        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mar&#xED;a, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for joining Telef&#xF3;nica's 2009 nine months results conference call. Today with me, I have Julio Linares, our Chief Operating Officer; Guillermo Ansaldo, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a; Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America; and Matthew Key, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe, who is connected from London. During the Q&amp;A session, you will have the opportunity to ask questions directly to any of them.</p>
          <p>We have released today a strong set of results on the back of our unmatched diversification and solid execution across businesses and geographies. Despite the challenge of the environment, business trends in the quarter are consistent with the performance of the first half of the year. Our focus to capture growth opportunities in our markets is reflected in the sharp increase in the Group commercial activity in the last three months, especially in the mobile space, with net adds excelling both in Spain and Latin America.</p>
          <p>Solid customer growth in every single region of operations and increased usage have led to positive organic revenue growth up to September, despite notable drags from regulation and business cycle. And we continue leveraging on cost management and significant synergies derived from our scale to further expand margins and deliver a strong cash flow generation. The solid operating and financial performances, combined with the balance sheet strength allowing us to reiterate our full commitment to enhance shareholder remuneration through growing dividends, as we communicated in our last Investor Day.</p>
          <p>As announced, our intention to propose a 2009 dividend of &#x20AC;1.15 per share is confirmed with the first tranche already being paid. We also reiterate our 2009 guidance and obviously all those targets communicated a month ago for the medium-term.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide number three to start with a detailed analysis of our nine-month results. Reported year-on-year growth rates have been negatively impacted by forex and impacts from capital gains recorded last year. Nevertheless, in organic terms, year-over-year growth rates remain healthy and show an acceleration from top line to operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>Organic sales in the first nine months of the year were flattish year-on-year to &#x20AC;41.7 billion, while OIBDA growth was close to 2%, leading to a healthy 39.9% OIBDA margin.</p>
          <p>Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America continues to be the main growth engine of the Group, already contributing 40% of Group revenues and OIBDA, respectively. Telef&#xF3;nica Europe also presented a robust performance with both regions partially offsetting the lower contribution of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a. As a proxy to cash flow generation, operating cash flow topped &#x20AC;12.3 billion through September, more than 10% on 2008 figure, purely organic.</p>
          <p>As in previous quarters, operating results are fully flowing into Group's net income, as you can see in slide number four. January through September net income exceeded &#x20AC;5.6 billion, showing a 6.4% underlying annual increase. Reported earnings per share reached &#x20AC;1.23 per share, posting a solid 9% underlying growth. Excluding the impact from purchase price allocations, EPS would have reached &#x20AC;1.33.</p>
          <p>On slide five, we show the remarkable customer growth recorded in the third quarter of the year. Group Accesses have already surpassed the 268 million mark. Net adds in the July through September period almost doubled the figure registered in the second quarter of the year, and we are close to the total figure recorded in the first half. This is due primarily to higher gross additions, as well as churn containment, despite renewed competitive pressure.</p>
          <p>Mobile Accesses continued to drive the growth in Total Accesses, pushing the quarterly net additions in line with the first half. I would like to stress the sharp increases posted by Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a and Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America. That we continue to actively manage, continue to diverse, ending September with more than 13 million Mobile Group and Accesses across regions, also posting an outstanding evolution in the quarter. Growth rates recorded by fixed broadband and Pay TV accesses are also to be highlighted.</p>
          <p>Turning to profitability on slide number six. And we are keeping a continuous effort on cost contention. Organic year-on-year operating expenditure change continues to trend down all the year, with a quarter-over-quarter improvement. The 1.3% annual drop in organic terms is mainly driven by lower commercial costs, as a result of the decrease in handset subsidies and advertising expenses, together with MTR cuts across regions.</p>
          <p>Obviously, economies of scale supports this good performance. As a result, cumulative OIBDA margins has consistently widened quarter-on-quarter to reach an almost 40% up through September, or 0.7 percentage points higher than a year ago, in organic terms. On the other hand, our company's flexibility to respond to changes in demand is reflected in the 16% year-on-year organic decline up through September, leveraging the high investment effort already made in past years.</p>
          <p>We continue to prioritize CapEx in growth platforms, as shown by the 56% year-on-year increase in 3G CapEx effects. A strict rein on OpEx and CapEx has led to an improvement in efficiency ratio for three consecutive quarters, from 75.3% in Q1 of '09 to 73.9% for the nine months ending September '09, and passing year-on-year decreases throughout the year in the range of one to two percentage points.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide seven, which shows the high conversion rate of top line growth into operating cash flow expansion, reflecting consistent trends with those of the first half of the year. Our efforts to manage OpEx and CapEx allowed us to post a robust cash flow generation profile in every single region of corporation, despite difficult trading conditions.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the GAAP return revenue and operating cash flow growth rates at Group level reached 10 percentage points. This positions Telef&#xF3;nica as an industry referenced by efficiency with a large cash flow over revenues margin. And this slide shows again the benefits of our diversification. The strong increase in operating cash flow, both at T. Latam and T. Europe, are combined with the very healthy contribution from Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a.</p>
          <p>Let me quickly review guidance execution. On the guidance criteria, consolidated year-on-year growth rate in revenues, OIBDA, and operating cash flow were 0.3, 1.9 and 10.3% respectively, all within the guidance ranges.</p>
          <p>CapEx up to September is still close to &#x20AC;4.6 billion. We maintain our target of CapEx below &#x20AC;7.5 billion for the year, with a big part of the budget expected to be executed towards the end of the year, as usual driven by CapEx seasonality.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the review of the results by region, let me start with Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a on slide number nine. In the third quarter, we have recorded a remarkable improvement in our commercial performance while we continue to post a strong cash flow generation. The effect of the increased commercial activities during the last two quarters on the top line is yet to come, but revenue declines slowed down quarter-on-quarter in both wireline and wireless businesses. This seems to confirm the trends of the second quarter, when we started to notice a positive seven derivative on comparable revenue year-on-year change, and might be an indication that we have already reached the bottom, although we still prefer to be cautious.</p>
          <p>OIBDA margins continue to be solid and a benchmark in Europe, despite a strong decline in high margin revenues, such as voice traffic and the ramp up in the commercial side in the third quarter, which is not cost free. Tight OpEx and CapEx control led to an improvement in the efficiency ratio. OpEx plus CapEx over revenues have come down 1.7 percentage points over the last 12 months, leaving operating cash flow for the nine months through September over &#x20AC;6 million, with limited decline of just about 3% on a comparable basis. This shows our ability to post a robust performance in a very difficult environment.</p>
          <p>Let me now share with you on the slide number 10, the enhanced performance of operating metrics in the third quarter. As Guillermo Ansaldo anticipated a month ago, during our Investor Day, in the third quarter we increased sharply our commercial activity across businesses for a second quarter in a row.</p>
          <p>Fixed broadband net adds for the quarter exceeded those recorded in the first half of the year, with a remarkable improvement in our share of net adds in the quarter. As a result, we have consolidated our leadership with a 56% market share at the end of September. The incorporation of new football content into our Pay TV offer is proving of great appeal for our customers, leading to a quarter-on-quarter increase of Pay TV net adds of close to 10 times in the third quarter, achieving record high net adds for the last 10 quarters.</p>
          <p>In wireless, we have again led the growth of the market in Q3, both on the total customer base and on the contract segment on the back of higher gross adds and churn contention, especially in postpaid. We gained customers from mobile number portability, and total net adds have more than doubled quarter-on-quarter with an even better performance in the contract segment.</p>
          <p>Fixed telephony losses have decreased 33% versus previous quarter to 209,000 lines, so well below the figures reported in the last two quarters. Please notice that 62% of Q3 '09 net line losses are compensated by a net increase in wholesale lines, which generate a revenue stream.</p>
          <p>Wireless data plan rates passed the 1.5 million link, which is 2.2 times higher than September of '08 figures, and our 3G customer base is the largest in the market, and almost 50% higher than a year ago. So very positive news. The market seems to be stabilizing and customers are reacting when provided with the right tele offer and we are being able to deliver it.</p>
          <p>Slide number 11 shows how usage is evolving in a rational pricing environment. Although usage did remains depressed, third quarter shows signs of stabilization, and even a little recovery from the second quarter, helped by seasonal effects. Mobile traffic is declining 3.8% in the quarter, 0.7 percentage points less than in the previous quarter, and both mobile outgoing voice and total option declines have improved by one percentage point purchase the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And I said a rational pricing environment, because that's what figures show. Outgoing wireless average revenue per minute decline continues to be in the 3 to 4% range, which is better than the expectations we gave at our Investor Day in London, from minus five to minus 7% more than two years ago, when we were not anticipating the crisis.</p>
          <p>Wireline retail broadband connectivity ARPU is down 6.8% in the third quarter, in line with the previous quarters, and again, in line with the performance expected two years ago, when we forecast 4 to 7% annual declines for this metric. Stimulating volume usage remains our challenge. There are some light signs of improvement in wireless; we keep working on triggering consumer elasticity for a return to positive trends.</p>
          <p>To finish with a review of the Spanish operations on the slide number 12, I will focus on revenue trends, which remain similar to the previous quarter. Wireline, IT, and Data Services keep posting sound growth rates in the quarter and in the nine months through September. Wireless data connectivity revenues continue to record outstanding growth rates at over 50% in the January through the September period. Although voice revenues related with decelerated usage are still down, the good news is that at a lower rates than in previous quarters. That's the case for both wireless outgoing revenues and wireline voice revenues. The same applies for wireless incoming revenue trend, that is roaming and interconnection, which are still impacted by lower usage and the significant drive from MTR cuts.</p>
          <p>On the downside, wireline access revenues kept declining, in line with the falling average lines of service. As quarterly line losses keep improving, average lines in service performance will ease, and so will related revenues in the coming future. We have not changed our core strategy and remain focused on revenue share. Despite price pressure and higher commercial activity in the quarter, we maintained our revenue share leadership in the wireline and wireless markets.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide number 13, OIBDA in Latin American properties. I would like stress the healthy revenue performance and the strong profitability posted in a region where we have recorded a very high commercial activity during the last three months. Up through September, our customer base in Latin America had grown 6.9% year-on-year to reach close to 164 million accesses, driven mainly by fixed broadband and mobile services. This robust advance and the increased usage across our networks have led to a close to 6% organic revenue growth, supported by double-digit growth in mobile and internet and TV, amidst intense competition.</p>
          <p>OIBDA performed even better, posting over 13% organic growth year-on-year, leveraging the full-scale economies, synergies, and tighter OpEx control, offsetting the drop-off in commercial activities during the third quarter of the year that allowed to multiply by 2.4 times net asset quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>This strong performance drove OIBDA margin 2.7 percentages point up, in organic terms, in the first nine months of the year, reaching 59.9%. CapEx over revenues remain below 12%, and close to three percentage points below last year figure. As a result, the inefficiency ratio stood at 77% at the end of September, improving year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter and boosting operating cash flow to &#x20AC;4.7 million, a sharp 31% year-on-year increase in organic terms.</p>
          <p>Let me now quickly sum up the evolution of our wireless businesses in the region, where we are recording consistent improvements in market share, profitability, and operating cash flow generation. Up to September, the year-on-year customer growth remained very robust at 9% to almost reach the 130 million mark, despite the high penetration in some of our markets.</p>
          <p>Net adds in Q3 were outstanding, with quarter-on-quarter improvements in most countries. We have added 3.3 million customers in the last three months or 1.2 times the net adds of the first half of the year on the back of a ramp up in gross adds and the positive churn -- both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. As a result, we have gained market share across several markets in our footprint.</p>
          <p>And what is even more important is that we are making good progress on one of the key levers for future growth, the improvement in customer mix, as also Maria explained recently during our investor day. In the first nine months of 2009, over 20% of our net adds were postpaid, and if we exclude Mexico from this calculation, as in this country we are also working to reinforce our postpaid offering, that ratio goes up to 25%.</p>
          <p>In parallel, our strategy to stimulate usage led to 10% increase in traffic, and ARPU performance in organic terms slightly improved versus the rate of decline of previous quarters, driven by the better outgoing ARPU. As a result, quarter-on-quarter ARPU remained stable. Annual evolution is explained by fast customer expansion, lower MTRs, and intense price competition in some countries like Brazil.</p>
          <p>Finally, as describes the mobile revenues, sound evolution, up close to 11% year-on-year in the January to September period, mainly driven by the sharp increase in service revenues on the back of a 37% organic year-on-year growth in data services. When we look to revenue deceleration in the third quarter, it is worth mentioning that this is mainly due to lower handset sales, because service revenue growth is just one percentage points lower in the first nine months than the one accumulated to June, and the data revenues have remained practically stable. Mobile broadband continue to gain traction and will be further exploited with a boost on our 3G networks and mobile broadband offerings.</p>
          <p>Let's move now on to slide number 15 to review our progress in transforming our wireline businesses in Latin America. We are advancing towards a different revenue mix generation by increasing the value proposition of the wireline accesses through bundles, limiting the pressure of mobile substitution into additional accesses. Obviously, Q3 performance has been negatively impacted by Anatel's decision to stop the sale of broadband accesses in Brazil from the end of June to the end of August.</p>
          <p>Fixed broadband accesses reached 6.3 million in September, a 7% year-on-year growth, fueled by the good performance recorded in Peru, Argentina, and Chile. They already account for over 25% of traditional lines, up 2.3 percentage points year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Pay TV accesses rose 16% year-on-year to 1.7 million. It is worth highlighting that after launching the Pay TV service in Argentina in the third quarter, all our wireline operations in the region have now triple-play service capabilities. More outstanding is the fact that already close to 55% of broadband accesses are bundled in a double or triple-play package, nine percentage points above September of last year. Total bundles represent 61% of fixed-line accesses, when including traffic packages and control usage.</p>
          <p>Our service holds new revenue sources, as Internet and Pay TV represent already 21% of total wireline revenues, 2.5 percentage points higher than last year's figure in organic terms.</p>
          <p>And then I outline the main topics across key countries. In Mexico, we have delivered a secured performance; the very strong uptake on the commercial front led us to increase quarter-on-quarter net adds by 36% and service revenue accelerated in the quarter growing ahead of customers. As a result, we gained a market share both in terms of revenues and customers to reach north of 20% in accesses. We have also increased profitability sharply with a close to 12 percentage points year-on-year margin expansion, and more than doubling operating cash flow in local currency, both in the first nine months of '09.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, we have widened the gap in the market and consolidated its leadership in accesses, revenue, and profitability. Customers grew 16% year-on-year and ARPU improved quarter-on-quarter, driven by the strong rise in on-net traffic and solid data revenue, which came along with enhanced OIBDA margin up three percentage points year-on-year to 31% in the first nine months of '09.</p>
          <p>In Argentina and Venezuela, we continued to post a very good performance. Revenues increased by double-digit rates and OIBDA margin further expanded in both markets in a remarkable size. In Peru, both the wireless and wireline businesses are posting robust results.</p>
          <p>Slide number 17 shows that we are starting to notice positive results from the initiatives launched to improve the performance of two operations that for different reasons have not been recording more -- have been recording more difficulties in recent quarters.</p>
          <p>In Telesp, the implementation of a quality plan to improve processes and service and to solve operating problems has allowed the company to post good broadband net adds both in September and October. Gross adds are still below the monthly levels recorded before Anatel's decision, as we are progressively resuming the Speedy sales across distribution channels. New commercial campaigns have been launched on 10 November and we are focused on capturing good quality adds. At the same time, the better quality and customer satisfaction is reflected in a promising churn improvement.</p>
          <p>In Colombia, our wireless business is also showing signs of improvement. Contract net additions have multiplied by five times quarter-on-quarter. Total gross adds are rising and churn has dropped 1.2 percentage points versus previous quarter. In addition, local currency ARPU was 6.2 percentage points higher in the third than in the second quarter. And all this while enhancing OIBDA margin by 1.6 percentage points in the first nine months of the year.</p>
          <p>In summary, despite the weak performance in some of our subsidiaries, Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America continues to record sound top line growth rates across most markets and further scale our integrated management model and additional efficiency gains continue to be afoot with OIBDA margin expansion across markets. This outlines one of the pillars of our strategy: diversification.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 18 to Telef&#xF3;nica Europe. Telef&#xF3;nica Europe continued to outperform in its key markets, thanks to its successful management of customer acquisition and retention, mainly in the contract segment, where we haven't seen major changes in customer behavior overall.</p>
          <p>Despite the economic downturn, we have continued to invest in the market in order to drive growth. Over the past 12 months, we have taken nearly 60% of all mobile net adds across our markets. Mobile net additions in the third quarter were close to 900,000 lines, a significant increase over the previous quarter, with 72% of these being contract customers. Smartphones and dongles continue to drive growth for the business with renewed propositions across markets, like the continued traction of the iPhone, which will be reinforced by the recently launch Palm Pre and other Smartphones.</p>
          <p>Revenue has sequentially improved to 3% year-on-year in the third quarter, ex-FX, and also excluding the impact from cuts in mobile residential rates in 2009, dragging three percentage points of growth in the third quarter alone. Net SMS data revenues also continue driving growth, with a 37% year-on-year increase ex-foreign exchange up through September 2009.</p>
          <p>The ongoing management of our cost structure is ahead of the curve. We are further progressing in the transformation of the Company, leading toward non-commercial costs. It's about giving customers what they want and saving for increased commercial activity overall, which is helping the business to increase OIBDA margin by 0.9 percentage points in the January through September period to reach close to 29%.</p>
          <p>CapEx has reduced year-on-year by close to 9% ex-FX, as 2G network rollout plan is nearly completed in Germany and the ending of major IT projects has taken place. Please note the 12% increase over the previous quarter, which is helping to sustain the future evolution of the business on increased commercial activity. As a result, operating cash flow continued to be strong, with Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany being, again, the major contributor to growth.</p>
          <p>In the UK, the business continued to clearly outperform the market on the back of inside-led propositions and ongoing low levels of contract churn, accelerating commercial activity around Simplicity and the iPhone, as well as other high-end devices. Telef&#xF3;nica O2 UK now manages 21 million mobile lines, growing at close to 6% year-on-year, from which 44.5% are contract customers, and no further deterioration of usage optimization is being seen overall.</p>
          <p>As a result, in adjusting for MTR reductions, mobile service revenue growth is ramping up to 6.1% in the third quarter in local currency, an encouraging behavior versus past quarters, which is also capitalized on non-SMS data revenue growth of 53% in local currency up through September.</p>
          <p>In terms of profitability, it is important to highlight that the ongoing efficiency program in the business is helping to sustain OIBDA margin at 35.6%, excluding restructuring costs of &#x20AC;28 million recorded in the third quarter as part of the transformation process. Thus, underlying OIBDA evolution in the third quarter of 3.1% year-on-year in local currency reflected increased commercial activity in the contract segment, offset by an improved contribution from the DSL business and further benefits from targeted customer retention activities leading to lower market churn.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow is growing 11% in local currency, in the January to September period, excluding the restructuring costs. <mark type="inaudible" /> OIBDA performance is complemented with the tight CapEx management, in order to sustain the already high quality levels of our networks and service platforms.</p>
          <p>To review the commercial and financial performance of Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany, please turn to slide number 20. The success of the customer oriented products led to contract net adds in the quarter of close to 216 million customers, or 1.5 times higher than in the previous quarter, driven by mobile broadband, the <mark type="inaudible" />, and the renewed activity in partner channels.</p>
          <p>The continued growth of the customer base, as well as the positive evolution of non-SMS data, underpinned mobile service revenue growth of 2.1% year-on-year in the third quarter, excluding MTRs, ramping up from the previous quarter. The Company continued advancing in terms of profitability, growing OIBDA by 25% year-on-year, up to September, and expanded OIBDA margin by 4.3 percentage points, driven by lower charges to third parties on national roaming finalizing by year-end.</p>
          <p>Our mobile network is now leading the pack in terms of quality, and improved profitability of the broadband business.</p>
          <p>And a new commercial approach from the fourth quarter of 2008, leading to a more efficient investment in customers, more focus in terms of product portfolio, and promoting direct channels, on the back of increased roll-out of shops. It is important also to highlight that you should not expect OIBDA to maintain the same year-on-year growth rate in the next quarter, as a new commercial approach, launched at the end of 2008, boosted OIBDA in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Before reviewing the financial profile of Telef&#xF3;nica, let me say a few words about the strategic rationale of the HanseNet acquisition on the slide number 21. The German market is characterized by growing trends from bundled products and future growth opportunities raised on addressing this trend. T. O2 Germany has the ambition to become a leading integrated player in the German teleco market and continue its growth story.</p>
          <p>Currently, Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany has a sound mobile business, but further growth potential in fixed net broadband. HanseNet enables a leap forward move in fixed net broadband, as well as acquisition of fixed net capabilities, the best fit for Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany's future aspirations.</p>
          <p>Next to synergies from the strengthened capabilities to sell bundled offers, know-how sharing in sales activities such as online and tele sales would represent an additional benefit. For the synergies, it would be possible through optimization of the operational model of both companies. They already close relationship that Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany and HanseNet have proves the ability to work successfully together.</p>
          <p>And turning to slide number 22, we can observe how we continue benefiting from our prudent financial policy. Our net financial debt stood at 1.9 times OIBDA at the end of the first nine months, or two times when adding cash commitments which is in the low part of the range I reiterated our last Investor Day in Madrid.</p>
          <p>A slight increase could happen in the last quarter, following the potential disbursement on M&amp;A deal's completion. We have further increased our average debt life even above seven years, even more to include our recent &#x20AC;1.75 billion 10-year bond issue. Our interest expense have stayed below &#x20AC;1.9 billion, which is equivalent to 5.6% effective interest rate, or &#x20AC;45.5 billion average total debt. FX losses, most of them due to US dollar needs in Venezuela, pushed total financial expenses just above 2 billion euros.</p>
          <p>To sum up, in the nine months of the year, we have posted a stronger news, retaining benchmark organic growth in the industry, and consistent trends with previous quarters. Commercial activity has recorded a sharp recovery in Q3, driven by mobile. And the high cash generation delivered shows our ability to enhance efficiency on the back of scale economies and disciplined operating CapEx management. We maintained a robust financial position and we have posted high single digit underlying growth in EPS. We are on track to meet 2009 guidance and we confirm our proposed &#x20AC;1.15 per share for 2009.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention, and now we are ready to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions. First with regards to Latin America, when we see a substantial improvement in margins in countries like Chile and Mexico and Colombia, my question was, is it something that you see as sustainable, is the kind OIBDA margins you expect in the future? And if that's case, why such a big improvement now? What is driving it?</p>
          <p>The second question has to do with Spain, mobile spend, clearly very strong KPIs, but we haven't seen the impact on service revenue trends. And I was wondering is it because some of the, for instance, contract net adds are very back-ended in the quarter? Or is it because prices of new contracts are much slower, or is it because you can see a deterioration of underlying usage? So really understanding why and if we can see a translation of that good KPIs at some point in the revenues? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of your first question concerning the margin improvement on the mobile side in Chile, Mexico, and Colombia namely, let's take into account that the handset sales has been significantly reduced year-on-year in the three countries, and that has been contributing to an improvement in margins. On top of that, there are some underlying trends that are improving in terms of just the scale of the operations and the fact that from a commercial standpoint, we have been able to stabilize the levels of churn and even to reduce them in some of the countries. So you have a mix of effects. First, there is a different mix in terms of revenues. We have less handset sales, and second you have improvement -- underlying significant improvements on the commercial side with significant churn reductions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the question about Spain, the mobile market, first, yes, we did have a very good quarter with particularly outstanding postpaid contract. How will this translate into revenues in the future? Well, it is a positive effect obviously, but given that we haven't seen yet a recovery in the traffic, with just some signs of stabilization, but not yet a turnaround, that overall traffic effect will drag still the revenues in the mobile business. Regarding the specifics, new customers that we are adding, they will provide new revenues. The amount of revenues depends on the promotion that we are -- we have been using to attract them. Churn also has been pretty stable, 0.42% only a decimal of decrease. So this is a very healthy increase in terms of stable churn and improved gross adds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you say that the gross adds were back-ended or front-ended or not particular patent there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, regarding the third quarter, again first, it's basically postpaid. Second, it's an increase in gross adds, given that churn is stable, and this is a healthy trend. What we are not seeing yet overall is a traffic improvement in the overall base. I'm not talking about the specific lines that we have, I'm talking to the overall base.</p>

          <p>Hi, I had a question on the fixed line business in Spain. You highlight on the slide 11 that the retail line telephone connectivity ARPU is down 6.8%. The total ARPU, just doing the average of the quarter, is down almost nine. Can you tell us what you expect the trend will be going forward, and when you think retail revenue in broadband will become positive again?</p>
          <p>And then a follow-up question on China Unicom. I wanted to clarify that the investment has already been completed. Although I know that deal was closed on October 21, I wanted to know whether the cash outflow for the shares of China Unicom received was already completed in the third quarter? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jesus. This is Guillermo regarding Spain. The broadband connectivity ARPUs have all been evolving in the range that we were expecting, that we commented in the Investment Conference between 5% to 7% per year. That's in terms of connectivity.</p>
          <p>In terms of other ARPU, and looking forward, we expect, first a change in the Imagenio ARPU, given that we are changing some of the Pay Per View revenues for base revenues in Imagenio so we are going to have more customers, but less Pay Per View revenues and more base revenues. So that would change the unit of ARPU in Imagenio but will provide more revenues over the old broadband. And regarding the rest of the value-added services, which have been very depressed, given the nature of not first-need type of services and given the crisis in Spain. We expect them to start to recover in the following year.</p>

          <p>In terms &#x2013; Jesus, this is Santiago, in terms of the China Unicom question. At the end of October, we completed the exchange of shares with China Unicom. So we gave them the 40.7 million shares that we had agreed. Part of those shares has been already bought at the end of September, but a few of those had been bought during the month of October. But as we speak, this exchange has already been completed and both them and ourselves have already in our books this year as that we have communicated.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just a couple of questions. First of all, I guess to Guillermo, the commercial activity much stronger in Spain. I'm just wondering, to what extent, I think, this was a question mentioned before, that commercial activity has come later in the quarter. And whether there have been any price changes, any changes in tariffs, perhaps a little more promotional into September after the summer period. I'm just wondering if we should sort of assume a lower, a little more ARPU pressure into Q4?</p>
          <p>And then, separately, and very differently to Matthew, please, just an update on how the Palm Pre has been selling, perhaps versus volumes that have historically been sold at the iPhone -- just your thoughts on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, David. Regarding Spain, and now we understand the question, on the bank of Paribas also, across the quarter, in mobile has been pretty stable. It has not been too weighted on September, it has been very good July, very good August due to the summer campaign and a very good September. So it's spread all around the quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding Pay TV, that's back-ended. Pay TV is very much focused almost exclusively on September. Even on the football league has started in Spain in September, and we have the new offering of football is starting in September, so it's basically almost 100% on September.</p>
          <p>Regarding fixed lines, the improvement you see, it is a net loss, not a net gain, but it is an improvement compared to the previous quarters. You have take into account, there is an improvement, but there is also some seasonality. In August, given vacations, we have less disconnections than in other months. So usually, we have an improvement in July and September, but August is providing more improvement. But this is more due to seasonality.</p>
          <p>Regarding broadband, it has been very spread around the three months. And that's due to a very good summer promotion that we have in August and in the first week of September. And then, we got positive seasonality on September with a back-to-school campaign. A lot of families are connecting or asking for broadband too, so the kids have broadband at home. So, it's a spread all across the segment, but Pay TV is much more loaded -- almost exclusively on September.</p>
          <p>Regarding the nature of the improvement. Well, in Pay TV, it's a content move. We decided to include football content on our base offering. So that's -- it's an improvement of value for the same price. Regarding mobile, it's an accumulation of different actions. Some of those were launched in the second quarter, like the semi-flat tariffs that we introduced in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And then particularly in the third quarter, we have a very good summer campaign, there the claim was basically a free cost during the weekend. It's a similar campaign -- not exactly -- but similar to the one we had in the previous year.</p>
          <p>And in broadband, we did have an August campaign. It is different from other years, with a very good entry price for new customers. And so that was much more on the promotional side. So it's a combination of actions: content on the Pay TV, promotions on broadband, and in the case of mobile, it's a combination of different actions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David, it's Matthew just to pick up your question. Let me first start by saying on the iPhone in the UK, Orange and Vodafone announced three or four weeks ago, we've seen almost no change in our volumes in terms of the run rate. So very little impact to-date, recognizing Orange only started selling yesterday, but certainly we've seen no change of customer behavior and customers coming to us, which I think is promising for us.</p>
          <p>On the Palm Pre, very happy with the volumes we're doing. Are they at the level of the iPhone? No, they're not, and they probably won't be, but really happy with the volume and particularly the customer reaction. So we're getting very, very low return rates and very few calls in to customer care, which means customers are buying the product and really liking it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Matthew, can you just elaborate, is it the same incentive to the dealers to sell the phones, or is that anything you can tell us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I obviously wouldn't want to get into individual commercial relationships we've got with the channels, but in terms of structure, absolutely, we structure it the same in any of our devices, which we make sure our objectives are aligned.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. A couple of questions, please. First of all, just on EBITDA. Clearly from a sequential perspective, the revenue declines in Spanish fixed and mobile have improved somewhat on an underlying basis, but there still seems to be some acceleration in the EBITDA decline. So can you just talk about the margin pressure and what the drivers are there and potentially how that could evolve?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I just had a question really on Germany. I mean, at the Investor Day, Matthew said that there was no denying the logic of potentially merging number three and number four, but obviously not to go in and write that you were going to buy E-Plus. I'd just like to extend that question more broadly to KPN. I mean, if KPN was available at the right price, is that something you would consider, or are you maintaining your view that you've got the right scale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding OIBDA margins in Spain, we have, as we explained, a very intensive commercial activities during the quarter. And that has a direct impact on the EBITDA in the quarter. So the deterioration that this marked deterioration that we have in the margin is very a healthy margin, but it's still a deterioration, in the quarter that is mainly explained by the increasing commercial expenditures.</p>
          <p>There are other items along the same line, also an increase in equipment purchases, particularly in Pay TV since we are connecting more customers, we are rebuilding stock in set-top boxes, for example, same happens broadband and routers. Also we have a very good, as you can see, revenues increased in IT. IT revenues are increasing, but these are typically business lines, with smaller margins than we have in traditional telco. So this impact on the revenue mix has also impacted the quarter. But the main driver there is commercial expenditure and other expenditure linked to revenue increase and connection increase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the question on Germany, and probably -- perhaps Matthew would like to continue with something later on. Mandeep, our slide on Germany is quite clear, we wanted to strengthen our mobile position, and we wanted to go for an integrated product, and that's where the HanseNet acquisition comes from. We have defended that we wanted to drive a value for money proposition, that is escaping from the low end of the high discount side of the market, and build an integrated proposition. We think that we are now closer to achieving that aim than we were before. And certainly the skill of the group helps us in doing so. We have no other plans in store for the time being.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Just a couple of questions on the '09 outlook, it seems in Q3, at the Group level, organic revenue trends actually turned negative. Guidance is obviously still for growth for the year as a whole. Should we expect that the good net adds in Q3 generally to lead to a rebound in growth as we look at Q4?</p>
          <p>And then just on the Group CapEx numbers, we haven't seen much of a sequential pick-up in Q3. To get toward 7.5 billion for the full year would suggest a near doubling, sequentially. Is that realistic, or should we be looking at a number somewhat below the 7.5 for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Julio Linares. Regarding the CapEx issue that you mentioned, you have to take into account that always in CapEx there is a seasonality effect. On the third quarter, it's worth note, very heavy in terms of the invested amount. The predictions that we have for the fourth quarter take into account that the number that we already show in our investment is that we are going to meet our commitment for the full year as we announced early this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of guidance fulfillment, we feel confident that by the end of the year, we'll again meet those numbers. Please keep in mind that in terms of revenues, especially in Spain, that we still have to take in this year the universal service obligation, which is still unknown, but unlikely to go below the last year's number. And that we have some properties in Europe, which are likely to perform significantly better in Q4 of this year than last year, notably Germany. And we also expect higher revenue growth in the Czech Republic, as the year-on-year growth rates were -- last year impacted by negative universal service obligations. So we know, we do confirm that the revenue numbers will be met, and I've tried to give you some color as to why that is not so far-fetched.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon, gentlemen. Couple of questions. The first one in Spain, when we go to slide number nine and you're telling about the revenue decline in Spain, we can see very, very slight improvement in your third quarter versus second quarter. So I don't know if you could give us with a data of October and November, you can reaffirm that, you can reaffirm now that the revenue decline 20s is being confirmed in this fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And the second one is concerning Latin America, looking at the region as a whole, if I look at the subscriber growth at the end of 2008, you're running like 18% on the mobile side. Now you're running like 6%, so if we look forward to 2010, I wonder that probably this macro environment, which is performing better on the region, so that can help you. On the other side, the penetration rate is approaching the 100%. So, I wonder if, in terms of subscriber growth in the region, you think you can sustain current levels, you think that decline is going forward in 2010, what is going to be the picture there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Iv&#xF3;n. Regarding -- this is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding the revenues in Spain, the outlook for the quarter, we don't see major changes in the underlying revenue trends taking away the one-offs. Regarding one-offs, as Santiago Fern&#xE1;ndez Valbuena I mentioned a moment ago, we expect to account for the universal service obligation of 2007 and maybe 2008, so there will be a one-off non-comparable. But taking away the non-comparable items, we expect a remittance similar to the -- excluding one-offs we have in the third quarter, maybe slightly better, but this is the usual total. I do have figures for October, but I don't have yet revenues number for November. These are estimates, obviously, for November and for December. But similar trends when you take away the one-offs, and in one-offs you do have to take into account the universal service obligation will be coming &#x2013; will might be accounted for in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question on the subscriber growth, what we have experienced in the third quarter is, I would say, a significant improvement in terms of net adds, and those came both from gross adds and from lower levels of churn. I do think that there has been an improvement in terms of commercial activity in the region. I will say all around the region. And also taking into account the fact that I would say that all of the places we have been subsidizing less the handset. And therefore, we have been having probably a slower growth compared with the previous year. If you take into consideration the fact that the last year we were also subsidizing heavily handsets, and we are not doing that for the time being. And on top of that, we see the minutes of usage globally in the region in our case. ARPU, that has been stabilizing and churn, that has been improving. So, what we can say so far is that the third quarter has been better than the second one, in terms of commercial activity, but still too soon to say that can be extrapolated for the next future.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions, please. The first one is a follow-on on the previous question on Latin America. I was wondering whether you could give us an idea of whether you expect the margin improvement you have consistently been delivering over the last four quarters to be sustained, even when the comparisons get tougher as the commercial activities last year are already on a lower base?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on financial expenses. Is it possible to give us an idea of the impact of your net cash position in Venezuela on financial income? So whether you can give us comparable numbers for this year and last year? And whether it's also possible to give us the net income generated out of Venezuela during these two periods?

          <p>Well taking your question on the margins in Latin America, you have two parts of that. First one is on the wireline side is picking up significantly with stabilized margin on the wireline side. And in fact, we have been able so far to slightly do so in three out of the five operations, namely Chile, Peru, and Argentina, where we are having some progress in stabilizing margins in Telesp and in Colombia on the wireline side. On the wireline side, overall we have been significantly reducing the rate of the deterioration all along this year, but we took on the issues of like Telesp and Colombia.</p>
          <p>And on the wireless side, we have been basically improving all around the picture. Part of that is due to the fact that we are being less aggressive in handset subsidy, but I will say that the most important one is due to the fact that <mark type="inaudible" /> campaign that the commercial activity has been much sounder, in terms of the right subsidies and the right promotions. So, I would think that significant part of that margin trend on the wireless side is here to stay.</p>
          <p>On the wireline side, it's also worth to mention that in spite of the fact that the handset sales have been reduced, service revenue keeps growing nicely year-on-year. So it looks like on that side in terms of revenue, is also contributing to expand margins.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the contribution of Venezuela cash to financial income, what I can tell you is that it has been coming down as a consequence of the over-supply of funds in the Venezuelan market. And this year, it is very likely that we should end with an average financial income over invested funds close to 7%, which is a very small number relative to the high inflation prevailing in the country, and in range that we had been enjoying over the past couple of years.</p>
          <p>This also naturally raises the average cost of debt in Latin America, when you do the netting, because that 7% or thereabouts is below the average cost of debt in the region, which is closer to 12%, as we disclosed in our last Investor Day. So there is a drag of Venezuelan cash on the total. And certainly as the business is doing well, the overall amount of cash that sits in Venezuela is likely to continue to being a drag on the overall financial expenditure. But it is one which is well contained.</p>

          <p>Thank you for taking my question. To Mr. &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Telef&#xF3;nica's high proportion of contract net adds in the region, especially in Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru. It was quite similar to what you saw from your main rival in each of those markets, as they reported their Q3, and have identified as their strategic focus also on postpaid. Do you expect competition with America mobile in the postpaid segment will occur more at the edge or at the core of your network? And if it's at the edge, should Telef&#xF3;nica investors like me be concerned about some near-term diminution in efficiency ratios as handset subsidies and/or retention costs rise on the per subscriber basis? It just seems perhaps inconsistent to think about handset subsidies continuing to come down when both of the major competitors in the market are increasing their volume of postpaid handsets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks for the question. It is true that we have been improved for slightly our position in contract in some of the countries, but still, we have significant room to grow, mainly -- for example, in Mexico or in Colombia where we are lagging behind our main competitors. The fact is that, in terms of handset subsidies, we feel that because of currency volatility, the market in general has become more prudent in terms of subsidizing, and therefore, as far as this volatility would still be in place, I think, that we will all be more, I would say, rational on handset subsidies.</p>
          <p>And therefore competition is much more based on quality of the network and product, in terms of our quality of service. And on that side, we feel very comfortable, both in -- I would say, in all the markets as you have been mentioning, but namely, increasingly in Colombia and for sure in Mexico.</p>
          <p>And in fact, in Mexico we are driving a campaign to migrate customers from prepaid -- our own customers from prepaid to a contract. We are starting to get results; still far from the traction that we would like to have. But we are in the neighborhood of 20 to 25,000 per month, which is much more than we were used to have. So I do not see, as of today, a major shift or a major change in commercial strategy in that front. But it may happen -- it may happen. So too soon to say, but for the time being, and as far as October and the first week of November is concerned, trends have been similar.</p>

          <p>Hi. At the Investor Day, you talked about data. Could you comment on what sort of positive impact you're seeing in data in Latin America? What sort of percentage of revenue it is, what the growth rates are like?</p>
          <p>And secondly, could you just sort of provide -- I guess, a bit of color on the Pay TV strategy, both in Latin America, and then also for Imagenio? If I understand you correctly, are you -- should we start to expect sort of multi-million numbers of Imagenio customers over the next sort of two years; is that the way to think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, taking your question on data in the region and really more specifically on wireless Internet, the third quarter has been pretty good in terms of customer adds. It has been -- it has proven to be even stronger than the second quarter, even taking into consideration that we didn't have the models campaign. So on that side, we have positive news in terms of the trends that we were anticipating at the Investors Day.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, in terms of our data revenues out of our total ARPU, the growth keeps being steady. It has been growing all around the year compared with previous year. And in fact, the growth that we are having in 2009 is bigger than the one that we were having in 2008. So both trends in terms of share of adds and in terms of ARPU expansion in data are proven to be there.</p>
          <p>So, yes, we think that this market is starting to accelerate. We will need to monitor that in terms of -- on a quarterly basis, because this is highly dependent on the commercial campaigns. Is a very certain market. And therefore we are basically building it in each of the countries as a sector. So, yes, the trends are there, but -- and trends are growing. And our third quarter has been stronger than the second one. So I guess that we are on the right direction.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Pay TV in Latin America, we will -- we have been -- we are not satisfied with the level of customer adds that we have been having. It is true that we have been facing significant difficulties in two out of the markets of the wireline markets, namely in Colombia and in Telesp for different reasons.</p>
          <p>In Telesp, because, as you know, we bundled, and as we have not been allowed to sell ADSL during two months, we have not been selling TV by itself. And in Colombia because we are reconsidering our commercial offer once the cable operators are starting to be consolidated and be much more aggressive. So I guess that on the Pay TV side in Latin America, we are not satisfied with the evolution. We will need to think about it and reposition our commercial offer. So we need to be &#x2013; my view is that we need to be more aggressive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Guillermo Ansaldo, regarding Imagenio in Spain -- Pay TV in Spain. As we shared in the Investor Conference, we expect to double our customer base from December 2008 to December '12. So roughly moving from 0.6 million, 600,000 clients, to 1.2 roughly in 2012. So it's not a multi-million. I would love to have a multi-million, but it's double the base.</p>
          <p>What are we going to do? We're trying to do, first to improve our content offer, both in standard definition and in high definition, as we have done with our Gol TV channel addition, both in standard definition and also in high definition. And we will continue taking advantage of the IPTV, the interactive functionality. We will continue developing a three-layer offering, the standard offering, which we call Imagenio <mark type="inaudible" /> offering our fiber with high definition and more value-added services. And also, we are developing an entry-level strategy with over the top. But basically, we are going to double our customer base -- from again, from the end of 2008 to 2012.</p>

          <p>Great. So the question is, in Spain. Are you targeting a net OpEx reduction next year? Just I guess, setting in context your increased commercial activity this quarter, is this something we can expect to continue?

          <p>This is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding efficiency in Spain, we are, as you know, roughly with the efficiency ratio, which is the complement of raising cash flow over revenue ratio around 60% and have improved it one percentage point compared to same period last year. And we are the benchmark in Europe in terms of efficiency and next year, we will continue working to be the &#x2013; an even stronger benchmark in efficiency. And that will be part obviously the focus and also the other side, as I explained in the Investor Conference, to strengthen our leadership in the market size, and also to capture the full &#x2013; all the opportunities that the market recovery will come. But regarding efficiency, where our goal is to still remain as the benchmark in Europe in terms of operating cash flow efficiency.</p>

          <p>Hi Tim, I don't know whether you picked up something from one of our competitors, but as far as the market is concerned, we haven't seen any change in competitive intensity that it is worthy of note. I think two things I would say, particularly the O2o for us was a groundbreaking proposition. We haven't seen any reaction really from the other competitors yet to O2o.</p>
          <p>And secondly, the data market is clearly an area of huge expansion for us in Germany. As far as growth is concerned, it's looking a bit like a three-player market. So we're more than happy with that, as far as the performance of our network and the performance of our mobile data share, which is looking at about 30% at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Can I ask two questions on Mexico, please? First of all, can we assume that you're interested in acquiring more spectrum next year, as spectrum becomes available? Secondly, when I look at the net add performance relative to AMEX, your performance is obviously rather stronger, but it's considerably stronger in prepaid. And I wonder if you've relaxed your postpaid strategy for Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the questions, Terence. The answer to the first one is for sure, yes, we will very much like to have more spectrum, because we are eager to do more things, especially namely on wireless Internet in Mexico Capital City, and for that we need more spectrum. But no clear path in terms of the timetable. The agenda has been fixed, and it's in the hands of the regulator to set the timing, and it is not yet clear what that timing is going to be. But we think that timing is approaching, I mean, we are closer. But no clear -- not a clear picture of when that's going happen.</p>
          <p>And in terms of net adds, it is true we have been having a pretty good third quarter, namely or basically in prepaid, where our distribution network, the capability that we have been able to put in place, and also the incentives that we have been putting to our sale channels in terms of costing or motivating the quality of net adds is paying off, both in terms of the total amount of gross adds and in terms of churn reduction. We have had a historically low churn level in the third quarter in Mexico.</p>
          <p>So very happy on the prepaid side, on the contract side, we keep doing efforts. As I was saying before, we have been able to migrate in September and mostly in October between 20 to 25,000 customers from our prepaid base to contract. We're still fighting to find the right proposition on the market. So not satisfied with the outcome, but I would say in better shape than a quarter ago, especially on the migration side, but still a long way to go to be successful on the contract side in Mexico.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a couple of questions please, gentlemen. First one is on Spanish Mobile, and on the sort of the contract net adds in the quarter. Where have those come from? Is it upgrades from prepaid, is it taking customers from other operators, it seems a little bit odd, it's so high despite your promotional campaigns?</p>
          <p>The second one is for Matthew on data in Germany. If we look at the data ARPU, it actually fell, went from 2.4% down to 4.7% down in Q3. How are we going to see that coming through with the new product being sold in the marketplace? Are we going to see the data ARPU pick up at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding -- this is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding the postpaid net gain in Spain, it's a combination of factors. We continue as before, migrating prepaid customer to postpaid, not at a great rate, but we continue adding, we've roughly around 62% of total base which are postpaid. In terms of portability, we have a positive number in the quarter, plus 2000, that's a change in trend compared to previous quarters. So that is not a significant number, but helps a lot, particularly before we were on the negative side and now we are on the -- a small positive side.</p>
          <p>Then also, we have the push of mobile broadband and big screen, which is adding also customers with high value. And also, churn has been very stable, best in class. So we are increasing gross adds while defending very well our churn. So to give you some flavor regarding churn in postpaid, we were 1.4 % churn, 1.4 in the first quarter, 1.3 in the second, 1.2 in the third. So we have continuously improved our churn across the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Brian, two things I would point to. The data ARPU going down is actually driven by SMS rather than Internet. If you look at our non-SMS data, it's actually going up about 33% over the nine-months. Obviously it's on a smaller base than the SMS base. What's was really happening in the SMS ARPU is prices are going down through competition. What we have yet to see, which we did see in the UK market, is the elasticity of usages as SMS prices go down. So clearly what we're hoping is one of the things that SMS usage actually responds in the future to the price movement. But, as we go forward, clearly non-SMS data will start to pick up a higher proportion of the overall data revenue.</p>

          <p>And second question is regarding the trends in OIBDA and operating free cash flows in Q3. They are a little bit down compared to H1. Partly is explained by your stronger commercial activity. So I was wondering whether you consider to decrease with your commercial activity in Q4, and see an increase in the trends in OIBDA and operating free cash flow?

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will take the first question on Telesp in Colombia. The answer is different in both cases. Well, you know that in Telesp, we have been experiencing significant difficulties during this year because of some -- I would say non-recurring issues, but also some structural ones. The main drivers of the revenue slowdown in Telesp in the third quarter is acceleration in traditional line loss. We have been losing year-on-year 4.5% lines where we were losing 3.6 as of June.</p>
          <p>We have -- we are facing a significant MoU drop, traffic is doing -- S&amp;P is falling the 7.1%, due to fixed-to-mobile substitution. Price, you know that -- price really is applied once per year in wireline in Brazil, normally in July. This year it has been much more in September and a much lower amount than in the previous year. And also, the new businesses growth in daytime TV and the system-wide traffic that are growing less than in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>As you will see, there are some factors that are -- I would say more structural, and some others that are much more linked to an <mark type="inaudible" /> of buying the sale of Speedy <mark type="inaudible" /> in two months. And that have been impacting also OIBDA, which has a significant impact. We think that the part that is linked to the Anatel decision is under solution. We have been able to renew, to retake our efforts on the ADSL side basically at the end of August, beginning of September.</p>
          <p>We have been very prudent in order to retake that commercial activity, while at the same time ensuring quality standards in order not to face again the same difficulties. And that's also impacting OIBDA, because our commercial efforts have been much more intense. And we are starting to get some results. In terms of ADSL net adds, we are getting closer to the figure that we were having before the ban. Churn on the broadband side has been reduced to 2.5%, which is in similar levels as before the Anatel decision. But the MoU trends keeps under pressure. So in terms of traffic, we have not yet seen a reverse on the trend.</p>
          <p>And it is true that we are also seeing some quality indicators. So in Telesp, we are starting to get results. But one of the -- some of the increasing factors, such as traffic, are still there during the month of October. So still too soon to say that the situation is going to be reversed totally. The one that is related to Anatel is under solution, the other one is still to be redressed.</p>
          <p>And in Colombia, the situation is different. We are facing a total change in the sector in terms of new competitors entering, like Telemig on the cable side, consolidating the cable operators. And the mobile prices in terms of ARPM being already lower than the wireline prices in Colombia.</p>
          <p>If you take -- if you add on top of that the fact that from a geographical standpoint in Colombia, we are incumbent in small and medium-sized cities, and a new entrant in large cities. We have been forced to totally reshape, and reorient our commercial efforts and also the organization of the Company. We have appointed a new CEO, who is coming from our Peruvian unit. And we are starting to set the pillars of the new strategy, in terms of being much more geographically oriented and also repositioning our offers, both in terms of traditional voice and in terms of bundles of voice plus broadband plus TV. So I think that in Colombia, it's going to take longer than in Telesp.</p>
          <p>In terms of the commercial activity taking the part of Latin America, well, as I was saying before, we have been less intense in terms of handset subsidies, but we have been more aggressive in terms of promotions and in terms of incentivating the sales channel, we think that with the right incentives. And in spite of that, we have been able to improve our margins and efficiency. So I think that considering that the third quarter has been a highly intense commercial quarter, I think that in terms of the margin side, the duration is consistent and coherent. We will keep you posted, but for the time being, we feel comfortable.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding commercial activity and margin evolution in Spain. We are not going to decrease commercial activity in the fourth quarter, provided that fourth quarter we have strong seasonality, in terms of Christmas campaign, particularly in the mobile business. Traditionally, if you track our quarterly margins in the past three years, for example, you will see that in the fourth quarter is a minor decrease in margin because of the higher commercial activity, particularly in mobile, where we have a lot of handsets and equipment that have been subsidized in order to foster the campaign.</p>
          <p>So like-for-like, and taking away the one-offs, and again, we're expecting the universal service coming in the fourth quarter, but taking away the one-offs, we expect a similar decrease or evolution as we have in previous years, meaning that the decreases that we are -- the moderate decrease that we are seeing this year so far in the -- what we showed in the third quarter will be similar in the fourth quarter, but with a lower base, because traditionally the fourth quarter has a rather smaller margin because of high commercial activity. And, again, let me stress that we are not going to slow down on commercial activity.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One second, please. Is it better now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Much better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First one, on Vivo, was literally the difference in service growth rates between Vivo and Claro. And if you could explain where that is coming from -- is it -- that is something you have to address in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of service revenue compared also with Claro, we have launched a commercial campaign in the last quarter that accounts for a significant amount of promotion in terms of minutes. The way we account for those minutes that we first account for the free minutes, and only when the customer recharges, then we account for additional revenues. So I guess that the promotion, the way that we are accounting for those promotions is also affecting the evolution.</p>
          <p>In terms of OIBDA, we are having a better comparison. And I think that those trends are going to be much more similar when our promotions are going to be stabilizing, in terms of the way we account for them in terms of the free minutes, because if you see the trends in the minutes of use, we are having positive growth in minutes of use in the last quarter, while our competitor is having a significant decrease. And in terms of our ARPU, the evolution is quite similar. So I think that they will be converging at some point, once the continuation is normalized.</p>
          <p>And in terms of our Telesp broadband activity, the focus right now and the priority right now is to ensure that we have a -- that we grow, and that we grow soundly, in terms of quality. We cannot afford to have the same issues that we have been facing before. And on that side, we have been much more demanding in our selecting the quality metrics that we are applying all along the processes end-to-end, from the commercial to the network side of that, which that means implicitly is that, we are being much more selective in the entry filters, in terms of that we are talking to the customer to see in fact that he is able to have where he is living, before he's installed the product.</p>
          <p>We only account for revenues when the product is installed in good and correct functioning. Till now we were installing -- we were accounting for revenues immediately after the selling process. And in fact, the churn that we are having in net adds, of the new net adds after the retaking of the activities much lower and is significantly lower than before.</p>
          <p>So the first priority right now is to ensure quality, to make sure that we have the right level of quality and the right level of customer satisfaction, and to retake growth on that side. And that's why you have seen that we have been having a margin deterioration in Telesp in the quarter in order to ensure that the quality was at the end of the quarter for everything that it was doing, and that the growth will come in a stable and sound manner.</p>

          <p>Our final question comes from Will Milner from Arete. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Two questions, firstly on Spanish wireline. Could you just talk about what's actually driving the acceleration in growth? I mean data services revenues, which I think was 13% in the quarter. How much of it's one-off and how much of it potentially is being generated outside of Spain?</p>
          <p>And the second question on Latin America, for Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a, could you talk a bit more about the open Telef&#xF3;nica initiatives, since these are becoming quite material? I think &#x20AC;137 million of EBITDA, most of it in the third quarter. So it looks like it could be annualized &#x20AC;400 million of EBITDA, just for instance here, sort of what that is and who your partners are there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding data in wireline, but all the services are in Spain. There are no international data revenues in our P&amp;L in wireline. There is more fracture in wireless, but not in wireline. There are two types of categories in data services. One is what we call virtual private networks, and they basically are solutions that we provide to large corporates with a lot of branches, typically banks, public administration, and so on, and then also we have wholesale. The chapter that is providing more volatility to our numbers is wholesale. Wholesale, for example, are the services that we sell to the mobile operators and that have some volatility depending on the number of new circuits that we are getting. And these are typically driven by an increase in mobile broadband, and we have more sales of data services not only to competitor, but also to our own mobile operation. This number is obviously in the consolidation disappears.</p>
          <p>Data services on virtual prepaid networks, which are the retail and data services, are very healthy. They are growing one digit, but upper one digit. And this is basically based on our success at offering networks based on ADSL and also on fiber. And as we explained in the previous Investor Conference, we have roughly 40,000 connections, meaning premises or branches or sites that are connected with fiber in virtual private networks type of solutions. So that's growing healthily. It has a lot to do with IT solutions that we are providing on top of connectivity. And, but again, going to the beginning, there is some volatility and an increase in the first quarter that is due to the wholesale side.</p>

          <p>Well, taking your question on what we have called at Telef&#xF3;nica, we have realized like a year ago that the size and the scale of the road was pretty relevant in terms of generating or being able to generate a significant value-add or significant advantage at the time when we need to develop adjacent and new businesses. What I'm trying to say by that is that we have launched an initiative where we have been regionalizing and, in some part of the Group, making global initiative at a time that we are ready to launch new products and services. And we look and we ask for partners in order to develop and to accelerate those business <mark type="inaudible" /> adjacent business.</p>
          <p>In fact, we have been closing agreements in the last years, and maybe the figure that you have seen in the report account for the nine months of this year, not just the last quarter. Namely with, for example, CTE, LG, Microsoft <mark type="inaudible" /> and others to launch a wide range of products and services, such as location-based services, security, mailing integrating platforms, mobile operating systems, software development platforms, a full range of products that allow us to take advantage of the scale and the addressable market that we can provide to potential partners. And at the same time, to foster and to develop our ARPU, our revenues, and our businesses.</p>
          <p>They are getting more and more important in that they have become, I would say, recurring year-on-year in terms of new products. Before this year, those initiatives were launched and generated and managed at the local level. But now, we have been upscaling or upgrading them at the regional level in order to generate more value and to integrate more scale. Again, also some of those products are helping us to improve some key operational metrics such as, for example, recharges, logistics, or roaming.</p>
          <p>We use -- they have taken such a scale that we think -- we have thought that it was good to have a specific chapter on that and to report them, and to keep you posted on the evolution, because it's a proof that the scale of the group is paying off, and is helping us to accelerate new adjacent businesses.</p>
