          <p>Welcome to the SAP First Quarter Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Today's call will be hosted by L&#xE9;o Apotheker, Werner Brandt and Bill McDermott. I will now turn the call over to Stefan Gruber. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning or good afternoon. This is Stefan Gruber. Thank you for joining us to discuss SAP's first quarter 2009 results. I am joined by L&#xE9;o Apotheker, Werner Brandt and Bill McDermott.</p>
          <p>Werner will discuss the Q1 financials in detail and Bill will comment on the current business environment, regional performance, product successes and our strategies. Following Werner and Bill's comments we have time for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>I will now make a usual few remarks about forward-looking statements. Any statements made during this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</p>
          <p>Words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, may, plan, project, predict, should, outlook and will and similar expressions as they relate to SAP are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. SAP undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. The factors that could affect SAP's future financial results are discussed more fully in SAP's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including SAP's Annual Report on Form 20-F for 2008 filed with the SEC on March 26, 2009. Participants on this call are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their date.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Werner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stefan. Before I begin, let me inform you that I will be speaking mostly about non-GAAP figures as they are more in line with how we are internally looking at our operational performance.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP measures are the basis of our guidance. The differences between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP figures are the result of two effects. First, the exclusion of the write-down of deferred support revenues in the amount of &#x20AC;11 million compared to &#x20AC;47 million in the first quarter of 2008. And second, the exclusion of acquisition-related charges in the amount of &#x20AC;66 million compared to &#x20AC;83 million in the first quarter of 2008. More details on our non-GAAP measures, the reason for their use and reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures are provided in our press release.</p>
          <p>Please carefully note that our non-GAAP measures are not adjusted for the impact of the 160 million restructuring charge we incurred in Q1 resulting from the previously announced reduction of the workforce. Therefore, both our U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by these restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>As you may recall, at our Q4 results conference in January I spoke about the future IFRS reporting which I want to reiterate today. During 2009, SAP will continue to report its financials according to both IFRS and U.S. GAAP. All quarterly earnings, press releases and quarterly reports will provide both U.S. GAAP and IFRS financial information.</p>
          <p>Capital market communication like our business outlook will be based on non-GAAP numbers derived from the U.S. GAAP numbers. The press release for Q4 2009 will be the last document providing U.S. GAAP financials. SAP's annual report as well as the annual report on Form 20-F for fiscal year 2009, will only provide IFRS financials. And beginning in 2010, SAP will change its reporting standards to IFRS only. Therefore, beginning in 2010, all financial information and capital market communication including business outlook will be based on IFRS and non-IFRS figures.</p>
          <p>With that, let me say that we are very pleased to report very strong operating margins despite a very challenging business environment.</p>
          <p>Let me give you the highlights of the first quarter. Non-GAAP software and software-related service revenue for the first quarter of 2009 were &#x20AC;1.75 billion, which represented a year-over-year decrease of 4% at constant currencies. This decrease was the result of a decline of 34% in software revenues at constant currencies, a strong increase of 12% in non-GAAP support revenues at constant currencies and an increase of 21% in subscription as a software related service revenues, also at constant currencies. In the first quarter of 2009, our recurring revenue stream accounted for 55% of our total revenue.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, our support revenues were positively impacted by our successful rollout of Enterprise Support. However, due to the difficult operating environment, we also had a negative impact of 87 million from increased sales allowances, primarily resulting from potential collectibility issues with individual customers, mainly North America, for which we recognize revenues when cash is received.</p>
          <p>First quarter professional services and other service revenues were &#x20AC;648 million which was a decrease of 11% at constant currencies. Consulting revenues of &#x20AC;553 million decreased 8% at constant currencies, and training revenues decreased 31% at constant currencies. The decline in training revenues was a result of a decrease in classroom training, which can also be expected in the current environment since many customers place travel restrictions on employees.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased by &#x20AC;90 million to &#x20AC;2 billion or minus 1% year-over-year. This number includes restructuring charges of 160 million related to our previously announced reduction in workforce. The number of positions reduced associated with the 160 million charge was approximately 2,200. Roughly 50% of these employees have already left the Company as of March 31. The rest will leave in the following month according to the labor laws in their respective countries.</p>
          <p>As already stated in January, we expect a total amount of 200 to 300 million of restructuring charges for the full year 2009 related to the workforce reduction. Also, keep in mind that we expect the reduction in workforce to lead to a decrease of 300 to 350 million in personnel expenses in 2010 when compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses decreased 10% to &#x20AC;364 million for the first quarter and represented 15.1% of total revenues compared to 16.1% of total revenues for the first quarter of last year. The decrease in R&amp;D expenses was a result of our continued focus on maintaining tight cost controls.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses decreased 14% to &#x20AC;495 million for the first quarter and represented 20.5% of total revenues, a decrease of 2.5 percentage points compared to last year's first quarter. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was mainly the result of lower personnel expenses due to head count reduction in this area.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses decreased 14% to &#x20AC;131 million for the first quarter and represented 5.4% of total revenues compared to 6.1% of total revenues for the first quarter of last year. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was the result of effective cost saving measures mostly in the area of non-customer related third-party expenses and head count reduction.</p>
          <p>Overall, the Company's non-GAAP operating margin at constant currencies was 17.2% for the first quarter which represents a decrease of 2.3 percentage points compared to the 19.5% in the first quarter of 2008. However, the first quarter of this year, non-operating margin was negatively impacted by 6.6 percentage points due to the restructuring charges from the workforce reduction.</p>
          <p>Let me now give you the details on the gross margins. The non-GAAP software and software-related service margin was 80.9% for the first quarter of 2009, which was a decrease of 1.2 percentage points compared to the first quarter of last year. The lower margin was the result of the decline in software and software-related service revenues due to the difficult economic environment.</p>
          <p>The professional service margin was 20.5% for the first quarter of 2009 which was a decrease of 30 basis points only compared to the same quarter of last year. The consulting margin increased by 110 basis points due to a decrease in personnel and other operating expenses.</p>
          <p>Conversely, the training margin decreased from 34.4% to 26.5% mainly by a 31% decline in training revenues which was partly offset by effective cost management. Because of the slight change in business mix, the first quarter non-GAAP gross margin increased by 10 basis points to 64.6%.</p>
          <p>Our U.S. GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 31.8% compared to 30.6% for the first quarter of last year. For the full year, we continue to expect a tax rate in the range of 29.5 to 30.5%.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2009 was 1.3 billion which is a strong increase of 32% compared to the first quarter of 2008. The positive development in free cash flow was primarily the result of improved working capital management in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Let me now give you an update on head count. As you know, in January we announced the reduction of positions to 48,500 FTEs by the end of this year. At the end of the first quarter, head count stood at 49,916 FTEs which is a decrease of 1,620 FTEs compared to December 31 of 2008. We remain on track to reach our workforce reduction target by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Let me finish up by saying that we have maintained our outlook for 2009. Please refer to the press release issued today for the complete outlook.</p>
          <p>I would now like to pass the call over to L&#xE9;o.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Werner. Welcome, everyone to today's call. I am pleased to provide you with an update on the business environment, our regional performance and our product successes.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the business environment, and that has been one of the most difficult topics since the economic collapse back in September 2008. There is no doubt that the business environment remains tough. While the pipeline begins to improve, closure rates are still unpredictable as customers remain extremely cautious and decisions are often delayed.</p>
          <p>Customers are buying software, but purchasing in smaller pieces. Therefore, phase deals and solutions that are quick to implement, ready to run and deliver fast return on investments are best in this environment. The good thing is that we are providing customers with the products that meet these requirements, like test-runs on our products, Business Suite 7 and SAP BusinessObjects solutions.</p>
          <p>Moreover, as the dynamics of the business are changing where volume becomes important, these products and many others of SAP are built for volume. In the first quarter, 22% of our order entry value came from new customers. This is a good achievement in this type of environment. That said, 78% of our business came from our existing customers.</p>
          <p>As the largest business applications company in the world, our more than 86,000 strong customer base provides great opportunities to continue to cross and off-sell software in this environment, when new customers tend to be a bit hesitant to make purchases.</p>
          <p>Another area of strength of SAP is value-based selling, or what we call value engineering, and its corresponding value delivery. Value engineering engages with thousands of customers each year across the world and has captured in-depth metrics and best practices by industry and business process, making it a highly scalable service. Value engineering is a competitive advantage for SAP and is even more valuable in this environment where customers want their projects to be on time, on budget and on value.</p>
          <p>Value delivery is our customer centric approach across all of SAP to help customers consume the value of their investment in SAP and achieve the goals they set forth at the inception of their initiatives. We believe that the alignment of value and value consumption is a critical component in making each customer successful and driving long-term success for SAP.</p>
          <p>As you saw, our non-GAAP software and software-related service revenues were down 4% at constant currencies in the first quarter. As we stated in our fourth quarter 2008 results press release and again at the analyst conference on the same day in January, the first half of 2009 would be a very difficult comparison to the first half of 2008, due to a different &#x2013; difficult operating environment. And secondly, 2009 no longer includes the positive effect from the acquisition of BusinessObjects and third, a tough comparison to the strong results reported in the first half of 2008 which was prior to the economic crisis that disrupted the global markets in the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>It is important for you to remember that this expectation continues to hold true for the second quarter of 2009, which will be even tougher comparison to the second quarter of 2008 than the first quarter of 2009 versus the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>While visibility for software revenues remains limited, we continue to focus on protecting our operating margins while adjusting our business model. As we did in the fourth quarter of last year when we began the program of tight cost controls and reported strong margin growth, I'm pleased to say that we were successful again in the first quarter of 2009 as demonstrated by the strong first quarter operating margin results that Werner talked about earlier.</p>
          <p>Our business model is flexible so that we can rapidly change our cost structure when necessary. Our cost containment measures and workforce reduction remain on track, allowing us to reaffirm our guidance for 2009.</p>
          <p>Our competitive position has not changed regardless of the environment, nor did we expect it to. Our win rates are above 80% against our next largest competitor, as they have been for many quarters. And we remain the undisputed leader in industry solutions with our nearly two decades of organic growth in developing and delivering more than 25 end-to-end industry specific platforms.</p>
          <p>One example of where we are demonstrating leadership in verticals is in utilities; specifically in smart metering. We announced with Landis+Gyr, one of the world's premier metering solutions providers, a software development co-operation agreement for the integration of Landis+Gyr advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) with SAP for utility solution portfolio using enterprise services.</p>
          <p>We also announced that Consumers Energy will become the first utility to purchase SAP AMI integration for utility software.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to our regional performance. As you can see from the results we reported, each of the regions experienced a decline in software and software-related service revenues on a non-GAAP constant currency basis. What we are experiencing from the customers' perspective is quite similar in all regions. Customers like visibility, cash and the ability to attain credit. So they are often hesitant to make purchases unless the software meets the customer's specific needs I mentioned earlier. To SAP's benefit, we have a large portfolio of products offering customers choice and flexibility to meet their specific requirements.</p>
          <p>We are seeing quite a lot of incremental business, small EAP purchases and sales of analytics and performance optimization applications. We are also offering financing through third-party financing providers, once again helping customers in this difficult economy.</p>
          <p>Software and software-related service results among the countries within the regions where we have indiscernible. For example, Western Europe didn't perform so well, while the Middle East showed good results. Emerging markets in general were down, but China was relatively flat. Nevertheless the BRIC countries, as a whole, were much lower.</p>
          <p>Key contracts wins in the EMEA region were Estacion Pharmaceuticals, Limited, <mark type="inaudible" /> and Bank of Cyprus Group. In the Americas, we signed Recreational Equipment, Incorporated, Maxum Petroleum, Infrastructure 1 Telecommunication and in APG key wins were National University of Singapore, Chongqing Electric Power Corporation and Northeast China Grid Company.</p>
          <p>We continue to deliver the most advanced product portfolio and technology platform in the industry. We believe we are well ahead of our competitors. We have a clearly-defined product road map, a service-oriented architecture with more than 2,800 enterprise services, a fully integrated suite of solutions for large and small enterprises covering more than 25 industry solutions.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we continue to innovate, incorporating new technologies like our enhancement packages, which delivers innovation results as to option to customers that no other competitor can offer. To date, there has been more than 3,500 downloads of enhancement packages. Some companies believe in the strategy of ITC on multiple platforms. One of SAP's strengths is a single, open platform with a burgeoning ecosystem developing around it.</p>
          <p>That brings me to our new SAP Business Suite 7 that we announced in February. We are very excited about this product. We currently have <mark type="inaudible" /> customers in ramp up, and it will be generally available in the very near future.</p>
          <p>SAP Business Suite 7 is ideal for this environment because it is highly modular. It contains pre-configured business processes that focus on industry-specific business outcome. It can be deployed in a step-by-step process quickly, generating fast Alloy, and it contains enhancement package technology and has embedded analytic capability from SAP BusinessObjects for better and faster decision making. These are functionalities that customers need now.</p>
          <p>Moreover, SAP Business Suite 7 provides more opportunities for customers to upgrade, augmenting their existing SAP application. SAP BusinessObjects Polestar is another product you will hear more about in the near future and another product geared perfectly for the current environment.</p>
          <p>Data exploration will be much faster once SAP BusinessObjects Polestar is combined with Business Warehouse Accelerator, basically using SAP BusinessObjects Polestar as the front end with Business Warehouse Accelerator providing the speed from the back end. It will be a powerful and extremely fast tool for data analyzers.</p>
          <p>Alloy was a product that we jointly announced with IBM in January. Alloy software enables access to SAP applications and information through Lotus Notes. IBM Lotus Notes is used by more than 46,000 companies, and over half of Fortune Global 100's largest enterprises use IBM Lotus Notes. Alloy joins to it, which enables users to access SAP software and data and support key business processes using their familiar Microsoft Office environment. The latest version of software Duet 1.5 supports new processes with recruitment management, -- choosing management, workflow templates and administrators.</p>
          <p>Alloy and Duet will play a major role in expanding SAP's addressable markets to business users as well as increasing users of SAP software in existing accounts. This quarter marks the first anniversary of the closing of our acquisition of BusinessObjects. Now joined together with SAP as SAP BusinessObjects, we couldn't be more pleased with the outcome of this acquisition.</p>
          <p>From the speed of the integration to the sales success of SAP BusinessObjects solutions, the acquisition has exceeded even our own internal expectations. We'll continue to see good demand for SAP BusinessObjects solutions.</p>
          <p>Also of significance especially in today's environment where risk management, transparency, understanding business operations and making the right decisions are paramount, we are now delivering SAP Business All-in-One with fully-integrated, predefined business intelligence functionality, including approximately 25 dashboards and the reports based on Crystal Reports and accessories.</p>
          <p>This new product is very attractively priced, contains prepackaged business and data content and requires minimum costs related to hardware services and change management. This offering further increases value for mid-size companies by supporting a very low TCO.</p>
          <p>You may have seen our press release today in our agreement with SUGEN on the defined list of key performance indicators that will be used to measure the success of SAP Enterprise Support services. SUGEN and its members are all fully behind this agreement and endorse this industry-leading approach. As part of the agreement, we also changed the pricing schedule for maintenance increases. Customers will now move to 22% over a seven-year timeframe instead of four.</p>
          <p>With this adjustment SAP demonstrates a clear commitment and responsiveness to its customers in the challenging global economic conditions they must navigate today. The commitment to our customers is a core value at SAP.</p>
          <p>On Enterprise Support, we are confident that it delivers unparalleled value to all customers. It is a significant step from the active problem solving to proactive management and improvement of our customers IT landscape, including end-to-end solution operations for the entire application's life-cycle.</p>
          <p>In fact, it is a bold step to shape maintenance and support within the industry. Through Enterprise Support, SAP is not only the role model for the evolution of software support, but stands alone among the competition in providing transparency into how the value of our support can be measured for our customers.</p>
          <p>Enterprise Support will become a competitive advantage for SAP. We are the leader in this industry and Enterprise Support, with its industry-changing dynamic, is just another example of SAP demonstrating true leadership and customer focus.</p>
          <p>In closing, let me say that while economic times are quite challenging, it is not the first time we have experienced a downturn.</p>
          <p>Tough times create opportunities for strong, healthy companies. We can become leaner without sacrificing future growth. We have a strong, flexible, scalable and resilient business model with a higher percentage of recurring revenues continuing to trend upwards.</p>
          <p>For example in the first quarter of 2009, 55% of our revenues were recurring compared to only 19, 10 years ago. We have the most robust product portfolio in the business applications space, and we have the ability to continue to innovate in these tough times. And, yes, innovation is important.</p>
          <p>As you may recall, continued innovation during the last recession was also in the new products we see today, products that allowed us to strengthen our leadership position when the market recovered.</p>
          <p>We are in an even better position now than during the last downturn. Once again, we expect to emerge a much stronger company as we did last time.</p>
          <p>Thank you for listening, and we will now be happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, if I may. First question for Werner, first of all, well done on the cost saving so far. I just was wondering, if you look at the cost OpEx run rate in Q1, does that already include any benefits from employees that have left already the organization or is that just pure non-personnel-related savings? And a question for Bill and L&#xE9;o, if you look into Q2, obviously the year-over-year rate will probably look a lot worse than Q1. But if I look into the second half of the year, has there been any change in terms of visibility? Do you feel slightly better because customer behavior becomes slightly more rational? Is there a sense of pipeline building, something going on? Thanks for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Raimo, I will start take the first part of the question. If you look to the operating expenses, the reduction in personnel expenses contributed the least to the reduction in operating expenses if you exclude the restructuring charge. If you exclude the restructuring charge, then you see a decrease of our operating expenses quarter over quarter by nearly 9%. And I think the personnel expenses, if you look to it from a standalone perspective quarter over quarter, only reduced by roughly 3%. So the majority is coming from the other cost containment measures like reduction in third-party expenses, restriction and reduction on travel expenses and other areas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on Q2, you're absolutely right. The comparison on a year-over-year basis is tough for Q2 in '09, especially considering the very large Q2 '08 that we had. And as L&#xE9;o pointed out, the environment is difficult out there. Having said that, as we look into the future into the second half, the pipeline does continue to build in the company quite strongly. We are looking at coverage comparisons that look similar on a year-over-year basis to what they looked liked in '08, which is encouraging. And we're also managing the business, not only at a revenue coverage level, but at a deal and a volume coverage level because we understand that we have to substantially increase the number of transactions given the economic cycle we're in.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you. Werner, a question for you on the provisions you mentioned, the sales allowance of 87 million. Obviously, that's quite a large number relative to prior quarters. Could you say perhaps how much of that was taken against licenses and how much against maintenance and perhaps also how much of it is specific as opposed to a general allowance? And then for L&#xE9;o, in terms of the linearity in the quarter, January through March, did you notice any change, any stabilization improvements, et cetera? And also perhaps could you say how many of the deals in the quarter were over 5 million? I think last year it was about 17%. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I'll take the first question, Michael. The majority of this 87 million was coming from the support area. So it has nothing to do with new licenses, it's really the support area, the support invoices fee we send out and then looking into maybe in a very conservative way, where do we anticipate any shortfall from customers due to financial distress?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hello, Michael, the linearity in the quarter was not abnormal and was probably more or less as usual, maybe even more than usual, slightly more towards back ended in the quarter given the very, very, very tough trading conditions in January and February. And there was a little bit of a cycling better climate in the last weeks of the quarter. And as to the deal metrics, deals above &#x20AC;5 million accounted for 12%.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my questions. I've got three questions, if I may. First of all, was there anything kind of atypical about the kind of quarter licenses, if they've had &#x2013; have restructuring any kind of impact on the quarter? And if that's not the case, if we would apply normal sequential seasonality, and I know it's fairly difficult to apply anything normal in this environment. But if you would do that, you get to a number around 2.6 billion for the year, which is quite a bit light versus consensus. I was wondering if you could make a comment on that?</p>
          <p>Then secondly, on the kind of improvements in the pipe, what is really driving that? Is that suite &#x2013; the new business suite or are there other kind of factors in there? And then finally, on the head count reductions, so the main kind of reductions at the moment have been in the U.S. if you look at Q1. When would you expect the kind of European reductions to kind of bear fruit and grow up out of the payroll? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start with the seasonality. I think it would be a serious mistake if you take the historical seasonality and transform it into 2009. We have an exceptional year due to the economic crisis we see around the world. And I only can recommend that you do not use historical seasonality. If you look to the reduction, what I said in my introductional remarks, of course we saw a stronger workforce reduction in the first quarter in Asia Pacific and in the Americas, but that's normal. The European law generally provides a longer period of employees to actually relieve the company, and that's actually happening. And we will see the benefit then throughout the next two quarters also from a position reduction, extra position reduction perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and maybe from a product point of view of what is selling out there in the market, SAP has a very wide and deep catalog and portfolio of products ranging way beyond the business suite from the analytical side to the performance optimization side to industry solutions to on-demand solutions to subscription solutions. So you can't really pinpoint this or the other product.</p>
          <p>What we do see is a good uptake from our ramp up customers when it comes to the business suite. We are launching a set of new products also on the analytical side, such as Polestar, that will be officially launched at SAPPHIRE. So the demand has actually been driven from many sides in the portfolio. And as Bill indicated early on, he is driving the sales force with a keen and sharp eye on the volume side which helps, therefore, to have a much deeper and a much more &#x2013; and a greater variety when it comes to the type of products that are being sold to our customer base.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks. I just wanted to dig a little bit more on just your expectations for operating expenses. Obviously saw a big decline quarter-to-quarter and then you did mention that you'll see more of these heads that actually were even let go in Q1 start to come off and then come off payroll Q2 and beyond. So how should we think about just from a, almost a seasonality perspective just modeling operating expenses in Q2? Or how do you all think about it Q2 and Q3? And then just one thing, back on the provision for doubtful accounts. I wondered if you can just give us some more details of this actually applying to customers that have been &#x2013; have indeed, let's say, gone into bankruptcy, or those that you're just really concerned about as it applies to any particular verticals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'll take the first part of the question. And I think if you look to these type of customers where we book the sales allowances, it's mainly related to financial distress. And some of them are in bankruptcy but it doesn't mean that they do not pay. Maybe when they are under Chapter 11 they continue to pay, but we were cautiously considering this when we closed the books for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Now regarding the operating expenses for the following quarters, it is a bit difficult at this point in time, because we have not yet the full picture on when people are leaving. We haven't made all the calculations, detailed calculations now. So I cannot answer the question. Of course, we will continue to have tight cost control in Q2, three and four, and on top you will see the positive impact from the reduction in personnel expenses, but I cannot quantify this at this point in time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, guys. A couple of questions from me. Just in terms of on this cost point again, Werner, I see you've done a credit rerun in the first quarter. If you do use kind of normal seasonality, it's difficult to see how you're not going to be above your guidance in terms of the margins. How are you feeling about the outlook that you've given? Is it that we're early in the year? Or are there things on the cost side that we need &#x2013; that we don't understand? And the second question is on the support. Is there &#x2013; I mean, do we expect the support revenues to start to grow sequentially now through the year, or I mean <mark type="inaudible" /> something that could be greater through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could you &#x2013; before I answer, can you repeat the second part of the question. The line is not so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question was really about the doubtful debt. How do you feel about these going forward? Do you think there's room at least to even be greater through the year? Or do you think that you have been conservative enough on doubtful debts around the support?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I think we have done everything we saw as of the first quarter. And we do not anticipate that we need to consider additional sales allowances at the same size during the next quarter. If you look to the cost control, I would say that the margin has &#x2013; is our first priority and to deliver on our margin guidance. And it is clear that visibility, as Bill mentioned, into the next quarters is limited and that's the reason why we stress the guidance and focus on the margin and we will do everything to deliver on our margin. More, I cannot say at this point in time. L&#xE9;o, anything to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, James, I can add only one comment. We reiterated our guidance for 2009. And I'd like to make sure that we all are on the same understanding. We gave guidance on the margin, and we try to give all of you a working assumption or hypothesis when it comes to assess our risk performance for the year. The guidance, in fact, is a margin guidance first of all. And that's how I think you should read it.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thanks for taking the questions. Just I know it's already been stressed pretty fairly, but I just want to get a feeling for the OpEx savings. I mean, in the last downturn you saved something, I think in 2003, something like more than 400 million in costs. And if I remember correctly, Werner, I mean, you indicated in formal comments you see some restructuring charges in the range of four to 700 million OpEx savings. Is that something that would still hold true? The first part of the question, then the second one was strategic one. Given the recent ongoing consolidation in the industry, how do you see your own strategic positioning going forward? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll take the first part, and L&#xE9;o, take the second part. Knut, if you look to the comment I made earlier, the impact from the workforce reductions in 2010, this reduction of 300 to 350 million, that's already a big chunk of the operating reductions we envision for 2010 over 2008. But if you continue to manage costs as tight as we did in the last two quarters, you will see also the difference to the amount you just mentioned, six to 700 million, flowing in as we continuously look to reduce our third-party expenses, travel expenses and all other kinds of operating expenses. So from that perspective, I still hold to what I said previously then, this is the range we can save if you compare 2008 &#x2013; sorry, 2010 with 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Knut, and regarding the consolidation, let me try to give you a bit of a perspective on that. If you take it from the SAP point of view, we are the world's largest provider of business application software. We are a company with 86,000 customers, and our market share is roughly twice as big as number two. We have just finished integrating very successfully the third-largest M&amp;A operation in the software industry, historically speaking. That's BusinessObjects.</p>
          <p>So we feel rather good about our strategy, where we combine organic growth under normal circumstances that is fueled by innovation and smart acquisitions that give us a much deeper stake on the higher side of the value-added side of the stake. I don't think that we are terribly interested in trying to consolidate the lower end of the stake, the hardware side, in particular when you look at some hardware that has the highest energy consumption of all existing hardwares in a time where everyone is trying to save energy, but that's a different &#x2013; that's a different reasoning.</p>
          <p>So we feel comfortable about our position, but I can assure you that we keep on monitoring the market. And we will be looking at the market, and should there be an opportunity out there that makes sense for SAP and for our customers, we will not hesitate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First question's just on the maintenance side. Clearly, the weak license revenue growth this year weighs on maintenance as you look out into next year, how do you think about creating some ballast against that in terms of maintenance growth rates? And then secondly, Bill, you talked about needing to increase the number of transactions, just given the pressure on deal sizes. How are you thinking about changing the sales force or providing different incentives to enable that transition to occur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sarah, this is Bill, and let me first of all talk about what we're doing with the sales force. We really are innovating the way we manage the business on a day-to-day basis. I think L&#xE9;o talked earlier about the move the customers made to value, because every deal starts with a business-led outcome. So at the high end, you have to look at the customers' business from the outside in and truly innovate their business based upon metrics, business value and fast return on invested capital.</p>
          <p>So everything starts with that. We're innovating the sales force in the way they think about deals, and one of the major changes is really looking at order entry. Because on a year-over-year basis, if you improve your order entry, while not every single deal may be recognized in the current quarter, you build a nice backlog of business. So we're looking to combine both our quarterly focus, which you're very used to, with an order entry focus, so we build a good backlog and a healthy annuity stream going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Sara, this is L&#xE9;o. Let me try to answer the second part of your question that basically Bill already addressed in his answer. I think you should follow the guidance we have been trying to give to the capital market now for some time and look at SSRS as our product revenues and not just as two numbers, which is license and support. In fact, in SSRS there is more than just maintenance. There is subscription, there is on-demand services and things like that.</p>
          <p>We are &#x2013; we have been in the process and will continue to do so during this quarter and next quarter and during the next year, in fact. We want to adjust our business model and have a much more diversified income stream from our software products. We want to generate subscriptions. We want to be more in the on-demand business. We will continue with the upfront license sales and of course on that basis generate maintenance. So I'd like to encourage you to decouple this binary equation and actually look at the entire portfolio and really focus on SSRS and not just on one or the other item of SSRS.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Maybe L&#xE9;o, just on Business Suite 7, do you think that's going to act as a catalyst for more of your customer base to move to the new or relatively new core component for ERP, and therefore does that open the door for you to effectively cross-sell more into your base, assuming that Business Suite 7 is &#x2013; sees adoption levels that are on plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ross, there is actually a very good adoption rate happening out there with ERP, which is, by the way, helping the bigger adoption of Business Suite 7 and not necessarily the other way around. So ERP is going very well. We have a big movement of companies moving to ERP, if only because of the TCO equation which is significantly lower with ERP. And on Business Suite 7, the innovation is actually twofold or maybe even threefold. On the one hand, it is the Enhancement Packs that go across the entire Business Suite.</p>
          <p>The second thing are very innovative business processes, end-to-end business processes, that we ship for industry and that are shipped as such as a end-to-end business process, and last but certainly not least it is truly a business suite from a technological point of view in the sense that it contains 2,800 enterprise services that are constructed from a holistic point of view, and you can implement it in a modular way.</p>
          <p>So we see quite a lot of pent-up demand for Business Suite 7. We are still in the ramp-up phase, just want to make sure everyone understands that. We are very optimistic about coming out of the ramp-up phase with flying colors, and so if we can mass market it and Bill's sales force can sell it. And, by the way, we have already quite a lot of demand for modules or for part of the business suite that can be implemented as such, thanks to the best-run, our campaign that we have designed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just a follow-up one for Werner. With the extension of the maintenance price change from four years to seven years, does that lead you to any different thoughts about cost-based growth or, indeed, incremental cost-saving measures beyond the current year? I'm just wondering if there's any kind of tie-in your mind between the two? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Ross, first of all, 2009 pricing is not impacted. And remember, this only applies to the installed base. If customers are buying new licenses, the 22% apply right away. And here we only talk about an extension of the period for adjusting the rate from 17% to 22%, from four to seven years. But in 2009, this has no impact because 2009 over 2008 will &#x2013; there we will apply the percentage of 8% to 18.3% as the maintenance support rate. Going forward, I think we have a focus on margin and this means that, in any case, we have a tight focus on controlling our costs. So this is not an additional lever to our cost-containment activities we have in our organization.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions from my side, if I may. First, I mean, I think we're all aware during Q1 that the tough comparison you faced on the last slide, but could you maybe help us understand the decline between a volume and a price implication, really sort of trying to understand here if you were prepared to discount or whether if you held the line on pricing and perhaps even ceded some market share erosion.</p>
          <p>And secondly, the question around the comparison base for Q2 is obviously even more prominent. As you said, it gets even tougher. But actually, turning it the other way, is there anything in the pipeline, anything you might be seeing in terms of stability or customer behavior that suggests that you actually might do better than the negative 34%? Is it impossible? Are you targeting that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I'd like to touch on the first quarter and the environment, Mark. On deals, there were less deals and the average selling price was lower on a year-over-year basis, but it wasn't dramatic in terms of the number of deals and it wasn't dramatic on the average selling price. But that's why we're focused on volume and increasing the number of transactions in every theater, in every industry, in every market segment. That is the focus. Now, as it relates on a go-forward basis, what was your main interest in Q2, is it likely to be better than Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The assumption, I think, pretty much from the Merrill Lynch question, I think, collectively, probably most on the call, are assuming that in Q2, I guess myself included, that it will get worse in terms of the drop, you'll see a worse decline than 34%. You obviously have a much better feel for your pipeline and what you're targeting, and I'm wondering if it's impossible for you to actually improve that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that it's pretty clear the Company is guiding on the margin because there is a lack of visibility in the marketplace. And you are right, in terms of the difficulty of the comparison, Q2 was an especially strong quarter in 2008 and actually contributed to five percentage points of our revenue greater than it normally it did on a historical run rate basis. So you have to take that into account. Therefore, I'd say let's focus on the margin. Let's acknowledge that the visibility is a challenge and also that the comparison is tough, without trying to apply a metric to it, because we're focused on our customers and executing our plan, and I think L&#xE9;o did reiterate guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, hi. Two questions. One is on the restructuring charge for the full year. I mean, given the fact that four, five years down the, let me say, fairly easy countries with the personal reductions, is there any danger that we're going to end up with a number higher than 300 million? And the second question is on your maintenance revenue. I mean, I understand if I take the 87 million sales allowance into account, then the number looks a little better, but I'm just trying to get a feel. I mean, how do customers react right now with maintenance contract? I mean, do you see a lot of customers trying to give back licenses or opt for discounts, specifically on maintenance contracts, or is it pretty stable?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jochen, the question regarding restructuring, I think we will not exceed the range we provided, two to 300 million, and we have included in our restructuring charge the implications from Germany, which actually is &#x2013; carries the highest cost. And from that perspective, we will definitely stay in the range of two to 300 million.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and Jochen, let me maybe say a few words about the situation around maintenance. It is obvious that in the current climate customers are trying to pinch every euro, dollar, yen, pound that they have before spending it, which is why the agreement we have reached with SUGEN and the KPIs that we have agreed to deliver and the value-based solutions that we are providing out of Enterprise Support is so important, because this is the only maintenance and support offering in the entire industry, and I insist on that. No one else comes even close that actually measures and provides customers with the metric to tell them how much value they can generate out of the maintenance. And I have to tell you that, by having done that, the discussion with our customers has radically changed when we talk about maintenance. It is not about price anymore. Everyone is now very much focused on extracting the value, and as you know very well, people are more than happy to pay for the value provided they get it.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if maybe I can add then, many &#x2013; most of our customers accepted the new contract we sent out with the new Enterprise Support price points.</p>
