          <p>Thank you, Diego.</p>
          <p>Good morning and afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Teva's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. We hope you had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of this press release is available on our website at www.tevapharm.com. Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast of this call that is also available on our website.</p>
          <p>Today, we are joined by Shlomo Yanai, President and CEO; Eyal Desheh, Chief Financial Officer; Bill Marth, President and CEO of Teva North America; Moshe Manor, Vice President of Global Branded Products; Dr, Gerard Van Odijk, President and CEO of Teva Europe; and Dr. Ben-Zion Weiner, Teva's Chief R&amp;D Officer.</p>
          <p>Shlomo and Eyal will begin by providing an overview of our results. Please note that Shlomo will be referring in his prepared comments to non-GAAP gross margin, operating profit, net income and EPS. Eyal will provide additional detail on the items excluded from our non-GAAP results. We will then open the call for a question-and-answer period.</p>
          <p>Before we proceed to the call, I would like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language contained in today's press release also pertains to this conference call and webcast. Shlomo?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Elana. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>This was an outstanding quarter for Teva. Indeed, it was our strongest quarter ever in terms of organic growth. Net sales reached $3.8 billion, breaking all previous records in local currency terms with record gross margins of 59%.</p>
          <p>Quarterly operating profit reached a record $1.2 billion, a 22% increase over the second quarter of 2009. Net income in the quarter reached $981 million, a 32% increase over Q2 '09. And for the first time, EPS crossed the $1.00 mark to reach $1.08. Our free cash flow reached $700 million, an increase of 86% over Q2 '09.</p>
          <p>Teva's better than anticipated results in the second quarter were driven by superb performances across our many geographies and lines of business, including especially strong sales in North America. It was a great quarter for Teva in North America, with record breaking results, record sales of generics, and record number of new product launches.</p>
          <p>Total sales in North America reached $2.5 billion in Q2, up 17% over the second quarter of 2009. We had sales of $1.5 billion in US generics, up 14% over the second quarter of 2009, and strong sales of our branded products.</p>
          <p>It was also an exceptionally busy quarter with 9 new launches, representing a brand value of over $7.5 billion. This intensive pace has continued into the beginning of Q3 with our launch of Venlafaxine ER, our generic version of Effexor XR. Thanks to the efforts of our outstanding global team, within 24 hours of launching, over 25,000 pharmacies in the US were supplied with the product, ready to dispense to the patients.</p>
          <p>This was also an excellent quarter for our European business, which despite the challenging market conditions in this region, reached sales of $811 million, up 10% on the Q2 '09 in local currency terms. Sales were up in all our major European markets and nearly all our other European markets as well. Growth was especially impressive in France, Italy, and in the new World Cup winner, Spain, where sales grew by well over 20%.</p>
          <p>I believe that our performance in Europe this quarter demonstrates Teva's strong capabilities in managing a complex business environment. The recent healthcare reforms in Europe do involve some pricing pressure in the short term, but there is an outstanding opportunity over the longer term to increase generics penetration in these markets. Pricing pressure is something we are accustomed to in the intensely competitive US market for a long time, and it is a phenomenon that, as you know, Teva is adept at managing. For all these reasons, we remain very optimistic about the future of our European business.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to our international business where sales reached $522 million, up 6% in local currencies over Q2 '09. Our strong performance in markets including Latin America and Israel were offset by weaker results in Russia during this quarter.</p>
          <p>Our results in Russia, one of the fastest growing markets where we continue to strengthen our market position, are simply a matter of the timing of tenders and the very large sales to government, which were especially strong in the first quarter of this year as well as in the comparable second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Q2 was another outstanding quarter for our innovative business. Global in-market sales of COPAXONE, the world's leading therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, grew by 13% over the second quarter of 2009 to reach $770 million. COPAXONE sales in the US grew by 21%, and according to IMS data, COPAXONE maintained its leading market position in the US with TRx of 40%.</p>
          <p>We are continuously working to develop new ways of improving the experience of patients taking COPAXONE. In April, the FDA indicated that a supplemental new drug application, sNDA, for our low injection volume of COPAXONE had been accepted, and the action date is January 1, 2011.</p>
          <p>In our GALA trial, which will examine a 40-milligram glatiramer acetate injection, dosed 3 times weekly, initiated patient recruitment during the second quarter of 2010. We are confident that COPAXONE sales leadership over the last 10 years will continue, and that its unsurpassed long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability established over 1 million years of patient experience will enable COPAXONE to remain well positioned, even as new oral therapies come to market.</p>
          <p>Clearly, physicians and patients will have to carefully weigh the risk against the benefits for emerging oral therapies, which are associated with serious safety concerns. Market research indicates that most physicians and patients will not rapidly adopt newer therapies until their risk benefit profiles are more thoroughly understood. Research also reveals reluctance by physicians to switch therapy if a patient's disease is stable.</p>
          <p>I would like to take a moment to address the market reaction last Friday to the approval of the generic LOVENOX and the apparent link that has been made to COPAXONE . Our team has thoroughly reviewed the FDA's response to the citizen petition questioning the approval criteria for generic LOVENOX. We believe that the agency's response actually supports our position, and in the case of COPAXONE and like some other complex molecules, there are no acceptable and reliable tests either in humans or in animals that can be relied upon except for complete clinical tests, which reflect the clinical outcomes in multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>For this reason, we believe that any company seeking to introduce a similar version of COPAXONE will need to conduct a long placebo-controlled clinical trial with measured clinical endpoints in a large patient population to establish safety and efficacy.</p>
          <p>And last, but not least, all this has been reflected in our long term strategic outlook, which we presented to you in January. As we told you then, our risk adjusted outlook assumes that COPAXONE will peak midway through the planning period and gradually decline into the $2 billion range, accounting for only 6% of Teva's sales by the end of 2015. Just to remind you, we expect $31 billion in sales of which $9 billion of sales will be branded sales by 2015.</p>
          <p>I would now like to take a moment to highlight for you some of the major strategic achievements of the quarter. As part of our ongoing efforts to continuously improve the level of service for Teva's customers, we opened two major new state of the art facilities during the quarter. In the Czech Republic, we opened a new oral solid dose manufacturing plant, already approved by the FDA, where we will produce many of the large scale products for the US market. The high quality and low cost production at this plant will enable us to further enhance our competitive position. And in Hungary, where our main manufacturing site for the EU is based, we opened a massive packaging plant which will help us meet the growing needs of the many different markets we serve in Europe.</p>
          <p>These last few months have been an exceptionally busy time for our European business as we prepare for the closing and eventual integration of ratiopharm into the Teva family. As we get to know ratiopharm even better, our excitement continued to grow about the combination of the 2 companies, and the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead for our European business. I am pleased to announce that we now expect the closing to take place earlier than we initially anticipated and that we should close during the current quarter.</p>
          <p>We are extremely pleased with the result of the first half of this year, which have yielded revenues of more than $7.4 billion and EPS of $1.99. Based on our performance during the first half of the year and our outlook for the third and fourth quarters, we now expect 2010 EPS in the range of $4.50 to $4.60 compared to the previous range of $4.40 to $4.60.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now let us turn the call over to Eyal for a more detailed financial update. Eyal?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Shlomo, and good day to everyone.</p>
          <p>I hope you have had an opportunity to review the press release we issued earlier today. As you can see, we reported an outstanding second quarter with record sales in local currencies as well as record gross profit, operating profit, net income and earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, completing a very strong first half and heading to an excellent 2010.</p>
          <p>We also reported cash flow from operations of almost $1 billion and free cash flow of $700 million, both representing substantial growth compared to Q2 last year.</p>
          <p>Before we delve into the numbers, I would like to touch on 2 technical topics. First, I would like to remind everyone that we are presenting GAAP and non-GAAP results. In our non-GAAP presentation, we have excluded the following items this quarter: amortization of purchase intangible assets amounting to $130 million of which $122 million are included in cost of goods sold and the remaining $8 million in sales and marketing expenses; finance expenses of $123 million, which reflect $147 million in expenses resulting from hedging activities in connection with the acquisition of ratiopharm; net of finance income of $24 million resulting from sales of securities; restructuring costs of $11 million resulting mostly from closing a manufacturing facility in Ireland; $5 million purchased R&amp;D process; impairment of assets of $3 million, and these expenses were offset by income of $23 million in connection with legal settlement. In addition, the related tax benefits of $65 million.</p>
          <p>You should note that the items excluded in arriving to our non-GAAP results for the second quarter of 2009 are not identical to those in the current quarter. Most notably, Q2 2009 included an inventory step-up in connection with the Barr acquisition and higher amortization of purchase intangible assets. Please review our press release and related tables for the reconciliation of our GAAP numbers and complete information. As indicated in the past, we present non-GAAP figures to show you how we, the management team and our board, look at our financial results.</p>
          <p>And second, foreign currency continued to play a significant role in our results. The second quarter, in the second quarter, foreign currency differences had a negative impact of approximately $52 million on sales as compared to Q2 2009. The impact on sales resulted primarily from the decline in the value of certain currencies relative to the US dollar, primarily the euro, the British pound and the Hungarian forint, which was partially offset by a decline in the value of the US dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, the Israeli shekel and the Russian ruble.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, the impact on operating profit continues to be negligible, this time on the positive side with a positive contribution of $8 million. Teva's diverse geographical presence continues to provide us with a good natural hedge that mitigates much of the risk involved in currency fluctuation and minimizes the impacts on our bottom line.</p>
          <p>Before I review the P&amp;L in more detail, one more comment on that impact of foreign exchange had on our balance sheet, namely on our equity. The strength of the US dollar June 30 versus March 31 primarily relative to the euro, the Hungarian forint, the Polish zloty and the Czech koruna resulted in a negative impact of approximately $1 billion compared to the first quarter of 2010, due to translation differences of long term assets, mostly goodwill and other intangible assets as well as cash balances held in euro. However in July, the weakening of the US dollar had already offset part of this negative impact of the exchange rate as of June 30.</p>
          <p>Looking at our consolidated results for Q2, sales totaled $3.8 billion, an increase of 12% compared to Q2 last year. This growth is all organic as there was no acquisition during the past 12 months period. North America, which grew 17% delivered record generic product sales and strong profitability of the base business. Europe grew 4% in US dollars and 10% in local currency terms. Sales international markets grew 1% in US dollars and 6% in local currency term and was influenced by the timing of COPAXONE tenders in Russia.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating income reached $1.2 billion, up 22% compared to Q2 2009, benefiting from strong gross margin and tight expense controls. Non-GAAP net income reached $981 million, up 32% compared to Q2 2009. Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share were $1.08, up 30% compared to Q2 2009.</p>
          <p>Two housekeeping points related to earnings per share calculations. The weighted average share count for the fully diluted non-GAAP EPS was 921 million shares and the add-back for the non-GAAP EPS calculation was $11 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss profit margin and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross profit margin, which excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets, was 59% in the reported quarter compared to 58.5% in the second quarter last year. Gross margin continued to benefit from contributions from new and recently launched generic products in the US, improved gross margin of the US generic base business and a contribution to sales to our innovative and branded franchises.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating margin reached 31.6%, up 2.7 percentage points from 28.9% in Q2 2009. The increase resulted primarily from the termination of payment we made to sanofi-aventis over the past 2 years of 21% of COPAXONE in-market sales in the US and Canada, which were recorded under sales and marketing. Strong gross margin and lower G&amp;A as a percentage of sales also contributed to the improvement in our operating margins.</p>
          <p>Net R&amp;D expenses reached $217 million or 5.7% of sales and was up 28% compared to Q2 2009. Gross R&amp;D before reimbursement from third parties for certain R&amp;D expenses were $227 million or 6% of sales, up 8% compared to gross R&amp;D in Q2 2009. The increase in R&amp;D expenses relates mostly to our innovative and branded business, most notably women health products, the new low volume formulation of COPAXONE for which filing was made with the US FDA and our BLA file for G-CSF.</p>
          <p>As we guided earlier in the year, for the full year, we expect net R&amp;D expenses to be between 6 to 6.5% of net sales. Sales and marketing expenses excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets totaled $636 million in the second quarter or 16.7% of sales compared to 18.9% of sales in Q2 2009.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, the decline resulted primarily from the termination of payment to sanofi-aventis, which were recorded in sales and marketing expenses partially offset by higher royalty payments in connection with new and recently launched generic products in the US market. Total G&amp;A expenses this quarter were $189 million or 5% of sales compared with 5.8% of sales in Q2 last year.</p>
          <p>The synergies from the Barr acquisition continued to contribute to the decline in G&amp;A expenses and to many other expense line items in our P&amp;L. We recorded $25 million of net financial expenses on a non-GAAP basis in Q2 compared to $61 million of non-GAAP financial expenses in the comparable quarter of 2009. The lower financial expense resulted primarily from lower level of average debt through most of the quarter compared with the second quarter of 2009 as well as lower interest rate and higher gains from hedging activity unrelated to ratiopharm.</p>
          <p>Excluded from our non-GAAP financial expenses in the quarter are $147 million incurred in connection with the hedging of the ratiopharm acquisition and a gain of $24 million from the sales of securities. Following the agreement to acquire ratiopharm, and as we indicated last quarter, we created a hedging program designed to protect the dollar value of the acquisition. After accounting for $147 million in hedging expenses, the net saving from the acquisition price is approximately $270 million in US dollar terms compared to the price on the day we announced the acquisition.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter upon settling these hedging transactions, we reversed approximately $40 million of these costs, which are expected to be recorded as income in Q3, but consistent with our current presentation will again be excluded from our non-GAAP results. The tax expense provided for the second quarter was $183 million on pre-tax non-GAAP income of $1.176 billion. Our current estimate of non-GAAP annual tax rate for 2010 is 15% compared to 16% for all of 2009. The estimated tax rate for 2010 GAAP results is 12%.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at our cash flow. Cash generated from operations this quarter totaled $954 million, up 45% compared to Q2 2009. Our free cash flow excluding growth capital expenditure of $136 million and cash dividend of $164 million, partially offset by proceeds from sale of certain assets of $46 million, amounted to $700 million even or 86% higher than in Q2 2009. The improved cash flow was driven by strong collections and slight increase in working capital items this quarter.</p>
          <p>As you all know, in anticipation of the closing of the ratiopharm acquisition, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of senior notes inside pre-credit agreements with banks for a total commitment of $1.5 billion. On June 30, cash and marketable security totaled $5.2 billion, up approximately $2.2 billion from March 31, 2010. Our total outstanding loans, bonds and convertible debentures stood at $7 billion, up from 5.4 billion as of the end of March.</p>
          <p>Our cash position as of the end of Q2 reflects a use of some of the cash we raised to pay down approximately $800 million of the more expensive Barr bank debt. Our convertible debentures were reduced by $70 million this quarter and we intend to pay down the balance of the Barr debt approximately $700 million by the end of this year. As a result, our financial leverage as of June 30, 2010, was 27%, similar to our leverage in Q2, but up from 22% in March 31.</p>
          <p>DSO, days sales outstanding, amounted to 50 days this quarter compared to 53 days in Q1. We calculated DSO after netting out from the receivables our sales reserve and allowances. Inventory days stood at 172 days down from 183 days in the previous quarter or down from 188 days in Q2 2009.</p>
          <p>Net capital expenditure reached $90 million this quarter compared to $164 million in Q1 2010. This quarter net CapEx includes proceeds of $46 million from sales of certain assets.</p>
          <p>And lastly, dividends. Yesterday, Teva's board approved a quarterly dividend amounting to approximately $170 million. On a per share basis, our dividend, which is declared in Israeli shekel, is 0.7 shekels per share. Based on yesterday's rate of exchange of the shekel to the US dollar, this translates into approximately $0.181 per share.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for your time and attention today. Now we'll be glad to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We'll now conduct the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Randall Stanicky with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for the questions. Just first for Eyal, a clarification. The updated guidance, that remains kind of a standalone and does not yet reflect ratiopharm, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. As the exact date of the closing is still not known, we did not account for ratiopharm results in this guidance and this is apples-to-apples with what you know in 2010 in general. Of course we'll provide an update. It will take us a little while to study the exact data of the company as right now our plans are based on due diligence information and it always takes a little bit of time. We do expect this to have a positive impact on sales of course. As to our earnings per share, it will probably be a couple or $0.03 below, but not more than that in the first period, and of course it will have a contribution in 2011 as we mentioned when we announced the deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. And then for Gerard, with respect to what you reported, the 10% constant currency growth in Europe, you just give us a sense of how much the known pricing cuts reflected in that second quarter reported number at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Randall, for the question. I think it's a complex question in Europe because it's almost different for each market to answer. But I think I should start with saying, repeating what Shlomo said, is that if you take it across the board, Teva has been able to demonstrate that our setup in Europe makes us less vulnerable to some of the price dynamics in Europe. We know how to handle the complexity and the challenges that are coming from the  clear price pressure that we see in Europe.</p>
          <p>I also think that we have learned in tougher pricing environments like the US to handle this. If you look at it, there is &#x2013; it will stay with us, price pressure, but it's been with us for a long time, and it will stay with us. We have seen prices going down in markets, but it's been overcompensated by volume growth. It's very clear that it has to do with our portfolio, which is quite well spread between OTC, with hospitals, with retail, with many other products and also our geographies. We are not overweighted in one place or the other. We have a very nice well spread portfolio in products and geographies.</p>
          <p>On top of that, of course we have our launches that give us the tools to respond to all of these challenges. On top of that, we believe that the environment is helping us. There's volume growth in many, many places, which is very strong. And that's why I believe that it's for that that we can explain that our growth in this quarter was as good as it was. I'm sure that it will require every quarter a lot of hard work from us and very specific tailor made answer to the different challenges and opportunities we see in the different geographies in Europe, but it's very clear that we're up to it. I'm happy to give you a few examples, but perhaps we can talk about that later in light of another question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there a couple of main regions or major countries that you can highlight or point to that the price impacts have been fully reflected, the known pricing cuts at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in some places it started, and in some places it's not started. I'll take the much spoken about example in Spain, for example, in retail where we all know about the announced 35% price decrease on the gross prices but also with a limitation on discounts in the trade as part of that whole package. As Shlomo reported, or I think Eyal was, we had excellent growth, and we have been growing nearly 20% in our retail in Spain in the period that all of these measures were kicking in, in Spain. So it's been absorbed, and despite that, we have been able to grow our business very, very strongly in a place like Spain.</p>
          <p>And in other places like in Italy, it will take a bit more time. It's just been announced a 12.5% again on gross price. In Germany, you see that some of these tenders are currently kicking in, and where some companies have been gaining tenders last year and they see now some of the results in that, we know that we have won some tenders in this year, the first half of this year, which will be kicking in, in terms of market share and volume growth next year and the rest of this year or next year. And therefore the price impact will be related to that.</p>
          <p>It's a very diverse picture across Europe if I talk about Germany, I talk about the tender business, but as you know, a large chunk of the German market is not exposed to tenders so it's a segment in Germany that's under price pressure. There are other segments that are feeling the pressure of price, but as I said, that's the sort of price pressure that we see coming in every year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>In France, we know that the government is going after some extra savings.

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Respiratory business in the quarter seems stronger than we would have expected. Can you provide a little bit more detail on what is happening both in the US and overseas and what we can expect going forward? And I have a second question. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Bill, will you take the US piece and then Moshe will follow by the international countries or the international part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Good morning, Rich, and thanks for the question. With respect to respiratory, obviously as you have seen, ProAir has been holding around 50% so that's been very well. And then we've got some seasonally adjusted advantage because this is a particularly good season for us. And really the strength of QVAR has been really exceptional. It's almost 20% of that category now and so it's done very, very well and continues to grow. So I would say the ProAir really holds steady and moves with the market, with the season, and QVAR is really showing just great strength for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So with the seasonal strength that you cited, does that mean that in the coming quarter, we should not expect the same level of sales that we saw in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's hard to say what's going to happen in Q3. It all depends on the weather and the seasons so right now the quarter seems to be pretty good, but we'll see how it ends up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the gross margin, the guidance that maybe Eyal had commented, but I didn't hear that the range had been 59 to 60%, is that still the case for the full year guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I believe so, Rich. I think that 59% that we reported this quarter, on this quarter, the second half of the year with Venlafaxine coming in, you could see some improvement there and I think what we have guided for the beginning of the year is pretty valid.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. First question was just a follow up on Europe. I think you've averaged about 5% constant currency growth for the first half of this year. When we consider the mix of further price cuts as well as potential new launches in volume growth, is that 5% type of growth rate we have seen so far this year a decent proxy of what you're anticipating for the second half? And I just have a quick follow up after that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the second half last year was a very good second half, and although we are anticipating continued price pressure as we spoke about earlier, I would assume that we would be able to stay in the same sort of growth range as we have been doing so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then first the updated guidance, can you just talk a little about the earnings progression as we think about 3Q and 4Q given the generic Effexor launch this quarter and number of potential opportunities as you think about 4Q? Should we be thinking about 3Q and 4Q as roughly equal quarters? Or are you anticipating one is going to be meaningfully above the other? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're leaving me very little choice, but to return to our old type of describing our market as a market with many moving parts. And that is throughout the second half. Generally we could see the rest of the earning per share for the second half split more or less even between the quarters, but we could definitely see a couple of cents moving from one quarter to another depending on timing of launches, demand in the market, how it's allocated over the period, and of course this does not include the ratiopharm impact. So I would calculate this more or less even plus, minus $0.02, it could move.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. I was wondering if you all could give us a little bit a sense of what the LOVENOX citizens' petition taught you about your own LOVENOX filing. Is there anything that you saw in that, that now you can go back and address, or are you in interactions with the agency? And as well, Shlomo, your commentary about some of the teachings in the LOVENOX citizens' petition vis-&#xE0;-vis COPAXONE, how do you think the FDA is going to address some of these potential deficiencies? Do you that think they'll have to solicit kind of expert commentary or open up to the public to help address maybe the mechanisms and assays that should be utilized on COPAXONE? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so Bill you take this one, and then Ben-Zion will follow to complete the answer to this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ken, and thanks for the question. With respect to our LOVENOX file, we are continuing to dialogue with the agency. I would say to you that we feel that we're on track. We're progressing ahead. We did file slightly later about a month later than Momenta on the response to the immunogenicity, which is very likely why we haven't received our notification yet, but as we review the 5 criteria, we find that our product falls clearly within the range that we believe is approvable.</p>
          <p>Now of course we have to let the FDA &#x2013; they're going to have to give us their opinion as well. But the fact of the matter is, as we read through it, we think that we hit all the criteria very, very well and it's just a timing issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben-Zion, would you like to add on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in relevance to the correlation between LOVENOX and COPAXONE, I don't think that there is a direct correlation between approval of LOVENOX  and future generic approval of COPAXONE. The FDA had issued 5 criteria by which LOVENOX  has to follow and then get approval, 3 of those have to do with the extra material physical chemical aspects for the fragments, et cetera. I won't go into details unless you want me. And the 2 criteria that have to do with biological assays and test and human exposure. And I think COPAXONE is very different from LOVENOX  in the first part, in the 3 criteria that have to do with the actual product and primarily with the 2 biological ones.</p>
          <p>The first 3, LOVENOX  is the parent compound is obviously Heparin, a known chemical, a known product for 90 years. Structure is known, activity is known and COPAXONE is obviously a very different molecule based on random polymerization of a amino acid. Structure is not very clear. There's no specific epitope through which the activity can be explained. And I won't go into details about the series of polypeptides and the number of repeating units in the LOVENOX.</p>
          <p>What is very important to note here is that LOVENOX , the assays through which FDA approved LOVENOX  is based on very simple straightforward acceptable tests that everybody can do, which are directly related to the target organ, which is the blood. COPAXONE target organ is the brain, and there is no direct correlation between the mechanism affection of COPAXONE which have to do &#x2013; has to do with influencing immune cells and the target activity in the brain.</p>
          <p>So in my mind and other people mind, there is no direct substitution to a proper clinical trial conducted on MS patients with clinical endpoints. In my mind, there is no good way to demonstrate safety and efficacy unless such a clinical trial is being performed. No PK, no PD and no biological assays can substitute this notion.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the Irvine facility, we continue to work with the agency. We have released 12 products to date in cooperation with the FDA. And we are continuing to work with them on a daily basis to bring that facility up.</p>
          <p>I would remind that any of the big launches that people are concerned about, Enoxaparin, is not tied to the Irvine facility. Or gemcitabine for that matter is also a product that can be manufactured elsewhere.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. Couple of them.</p>
          <p>One around the filing of the low volume COPAXONE. Do you happen to have any update on whether that product will be titled for a 3-year exclusivity?</p>
          <p>And second, a little bit if you can, a little bit about how you're thinking about the risk in that you currently have with Protonix and the chances of exclusivity on ARICEPT?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ronny, as you probably now know, we have submitted the file of the 0.5 ml, and the file was accepted by the FDA, and with the action day as was mentioned January 1, 2011.</p>
          <p>Of course, I think it's too early to comment on the question that you ask about exclusivity. We definitely have good data there that show that the 0.5 ml is associated with less local saturation and pain, local pain, and that's something that we're going to discuss with the FDA, and with relation to the potential 3-year exclusivity for the low volume product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you would not know the answer to that until January 1? Or would you know the answer before that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't believe that we'll know the answer before January 1 for this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unless the FDA will give us the answer earlier.</p>
          <p>Bill, can you answer the second one on the Protonix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let's talk about the last two questions, Ronny. The Protonix and the Donepezil.</p>
          <p>On Protonix, let's just &#x2013; we'd go back to that and say I think it's a little early to talk about damages on Protonix, because we still believe we have a very long way to go here. Although, obviously, we don't agree with the judge, and at the appropriate time, we will appeal that decision, we still have two defenses that remain alive out there, the patent misuse and the unclean hands. So we will still pursue those with full vigor, and we will be looking for discovery in those particular areas. So I think we're a long way away from that on Protonix.</p>
          <p>On the Donepezil, I can recount to you where we are at. You know that we have actually 2 files. But our first file we have a final approval on that file. We believe we are first to file on the compound patent. We believe we are entitled to exclusivity. We maintain that position. Of course, Ranbaxy challenges that, but we beg to differ to that view. And so we're just proceeding.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a couple. First on COPAXONE, do you think you're getting to a point in the US at least where you won't be able to be as aggressive in raising prices? And just talk about what you think the long term outlook on price increases are for COPAXONE and how you're thinking about that at least in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, would you like to take this one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks for the question, David. You bring up an excellent question about COPAXONE and the pricing.</p>
          <p>We did take another price increase this quarter, and as we move forward, we begin to wonder about where those price increases will lead us to. But frankly you have seen the competition raise their price as well. So price in this particular area seems to go up. I would tend to agree with you that I would not be as aggressive in the future on my pricing. But we'll have to see.</p>
          <p>My concern has always been, Teva is generally speaking not a price leader. We're a price follower. And what I can't tolerate is a situation where what I believe is the standard of care in this particular therapy and the leading product in the US and global markets to be disadvantaged on price. So we'll continue to watch that as we move forward and just follow the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just the second question about competition from the orals, and specifically Gilenia. What's your market research telling you regarding the willingness of doctors to potentially use Gilenia in the earlier-stage patients? And do you expect that Gilenia largely at least initially will see usage in treatment failures and potentially switches from TYSABRI? I guess talk about what your research has been telling you there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, based on our research and extensive discussion actually with opinion leader, we believe the orals and specifically Gilenia will enjoy really slow uptake. And the reason I believe is, first of all, the physicians &#x2013; sorry, patients &#x2013; most of the patients on COPAXONE are stable, which they are doing well. And we don't see the rationale of switching patients that are doing well to a product that is relatively new with unknown long-term safety concerns.</p>
          <p>And actually if you talk about safety, we have to look at the &#x2013; and on the safety as issues that already were published, and more that I think we have to pay attention to the potential long term safety. And based on the experience that we all had in the market, and physicians and patients, with TYSABRI, we know the question of issues of safety on the short term and the emergence of safety issues on the long term. So therefore I believe that physicians will &#x2013; and definitely patients will follow &#x2013; will prescribe the orals mainly as a third line therapy, and in some cases, in the second line therapy, after a patient failed 1 or 2 Y therapies.</p>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that the oral might have the chance or the opportunity to expand the market as those patients that are really not &#x2013; really currently not treated <mark type="inaudible" /> that's an opportunity that oral can offer to the market that will not come on the expense on the existing products, and definitely not the expense of COPAXONE.</p>
          <p>So therefore, if you look at the oral and we look at COPAXONE, COPAXONE can deliver &#x2013; we are confident that COPAXONE will maintain its leadership, and actually we will grow COPAXONE sales in 2011.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning. I think this one is for Bill on the 0.5 ml filing.

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was kidding. But in any case, it's impossible for us to say at this point in time, really, whether we'll get the exclusivity on the sNDA &#x2013; on the low volume. I would like to believe that we should get that. But the fact of the matter is, right now, we will have to wait to see what the FDA's opinion is on this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So whether or not it has its own Orange Book listing and exclusivity are tied to each other? You don't know, based on the type of application, whether you would get an Orange Book listing that is separate or not? I just want to make sure I'm clear on that.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then the other sort of bigger picture North America question I have for you, Bill, is your latest thinking on the implementation of AMP and the implications for your business and the industry. Last time we checked in with you, I think it was still unclear to what the final deadlines would be and what the effects might be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we know that the effect actually- the bill was signed on March 23, and then it actually goes into effect at the first of next year. And it will go back and reference pricing from the fourth quarter of 2010. That's our estimates right now.</p>
          <p>The actual &#x2013; what the effective AMP will be in the US is really a very interesting question. We just don't have a good sense for that. You know, one has to speculate that if you're talking about AMP being a weighted average of pricing that is sold using a particular formulation with some exclusions and exclusions, essentially those largest purchasers that are not mail order, being the large chains in the US, are likely to be those individuals that drive the AMP.</p>
          <p>So those largest chains' prices will be largely what makes up the weighted average AMP. Because if you aggregate maybe a CVS and a Walgreens and a Wal-Mart and a Rite Aid together, you've got to have what is largely the retail market in the US.</p>
          <p>So if you think about that, you have to wonder about the new dynamics, and why does &#x2013; why do these large chains want to drive down price where they did prior. Prior, they always wanted to get advantage over the other chain.</p>
          <p>Now when &#x2013; if you drive down price at one particular location, whether it be in &#x2013; whatever city you're located, whichever chain drives down price, there is effect against everyone. So you don't get to capture that benefit.</p>
          <p>So it's really a perverse incentive. This was something that when this whole theory of AMP was talked about in Washington, we fought against it because we didn't think it was proper &#x2013; the proper incentive. But we'll see what happens. It's very much an open question, and anyone's guess is probably valid at this point.</p>

          <p>Thanks Bill. And lastly, on biosimilars, have there been any &#x2013; any color to offer on regulatory or legal issues with your G-CSF filing? And are you doing anything with EPO in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our file so far on the G-CSF is progressing. I don't think we'll have anything to add on EPO just yet, but we may have something to talk about a little later. But nothing to talk about right now. And we are proceeding down the path as a BLA at this point in time, and not with the ABLA route.</p>
          <p>Again, why would you take the ABLA route, which is very uncertain as to how to go down that path now. And if you look at some of the legal characteristics of how this bill will work, why would I reveal my whole process to the innovator so that they can decide what to sue me on? It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense for us. It's just much simpler for us to go down the path of a BLA.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Just a couple of quick ones.</p>
          <p>First for Eyal, can you give a sense of ratiopharm, how you think they've been reacting in terms of performance to the European price cut environment? And what the run rate of sales would be from ratiopharm in 2010?</p>
          <p>Secondly, for Moshe, can you talk a little bit about, you mentioned clinical trials is your view that you think that's a gold standard for a bioequivalent form of COPAXONE. How do you expect at this point to get your message across to the FDA? Obviously, the citizens' petition route's been tried. What's sort of the next step we should be expecting in dialogue with the agency?</p>
          <p>And finally, can you just talk about what the status is of laquinimod and what the filing target date would be for that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding ratiopharm, I think this is way too early for us to provide an educated answer. We will open the boxes once we complete the acquisition. We will learn, and we will come back to you guys well informed and educated.</p>
          <p>I don't anticipate any material changes. It seems that that business has been running well. But numbers will be provided on a timely basis. It's a private company, as you know. Much less information than when you acquire a publicly traded company. Still viewed in the period before closing as a potential competitor. So the level of detailed information provided to us was naturally limited, and we will study and report.</p>
          <p>But as I said, we don't anticipate surprises. And I think they've been dealing &#x2013; from all we know, they have been dealing well with the environment in Germany and the rest of Europe where they're selling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, David, as far as COPAXONE, based on what we just heard from Ben-Zion and our understanding of COPAXONE and the model, we believe that we will continue our interactions. And we plan to do them with the FDA, and actually demonstrate to them and convince &#x2013; we believe that we convince the FDA that in the case of COPAXONE, it's unavoidable that any generic competitor will need to embark on a clinical study and even on preclinical activities as well.</p>
          <p>As far as laquinimod, as we reported, we have completed the recruitment and the first study. We'll see the results of the first study in the first quarter of 2011. And followed by the result of the second study by the mid of 2011. And if everything goes as we planned, we immediately plan to submit the file. As we have a fast track in the US, we are planning to launch the product by mid 2012.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one follow up. Would you anticipate any type of public forum such as an advisory committee on COPAXONE on the issues that you raised?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That could be one of the scenarios that can take place. I think that the dialogue with the FDA is ongoing. And we believe that based on the recent publication that &#x2013; on the COPAXONE and the mode affection, that this is the case that the FDA will require clinical studies from any follow-on COPAXONE.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions. First couple for Eyal and then I have a couple follow-ups for Bill.</p>
          <p>First off, on cost of goods, can you just help us understand what the impact of foreign exchange was on COGS within the quarter? And then you do provide us with your API sales. Can you provide us with your global generic and branded sales within the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, on COGS, there wasn't major impact on the improvement in COGS that we have seen, mostly a matter of product mix that we have seen. What was the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You give us API sales. Can you possibly provide percent generic and percent branded sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the breakout I don't have under my hand. Regarding API sales, we had a very strong and good quarter on the sales of API actually with growth of 23% year-over-year. And as you know, we stopped publishing this individually as a business unit, but around $163 million for the quarter and 23% growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. For Bill, can you just comment on whether you have launch quantities available on LOVENOX  and your capability of being able to supply the market? Some initial checks would seem to indicate that Momenta, Sandoz might be somewhat capacity constrained. And then the second question just has to do with the Office of Generic Drugs. Seems as though between some patch formulation getting approved, some high profile sustained release preparations and then the LOVENOX  approval, are we seeing a pickup at OGD? Or is this just an anomaly? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, John. As far as launch quantities with respect to Enoxaparin, the answer is yes. We're in good shape, so. We will need the approval, and of course we commented on that earlier. The second question &#x2013; your second question was about the OGD and its activity now and the leadership there. I think on that particular question, I do see them getting bolder and making some very interesting calls and I think that this is really a step in the right direction. There's interim leadership right now in the department and we take our hats off to them for approving an Enoxaparin and proving that they can stand some tough tests. So we think that's really a positive thing at this point in time.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first, you keep talking about the US based business being strong. Can you just give us an indication of is this stronger than last quarter? Is last quarter stronger than the fourth quarter? Is this getting better or is this just, continues to be stable? And maybe you can put some color around that. And then also Canada, obviously we have seen what Canada is going to do to pricing. Give us a flavor for how that's going to impact your business, the business you're about to get from ratiopharm. Should we be assuming that the Canadian sales are going to be down in 2011 versus 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Marc. A couple of points here. The base business is strong. We have done a lot of things to improve our base over the last couple of years, whether it's pruning where we have taken out some of the less profitable products and sell more of the profitable products. We have seen more impact around price increases, just lots and lots of different things. Some of the products that have launched have launched at a little better pricing than it had historically. Some of this can be retraced to the quality concerns, and lots of proactive things going on in our base business.</p>
          <p>So I think that by and large, our base business has been strong for the last few quarters, and continues to be strong. And really there is not much more to say about it than that. Whether you say is that changing from quarter to quarter, remember the way we track our base business, it's products that have been in the market for 2 years. So every quarter an old launch product becomes a base product and of course that changes your numbers somewhat. But it's been a very strong business.</p>
          <p>As far as Canada goes, the Canadian business we continue to believe is going to be strong. Now obviously the effects on the, the effect in the various provinces of the change, especially with respect to Ontario, that's going to have an effect. The idea, though, is the big change is what happens with the chain or the pharmacy itself. You know, in that particular system where they're lowering the reference price, it's not indifferent, by the way, to what's happening in other markets whether you see the US change in AMP or you see the change in Spain. It's really trying &#x2013; the government trying to take something out of the channel. And what they're doing is lowering price, and then you're limiting your back end to the pharmacies themselves.</p>
          <p>So net-net for us, it's not as huge of a change as one might expect. We certainly believe we'll get some pressure from the chains in order to give more on the back end, but at this point in time, we don't see a huge change. It may actually be a net positive for the business as it becomes more difficult for some of the smaller companies to manage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should be assuming Canadian sales in 2011 will be up from '10? I mean, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously with the addition of ratiopharm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excluding the ratiopharm addition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, again, I can't really comment on that until I actually get my hands on the ratio business and I'm able to look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just on your own base business in Canada, you'd expect it to be up next year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our business has been growing and it will continue to grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take this opportunity to follow on because I think that the pricing pressure is kind of a common denominator question all over the globe. I think that the results in Europe, 10% growth is actually the best answer to prove the statement that Teva knows how to operate in a price pressure environment. And this is not just a statement for stating the obvious from our point of view. It's just to say that we know how to leverage our market leadership, how to leverage our scale, and how to leverage our largest ever portfolio and our different lines of business.</p>
          <p>And if you add to that the deep understanding and the know-how in different models of businesses, countries, and healthcare systems, that actually giving in a nutshell the answer how we are managing to continue a profitable journey in pressurized environment, exactly as we did it for many years in the United States. So we believe that this is one of our unique advantages that make us different from part of our peers that we know how to operate and how to make money and even how of course to grow the business under this different business or market environment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just follow on then to that last comment you just made. So if you're continuing to grow in the face of pricing pressure, I guess the only way to do that would be to gain share. And so, A, do you agree with that, and B, since you're the first of the big public companies to report, when the others report, are we going to see that perhaps less robust results? I'm not asking you to comment specifically on their results, but if you're gaining share in volume terms, you have to be gaining it from other players. So is that the right way to think of how you're being so successful in Europe in the face of such pricing pressure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, as a general statement, we would view that market leadership is about getting market share. And we said it many times in the past that our strategy is to gain more market share. There is only 1 caveat to your way of posing the question. I do believe that in certain markets, definitely Europe is a good geography for that, that we can also see larger pie, or actually see more market, or potential market as the European markets, at least some of them, the level of the generic penetration is relatively low compared to a market like US or let's call it generic developed countries in Europe. So there is still more room to grow generics, and therefore we are so optimist on the business in Europe not only by taking the market share for our competitors, but also by growing the overall market for generics in Europe and some other countries in the world as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got that. And for Bill, I think I got the message, but I sensed fairly extreme optimism on your own generic LOVENOX, and can you elaborate even more on maybe your interactions with the FDA discussions? Is it really nothing more than checking all the boxes that they put out in their response to the CP and just finishing up their review of your immunogenicity data that you mentioned?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Corey, it's hard for me to say much more. We have dialogue with the agency. We believe we have first of all, we've looked at the citizens' petition, and we believe that we meet all the criteria on the citizens' petition. Our dialogue with the agency says that our review is going nicely, and we're just waiting for a couple &#x2013; we're just waiting for an answer. So we feel that we're in a good position, but again it's up to the FDA to decide, not me.</p>

          <p>Just before the next question, just one more follow on, on the COPAXONE as it's become the major subject in this conference call. To add on comments, to add to what we all answered in this respect, one is just to remind you that about a third of our COPAXONE sales is in non-US markets, which the whole discussion that we are involved in is less relevant for this 1 billion growing business.</p>
          <p>The second comment is regarding the oral therapies as kind of food for thought, I would like to take the TYSABRI case study for you, and you can look in retrospective which reminds a little bit the next oral therapies.
