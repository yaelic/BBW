        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Despite the gloomy weather, the Moscow traffic, people have made it to the office. We're happy to see you here at our quarterly presentation of the financial results of the nine months of 2011. Each year brings us closer to the reporting date, and an assignment for our financial accounting is to keep up with the schedule with our foreign competitors just like in the same pace as they are moving. You all have seen the press release. Let me go straight to the key financials.</p>
          <p>Is anyone going to be browsing the presentation? Let's bring up the first slide. This is required by the lawyers, the forward-looking statement. The key financials are next. Just as before, year 2011 is the best year, continues to be the best one in all of the company's history. We are showing a very high level of EBITDA growth by 28%. Net income has grown by 32% to nine months 2010. It should be even higher, but we have written off over $500 million through currency translation and we have also written off one of the dry wells, non-commercial. Basic earnings per share grew by 42% to $11.55. Net income per barrel of oil equivalent of production $15.4, plus 39%, and free cash flow has reached a level of $7,712 million, which is higher by 11%.</p>
          <p>Macroeconomics and tax environment; Brent crude price has grown by almost 44%; diesel fuel, gasoline has grown more or less the same, to the same degree. In Russia, gasoline growth has been by only 23%. The mineral resource extraction tax has grown by 55.8%. I would like to focus your attention on the fact that the new tax regime, 60-66, only started to be in force in October. So it's not yet included in the reporting figures. It will only be seen in the fourth quarter figures.</p>
          <p>Main operating results look as follows. Sales have grown by 22.2%, refined product sales by 7.4%. Oil export operations have decreased. This is because of a declined production rate by 4.7% hydrocarbon production. We hope that this is the last year where we see a decreased level of production in Western Siberia. We already see that we're reaching a stable level of production, and in 2012 we'll be incrementing production.</p>
          <p>Also, this is also influenced by the fact that we are concentrating on sales in Russia, which is more economically attractive. The company is raising high-octane gasoline production. This is mainly because there is a strong demand. Despite all claims by experts, the company is not decreasing refining volumes. The margin remains stable high, and you can see that by 600,000 tons we have increased production of high-octane gasoline to 4.7 million tons. This is the highest volume of production of refining, and we hope that we will be able to maintain this output. In the nearest future, we will be discussing, namely on December 1, we expect that the amount of high-octane gasoline produced in Russian refineries will increase by 70%.</p>
          <p>Financial results, almost all of them are positive. You can see here sales income, operating expenses have increased. LUKOIL is a number two taxpayer Russia, a little behind Rosneft, significantly ahead of all other companies, including Gazprom. Net income has reached $2.244 billion, which is higher if you look at the nine months previous year.</p>
          <p>You can see here a sharp growth of profit tax in the third quarter. This is a one-off effect reflecting revaluation of currency translation rates for the currencies on the balance sheet of the company, because U.S. dollar appreciation against the ruble reached 13%, and over $500 million was currency exchange gain, which led to a $340 million tax payment. If the exchange rate reverses, we will get the mirror effect. The company will get back most of the taxes paid in the third quarter in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As far as I understand, this is not a very typical situation for the European and American accounting system. It is unique for Russia, which is a relic that we have gotten as a legacy from the earlier times. We hope that the Ministry of Finance will change this situation, because it significantly distorts reporting and does create negative impulses for the development of the company. If you look at quarterly net income reconciliation, you will see reevaluation of the ruble cash position in Russia is at $196 million. You can see that tax on currency translation gain is $340 million, and also two dry wells in Ghana are also shown here. One of them was dry; the other was not providing the required flow rate.</p>
          <p>As for the operating expenses, hydrocarbon lifting costs have increased by only 12%. Own refining expenses has increased a little bit because of better conversion ratio with higher output of light products. Electricity, power generation and distribution expenses are pretty much the same. We launched a refinery in <mark type="ph" /> Kalosh (9:36).</p>
          <p>Other expenses have been under the control of our company. If you look at the operating expenses graph, you will see that they only have grown by 11.2% compared to the third quarter previous year. Lifting costs only increased in third quarter 2011 by 10.6%. Another characteristic of the period is appreciation of ruble. In the previous quarter, the situation was reversed. Due to this lifting costs decreased a little bit by $0.18 compared to second quarter this year. On the whole, operating expenses increase lies in greater refining costs, own refining costs and power generation and distribution costs by 1.5%. Transportation costs have decreased, as well as other expenses.</p>
          <p>Transportation, commercial, administrative costs, they are also within the budget. Some of the factors are negative, such as transportation expenses, our monopolies and then Transnefteproduct. Transneft are increasing their tariffs. At the same time, freight expenses have decreased by 16%, as you can see from the graph, because of the significant amount of crude oil sold in the tankers. These proposals have been exhausted and freight proposals are pretty favorable. General and administrative costs have been within 11% because of the current inflation rate.</p>
          <p>Net income reconciliation, the most effect comes from greater export duty, NTPI, which is higher for us as compared to Rosneft. Also depreciation, profit tax because of the factors that I mentioned earlier, including the currency translation difference. On the whole, we have the highest profits over three quarters in the whole history of the company. We believe that our annual profit will also be a record level for our company</p>
          <p>Cash flow reconciliation; capital expenses, dividend payments, loans buyback have been the factors. Despite this, the cash on the company's accounts are at the level of $4.44 billion. The company has never had such a significant amount of own cash. The company continues to increase free cash flow, over the period it has reached $7.7 billion. This speaks for the fact that the company continues to be high performance, has potential for rapid development, for investing heavily in the most profitable areas of our operations.</p>
          <p>Capital expenses; most capital expenses are allocated for exploration and production. Overall, these investments have been increased by 30%, recording 33% increase in Russia. Refining and marketing remains pretty much at the same level as last year, as these are less profitable areas of our operations. At the same time, international investments have been raised by 18%. Russian levels are more or less the same. We are completing the investment program that was started after the purchase of TGK-8.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures show us here that the company is in line with the strategy of investing in the most profitable projects in upstream and Russian high complexity refineries with high levels of free cash flow for the company and high performance.</p>
          <p>Talking about the latest events in the past quarter worth attention, I must mention that we have been successful in geological exploration in Russia. We discovered the East <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:07) field in Komi. The resources in the second well are at 150,000 to 200,000 barrels. This is a very promising field, but 1,000 barrels per day is the target production rate. In Komi second one after <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:34) field, we believe that we will have similar discoveries in the nearest future, because we have a so-called reef structure in this province.</p>
          <p>We are completing drilling <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:58) structure in Kazakhstan second exploration well has been drilled. We are pretty confident that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:09) field are the same structure, and we believe that we will have additional 200 &#x2013; 250 million barrels of oil equivalent increase. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:25) was previously viewed as only a gas structure. Now we believe that we will also be producing oil from it; liquid hydrocarbons have been found here. I cannot yet say anything specific about the volumes, but they look like they are significant.</p>
          <p>Speaking of West Africa; unfortunately, the two wells have not yielded good results. The first well promised about 136 million barrels of oil equipment, but Chita X1 wells look different. The first well show tight oil, difficult to extract oil; the second well was dry. We are completing another well. This well discovered gas-bearing sands. Any more specific data will be provided later after analysis of well logs. Hydrocarbons are there. Whether it's gas or gas and liquids, we will see later.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to drill exploration wells at Albacore. It is near <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:04) discovered by the company <mark type="ph" /> Torol (19:09) that is located at the distance of several kilometers from ours. More detailed information will be available in January. Other big events include our negotiations with the Ministry of Oil in Iraq, and we hope that the contracts, the EPC contracts for this field will be approved by the Ministry of Oil, and starting in 2012 we will be building infrastructure for West Qurna-2 fields, a significant resource for the company.</p>
          <p>The company's strong financial status allowed us to decrease our debt despite the buyback, unprecedented buyback of our shares. And you can see that the company's loan has decreased by $1.3 billion. It is important for the company, because we see high volatility in the markets and we think that the markets will continue to remain unstable for quite some time. So having this cushion is one of the priorities for us.</p>
          <p>LUKOIL has been demonstrating the best results in the Russian oil industry. Over the nine months period the company has the best EBITDA per barrel of hydrocarbon production among our competitors. We also have the same best figure for net profit per barrel and the highest free cash flow among the companies reporting under international standards. Despite this, LUKOIL remains one of the leaders in terms of finance over the three quarters. We can see that LUKOIL has very good figures among the oil majors in terms of production rate, and cash flow were pretty competitive. If you look at our capitalization, LUKOIL is very low. It cannot go any cheaper. In fact, in terms of the financial policy we continue to pursue the following.</p>
          <p>We will be concentrated on investment policy targeting development and exploration and production segment. We'll continue modernization, increase efficiency, and maintain conservative financial policy and strong financial discipline. The company is finishing the work on the strategy for the nearest 10 years. We hope that Board of Directors approves our strategy. It will be a strategy that will be built of projects just as a building is built from bricks. All of the projects will be demonstrated for performance. We will make a presentation of our strategy. Our consultants say that people would be much interested in financial results. It may follow after Christmas.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. Questions, please. Please take the mic.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for the presentation. Vadim Mitroshin from Otkritie Capital. Going back to Africa &#x2013; Ghana, is it correct to say that you will complete drilling of two offshore wells before the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just for your understanding, there are gas indications; there is luminance in the sensors. Further analysis will require well logs. It will take some time. All I can say is that in Ghana first well was very good, the second one was satisfactory; the third one was dry, it's written off. We will be drilling another well to better understand how we can commercialize the resource. As for Ivory Coast, the first one revealed vast resources of hydrocarbons. Commercialization opportunities will be a question of the future, but we are on the whole very optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back to Ghana, do you have any obligations for next year, for example, to drill a certain amount of wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't only have obligations; we want to drill more wells, because we know that there are reserves. It's only a question of mobility; it's only question of horizons. In the first well we have put on the balance sheet 136 million barrels of oil equivalent; second well was on that brim, so to speak, of the field. And it is worth mentioning that there are five types of reservoirs in Ghana, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:50), Jurassic, other layers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the total number of wells you're planning for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I cannot tell you yet. At least, this will be between two and four.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question on the financials -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This will only be concerning the Savanna structure in Sierra Leone, but that's a different place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Speaking of the financial results, the impressive free cash flow over the nine months, it is clear that &#x2013; it's almost end of the year, the fourth quarter will be also good. The profit growth has been more than 40%. Do you believe that it will be possible to say that shareholders will receive a 40% increase in dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, hopefully, we will certainly increase the proportion of dividends. The dividends can be no less than 15% of the net profit. Whether they will be higher than 15%, it is a question of priorities. The company will be incurring large investments in 2012-2013, so we will decide later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:31) Bloomberg. The production of gas has also decreased, and the reason for this was because of the lower demand in international projects. Could you expand on the situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't quite understand the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Gazprom is buying less gas from Uzbekistan. Maybe Shah Deniz production has decreased.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I correctly understand your question, you are talking about international projects. We do have a certain decrease from Uzbekistan, as Gazprom is selling directly to China. As you know, a new agreement has been signed between Gazprom Uzbekistan and China. There is also a small decrease because of the negotiations between the consortium working in Shah Deniz and the government of Turkey regarding the delivery of 6 million cubic meters of gas. Turkey has a very wide area of proposals of gas. They currently see a small decline there too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Before the end of the year, LUKOIL and Rosneft were to define joint projects. Have you decided where you will be cooperating, upstream, downstream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not yet found anything that could unite our companies here. We have a number of joint projects in gas sales. We are at present cooperating in the gas sales sector in Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:58). Yes, please. You announced over the first quarter results $1.8 billion acquisitions. When are we going to have any concrete results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are in the process yet. There is confidentiality agreement. I cannot yet say anything. I cannot yet tell you whether the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:30) has died or recovered. It is a process that is lengthy. And it's a question of price. We don't want to buy at any cost, that's the message. Any more questions?</p>
          <p>We have another question from the Internet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you explain what the dry wells in Ghana mean for your company as a whole? What will be the next steps in this region?</p>
          <p>Well, the wells are dry. Any time you drill a well, you're running a risk of getting a dry well. The trap is looking good, but we've found some wet sands. Some indications say that it's a continuation of the <mark type="ph" /> ZATO (31:44) structure. However, the well logs show us that the levels of hydrocarbons are lower than in the first well, and it takes modern technologies to run a good assessment of whether these will be an attractive commercial project.</p>
          <p>We have discovered seven structures. We are preparing a third structure for drilling. All of these structures have different levels of geological reserves. Naturally, we are not happy with our results. We are, on the contrary, disappointed, but it's always a risk. You probably all know that in the North Sea, they drilled 30 wells before they found oil. In West Siberia, the situation is even more indicative. We hope that Ivory Coast drilling will be more optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:06), Dow Jones. What is the level of production you expect next year? CapEx is remaining at $8.5 billion. How much of this amount will be invested in West Siberia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect next year a small growth. West Siberian managers are promising stabilization for next year. We can see in daily production amounts that the curve is leveling out. We believe that 2011 has been the last year of declining production. In the nearest years CapEx will be growing. Budget has not yet been finally approved, but the budget will be over $8 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You already mentioned that CapEx will be over $8.5 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be higher than $8 billion. We will be making investments in two large projects next year. We will be executing E&amp;C contracts in West Qurna in the quarter, and our investments will be over $4 billion. We will be accelerating West Qurna, because we don't want to lose income. I already mentioned that as we present our program for the 10-year period until 2021, we will talk about this in detail.</p>
