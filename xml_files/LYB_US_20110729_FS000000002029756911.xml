          <p>Hello and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Welcome to LyondellBasell's Second Quarter 2011 Teleconference. And I'm joined today by Jim Gallogly, our CEO; Kent Potter, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.</p>
          <p>Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our web site at www.lyondellbasell.com. I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and the actual risk could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statements in the presentation slide and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyondelbasell.com/investorrelations.</p>
          <p>A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures together with any other applicable disclosures including the earnings release are currently available on our web site www.lyondellbasell.com. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1pm.Eastern time today until 1pm Eastern time on August 29, by calling 800-510-9771 in the United States and 402-334-6800 outside the United States, and the pass code for both numbers is 4765.</p>
          <p>During today's call we'll focus on second quarter of 2011's performance, the current environment and the near-term outlook.</p>
          <p>And with that being said, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompany this call and are available on our web site. Let's begin by turning to page four to review a few financial highlights.</p>
          <p>Second-quarter results were strong. In fact, it was the best quarter that we've ever posted with earnings per share of $1.38. Our year-to-date earnings per share were $2.56, a very nice start to the year. Adjusted for various items noted in our earnings release, this increases to $2.74 per share.</p>
          <p>Our second-quarter EBITDA surpassed $1.5 billion, bringing the first half EBITDA to almost $3 billion. Not only did we have a great first half and a record second-quarter, we also had a nice balance across the period. Our portfolio performed well month-to-month. This was due in part to solid operations during the quarter. We finished our largest turnaround in company history at Channelview, a major activity during which we had more than 2000 contractors on-site at the peak. The plan restarted in late June and is operating well. This scheduled downtime negatively impacted our EBITDA by about $75 million. We also had about two weeks of unscheduled downtime at our Morris, Illinois site. The downtime was causes by multiple lightening strikes at the facilities of our third-party power provider. This adversely impacted the quarter results by approximately $25 million.</p>
          <p>Good, steady operations generally go hand in hand with good safety performance. On page five, you can see that our safety performance continues to be excellent. However, within the quarter we experienced a number of isolated and generally minor injuries. To help bring focus to safety, we held our second company contractor and supplier Global Safety Day. All of our 50-plus sites participated in this event. Our company goal is safety perfection.</p>
          <p>In summary we had a great quarter. Through investments in our assets and our systematic approach to all aspects of our business we have made great progress and established a solid foundation. The first half of the year was a good example and a performance that we'll build upon.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the call over to Kent to discuss our financial performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jim and thank you all for joining us today. As Jim said the second quarter was another strong quarter. On slide six, we have charted the EBITDA by segment for both the second quarter and our year-to-date results. I won't step through each segment as Jim will do so in significant detail, but I do want to stress a few points, some of which Jim has already mentioned.</p>
          <p>I first want to underline the strength of the second quarter and our six months results. EBITDA for the six-month period falls just shy of $3 billion. Consider that each of the four large segments were individually generating EBITDA that when annualized with would equal or surpass $1 billion. Olefins and Polyolefins Americas alone operated at an annualized pace of more than $2 billion.</p>
          <p>Second, I want to emphasize the consistency of our results across the period. Our results have been reasonably steady across most segments and the Refining &amp; Oxyfuel businesses have followed normal seasonal trends.</p>
          <p>I also need to point out that we recorded several charges and credits during the first half of the year. Among these were, credits of $75 million for the cumulative impact of an insurance recovery and profit from the sale of silver and spent catalyst. Offsetting, charges of $190 million related to combination of marking our outstanding warrants to market prices, reorganization and severance accruals, debt restructuring costs and environmental legal approvals. The combined after-tax impact these items was a charge of $43 million during the first quarter and a charge of $62 million during the second quarter. The details can be found in our press release.</p>
          <p>Finally as Jim mentioned, we were also impacted by an estimated $150 million in pre-tax opportunity cost related to the downtime associated with our major turnaround activity.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to slides seven and eight, and I'll cover some of the key elements to our cash flow. During the second quarter, we generated $554 million of excess cash, building our cash balance to $4.9 billion. I'll touch on a few of the components in these cash flows.</p>
          <p>First, exclusive of working capital changes, our operations generated $1.1 billion of cash. Included in this figure were a few significant payments, including $120 million for interest and $330 million of income tax payments.</p>
          <p>Working capital consumed approximately $50 million as Brent crude oil prices averaged $117 per barrel during the quarter, versus $105 during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The next slide addresses the changes in the key components of working capital. However, there is nothing unusual in the results to justify special mention this quarter. During the quarter, we continued to reduce our debt paying down an additional $250 million or 8% bonds. We also paid our first dividend, $0.10 per share or approximately $55 million.</p>
          <p>Capital spending during the quarter was approximately $260 million bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $480 million. This is somewhat below our targeted spending pace but I anticipate that full-year spending will be between $1 billion to $1.2 billion, depending on certain timing considerations.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side of the chart, you can see our cash generation since emerging from <mark type="ph" /> bankruptcy (8:23). Since then we've added $2.2 billion to our cash balance, while reducing our debt by $1.4 billion, and paying our first dividend. On June 30, our total cash balance was $4.9 billion, liquidity was $7.1 billion and our net debt had declined to approximately $900 million.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we closed a couple of financings I'd like to explain. First, we refinanced our asset backed revolver facility. Through this refinancing we extended the term to 2016, expanded the facility size to $2 billion, reduce the fees and interest rates considerably and amended and modified covenants to add flexibility as we advance our financing strategy. We also put in place a new agreement which reduces the costs of letters of credits.</p>
          <p>And you may have noticed that we've not included our balance sheet in our earnings release. We've identified certain errors associated with our bankruptcy-related tax positions, and related accounting that will result in a revision to our April 30, 2010, emergence balance sheet deferred tax liabilities. However, the revisions will not change net income either in the predecessor period or the period since emergence. Of course our balance sheets will be available in our upcoming 10-Q filing after our revisions are finalized. I want to emphasize that these revisions relate to our emergence balance sheet and will not affect income or cash flow. Our EBITDA, earnings, EPS and cash flow will not change from amounts previously reported.</p>
          <p>And before I turn the call back to Jim, I want to speak about our joint venture reporting. Joint ventures are a very significant part of our company and I want to ensure that their value is fully appreciated.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide nine, as I believe it will help me make my point. On the left-hand side of the chart, I've including information that provides perspective of our individual joint ventures.</p>
          <p>Let's discuss the drivers of a few of the key joint ventures. First our Saudi venture sells product into Asia &#x2013; our Saudi ventures sell product into Asia, while benefiting from large scale, the latest production technology and cost advantaged raw materials including ethane and propane.</p>
          <p>Similarly, in Asia one of our key ventures, HMC enjoys many of the same benefits of the Saudi ventures converting the locally-priced propane into polypropylene. In Mexico our Indelpro joint venture enjoys a raw material advantage as it upgrades refinery-grade propylene to polymer-grade propylene and then polypropylene. Given the tightness in the North American propylene market, this has been a significant advantage.</p>
          <p>Finally, our joint-venture in Poland operates with some of the newest polymer technology while benefiting from raw material supply from our partner's olefin production. In summary, our ownership of these ventures represents 4 billion pounds of equivalent polyolefin capacity, which typically operates with advantaged raw materials. They also service growing markets with the newest technologies available.</p>
          <p>Many of the ventures such as the Saudi Arabian plants are new while the other such as Indelpro and HMC have recently been expanded. Hence their future potential exceeds historic results. In general these ventures are structured to distribute excess cash to the owners and do so periodically during the year. Some typically pay dividends quarterly while others pay annually. For the first six months of 2011, our joint ventures have generated $131 million of equity income &#x2013; our share &#x2013; and paid $107 million of dividends.</p>
          <p>We are aware that many of you use EBITDA multiples to value our company. In our EBITDA presentation, we include cash dividends that we receive from our joint ventures rather than equity income. This approach is typical in high-yield financing as it represents <mark type="ph" /> immediate (12:20) cash flow. However, I believe that it underestimates the value of these ventures. My basis for this belief is that dividends are paid out of net income &#x2013; that is after all financing tax expense. Therefore an EBIT multiple applied to dividends is not consistent. Rather, I would propose that the JVs should be valued based on equity income and a typical price to earnings multiple.</p>
          <p>On the upper right-hand side of this chart, we have provided our 2010 and annualized year-to-date joint venture equity income and dividends. In the chart on the lower right, we have valued the JVs based on three approaches.</p>
          <p>First, we plotted the book value of the JVs as defined last year in our emergence plan. This value was derived from the discounted cash flow of the then-current forecast, a forecast which is proving to have been quite conservative. In the second column, we apply a multiple of five to both our last 12 months of dividends and our annualized first half of 2011 dividend. This methodology results in a joint-venture valuation between $600 million and $1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the column on the right, I applied a multiple of 11 to the last 12 month and annualized first half 2011 equity incomes. The resulting joint-venture valuation using this methodology is between $2.1 billion and $2.9 billion. The multiples I've chosen are representative of general chemical industry multiples. I don't mean to suggest that you apply these multiples; I have simply selected multiples that reflect recent trading levels.</p>
          <p>The point that I want to make is that the use of an EBITDA multiple significantly undervalues the shares of our ventures. Based on the examples I have presented, I suggest that the EBITDA multiple approach undervalues the JVs by more than $1.5 billion, or $3 a share.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Now I'll return the call to Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Kent. Let's step through a summary of second-quarter results for each of our businesses. Page 10 addresses the key results for the Olefins and Polyolefins America segments. The second quarter continued a string of strong quarterly results, EBITDA of $578 million. It was approximately $95 million more than the corresponding first-quarter result.</p>
          <p>Within the segment, Olefins EBITDA improved by approximately $130 million. The key drivers of the improvement were increased prices and margins. Our production volumes declined versus the first quarter primarily due to the scheduled turnaround of one of our Channelview Olefin plants and the Morris downtime. Our margin increased by approximately $0.07 a pound as ethylene price increased by $0.09 a pound. Partially offsetting this increase was a $0.02 per pound increase to our cost &#x2013; our ethylene cost of production metric.</p>
          <p>Raw material cost increased significantly as crude oil based feedstock cost increased by $11 per barrel and Gulf Coast ethane increased by $0.12 a gallon. The majority of these raw material increases were offset by increased co-product prices with the net result being the modest increase in the cost of production method &#x2013; metric. Examples of the co-product price increases experienced quarter include propylene up $0.11 a pound, butadiene up $0.36 a pound and gasoline blending stocks up approximately $0.50 a gallon.</p>
          <p>As a result, the second quarter cost of ethylene production from crude oil based feedstock declined versus the first quarter. Additionally, we benefited from our advantaged position in the Midwest, where ethane cost increased by only $0.07 per gallon, rather than the $0.12 increase on the Gulf Coast where most industry capacity resides. Approximately 80% of our second quarter ethylene production was derived from natural gas liquids. Overall Olefin results were very strong particularly when one considers that we operated for the majority of the period with one of the Channelview olefin plants in turnaround.</p>
          <p>Our polyethylene results declined by approximately $50 million versus the first quarter, as price increases did not keep pace with the ethylene increases. As a result, spreads declined by approximately $0.02 a pound. Volumes declined slightly in part due to our internal maintenance schedule, but also due to customer buying patterns.</p>
          <p>Polypropylene results improved by approximately $10 million and sales volumes increased by about 5%, while margins were unchanged.</p>
          <p>Late in the second quarter, certain product prices declined, most notably polyethylene. Despite this decline, thus far third quarter ethylene chain margins have been good. Our ethylene plants are running near full rates. Current spot ethylene price to support our belief that we will benefit later in the year when several producers execute turnarounds.</p>
          <p>Let's page forward to slide 11 and turn our attention to Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International. This segment also had a strong quarter with EBITDA of $275 million. This was approximately $60 million less than the first quarter EBITDA, as increases in our underlying 100% owned operations were offset by an approximate $90 million decline in joint venture dividend receipts and approximately $16 million for accruals that Kent mentioned.</p>
          <p>Absent these items, our underlying second quarter EBITDA was approximately $336 million versus $240 million in the first quarter. To build on Kent's previous discussion, I should mention that our second quarter equity income was $73 million versus $58 million during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Similar to the Americas segment, Olefins was a source of strength during the quarter. Olefins EBITDA increased by approximately $95 million as both cracker and butadiene recovery margins increased.</p>
          <p>The margin improvement resulted from increased ethylene chain margins and various butadiene prices. The crackers contributed slightly more than half of the sequential improvement. Butadiene recovery continued to represent approximately half of the Olefins' profit. Olefin production volumes were relatively unchanged versus the first quarter, while increasing by 20% versus the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Within polymers, our results improved by approximately $10 million. Polyethylene results remained generally steady across the quarter. Combined polypropylene and polypropylene compounding results improved moderately. Polypropylene volumes declines were in line with the industry. Of note, our polypropylene compound volumes were unchanged despite the uncertainty around automotive production following the Japanese earthquake.</p>
          <p>Early in the third quarter, European trends are similar to those in the U.S. market, as industry chain margins have declined from the strong second quarter levels. However, ethylene chain margins have been greater than first quarter levels, and we're seeing positive price movements in the Asian markets. Over the coming weeks, it will become clear whether this signals an end to the recent soft patch.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 12 for a discussion of the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $313 million, $43 million greater than the first quarter results. This improvement includes a $41 million gain from the sale of silver and spent catalyst. Within the segment the propylene oxide and derivatives area results declined, volumes declined with the end of the aircraft deicer season while margins were relatively unchanged.</p>
          <p>Our Intermediates products continued to post good results as increased margins led to improved acetyls and styrene results. Independent of the gain from the silver sale ethylene glycol and TBA intermediates continued to post strong results, which were relatively unchanged &#x2013; first quarter. The markets for these products and our operations in these areas have been very good. The Intermediates &amp; Derivatives segment has been a strong steady performer and is expected to remain so in the near future.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to page 13, I'd like to discuss the Refining and Oxyfuels segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $353 million, a $144 million increase versus the first quarter, which included the benefit from the $34 million insurance settlement. The Houston refinery EBITDA increased by approximately $135 million as it benefited from both increased industry margins and strong operating rates, following the first quarter fluid catalytic cracker turnaround. Our cat cracker is running very well and is exceeding our design expectations.</p>
          <p>Second quarter crude rates exceeded 260,000 barrels per day, reaching 280,000 barrels per day at times. Compared to the first quarter, the industry benchmark Maya 211 spread increased by approximately $2 per barrel. The corresponding metric for our facility increased by several dollars more, as we continued to secure advantage crudes and benefited from our marketing efforts and product mix.</p>
          <p>I'd like to take a minute to speak about crude oil prices as there may be some confusion regarding the price of West Texas Immediate WTI crude relative to other light crudes. WTI price has been depressed, due to logistical limitations in the Midwest coupled with increased crude production from the Dakotas, the Rockies, and Canada. Essentially, crude oil is long in this region and thus price has depressed relative to global prices.</p>
          <p>In order to better understand and reflect the spread between heavy and light crudes on the Gulf Coast, we have graphed the 2011 data based on Light Louisiana Sweet or LLS crude as a better representation of the benefit derived from our Houston refinery assets.</p>
          <p>The Berre Refinery continued to post a loss as results declined by approximately $10 million versus the first quarter. Industry conditions continued to pressure results as naphtha prices lagged both crude and gasoline prices. Additionally, crude costs were elevated as a result of the Libyan political situation. During the quarter, we chose to limit crude runs due to economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Oxyfuel results improved by approximately $50 million this quarter. This is consistent with seasonal trends and it is attributed to both improved margins and volumes. The benchmark margin that we follow and report improved by approximately $0.35 per gallon.</p>
          <p>I would also mention that our shipments of ETBE to Japan continued throughout the quarter without interruption.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the industry benchmarks on the slide, conditions in this segment have remained strong essentially equivalent to second quarter levels. As Houston refinery has been operating at full capacity, we're realizing the expected benefits from our FCC turnaround, and believe that we're well positioned to take advantage of this environment.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide 14 and the Technology segment. This segment posted second quarter EBITDA of $42 million. Catalyst results remained excellent. Licensing results declined relative to first quarter when we benefited from ongoing payments related to earlier activities. Results included an approximate $15 million accrual related to the relocation of our Newtown Square Pennsylvania Research Center.</p>
          <p>Let's step back from the details and summarize the environment on page 15. Our second-quarter results were the best we've ever recorded. And as a result, during the first half of year, we generated EBITDA of almost $3 billion. Late in the quarter, we saw some relaxing of polyethylene volumes and prices. However, this followed very high margins realized early in the quarter.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> I don't think this is a (25:20) longer term concern and for the most part, I believe that it was driven by inventory adjustments as energy prices began to fall. In fact, during the past few weeks, we have seen the Asian market already began to recover. This is typical of an inventory correction and a buying behavior that we've witnessed in the past within the Asian markets. Unfortunately, it's impossible to define the duration or severity of these adjustments. The uncertainties around global events have made it that much more difficult to quantify.</p>
          <p>Regardless of this volatility, the fundamentals that support our business have remained intact. Low natural gas cost relative to crude oil create a global advantage for our U.S. olefin operations. Our European business has performed well, driven by our strong technology and asset position coupled with global olefin co-product tightness. In the refining area, our Houston refinery is highly competitive and it's clearly beginning to demonstrate it's earnings power.</p>
          <p>Across the company, our second quarter operations were solid. We completed a large critical turnaround at our Channelview olefins complex. We continue to invest in reliability and efficiency improvement projects across the company and as always cost management remains a key aspect of everything we do.</p>
          <p>We're working aggressively to restructure staffs within our European operations to further improve our competitiveness. We're consulting local works councils to finalize plans. We're also optimizing our U.S. R&amp;D efforts. We have taken accruals in the quarter related to these items. I should also mention that our global employee head count currently stands at 13,900, a reduction of 3,300 since we initiated our efforts three years ago and 600 below the year ago level.</p>
          <p>Our corporate governance efforts are also moving forward. During the quarter, we had four new directors to our supervisory board. The board now has majority of independent members with six such directors out of a total of 11. With the board now fully constituted, we're positioned to conduct the discussions and debates which will serve as a foundation for our longer term strategic, investment and financial plans.</p>
          <p>As Kent mentioned, we continued to move our capital structure forward. During the quarter we reduced our debt, restructured our revolving credit facility and paid our first dividend. We also advanced the projects that I discussed during our last call, and is outlined in the final slide in this presentation. It's premature to report specific information on these efforts, but I will say that the engineering is progressing rapidly and I'm very encouraged that we have wonderful growth opportunities with excellent returns.</p>
          <p>Our Channelview and La Porte crackers are already highly competitive. Following de-bottlenecks, they will clearly be world-class. I hope that it is apparent that we are beginning to operate on all cylinders. Our result are reflecting this fact and our successes today are allowing us to turn more of our attention and resources toward the longer term. I stated a couple of years ago that we will have to earn the right to grow. We are now at that point.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your past and future support. Sherry, we'd be happy to take questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer-session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from P. J. Juvekar of Citibank. Your line is open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. A couple of questions Jim, can you talk first a little bit about polyethylene, how much are you exporting and did you see any slowdown in those exports?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, P.J. let me comment on that. We'd mentioned there was a little bit of softness at the end of the period. You recall that we previously indicated that we significantly changed our polyethylene portfolio. A couple of years ago, we were exporting about 30% of which about half was to Asia. Today, we export very little from the United States to Asia, of course our Middle East production primarily goes to Asia. We export 10% to 15% generally to South America and that continues. So some of that softness in Asia that we saw didn't impact us that much in the U.S., simply because we repositioned our selling patterns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And second you talked about the right to grow, you mentioned condo cracker, I was just wondering if Kent or Sergey can talk about how you are looking at build versus buy decisions? And are acquisitions off limit at this point and are you looking only to either brownfield or greenfield expansions?</p>

          <p>Well, first, I want to point out that our primary emphasis will be on de-bottlenecks of our existing assets. We've got some very large, very competitive crackers already at Channelview and at La Porte. And we're seeing the opportunity to significantly de-bottleneck those plants. Those brownfield-type investments will have much better returns we believe than greenfield. So we're looking first and foremost to de-bottlenecks. And when I say de-bottlenecks, potentially fairly significant de-bottlenecks. As I said, these could be absolutely world-class crackers in size.</p>
          <p>So that work is ongoing. We're doing it at a very fast pace. We're expecting to get some detailed engineering in soon, so that's moving ahead full speed. We're also looking at potentially greenfield investments. After the announcement we made last quarter in the earnings call, we've already been contacted by a couple of parties and said, you'd make a great partner, maybe we ought to discuss this. We will look at those opportunities. We'll see what the economics are and then decide from that point. But again, the priority is first and foremost on the highly leveraged de-bottlenecks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Jim, it seems like these ethane prices in the U.S. continue to stay stubbornly high and I know in the past you've implied maybe you could put a little pressure on the suppliers by looking at building your own. You've got an awful a lot of cash and it wouldn't be very expensive. So is there any potential that you could actually get closer to maybe building your own fractionator?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, that's a good point. At this point in time, ethane prices are elevated. That's in part because most of the large crackers are running well. There are a couple &#x2013; actually a few smaller crackers at this moment that have hiccups that are working through a few issues. But generally, because everybody is running pretty hard, that balance favors the folks that are fractionating.</p>
          <p>Now when we get into the heavier turnaround season that we expect this fall that is likely to change. Having said all of that, we remain open to the concept if necessary of building our own fractionation. We know that there is some capacity that's coming on about 40,000 barrels per day from Enterprise that I think comes on late in December. Targa has got another 40,000 barrels per day, I think, early in the second quarter. There are some various things that are talked about in the Marcellus maybe in 2012, another 100,000 barrels per day. So we see quite a bit of capacity coming in, but we remain open to good financial opportunities for the company.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, and if I might follow-up for Kent, you gave an interesting analysis of your JVs and a belief I guess that you're getting short changed by the market. Is it possible you could also give us a sense of what the proportional EBITDA, proportional debt so we can look at it on a pre-tax basis?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, some of that is changing too, Bob. One of issues that we see is as these joint ventures start-up, pass all their completion tests and all that, we generally have been successful in refinancing. And so some of that is changing. In case of Al-Waha we'll be doing that I think. So, no I really can't give you of those numbers today.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. If you could, I know it's early and there is a lot of planning yet, but roughly speaking, how much should we expect CapEx to be up for you guys in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Duffy, we'd been saying that we would generally spend about $1 billion a year in base capital and modest growth. As we start to work these other projects that's going to increase. And I would expect that we ramp up maybe a couple hundred million dollars next year and then we'll see after that depending upon the size of these projects that we're looking at. There is various things that we're considering in overall scope for those cracker bottlenecks; we talked about the propylene oxide expansion. Most of this heavy spending doesn't happen in the first or second year, it happens after you get the permits and a couple years after that. So for the next year or two, you won't see a significant ramp up, but you will see a ramp up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then what are the chances that a decent amount of your expansion will happen kind of via your JVs, is they room to expand those meaningfully or will most of it happen with wholly-owned assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the things that we are looking at in the United States are wholly-owned assets other than a potential condo cracker. That of course should be in the partnership by definition. In Asia and in the Middle East, several of those facilities as Kent mentioned have already been de-bottlenecked. They are well positioned to go ahead and as naphtha in Asia becomes more competitive as the cycle starts to turn in our favor, those will run at higher capacities and that's all upside. We would like to de-bottleneck some in the Middle East, but it will depend on feedstock availability. The Middle East as you know is extremely competitive. There is opportunity for us to do things there, but we have to get a feedstock allocation and I know we and our partners talk about that with the authorities on a regular basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just the last one, right around the time of your last call, there had been a number of announcements; you guys had your own, some of your competitors had some about stuff they wanted to do in the U.S. based off the shale gas. You've had three months now or so to analyze that. Can you just kind of handicap the whole of all the announcements and what you think is probable as we look out over the next four to five years as far as capacity coming online in the U.S. ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's going to be a tough thing to do, Duffy but I'll tell you how I think about it. First, one of the reasons our company is pursuing the de-bottlenecks is because those can be executed quicker and the first guys done are going to be in the best position. And so, we're working that very, very hard with full emphasis with our engineering team and our external contractors. We would like to be one of the very early movers.</p>
          <p>There has been some of the announcements, if you look at kind of what's been done, what's been talked about, some of those are &#x2013; I call those lines in the sand, they're telling us they may come, but that's another way of saying, we'd like to talk to people about product. And so, we'll just &#x2013; I really can't handicap it, but some of the projects would be so late in the cycle that by the time they got going, they'll probably miss some of the early benefit.</p>

          <p>And of our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Just a question on O-Po Americas for the second quarter; you ran a pretty heavy NGL slate and I know that U.S. naphtha margins were very attractive in the quarter, I'm just wondering why you didn't run more naphtha, was that because of OP-2 down and the need to maximize production hence you ran ethane? And Jim you mentioned about de-bottlenecking Channelview and La Porte, and I wonder if you have any plans to de-bottleneck your Midwest crackers to take advantage of what should be a sustained ethane advantage in that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Don, first in terms of why we ran so light. At this moment in time, there is reasonable balance between light and heavy because of the strong, strong value of the co-products. We did have OP-2 down and that had a pretty significant influence; as you know that's a very, very flexible cracker and we'll run quite a few of the furnaces on heavies to take advantage of that co-product pricing. So you correctly analyzed that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Midwest, we've done some turnaround work there last year at Morris. And we're &#x2013; other than the lightning strike that hurt us this last quarter that unit's running very, very well. We've set new production records time after time after time to the point now where we're looking at de-bottlenecking the polyethylene. So the unit itself following the turnaround, some of the things we've done, really is helping us there. In Clinton we're doing some furnish work, improving the efficiencies that will help us on energy as well as yield structure. So again, those are the kinds of de-bottlenecks that do nothing but good for you, very low capital and really nice returns. And so modest things there, but still given the spreads pretty impressive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just If I may, a quick follow up on the refinery. You mentioned you did briefly get to 280,000 barrels a day from time to time. Is &#x2013; should we expect that a sort of a new potential run-rate as we get into the second half of the year, just what are your thoughts as to how you kind of run post the FCC turnaround?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm not going to call 280 at this point in time. But we have demonstrated the ability to do it. It depends on what crudes we're running and a few other things and how we're configuring the back end. But I think the great news is that we're showing we really know how to be a company that refines again. You can see in the operations that we are lining things out; we're a lot smarter in the way that we're buying crudes and selling finished products. And the margins have improved significantly in that business, but we've outperformed the general industry and you see it in our results. And I'm extremely proud to be saying that. Last year I kept making excuses for this refinery and said trust me it'll get better, and now I'm able to tell you we're demonstrating that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Jim, in your prepared remarks you mentioned that your refining economics ran several dollars better than the benchmark Maya 211 spread. Was that delta above the Maya 211 better than it would have been in 1Q? And do you think it's sustainable moving into the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's a little better this quarter than in the first quarter. We have done a very nice job of buying crude oil. There is that significant disruption in WTI compared to other crudes that are coming in. If you look at WTI Maya, you'll see a negative spread, it never happens like that, for people will price crudes off WTI in oil and we've been out there in the market, I think doing some very clever buying and also optimizing the feedstock that that we bring into the refinery, the amount of heavy sulphur. We've always been a little light with our hydro treaters in terms of total capacity, and so we've been smart in pre-selling some co-products and doing this and doing that. I call it refining 101, although the way it's been done by our team, it's more like a senior class because they really demonstrate the ability to move quickly <mark type="ph" /> in various markets and bring in some nice cargoes. (43:08) Is it sustainable if the opportunities in the market remain? Yes. We've got to run very well, but we've now demonstrated, we know how to do it and in the past this stuff just was not happening in this company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a follow-up if I may, Jim, on a different subject related to the propylene chain, an awful lot of value has been created in propylene monomer or I guess over the last year or two, less though at the polymer level based on some of the industry margins that we observe. Do you think that that will change in coming years? And I'd welcome any thoughts you have on the industry consolidation there with the Dow-Braskem deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, first on that the general propylene molecule and the polypropylene, we have to talk geographies there and as you know in the Middle East we have an advantaged feedstock situation. So those economics will remain very robust.</p>
          <p>In Asia, and in Europe things remain about the same simply because people continue to crack naphtha and so the balance between ethylene and propylene isn't that different. Now, I would like to point out that we buy propylene fairly well in Europe, because of the size that we have, we're so net short and that some people get some stranded propylene and so we've been pretty good at buying that molecule.</p>
          <p>Now in the United States, which is I think where your primary question is, because of light cracking we've been -- the propylene molecules has been very short, has caused polypropylene to be more expensive than polyethylene and there has been some product substitution. That will normalize itself out over time. We've reacted to it. The volumes have fallen some but we've been able now to adjust and get some decent margins. You saw our margins went up a little bit this last quarter in polypropylene, but the value will be primarily in propylene, I think versus polypropylene in the near term.</p>
          <p>In terms of the consolidation in the industry, Braskem has been there in the past and they're a good competitor and they are very large, we are very large and we'll enjoy competition.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Doug. I'd just add, remember we also have a pretty nice business in our polypropylene compound in there. That's why we've got some places where we add some real value to the propylene chain.</p>
          <p>Guys, one thing I want to say is, is we've only got 12 or 15 minutes left. So we will have to move pretty quick because we have a fairly long queue of questions. Be respectful of everybody's time. Okay? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Just two questions. Will there be a difference between your book taxes and your cash taxes this year? And then secondly, can you speak about the profitability of your Berre refinery year-over-year and when you might expect difficulties there to end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the tax question first, it sounds easier. In the U.S., we remain largely where we were before and just as I mentioned before, it's really not going to change too much. We lost pretty much our attributes during the bankruptcy. So our cash taxes are pretty much the book taxes in the U.S. In the rest of the parts of the world, we do have -- first of all we have statutory rates in some places and some of our profits aren't taxed, at least on our books as you see like I was talking about with the joint ventures. But in other places of the world that were not affected by bankruptcy our European operations, we still have significant temporary differences between book and tax. So there will be still some differences.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One other thing Jeff, I'd just mention, we do have an interest carry-forward available still.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Doug raises a good point. We do have what might be called another temporary difference, in that we did not lose all of our interest deductions in bankruptcy. So &#x2013; but that &#x2013; those will be reported through deferred tax accounting, so we will be okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Berre refinery, we continue to have losses at that facility. The European refinery industry is reasonably challenged in general at this moment in time and our asset has run on purpose at lower volumes to minimize the losses. As we've announced in the past that asset is for sale. That process is in the early days and so we will see how it continues on. I would like to point out if we are unsuccessful in selling the asset, it is a possibility we could shut that refinery down and run our cracker, our low-density unit and polypropylene units on a stand-alone basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. Just one question here, as far as the maintenance scheduling goes in the second half of this year, how much market share you think you can gain while all the competitors aren't running?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure if I'd talk about market share. But I will say that there is a pretty heavy turnaround schedule expected in September and October of this year. We generally don't look at that as market share because it's transitory. But we think it should make the market very, very firm at that point in time and we're glad that we have OP2 done already. Now, come spring there's going to be an extremely heavy turnaround schedule including the OP1 our other cracker at Channelview so things will get very tight then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow-up. As far as just the gain these customers from the &#x2013; even if it's temporary, how much of can you maintain once the competitors are back on line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, generally that's transitory. We don't really think about it in terms of gaining market share on a permanent basis. As you may know, we've contracted our long ethylene position to third parties. And so while we're in the spot market, that's not a market we depend on per se. So in these kind of opportunities, we'll consider where we can make the best money. You remember, last year we quit making some polyethylene to sell some extremely valuable ethylene. And so we'll do those kinds of things in short periods of time to optimize the benefit to our shareholders.</p>

          <p>Great. Good morning. Jim, I just wonder  if you could address &#x2013; you talked a lot about the greenfield and brownfield expansion, a lot of this organic growth. I just wonder if you could address the thought of acquisition potential, and then within that context any thoughts about further integrating your business on the downstreams?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, at this point in time, in terms of the ethylene component, we think we can build out the existing assets we have to the point where &#x2013; as I mentioned, we'll have absolutely world-class size and cost structure type assets here in the U.S. between those OP1, OP2 and La Porte, with also a very nice facility down at Corpus and then two well-positioned Midwest crackers. If the right opportunity were there at the right price maybe in terms of an acquisition, but most people see the advantage that ethane has right now and I suspected that assets for sale may carry a pretty steep price. We just have to see what comes along.</p>

The Middle East is much slower because frankly they don't have all the stranded ethylene available and the newer projects don't have the same economics as the ones that we've done previously, in my view, and I personally have been responsible for building a lot of those plants.</p>
          <p>In Asia, there is going to continue to be some expansion, but most of the forecast we see, most of the announcements say that the pace is reasonably slow and if everybody really cranked up right now, we're in very, very good shape for the next years and that's why we think we have such a bright future in part. And we think it's going to ramp up very slowly. And the big growth in the Middle-East is just not going to be what it used to be.</p>

          <p>Okay, thanks. And then just quickly on fundamentals, I was wondering if you guys could size the silver catalyst sales in the tens of millions or in the hundreds of millions, and then finally just trying to reconcile the North American EBITDA, your big numbers in the quarter compared to our little numbers in our estimate. I was just wondering was the metaphysis unit a big &#x2013; did it play a big role improving EBITDA in the second quarter compared to first quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me figure that out. The silver sale, we said it was a $41 million gain; it was about a $55 million, $60 million sale -</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the metaphysis unit actually part of this whole major turnaround activity at Channelview involved this unit and some of the C4 recovery areas. So we had a pretty big activity and turnaround and we saw the impact there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it was a -- it didn't help out in the second quarter and it was down most of the quarter. Is that right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two quick questions. Most of mine have been answered. On the refining business, how much of your refining results was specifically due to buying <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:18) in Q1 that you don't think that you'll be able to repeat going forward? And secondly just a tactical question; when you think about reporting your segment EBITDA, a lot of companies consolidate the JV EBITDA into their segments' EBITDA as opposed to the dividend, so would you consider making such a shift in your accounting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of the accounting we do put the JV dividends into the segments that manage our interest in those joint ventures most of them primarily are in O&amp;PO-EAI in with the. . .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:54) more changing from consolidating dividend to consolidated EBITDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we could but as I was &#x2013; actually when Bob was asking his question about debt financing we have to appreciate that some of the big ones, the ones that are materially impacting us or have recent debt that is being paid down, things are changing, we could take their EBITDA but we do a lot of &#x2013; we have to make sure that their reporting is on an U.S. GAAP basis. So there is a lot of complexities there but it is something we've thought about. This is the way we've done it because it represents cash and is equivalent to our cash. But that is a thought; maybe we should take that under consideration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In terms of what's repeatable in terms of the crude oil slate and all, I would say that the general conditions that we experienced in the first half of the year in terms of crude purchasing seem to be continuing on into this third quarter and hopefully for a reasonable period of time, so we expect to do well on refining.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question in the queue comes from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just a quick question on the cash conversion side of things; taking a look at the Q1 numbers, you guys obviously did around $1.4 billion in EBITDA, but cash from operations was slightly north of $200 million. And looking at this quarter, EBITDA obviously north of $1.5 billion and cash from operations over a billion. So on the Q1 side of things, was that really an inventory build ahead of your planned maintenance that brought the cash from operations levels down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, well it's number of things; it's a number of things. We have &#x2013; in our business we have significant first quarter cash payments related to accrued bonuses, rebates, very heavy rebate operations, our insurance premium. There is just a number of first quarter effects. And in our case, we also paid a significant contribution to our pension plan. So I think it was more a function of the timing of our cash payments in our annual cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. So Q2 is more normal, is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say so. In fact one could argue that, that we're making accruals in two, three, and four quarter that will have to be paid in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>And our last question will come from Bill Young of ChemSpeak. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. The inventory correction you mentioned Asia looks like it's coming back a little bit, how would you characterize the North American market for polyethylene with prices having gone up so steeply, it's probably been a lot of pre-buying, where would you say that one is in the overall scheme of things and how much longer you think it might last?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bill that's a bit difficult to predict, but the pattern that we saw was fairly typical. When oil prices start to fall people wonder if the polymer prices will also fall, so they start to destock inventories. They did that, the volumes fell a bit. We've already seen intensified buying in Asia, it's ramping up and typically that same kind of a pattern happens in the United States and in Europe. And so it's starting to gain a bit of momentum; we're seeing a little ticking up of the markets, but there was a soft patch and we will just see the duration of it. We're optimistic that this was inventory destocking influenced by a temporary reduction in oil price. But inventories are a reasonably low.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly on the condo cracker concept, you said you got some calls, are you expecting other companies to announce plants besides what we've already seen say in Marcellus or were the calls mostly from people who already have made announcements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>People who made announcements, I would say are the general ones that called us. As everybody knows, you just don't build ethylene capacity, you have to have a derivative behind it. And we're a very, very good competitor in polypropylene and polyethylene and world leading technology. So people think about what they might want to do downstream of a cracker and we come to their mind fairly quickly in many instances. So it's not things that aren't announced; it's things have been talked about in the press already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Great. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. All right well as we wrap up, I'd like to reinforce a couple of points. First, we truly are making progress on all fronts. The results have been very good. We just reported our best ever quarter. We think the recent soft patch is just that, kind of a temporary thing where inventories readjust. We're beginning to have growth plans, we're investing in our assets, getting our turnarounds done. We've also begun to return cash to our shareholders, through the payment of our first dividend. And we're continuing to repay debt.</p>
          <p>We're very happy to have a full board in place. We're looking very much forward to the discussions on our financial plans, our growth projects with those &#x2013; with the new members of the board and the existing members. We're able to turn our attention now to the future and to new opportunities.</p>
          <p>I said a year ago that we had to earn the right to grow. We think we've done that. We think we're starting to operate like a very, very good company on the way to becoming the best in the industry. We feel good about our results in the first half of the year, particularly good about this quarter.</p>
          <p>We very much thank you for your support and look forward to the next quarter. Thank you.</p>
