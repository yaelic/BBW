          <p>Denmark in the second quarter that needs to continue in the third and the fourth quarter. And the last important driver is, of course, efficiency measures. To make this all happen a law on management priorities and tough decisions together with the unions in Sweden and Finland have to be made fast and in a professional manner.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, I'm convinced that this is a good industry to be in and that it will continue to be attractive. TeliaSonera has a unique position in the Nordic and the Baltic countries, we are very well positioned in several emerging markets with high growth potential and we continue looking for new investment opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now, over to our CFO, who actually, this is his last quarterly report. And he is leaving us unfortunately to go back to Finland. Kim, last one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. I will now go through the financials for the quarter, starting with net sales and as mentioned, a good development, 5.7% increase of which 3.2% was organic growth in local currency. Looking at the different business areas, we are very, very pleased with Mobility services growing with 770 million.</p>
          <p>This quarter actually Spain is the biggest contributor to our growth. After Spain we have good volume growth in Sweden also increased users in Denmark, supported acquisitions that we have done over there plus wholesale revenues coming from the Norwegian markets. In Broadband services we had flat sales year-on-year. So on the group level we are successful in offsetting the declines in the traditional fixed line services with other services like IP based services and wholesale services. In Eurasia we grew 25%, and this I think is a good accomplishment. We have really tough competitive situation in most of the markets. In addition to the organic growth we also added the operations in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
          <p>Moving to operating income, again growing very nicely from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion. Mobility services doing extremely well, also 770 million in increased sales. We are actually able to keep 420 million all the way down to the EBITDA line. Sweden is doing fine. The EBITDA margins in Q2 in Sweden were at the high level of 37%, which shows the focus and the commitment to keep good level margins in the unit. Also in Norway and Denmark we were able to have efficiency improvement and therefore improve our profitability or keep good levels of profitability.</p>
          <p>In Spain, we continue to execute according to the plans communicated to the market. In Broadband services the situation is not as good. We had flat sales as mentioned but we do lose 250 million on the EBITDA line, and this is because of the change in the product mix where high margin fixed line services, fixed voice services are declining and are being offset with lower margin in the wholesale international carrier, sales and IP based broadband services.</p>
          <p>In Eurasia we grow nicely in tough environment, still we are able to give EBITDA margin of 50%. Also our associated companies are doing very well. Russia, excluding non-recurring items improving with 300 million year-on-year and Turkey improving with 430 million.</p>
          <p>To summarize on slide eight, the group P&amp;L saw good growth, good improvement in margins levels, income from associated below 2.3 billion compared to 1.9 last year, financial items higher because of the higher net debt and higher cost of capital currently. Income taxes, the effective tax rate is a bit higher than what we have seen during the last quarters and this is because of providing for withholding taxes in Turkey and in Azerbaijan. CapEx level is 17.7% of sales in Q2 '08 compared to 13.9 last year higher level, but according to what we have communicated to the market.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide nine, statement of cash flows, EBITDA,  including as mentioned also a bit higher dividends received from the associated companies. On the negative side we do have higher interest and income taxes paid. In restructuring provisions and in net working capital items, we do not see a major difference compared to last year's Q2, which is leading to the fact that the cash flow from the operating activities actually is pretty much in line with where we were last year. Where the difference comes from is the CapEx level where we have 4.6 billion in Q2 this year compared to 3.3 last year. The biggest single item behind this change is our investment in the 4G license in Sweden for SEK 560 million, all leading to a free cash flow of 2.5 compared to 3.5 last year.</p>
          <p>Last slide, what comes to our &#x2013; some of our financial key ratios, the returns on equity and on capital employed. They continue to be at a very good level and we also continue to be one of the best rated telco in Europe.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and back to Martti for Q&amp;A.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from the line of Stefan Patterson. Please go ahead announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, this is Stefan Patterson, Nordia. Coming back to this question regarding Spain, you have two targets, one is that the net loss on EBITDA will not exceed SEK 1 billion and also that you should reach at least 1 million subscribers by the end of the year. Looking at my numbers I can't make this add up, because either you have to drastically increase your subscriber intake, which will cost more on the OpEx line or you have to slowdown or at least keep them on the same level. So the question is, which target do you prefer to reach the lower than SEK 1 billion target or to keep growth and go for the subscribers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Lars. Stefan I want both targets obviously. We have 627,000 subscribers at this point in time, and I think both are important. I don't want really to have to pick between one of them, I really would like to have both and the management, including myself believe it's possible. It's not easy, but it's possible. And I think it's very encouraging what happened in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If the targets cannot be met, does that change your view on Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we don't deliver the plan, of course my view on Spain will change. By view I mean we will have a serious discussion what's going to happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Hogley. Please go ahead, announcing your company name.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. It's Andrew Hogley from Execution. A question about the Swedish broadband trend. On my calculation, it looks like the overall number of top line years is falling by about 3%. Is that being driven more by substitution by mobile and mobile broadband or is that loss of lines to cable broadband and cyber? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is mainly due to a substitution by mobile services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that something that you've seen emerging of a new, should I say the last few months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's something that's been ongoing at pretty much the same level for quite a while.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of the Laurent Sierra. Please go ahead announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Laurent Sierra from Redburn Partners. A couple of questions on the situation in northern Europe. We have seen different trends in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, could you tell us what is the business that you see the most at risk going forward as we all fear on the economy weakening. For example what is your current exposure in the legacy business that you see the most at risk? Can you give us a kind of global picture of the trends there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Lars. I think if you look at the economies in the Scandinavian countries, and the Baltic countries, I think everybody agrees that the biggest challenges are in some of the Baltic States more so than in the Scandinavian countries. But of course, the Scandinavian countries are as dependent as other countries on the world economy. I have said that we didn't see much of a changing trend in our markets during the second quarter. We did see for instance in some of the Baltic countries a slowdown of sale of new terminals that's I think is a sign of people being careful spending money on terminal. They do still use their old ones, which is the most important thing for us. We actually see some similar signs in some countries in Eurasia driven by higher inflation, slowing down of the economy. But I don't think the Scandinavian countries; in Nordic countries we saw any change in the trends during the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Leiana Oftberg. Please go ahead announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Leiana Oftberg, Enskilda Securities. I have three questions if I may. First of all on Denmark, you said that you have made investments in the quarter in the broadband side, what exactly were they? And would they lift margins going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to Denmark, it's mainly investments with regard to our TV offers that we have in the market. And of course I mean as the largest state, Denmark is a very important country for us when it comes to our EBITDA guidance and we are working very hard on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also then, if I can ask you on broadband, especially Sweden, because it seems most of the cost cut in this quarter came on mobiles in Sweden. And you're lagging behind on broadband Sweden and in Finland. What is the timing of the cost cut &#x2013; has the decision being taken, are they in place or is they are waiting to take some decisions to lift margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Lars. First of all there are no new cost cuts, it's the same program we are executing, we announced in the beginning of this year I believe. At least we indicated in the end of last year. This is a numerous number of decisions that has to be taken, some has already been taken, some has been executed, but obviously the majority of the decisions are taken right now and towards the end of this year. And some of those will be executed in this year, already most of the savings of the 5 billion will be saved during '09. So that's what...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we should not expect any major improvements from cost cuts in the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't guided you on the cost cut by quarter, we have said we're going to save 5 billion over the years '08 and '09, and we have said when it comes to the savings about 1.5 is to be saved this year and 3.5 is to be saved next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you say something about how much of the ones that you realized has been in which business area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't disclose that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I also finally ask you on your Swedish IPTV customers, you said it had, I think a 100,000 paying subscribers now, could you say something about the ARPU levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We don't talk about ARPU levels either. I think Leiana that, I think the most important thing is we went into this market with this free offer and there were a lot of discussions about it. I thought that was a very smart move and we see some proofs of that now and more than a 100,000 actually have said this is a great offer, I want to have it, I am paying for it. Now, let's see by the end of this year how many of the remaining 220, whatever it is, 1000, will have taken the same decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of O Ritrassa. Please go ahead, announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>O Ritrassa, Dresdner Kleinwort in London. I have two questions. One is, it's a very big picture, Lars you have been with the company now for sometime. I was just wondering, if you sort of compare to the way you think about the company on what the strategy today compared to how you entered, where has been the biggest change? And the second question is specifically on mobile in Sweden. Would you give some indication for the scale of the mobile broadband subscribers that you currently have and what share you believe you have in that market at this stage? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the first one. I thought you asked me about the big picture and what has changed since I came in till today, I hope that was the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And how are you thinking about what the strategy has changed, not just the environment but also how you view the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First of all, not much surprised me, quite a bit the way I expected it to be positive and less positive. I was a little bit &#x2013; I won't say taken aback, may be strong word, but there was a very intensive discussion in the industry a year ago and still is about the different business models, future business models for telecom operators. I feel very comfortable with the business model I shared with you in my initial comments. TeliaSonera, I think will be very successful being a true telecom operator with great networks, great service, great quality and we will be active in packaging and carrying content, but I don't think we should spend a lot of effort trying to create the content. And I tried to explain why I believe that's a great business to be in and that we have, especially we have a very, very interesting position being the leading operator in our home markets and we are also in very attractive emerging markets.</p>
          <p>So I feel good about that and I feel that, that has become clearer and clearer over the last six or nine months and I actually think we all agree in the management team that this is the priority we should have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in order to your second question with regards to our share of the mobile broadband subscriptions in the Swedish market, we feel that we are taking our fair share, of course, to some extent that the &#x2013; well, the other operators are not providing that numbers. So in that sense it's very difficult to verify that, but we feel very much, that that's the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, can give some indication for how many you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't yet opened that case, so the only numbers that we have is the total number of subscriptions and the mobile broadband subscriptions are part of our postpaid subscription base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it fair to say that it's a majority of your net adds or is that, Ignatius, to say, exaggeration.</p>

          <p>Hi there, Jakob Bluestone from Merrill Lynch. I was just wondering if you can give an update on Turkey, I haven't heard anything on that for a little while? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Lars. I said that I think, I have been here for a year now and I think we have good open communication with the relevant players, a couple of players in Russia, and Sukor&#xF3; of course in Turkey. We haven't made any significant progress or structural changes. I jokingly said that the moon and the stars have to line up before it happens and they might do, and then my experience is they normally do if you are, if you talk, it you talk long enough and you explain what you want then you listen to what the other side wants. One day something happens and, but for that to be successful you need to talk and we're talking on a regular basis and that I'm pleased with and we will see.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, my name is Timothy Leco. I'm a reporter for Russian business daily <mark type="inaudible" />. It's a subsidiary with Financial Times in Russian. I have got a question about TeliaSonera's investment in MegaFon because in your report it is written that TeliaSonera has signed agreement with Telecominvest and shareholder of Telecominvest in order to secure TeliaSonera's ownership in MegaFon. What does it mean? Does it mean that the 8.2% of MegaFon now directly belongs to TeliaSonera. The first question, and the second question is why these shares were secured, for what purpose now that shareholder of Telecominvest has placed these shares? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Kim, short answer is, first of all it doesn't mean that TeliaSonera now owns the TCI shares, they are only pledged to us. The ownership structure has not changed and what comes to the pledge arrangement, you really find all the information on the release.</p>

          <p>Yes, the second question was which term is of this pledge, when the shares will be returned to Telecominvest, and they were &#x2013; according to our information TeliaSonera is providing negotiations with a third shareholder of MegaFon, Alfa  to buy their stake in MegaFon. Is it true? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon guys, this is Andrew Lee from Citi. I have just one question on Swedish mobile. Both you guys and Tele2 had a decent quarter in two Q. And the market is relatively benign, but Telenor has been struggling and commented yesterday that it feels it had a limited impact in Sweden since taken over from Vodafone in particular it felt it has not been competitive in pricing. The question is what spread do you see for the potential for Telenor to get more aggressive in the market and do you expect it to become more aggressive and how do you see the Swedish mobile market developing through rest of the year? Thank you.</p>

          <p>This is Lars. I have a lot of respect for Telenor as a competitor, they are obviously very strong in Norway and we have the reverse situation a little bit in Norway as we have in Sweden. The Swedish market is a very competitive market, I respect all my competitors and I don't expect this to change, it will be an highly competitive market going forward as it has been for a long period of time. We happen to be the biggest, that's the advantage we have.</p>
