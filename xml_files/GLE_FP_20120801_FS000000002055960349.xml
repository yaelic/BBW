          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thanks for attending our Results &#x2013; Second Quarter Results Conference Call. What I propose is that with Bertrand Badr&#xE9;, our Chief Financial Officer, we will briefly go through our &#x2013; the presentation and highlight the main items. And then we'll take an hour, I suggest that we limit the Q&amp;A session to one hour to answer, again, your questions.</p>
          <p>I just would like to go through the page four and underline that, in my view, the second reflects all the efforts that we've been undertaking in the last year in particular. We have one priority to generate capital and adjust the business model. We are benefiting in the second quarter with the strong business franchises and we have posted resilient performances in clearly a difficult environment. We all know that the second quarter had seen a slowdown of economic activity and also a lot of nervousness on the markets &#x2013; on the financial markets. We have been able to, again and Bertrand Badr&#xE9; will come back to that, post sound performances.</p>
          <p>Clearly, this quarter is an additional and significant step towards our target in terms of capital, plus 51 basis points in the second quarter, following plus 35 basis points in the first quarter. And we are managing very strongly all our scarce resource in all the businesses. We've, overall &#x2013; is we've seen a decrease of our risk weighted asset in the second quarter driven in particular by SG CIB.</p>
          <p>And let me highlight that in this second quarter, we see also the benefit of all the efforts in the past quarters in terms of cost and risk management. The operating expenses are down minus 6% versus last year. The SG CIB the restructuring plan is now fully completed and we will benefit in the second half of the full effect of this plan and on the cost of risk, and Bertrand will comment on that, it is under control across the group. And let me highlight in particular as we will answer again, in an uncertain environment after the summer, in autumn and for the coming quarters, I would like to highlight again the very low exposure that we have on the peripheral eurozone countries both in terms of sovereign debt as well as in relative terms in terms of the private sector. So I think we are, and I will comment on that in the conclusion, well equipped to fare the coming quarters, which might remain uncertain and turbulent.</p>
          <p>Bertrand, I leave you the floor to highlight the main items of these quarter results.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric. Good afternoon everybody. I think the main messages have been passed by Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric. We'll start with the following pages, which, of course, has raised significant questions regarding the difference between the stated net income &#x20AC;433 million, and the underlying figures which we have put at close to &#x20AC;800 million, i.e., &#x20AC;2 billion of what we have here, which are based on the &#x20AC;2.3 billion gross operating income. It just shows the underlying strength of the businesses, the fact that despite &#x2013; or thanks maybe to the transformation we've been through over the last year, the engine is far from being broken. The engine is working and it's a very good news and a very comforting news looking forward.</p>
          <p>So what are these exceptional or one-off items which have impacted our stated results this quarter?  I think most of you have already dig into this figure, I will provide comprehensive analysis. On the one hand, you have the traditional, unfortunately, legacy assets impact, little bit more than &#x20AC;100 million, so in line with we've been through. It's likely to last a little bit as you might expect. It's a mix of different elements. The cost of the deleveraging, of course, and also various impacts in terms of valuation of these assets which we have to deal with quarter-after-quarter as you know.</p>
          <p>Second main item, same order of magnitude, the deleveraging of our CIB of our core businesses, basically, the losses that we have to take into account when we sell a line of credit or portfolio of credit, which is of good quality but we have to take a discount. In average, we've taken a 5% hit on these disposals, bottom line, it's a little bit more than &#x20AC;150 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;159 million pre-tax, &#x20AC;110 million at the bottom line level. So these are the two impacts which are mostly felt at the CIB level.</p>
          <p>We also have the impact of the widening of the spreads regarding our own debt, our structured debt. Here again, an impact which is, if I may say, artificial, we've been used to live with that in one direction or the other, first quarter was a loss and this quarter is a profit. Here again, &#x20AC;219 million pre-tax, &#x20AC;195 &#x2013; &#x20AC;145, sorry, million after tax. This will happen again, as you know, we have to live with that but it has no impact on the underlying business as you know.</p>
          <p>More important, if I may say, the two last items. On the positive side, we have bought back a chunk of our Tier 2 debt, which has generated a profit &#x2013; a P&amp;L profit and also some capital relief. So pre-tax, &#x20AC;205 million, total &#x20AC;200 million net income impact, so it's a positive side. Here again, it's technically a one-off, we do not do this every quarter, of course. Last and certainly not least, it has been discussed this morning in the various papers I've read, the goodwill impairment we've taken mostly on Russia on the one hand, &#x20AC;250 million; and TCW, on the other hand, with &#x20AC;200 million. As you know, this has no tax benefit, if I may say, and this has no prudential impact.</p>
          <p>So from our capital perspective, which Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric briefly described in his introduction as you're familiar with, no impact. So that's what I wanted to share with you, again, nothing is hidden, as the main items are there, underlying figure is &#x20AC;800 million, &#x20AC;2 billion for the quarter, and I think this is basically what shows the strength of the robustness or the resilience of the engine throughout this period.</p>
          <p>Next page, basically another page where I might spend a little bit of time, it's the capital. You remember that we have detailed our roadmap towards our objective end of 2013, 9% to 9.5% fully loaded Basel III figure. Actually, we say very clearly in the introduction and we confirm it in this conclusion, we are on this roadmap, and we confirm that we will stick to this roadmap. As a first milestone after six months, the fact that we are at 9.9% in the Basel 2.5 I think is a key element, it shows the way we will reach our capital target. Basically, it's a mix of different elements. On the one hand, of course, is the retained earnings, roughly out of the 50 bps of this quarter, it's roughly 20 bps of retained earnings.</p>
          <p>Second, the strict management of our scarce resources and basically the growth of our RWA, the fact that our RWA decreased by &#x20AC;7 billion provided 20 bps, roughly, relief on capital. And third, as a deleverage, and mostly the deleverage focused on capital relief with the legacy assets, an additional 10 bps. That's, in broad figure, the impact. So what we are doing this quarter, we will do this over the next period in order to reach our 9% to 9.5% target by the end of next year.</p>
          <p>We have also put on the same page a chart which basically makes the connection between the objectives stated last year. You remember &#x20AC;30 billion to &#x20AC;40 billion risk weighted assets deleverage, just to say that we are at &#x20AC;33 billion and we have also made a transition into bps &#x2013; into Core Tier 1 bps, here again, we are at 40 bps so far out of the 70 bps earmarked for 2013. So here again if there is one message with this page is the fact that we are on track with our objective.</p>
          <p>The following page is probably for me, one of the most important in the fact that it shows how important the transformation has been through the last year. I don't want to celebrate any birthdays there, but if you can consider where we were a year ago, where we are today, let's take some elements. On the one hand &#x2013; on the long-term refinancing, given the fact that our rating in relative terms is much better today than it was a few months ago. Second, our CDS ratio is now well within the pack. We've been able, also because we've been relatively attractive, we've been able to raise &#x20AC;14.2 billion throughout this first half year, mostly, actually, on the unsecured issues including &#x20AC;2.25 billion that we raised within the next few days after the last European Summit, so it just show that we've been, on the one hand, very proactive on the second hand, very well received. And I think this is a clear signal, so we are ahead of schedule as far as refinancing is concerned. We will of course continue and do more than that if we can this year and I'm pretty confident that we can, that's the first important message.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet structure itself, I think the main elements are the following. First of all, the short-term refinancing is really significantly down, close to &#x20AC;250 billion 2007 pre-crisis,  &#x20AC;160 billion a year ago, &#x20AC;115 billion now. So it just shows how restructured the balance sheet has been and the fact that the engine has still been able to provide the results I've discussed prior to this point.</p>
          <p>So &#x20AC;115 billion of short term within which the dollar part has gone down from 50% to around 25%, 28%. Loan to deposit ratio, I think it's a critical indicator that people are more and more following, down from 122% to 114%. I think it's important as well to underline what it means in terms of business model and the way the businesses are managed.</p>
          <p>Next element, on the surplus of stable resources versus our long-term assets, basically the balance between long-term liabilities, long-term assets, the excess has gone from over &#x20AC;15 billion a year ago to over &#x20AC;50 billion at the end of this quarter. I think it's also an important signal of the transformation.</p>
          <p>And last but certainly not least, our liquid asset buffer, basically what is matching our short-term debt, we are now at 99%. We can say that if we include on top of that, the &#x20AC;14 billion of assets which can be sold within the next month, we are above 100% vis-&#xE0;-vis our short-term refinancing needs, again, it's a very strong signal and a significant change. We were below 70% a year ago, we were slightly above 70% two quarters ago, we were at 84% last quarter and we are now at 100%. So again, it's a big change.</p>
          <p>Our results, I will not spend too much time on the next page, basically, our results are based on three different trends. First of all, resilient top line; second, significant efforts in terms of cost, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric highlighted this in his introduction, minus 6% quarter-on-quarter. But if we look at the first quarter vis-&#xE0;-vis the second quarter, we are down more than 4%. So it's a strong push and we will continue in that direction, no doubt. So resilient top line.</p>
          <p>Costs not only under control, but costs down, and the cost of risk which is, as a comparison quarter-to-quarter, is not really relevant, because last year it was impacted by the first impact of the Greek crisis. But underlying trends show that cost of risk, and this brings me to the next page, cost of risk is under control, it's slightly up this quarter. It will continue to go up, but moderately. We are not &#x2013; we are of course concerned by the economic situation. We are watching potential impacts on our various geographies and businesses very carefully, but we are confident that, for the time being, there is no signal that this is &#x2013; there is a significant deterioration ahead of us.</p>
          <p>If you take this business by business, French networks, it's relatively stable. You see plus 1 bps quarter-over-quarter, it will continue to grow, we think, with this type of rhythm as far as increase is concerned. International retail is a mix of different things. Two points of interest, if I may say, on the one hand, Russia, the negative news is that we've been through an in-depth review of our portfolio and we had to provision one &#x2013; just one significant situation. The rest of the portfolio is relatively sound. And so there is no worry relative to the rest of the portfolio, it's really related to one-off.</p>
          <p>In Romania, given the economic situation, the cost of risk is high and is likely to stay high a little bit more. In CIB, specialized financial services, the cost of risk is low and we expect it to remain in these areas going forward, even again, as I say, we are cautious given the economic situation and deterioration of the perspective in Europe especially.</p>
          <p>Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric, highlighted on the next page, our exposure to the peripheral &#x2013; to peripheral Europe. We are down to &#x20AC;2.4 billion end of June, technically, we are even more down than that because we have &#x20AC;2.2 billion, there were two &#x2013; Spanish bond redemption in July. So we have &#x20AC;2.2 billion, out of which &#x20AC;1.4 billion on Italy, I think it's big distinctive factor vis-&#xE0;-vis the rest of the banks in France and in Europe.</p>
          <p>Related &#x2013; as far as GENIKI is concerned, I think the main message is that the situation is ring-fenced. We are not providing any funding or quasi no funding today. We have transferred part of the loans to Paris, basically, we have a balanced loan to deposit ratio and we are managing this as carefully as possible, but not much to add besides the fact that the situation is under control and is ring-fenced.</p>
          <p>Business-by-business, French networks, slow growth environment to say the least, I mean France is at zero plus growth rate. In that environment, there is a still commercial momentum with the French networks, deposits and credits are up, which I think is a distinctive feature of the French market vis-&#xE0;-vis the rest of Europe.</p>
          <p>Just wanted to underline the fact that we've been above 11 million clients. I think it's an important threshold, including also 2 million clients for Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord. So based on this commercial momentum, how does this translate into financial figures? Top line, flat to flat-plus, basically flat-plus in the French networks under pressure with Boursorama. The production is down, I mean the market figures are public, mortgage production, investment credit production are down. Margins are okay, I mean margins are okay, even slightly up, the commissions are down. So bottom line, it's</p>
          <p>a zero-plus top line growth, which is, to a certain extent, protected by our work on cost.</p>
          <p>The costs are down in the French networks, it's due basically to the cost-control policy at the group level, but more importantly, the first benefit of this very, very big efforts we've made in terms of convergence of IT platforms between our various networks, which are bearing fruit this quarter or will continue to bear fruit. Bottom line, of course, is cost savings do not exactly match the increase in the cost of risk, but this being said, they protect the bottom line relatively well and the bottom line is up compared to first quarter and still okay compared to last &#x2013; to Q2 last year.</p>
          <p>International retail, hear again, if you take a macro-perspective or macro-picture, you'll see there's some commercial momentum, credit growth, deposit growth, group funding is down, loan to deposit ratio at 98%, but as you know, this is basically a mix of different situation where some countries have a deficit and some countries have a surplus and you cannot really move the deficit &#x2013; match a deficit with a surplus, so group funding in an aggregate format is above &#x20AC;6 billion, we want to bring this down over time.</p>
          <p>Another important factor is the fact that costs apparently are slightly up or, say, stable. You have to remember that these &#x2013; we are operating in countries where inflation is relatively high, and so this flat perspective in reality, significant efforts in terms of cost control. Cost of risk, I discussed this briefly before that. I think the main items are these one-off Russian situation and the fact that Romania is still high, in the other geographies, it's under control and does not provide for any worry going forward. So bottom line, we have in Czech Republic, in the Mediterranean Basin in Africa very good businesses, Russia, I will come back in the next page, is impacted by the goodwill impairment and Romania is still facing a more difficult environment.</p>
          <p>On Russia, the decision has been made to have an impairment there, there is nothing special regarding that, we have been able to explain this every semester. We run all our businesses which have a goodwill and we say whether this goodwill is still justified by the business plan. Nothing more, nothing less. The fact that there is some delay in the implementation of our restructuring of Russia and the benefit of this implementation translates into this goodwill impairment, &#x20AC;250 million. This being said, a number of decisions have been made. We have restructured the business from a legal perspective <mark type="ph" /> by divesture (19:15) by merging the various entities. We have started to decrease the workforce by more than 2,000 people. We have restructured, we have some figures, the number of regional headquarters, for instance, restructured the head office and so on and so forth, this will also bear fruit. We have also announced a certain number of management changes. So all of these will bear fruit going forward, but we have to take into account the fact that 2012 is not exactly where we wanted it to be. So it's delayed basically <mark type="ph" /> item (19:45).</p>
          <p>On CIB, I think the quarter that we have is, of course, behind last quarter. Q1, and we will discuss that at length with all of you, Q1 was most exceptional. Even if you compare to Q2 last year, which was also under the first half of 2011, was a very good year. So we have more to something, I wouldn't call it normal because you would draw too early conclusions, but something which is in line with the market basically. If you compare with the announcements made by most of our competitors so far, there is no significant changes regarding our perspective, whether you look at the fixed income or the equity markets, we are basically down in the same proportion.</p>
          <p>The important point though is the fact that our VaR is very low, &#x20AC;25 million. It just shows that we have taken, and it's not an accident, we made a decision to have a defensive position on our CIB this quarter. Here again if you look back, whether you take into account political uncertainties in France or in Greece for instance, debate on the eurozone, et cetera, I think it was a wise position. And despite this defensive position, we've been able to have very significant commercial results. To say the truth, it was more difficult in May than in June. June was a relatively good month, whereas May was more difficult. But bottom line, good commercial volumes, relatively good performance, and we have not been penalized on the fixed income about the CDS level here again, like for our refinancing plan, CDS level is an indicator. But don't draw too early conclusions on that, real life, doesn't work exactly 100% correlated to the CDS fortunately.</p>
          <p>Good news on top of that is that what we have earmarked for the entirety of the group is true for SG CIB, costs are down. And it's not the end of the game, because we will benefit, as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric said in the introduction, on the full impact of the plan, which is now behind us, second quarter. So the costs were down 14% Q2 versus Q2 last year. They were down 18% versus Q1, and even if you exclude the bonuses, which have, of course, have an impact, we are down 9% year-on-year and even 2% down from Q1. So here again, very strong operating performance and strong focus on cost.</p>
          <p>Transformation, I think the main point is the fact that we have sold, since we announced last year, &#x20AC;14 billion of good credits, which provided for an impact of roughly &#x20AC;11 billion of funding equivalent and above &#x20AC;5 billion of risk weighted assets at an average cost of roughly 5%. These are the metrics that we have in mind. I think it just shows the importance of deleverage and the impact on our income. I will not comment on the cost, I've already done that; evolution of model, we answer question if you have, but I think we are dedicated to transforming, positive transformation of the model of the CIB.</p>
          <p>On legacy assets, we are pursuing our strategy, &#x20AC;2.2 billion decrease, &#x20AC;1.6 billion disposal, &#x20AC;0.6 billion natural amortization, disposal which are basically two-third non-investment grade, one-third money-good assets. Today, we are left with &#x20AC;14.5 billion in total, but as you know, this figure is not really relevant, what is really an area of focus is a &#x20AC;3.8 billion book value of the non-investment grade assets, and all of this is the CDOs of RMBS. So what we will do is that we will focus our efforts on this part, on this &#x20AC;3.8 billion. It takes, as you know, a lot of time. It's complex. It's mostly &#x2013; it goes mostly through CDO cracking, which is a time consuming relatively painful process, but it provides a lot of capital relief and this is our priority.</p>
          <p>Our pure net impact, as I said, &#x20AC;114 million is a mix of different elements, none of which is really material at that stage. Here again is other traditional elements that have an impact on our books quarter-after-quarter. But again, if you have questions, we'll be more than happy to answer these questions.</p>
          <p>Specialized financial services and insurance, a very good quarter, a record quarter, historically equal to the best performance so far second quarter 2008. Good level of profitability in insurance and specialized financial services, which under very tough constraint in terms of scarce resources, are doing well. Production is under pressure, but margins are okay. Cost of risk is down and costs are under control. And on top of that, I want to underline the fact that one of the changes in the business model is a fact that this businesses have been asked to raise money on their own, which they have done, whether it's with securitization or deposit policy, I think our German business, GEFA, has started to raise deposits and they are now a gross &#x20AC;300 million, and it's growing week-after-week and we're following that with a lot of interest. I think it's a very important signal regarding our business model.</p>
          <p>Last fall, GIMS, our private banking Global Investment Management and Services, I think the main message is the fact that these businesses are, with various elements, doing okay this quarter. The main impact of course is the precision of the goodwill on TCW, which brings the goal below zero in terms of net income. But apart from that, most of the businesses under market circumstances, which you are familiar with, are doing okay. And with that I think we've been through the &#x2013; over the portfolio and Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric, I leave you with you conclusion.</p>

          <p>Bertrand, thank you. Let me just effectively conclude page 24. Bertrand has highlighted our achievements, I would say, for the last year and in particular in the second quarter. Let me say a few words going forward. As I said at the beginning, we are factoring still difficult economic environment clearly we've seen in the second half a slowdown of the economy in the world and of course in Europe in particular and we know that the next 18 months should reflect again to clearly this kind of environment.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we also factor potential volatility related to tensions on the euro zone, I'm sure we'll have perhaps opportunity to answer certain of your questions regarding that and so we have been able I think to strengthen our muscles to fare well these coming quarters and speak to our roadmap. First of all, my confidence relies on the resilience of our revenue generation highlighted in the second quarter, which again was a difficult one and we are confident in that. Let me highlight the quality of the relationship with our clients. The development about this relationship is going in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of cost, Bertrand has highlighted already the first results, but I would like to mention again that we don't have yet the full benefit of the restructuring plan in the CIB business and that we have also taken steps in terms of reducing, delaying more discretionary expenses in order precisely to maintain the capital generation in the second half of this year despite again the environment I was mentioning. And third very importantly of course on the risk &#x2013; on the cost of risk, again, we are &#x2013; we have very limited exposure, as you know, to extreme scenarios in the eurozone, which was commented by Bertrand both on the sovereign debt but also on the more than private sector one. We have, as you know in relative terms, limited exposures to the countries, which might be the most at risk, and if we put aside these extreme scenarios but stick to again a low growth environment, as we've commented if we expect moderate increase of the cost of risk on certain of our retail activities given the economic activity, we are confident that it should not change significantly our capacity, again to generate capital and the credit quality of the portfolio is sound.</p>
          <p>So that's why I'm again confident that we will generate quarter after quarter with still the same discipline in terms of scaled resource allocation to the businesses and of course additional and further selective deleveraging on the balance sheet, we will effectively meet these 9% to 9.5% core Tier 1 Basel III target ratio at the end of 2013, again despite the difficult environment we envisage for the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>That's what we wanted to say in terms of presentation, and we are now open to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Hello there. I have a quick series of questions if you wouldn't mind. The first one is on the banking union, so I've seen comments from Soc Gen in the paper that you guys were favoring this scenario, and I just wondered one quick thing is that if you look at within eurozone countries, you see very, very different risk weights for similar asset classes being up or down depending on the countries, but I just wondered whether you had a view on whether these differences in risk weights of various assets would become more clustered under European supervision i.e. for example reintroduction of some floors or things like this on certain assets. So that was my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question is now with the half year behind us, if you had a guidance for the full-year jaws effect for the French retail business, then on the core Tier 1 capital with the Basel III impact that you disclosed nicely in Q1, I just wondered whether that has changed slightly or being reduced the impact that is thanks to your second quarter deleveraging, so for example I can see that your Basel II deduction has gone down another &#x20AC;300 million I think. And lastly on the Russia revenues, I just noticed that the revenues were flat on last year while the loan I think were up something like 15% and I just wondered whether that was due to the technical glitch that you mentioned previously and whether we're seeing the trough of the sort of revenue margin if you wish or is it going to continue like that for a little more? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, hi. I will answer your question on the banking union, I will let <mark type="ph" /> Jean-Francois Martinique (31:08) comment on the jaws between cost of revenues in French retail, Bertrand will quickly comment on the capital assumption, but I don't think they're going to change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, now the answer is, mainly there is no change compared with one quarter ago. And on Russia, Bernardo will elaborate on the evolution of the revenues. First of all on the Banking Union, let me again just say the way I see the strategies in the eurozone countries, as you know, to segregate the banking issues, two and the country sovereign risk issue.</p>
          <p>And as we say, on the banking sector, I consider that once the Spanish system will have been handled, but we don't see in any country the similar asset level or real estate bubble that we had in Spain.</p>
          <p>And what is at stake is to ensure effectively that there is a supranational supervisor, able with the national ones, not only to get a clear picture of the current situation but going forward, to ensure of course, a consistency of the application of the different rules, but also to prevent if you wish, new and future problems in terms of risk taking or risk management.</p>
          <p>And effectively, as you say, the French Banking Federation is supporting that trend, before the overall universe of the European banks. We think it is one, an element &#x2013; one element not global solution, but one element in terms of future integration in the eurozone countries.</p>
          <p>Regarding more specifically, the risk weighted assets, I mean the risk weighted assets first of all, it is pretty natural that depending on the way you generate credit you might have different losses and hence, different risk weighted assets. I'm thinking in particular on the mortgage side and needless to comment on the cost of risk we've seen in the different countries in the U.S., the UK, Spain or France but let's say effectively that would help to have again harmonized treatment for similar kind of assets and as I said in particular with the way the regulation has been implemented in France, we are very supportive and comfortable with that kind of move. In terms of timeframe, let me remind you that I think that Europe has in mind basically to define how it would work and the timeframe before year end.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn to Jean-Francois on the French Retail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In French Retail, our target is clearly to have not too many jaws regarding NBI on cost. In fact, the first half was, in our view, quite good. We have NBI growing even if it is at a low level on the cost reducing we saw an increase in terms of GOI. For the second half, it would be probably more difficult to see the same FX rules like that we forecast a decrease regarding for example fees regarding direct debit due to an agreement that we passed with a commission &#x2013; with authority like in France. So it will be difficult to have NBI growing, so we're very close to zero and our objective is to have also the cost being very close to zero.</p>
          <p>Again, regarding so we forecast close to zero in terms of growth of GOI. In terms of costs, the cost were relative &#x2013; the cost of risk was I will say growing in the first half, but in our view it has &#x2013; the growth was less important than our previous forecast at the beginning of the year. And probably we expect that in Q3 and Q4, the impact of the recession, which is coming, will be more important. So, we forecast the cost of risk in the second half which will be closer to 50 basis points than to the 45 basis points that we are seeing in the first half.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you might &#x2013; you have to be careful because you are comparing probably the page 43 data on Rosbank with the page 15 data on Russia and this page 15 data includes <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:39) so the two magnitudes are not comparable. Having said that, the margins in Russia are under pressure and this is a trend which has been going on for the last six or nine months and this is the reason why we are putting the pressure on developing the fee-based revenues, which are less depending on the market conditions.</p>

Next question?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I have a question on capital, just coming back on Basel III, I mean, you stick to your guidance of 9% of 13%, but if you could just maybe give some indication where you think you're going to be in 2012 given that progression on the capital improvement seems to be a little bit softer than expected. And also maybe secondly any thoughts on maybe what could come up after the summer on the regional report on maybe banking reform in France, and what that impact could be for you? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Delphine, Bertrand will comment in a minute again on the pace of conversions to Basel III capital. Regarding the banking reform, let me say we have clearly highlighted to the French government that &#x2013; and here we talk about issues which go beyond the banking sector. With Basel III as we need in European eurozone in particular more capital market activity to finance the economy. It is of crucial importance both in terms of sovereignty, but in terms of efficiency of our economy to have strong players in the capital market industry anchored in the euro zone in order again to channel precisely to help to channel the savings of households and corporates to the needs of the economy.</p>
          <p>Having said that, it means according to us from an industrial if I may say point of view that splitting banks does not work. When you consider in theory this kind of model, the type of rating you would need, the type of market share with a fragmentation market that we have in Europe, we think it will not work. And so, we've said clearly to the government, we still believe the universal banking model is the best, the best suited to the eurozone countries, the best suited in terms of financing of the economy going forward and that of course, we are absolutely supportive of any additional reform on top of Basel III, which would help to rebuild confidence and ensure that taxpayers and people who put their money in the banks are confident with the security of the banks.</p>
          <p>Let me say again the model on the capital market which is driven by client-driven activities with risk under control as we all know. It's premature to comment, let me just say the French government had a very pragmatic attitude which was to anyway wait to get the outcome of the regional group at the European level. And I think he's very, very aware of all these challenges, if you read the transformation in Basel III and has clearly had a clear understanding of all these challenges. So, we might have a low after the regional again group results, but I'm pretty confident that reality and pragmatism will prevail.</p>
          <p>Now, Bertrand, a few words again on capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Delphine, on capital, I think the objective is still the same end of 2013, we will see in due time where we are end of this year or mid next year. I think the main elements provided this quarter &#x2013; provides comfort in this perspective. We have retained earnings, we have demonstrated our ability to deleverage the business. I think this is important. We have also demonstrated that we are able to manage our risk-weighted assets and the growth of our risk-weighted assets. So basically, we are in line with our trajectory, with our roadmap, and this roadmap is I would say self-sufficient and doesn't need any mini roadmap within the roadmap if I may say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hello. Good afternoon, everybody. So two questions then, maybe the first one will be if you could please come back on the different type of one-off that have affected the revenue line of some of your subsidiaries in the international retail division especially probably in Czech Republic and Sub-Saharan Africa. And also some question will be more around ALM strategy. I mean, we are seeing long-term bond deals falling off a cliff over the past few days and weeks. I was actually wondering whether this could have an impact on your hedging strategies that would push you into longer duration type of bonds that are higher risk probably not, but just asking, and also just in case what would be your reaction in case of ECB moving the deposit facility interest rates to a negative number. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will let Bertrand again come back to the one-off elements in international retail, but there is nothing in the Czech Republic neither international retail in Africa and Egypt, now really the big ones, where the ones that Bertrand commented and he might say a word on the ALM policy. Well regarding the ECB, if they were to move to negative rates, I don't think we would change very much our way of managing our liquidity. We have in the French banking sector as a whole have been probably the most supportive to the economy. And the growth of the loans is there compared with one year ago, more than in any large European countries. Secondly, we have enhanced our buffers of liquidity, and Bertrand has commented that with effectively money also in our accounts in the central banks. It's a kind of buffer and I don't think we will fundamentally &#x2013; we would fundamentally change our policy regarding that if again the ECB where to put negative rates on the money which is deposited. Bertrand, a quick word on the one-off ALM policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the one-off Thibault, there are certain elements which are a mix of pluses and minuses actually on international retail, which are some gains and losses which &#x2013; none of which is material. So we did not provide any disclosure, but clearly there is no impact going forward on the run rate of the top line of the international retail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding ALM strategy to complement on what has been said. The ALM strategy is not, I would say, a profit driven strategy and the objective of the ALM strategy is basically to protect the structural risk that the bank might be taking given this balance sheet and this profile. And so it does not change over the years. I'm looking at Didier was facing this. So there is continuity from that perspective and for many perspectives, and so we are trying to protect and immunize as much as possible, the structural risk that the bank might be taking in an environment which is &#x2013; as you rightly said difficult and evolving.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. My first question would be for Jean-Francois. Can you give us a little bit of color of how the outflows on the mutual funds are reused by the customers? Is it directly into side deposit or the saving side? Or is it purely to deleverage?</p>
          <p>The second question will be for Didier. You clearly highlighted that you had a very cautious strategy in Q2 with a VaR falling from &#x20AC;46 million to &#x20AC;25 million. What is your position for Q3? Are you staying with this kind of level and do we need to anticipate indeed very efficient way to allocate your capital, but still very low revenues? Thanks.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, if you should look at, for example, life insurance. In fact, we have net inflows in the first half of 2012. I think that if you compare it to our peers, it's a very specific situation, because we didn't decide to push our clients towards, I would say, balance sheet products. What is important to us and also for our clients is to have a good advice on what is a good product for the client. And we present that to the fact that to the increase of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In spite of this policy, we have clearly increased our balance sheet, because there is no interest for clients to stay in the money market trends as the net income is very close to zero. So, it's one of the reason to improve in our loan-to-deposit ratio, which is now at 125%, so which has decreased in the first half. If we look also at the outflows from the life insurance, because I said the net inflows would draw a lot outflows also.</p>
          <p>If we look at what are the, I will say, the reinvestment of this outflow, it's a mix between real estate investment from the individual clients and also reimbursement being back of their debt, regarding for example consumer credit or mortgage rate. They're mixed on a part of this. It's coming on our overall balance sheet of the group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one point, what I'm surprised is that for your positioning of high affluent customers through Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord and also with SocGen network that there is so much interest for regulated saving. Is it due to the advertising of the campaign of Mr. <mark type="ph" /> Roland (48:27) about the Livret A that has been bringing back to the mind of your customers that the Livret A exists or is it something that you try to push out a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Kindly, if you look at what could a French individual do with his money, the Livret A with 2.25 for a site deposit in fact, without any social tax, any taxes on this, it's the best way for the time being to keep your money in a secure way, which quite exciting.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just, Maxence, good afternoon first. Just to mention that unfortunately, we are not setting the VaR revenue of the quarter and then adding mechanically a revenue extrapolation. So, I will not mention what we expect for Q3 because, as I said, that is only five weeks quarter to date. But you've seen that the market has been different from the beginning of July to the recent days where there was some support following the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:04). So you can say that it's a mixed start of the quarter, I would say, in terms of trends.</p>
          <p>Also, I mean that comment, I will not take your low revenues, that is low capital, because I think that as we mentioned in the presentation, revenues were sound in our view. As we mentioned, the performance compared to our peers was in line. So clearly, we mentioned that that Q1 was exceptional in term of trends, especially on the fixed income side. So, what we've seen is just a normalization, maybe a bit less than a normalization as Bertrand was mentioning. But actually, we stated that we weren't expecting the fixed income business to be able to be at &#x20AC;1 billion in normal market condition.</p>
          <p>Also, when you look at the equity consumption allocated to SG CIB, the decrease that you've seen is now adjusting to the VaR. That is also the benefit of the deleveraging that we have started to implement. You've seen that the portfolio sales and some have been in the future, some have been not settled yet. And we'll continue a little bit so there'll be some further benefit. That's the income of reduction of the capital for the financing activity that we expect in Q3.</p>
          <p>And you've seen that there was almost 4% decrease Q2 versus Q1 despite the increase in the dollar. And on the market risk, policies due to the VaR and by extrapolation to this price of VaR, but also in terms of Basel 2.5, we have managed carefully some of our exposure together we did some capital release in transaction that under Basel 2. We are not as penalized from a capital standpoint than what they are in Basel 2.5. So that will also optimization of the portfolio that we've made over the last six to nine months.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Guillaume Tiberghien from Exane. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I have got two questions and one request if it's allowed. The first question is with regard to liquidity and funding. I'd like to know whether you have a sense as to what loan-to-deposit or also short-term versus liquid assets or also stable resources versus long-term assets do you think you will want to reach in a, I would say, equilibrium world.</p>
          <p>The second question is a little bit of detail on the revenues of the corporate center. If I take your &#x20AC;363 million reported revenues and I deduct the &#x20AC;305 million of ELM and &#x20AC;206 million of fair value gain on own debt, I get to minus &#x20AC;150 million. We were used to closer to minus &#x20AC;50 million or minus &#x20AC;100 million. So, is that a new run rate or we should go back to sort of minus &#x20AC;100 million per quarter? And the request is would you mind in the future giving us the NPL and coverage ratio in the various countries in Eastern Europe. I don't think I've got them unless I need them. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guillaume, hi. We can certainly provide you with more detail on the coverage and doubtful loans in each country, no problem. I will let Bertrand answer the question on the corporate center. Let me say on the liquidity, I think premature to have a clear view because first of all, even the regulation is not determined yet as you know. And let me also highlight that what we are seeing today again is a profound transformation of the financing of the economy. What was the role of banks for several hundred years so far was about transformation.</p>
          <p>And I think going forward we need probably to be a bit more careful about just saying there will be no further transformation in the world. But clearly as we've said, we are moving towards where the bank's balance sheet will be smaller, more market mechanism to finance the economy. It is something which has started and we have a key role to play on that. We say the final shape of all this, I think remains still a bit uncertain. You've seen the progress we are making on the loan to deposit in addition to retail activities. We will carry on doing this. You've seen the progress.</p>
          <p>In terms of self-financing, the specialized financing businesses, we will make further progress on that. You've seen the reduction of short-term liquidity requirements and the capacity to cover them with liquid assets. All that is there to stay. The final outcome, I think it's a bit premature at this stage. Bertrand, on the corporate center.</p>

          <p>Hello, Guillaume. On the corporate center, so <mark type="ph" /> as Philippe say (54:56) Hans and his team will provide you with the various figure that you are looking for. They must be available and you might not have found them at the right place. But we'll make sure that you get them. On the corporate center, as you know, it's a mix of different things, the one-offs, which we have pointed is the gain on the Tier II operation, also has impact on the profit or sometimes loss on our own debt. So these are the main elements.</p>
          <p>You also add in the previous quarters impact of the Greek debt. There is nothing really special about regarding the risk its mostly the internal financial relationship which relates to a number of elements, which are whether management of collateral, buffer remuneration, whatever. It's basically the financial system of the bank and so there is nothing special, which is worth discussing, I think, today.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Kinner Lakhani from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I wanted to pick up on a couple of points mentioned earlier. So firstly was following kind of Didier's comments on the financing side of the business. I think you previously outlined &#x20AC;750 million kind of recurring impact in terms of revenues. If I look at what's happened so far, it looks like it's somewhere between &#x20AC;0.4 billion or &#x20AC;0.6 billion, but then the market environment is much worse.</p>
          <p>I'm really trying to get a handle on how far we think we are in terms of the revenue impact on the financing business, which is kind of been a &#x20AC;500 million, &#x20AC;550 million number in the first two quarters of this year. And my second question was just to kind of follow-on on a disclosure you've given on Russia and all the rationalization that has already happened. Maybe just one more step in terms of what we should think next year in terms of the cost synergies or the cost savings from the kind of run rate that we've seen so far this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll let Didier answer your first question. Kinner, hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Kinner, hi. On the &#x20AC;750 million loss of revenue that we were expecting in the first half of this year, you should bear in mind that we have not sold the whole portfolios. So, we continue to have that here. Some carry on the portfolio that's for sale, I would say, as we intend to set our most of the loans even if there is a small visible part by end of this third quarter. Let's say Q4 will be a clean quarter. Let's say didn't get free of the tariff that we used to have on the portfolio that we have up for sale.</p>
          <p>But on top of that also, what is important to mention is that first, the other businesses were able to grow. When we look at our strengths, our expertise, for example in natural resources, we were able to grow the portfolio, to grow the revenue contribution year-to-date, which was extremely positive on both short-term trade financing, but also in terms of project finance. For example, we ran the bank advising and arranging the financing of a refinery in Egypt that was a quite visible at the end of the second quarter. And also, in certain activities where we decided to have no longer balance sheet usage, like for example, the aircraft financing.</p>
          <p>We've kept some of the teams. And now, they are turning to kind of more advisory role being able to fit to a structure to get the fees, but not to get the balance sheet. And so net-net, this clearly will help &#x2013; I know whether we mentioned mitigate, but at least to grow the business in a different way going forward. So, I think that the &#x20AC;750 million was really by unplugging the businesses that we have decided to sell.</p>
          <p>But also, you should have in mind that on the other side, we have some businesses which have either grow or reinvent themselves. There is also a slight positive impact from the dollar strengthening. That for us we continue to lend into dollar even if we have reduced funding in dollar. We continue to have some lending in dollar, which had also a slightly positive impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Bernardo, perhaps on the slightly longer term outlook for Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So we had the cost reduction plan. There are two sides. The first one is on the cost of personnel. And we should have next year the full year effect of the reduction of 2,000 people out of 20,000. So, slightly more than actually 10% of the workforce. So, this is already implemented this year and should have the full effect in 2013.</p>
          <p>Second part is the restructuring of the network, where we are actually incurring in non one-time costs for the restructuring of the network. And we should have also the full year effect of the reduction on the number of square meters that we use in the head offices and the regional branches in Russia.</p>
          <p>And we are also implementing the restructuring of the back offices, which will have no effect in 2012 and full-time effect in 2013. We have to be careful about the calculation, because the Russia is an inflationary country. So we have between 6% and 8% inflation on costs due to the evolution of the country. Initially from the 2011 point of view, we were targeting reduction of around 15% of the costs. But they don't have clear estimation &#x2013; a purely calculated estimation for 2013.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions also. I'm sorry. I'm coming back to the one-offs in the international retail banking. I had a question regarding the provision. You mentioned a specific client in Russia, to have an idea of the magnitude of this provisioning in Russia. And I have a feeling there is eventually one-off in Africa in terms of provision or if it is a new run rate on the level of provision.</p>
          <p>And if I may, I would ask also the losses that you booked in Greece in this quarter. And the second question regard systemic tax that you mentioned before. That will be in corporate center, if I'm not wrong in expenses. What I don't know is if in H2 this year, we will book this bank levy for the full year of only one semester or am I wrong in this assumption? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>International retail, the systemic tax has been established now one year and a half ago. So we already booked it. Now, the doubling has been decided in August and it will be booked basically in the second half quite effectively in practice the full year doubling if you wish.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Is it clear?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's how I was seeing it. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so you will see.....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So this will probably be booked third quarter end of first quarter. We discussed with the other banks how we do it. The impact should be roughly &#x20AC;70 million based on this figure. On the specific side in Russia there is one situation where we have booked &#x20AC;38 million cost of research. If you deduct that, you will see that the underlying trend is okay. And as for Americas, you could see if you just didn't take into account the specific situation, I'm not sure where this idea for one-off in Africa comes from to be honest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a one-off. I see &#x20AC;40 million provision in Q2. And last year, it was &#x20AC;9 million. Then there is an impact on difference I don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there was &#x2013; be careful. Last year, there was the Ivory Coast, we might have booked things and take out provisions. I'm not sure that last year reflects necessarily the other trends.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes, good afternoon. Two questions. The first one is on the market risk weighted assets, which is down a lot this quarter. What do you recommend us to do on the modeling? Will that be wise to just reverse the 20 bps impact in the model by the end of 2013 or are you feeling you can kind of sustain the &#x20AC;19 billion market with covered assets over the next say two years? Or will that reverse when the market normalizes? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And question number two is on your U.S. dollar liquidity. You provide useful balance sheet details on the page eight. But after significant de-leveraging, where are you in terms of excess off-table funding in U.S. dollar versus your long-term U.S. dollar assets. Can you just update us a little bit more specifically on U.S. dollar, how you stand there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the risk-weighted assets, I think basically, we have a lot of parameters which enter into the calculation. It's not just the question of modeling, but just the evolution also of the rating. I'm not sure we can really answer properly your question on the capital market the low again, low exposure. Didier, do you have any further insights?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I was mentioning, the VaR is one of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:06:15) decrease of the risk-weighted asset. And by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:06:20) VaR has been <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:06:24) impact. Altogether, I would say in the &#x20AC;8 billion reduction, &#x20AC;7.5 billion reduction of risk-weighted asset equivalent that you've seen, you have on the VaR something like 50%, which is coming from spread VaR.</p>
          <p>So, the rest has been more proactive management of our exposure under IFC and CRN. So we should have added &#x20AC;2.5 billion. Clearly, it has been we've had some position. And it's part of the mitigation action that has been already discussed that we implemented in reducing the consumption coming from these two items. So, I would say 50% of the reduction comes from VaR and by extrapolation spread VaR. 50% is coming from proactive management of our asset credit exposure under IFC and CRN.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the dollar funding, as you know, the biggest issue was a short-term dollar funding which has been the main item, which created the crisis last summer. Here again, as I said, the short-term, we moved down from the 50%, even above 50%. We are not very original. I mean most French banks are in the same situation, down to something which is closer to 1.25% to 1.28% in terms of short-term dollar funding. On the long-term side, there is no issue basically. I mean, there is no problem regarding the long-term side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And more generally going forward, I would like to remind you that the whole strategy is, of course, to presage leverage on our U.S. dollar platform, to refinance where we need to finance in dollars and typically we did that for projects, also for corporate side, it's part of the transformation of the business model in CIB. Next question?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, good afternoon. So, I'll stick to two questions as well. The first question I have is on the cost in CIB. So indeed, there was a clear improvement in Q2 and you mentioned several times on this call that you expect some further improvement with the completion of the restructuring plan. I was just wondering whether you could quantify this or give us, at least, some guidance on how much you expect cost to decrease following the restructuring there, or if you could give us a target cost income ratio for CIB. And the second question is actually on RWA as well. So I understand what you just said on the market RWA, but I was just wondering whether you had also some FX impact on your RWA? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost base, I will not, let's say, detail what will be the further decrease in H2. But, let's say, as Bertrand was mentioning that the decrease that we've seen in costs, excluding bonuses was, let me check, was something like 9% year-on-year. There was a 4% decrease quarter-on-quarter. So I think that we should be able to get further about 2% to 3% in Q3 compared to Q2, because of the full benefit from the plan in France. After that, the results of the mitigation, depending on the revenue trends which will come from the bonus calculation, which is something that is more linked to the revenue rather than our own, cost containment or cost reduction measures. So that's for the cost base. So you should expect some further, excluding bonuses, some further decrease in Q3 and in H2. On the....</p>

          <p>For us, you know, the priority is clearly to contain the risk in GENIKI. It is clearly the case. You know that we have been able to maintain a very strong liquidity profile on the subsidiary. We have a &#x20AC;300 million total exposure of equity and hybrid in the subsidiary. On top of that, in terms of Greek exposure for the group, let me just remind you, we have roughly &#x20AC;500 million on a global basis of additional Greek exposure. So, as you can see, it's very well ring-fenced, very well contained. The priority is to maintain that. We've, as you know, the benefit potentially if we did, of the liquidity from the Central Bank, that for the time being, we've been able to maintain a good level of deposits and there is no issue on that.</p>

          <p>On the tax rate, I think it's fluctuating. As you know, we said, there are a number of businesses which are generating, depending on the quarter some tax credit. So, there is no underlying trend, it's mostly the one-off impact of some tax credit-driven business this quarter. I'm not sure....</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I was just wondering, should we see Q2 on good level, more like a run rate for the second half, which would sort of like suggest a 4% decline second half versus first half? And then more specifically on the investment bank, you said that there will be an ongoing trend of reduction, so that would suggest, as well, that Q2 will be more an indication of the second half. I was wondering if this is correct. And then I was very interested about your comment about the trend in cost in CIB with and without bonuses, the difference. So the large impact on your costs from the change in bonuses, did you change your &#x2013; how you defer, or how much you defer, or you're just doing a more flatter accrual over the quarter or was there any other change or is it just absolutely less? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Anke. Now on the cost basis of the CIB, as I said first, excluding bonuses, we should expect some further decrease in Q3 compared to Q2. As I said, we were down excluding bonuses by 9% year-on-year and something like around 4% quarter-on-quarter. And as we have not the full benefit of the head count reduction in our second quarter cost base, which should be lower in third quarter.</p>
          <p>On the bonus, I will not comment on the overall quarterly evolution, but have in mind that the way we do calculate, there is no shift in the deferred percentage compared to the last year. So we continue to have the same <mark type="ph" /> first (01:17:14) threshold, and also structure of deferred and non-deferred and equity-linked and non-equity linked compared to last year. And something quite important, it has been noticed that for French banks in general and Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale in particular, the way we do calculate our bonus is compliant with <mark type="ph" /> ESSB (01:17:33) recommendations, so I think that it shows that we are already on track with best practice of the market industry in terms of deferred part and also structure between the share or index in share and cash component.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Robin Down from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've only got one question, really and I'm afraid it's to come back to Russia. Obviously, you've got an 80% cost income ratio there, suggestion is that you've got some quite intense margin pressure coming through in the business. And from a cost perspective, it's difficult to take the cost down hugely because the cost inflation that's coming through that's offsetting the head count reduction. So, really it's just a question of returns. You've got a reasonable amount of capital tied up in the business, what comfort can you give investors, that you can generate a decent economic profit from the Russian business? And I'm conscious that, a lot of your competitors, some of your peers have pulled out of Russia, including obviously, our own parent.</p>
          <p>So, what comfort can you give them that you will be able to get a decent economic return there? And in particular, I'm conscious that your minority shareholder in Rosbank has publicly said recently that they would like you to buy out the minority, perhaps you could comment on the possibility of that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robin, let me take a step back on the Russia. When I think about the world in the coming years, if we take for granted that in mature market there will be no growth or limited growth and that you will have saturated banking markets with pressure on commissions, et cetera, looking forward, looking ahead, there are not so many places where the banking industry will find growth. And we consider that Russia is one of the very few places, and I must say, from an economic point of view, we consider that the economic growth in Russia should remain, for example, robust in 2012 and 2013.</p>
          <p>In this market, as you said, very marginal players, foreign players have exited because it's a big market and there is no point, in particular with the consolidation which is taking place in this market to be very small. And when you look at the market, at the end of the day, in two, three, four years' time, I think you will have landscape, which will look like most of banking markets, I mean, probably a very strong concentration of market share in less than 10 banks, and at the end of the day, with a limited number of foreign banks.</p>
          <p>And so for us the strategy challenge is really to confirm our position of leading foreign bank. One thing I would like again to highlight is that in the way we report and Bernardo said that, we are splitting our Russian operation now, which are fully consolidated into one roof, in two places. So it is, and even three, if I take into account the revenue generation in CIB with Russian clients. So clearly today probably the way we report does not reflect the way we manage and the way we're going to manage the business going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look at the business as Bernardo said, if on the retail side, not only we are growing, but from a market risk capital perspective, we are absolutely comfortable with that. The challenge for us is more on the corporate side. And I think personally, our capacity precisely to convince investor that we can get a decent return is more on the corporate side.</p>
          <p>Taking into account not just the loan products, but going forward, the capacity we will have to develop all the businesses, in particular as Bernardo was saying also, fee income. As well actually on the retail side, we're developing the insurance product very nicely, which is a fee income and compensate for, again, on the margins. And it is a very still growing business model. So that's where we stand and we've said clearly that from a risk perspective, we have, I think a sound portfolio. We have reviewed, as we said, very comprehensively the guarantees attached to commercial real estate and as we've said there was need just to complement one file.</p>
          <p>So, that's the challenge. We will come back to you in due course, but that's the challenge and we remain, I must say, confident to be able, progressively, to develop that corporate business. When I speak to clients at the end of the day, that's what is important. And I speak to a lot of the clients, when I say to them, are you interested in meeting with or having an alternative to Russian banks with Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, they say yes.</p>
          <p>And Russia is still a territory of investment by European clients. That's very clear. So, I think there is still a very strong strategic interest. We still have now, of course, to demonstrate that we can make a decent return and it's more gross operating challenge today than a risk one and net operating income.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Regarding your legacy asset portfolio, you've got &#x20AC;2.8 billion of capital for those assets remaining. It seems to me that you should aim to release about half of that in order to achieve the remainder of your core capital target from 30 bps to 70 bps, in terms of mitigation. Is that in line with your own thinking there?</p>
          <p>And then, in terms of those legacy assets to be cracked, would you be focusing on those where the book value is close to the fair value? Or is the fact that you still have got &#x20AC;2 billion in difference between fair value and book value, does that have no influence whatsoever in your strategy there in terms of cracking that portfolio? And then secondly, with respect to TCW, obviously you've taken &#x20AC;200 million impairment there, does that have any impact on your 50 bps to 100 bps target for non-core deleveraging there in any way? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will let Didier or Bertrand comment on legacy asset, comment on the legacy assets. The impairment on TCW is not related to capital generation. I think it's truly a goodwill <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:25:17), it has no impact. Bertrand, the legacy asset disposal strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On legacy assets, I think the strategy, I hope, is clear now. We have on the one hand non-investment grade, on the other hand, money-good assets. Money-good assets do not provide, even if we sell them, significant capital relief. So, it's more managed vis-&#xE0;-vis the liquidity requirement and the liquidity requirement are little because most &#x2013; I mean, not most but the big part of this assets or synthetic assets.</p>
          <p>If I focus on the money &#x2013; on the non-investment grade assets, which is out of your question, it's true that so far, out of the 40 bps related to the deleverage, more than the 30 bps are related to legacy assets. This being said, it's not kind of arithmetic move quarter-after-quarter. It just cannot derive unfortunately from one quarter the trend for the next quarter, it's really a bps by bps. And you can also from time to time lose and gain bps depending on the way CDO is hedged and the way this hedge is itself hedged and so and so forth. So, it's not because we've done 40 bps so far, that we will do 40 bps in the next six months. It will take a little bit more time.</p>
          <p>The strategy is very clear. We want to get rid of the maximum of this asset as soon as possible, and we'll do our best to do this. As I said in my introduction, it's time-consuming, it's a painful process. Cracking the CDO is not something you do overnight. It takes months. And once you've cracked the CDO then you have to start selling the underlying assets. We sold, as an example, &#x20AC;400 million roughly of this type of assets over the last quarter, and we'll continue to do that. So, here again, the trend is there, the strategy is clear, but it's not going to be linear, if I may say so. I don't know, Didier, if you want to add something? No? Okay.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Just to get back to that sharp decline in value at risk, if I turn to slide eight, where you've got your funded balance sheet, you show your client-related trading assets at &#x20AC;65 billion, that's falling sharply year-over-year, but actually quarter-on-quarter, it's barely moved. So, I wondered what's driving that divergence, stable client-related trading assets, but value at risk falling sharply. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Didier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no obvious correlation between the current trading assets and the value at risk. So I think that it's, the value at risk, are a function, first, of the position that we do carry on behalf our accounts held, but also on the level of the scenarios, which are computed on a daily basis. So as soon as there is a stress on the dial, which took place in Q3, you could have some other scenarios that appears, or you could have some other scenarios that disappear, and so I think that it's something much more complicated.</p>
          <p>So, you won't be able to extrapolate anything from the evolution of the current trading assets into the value at risk. Having in mind also, value at risk does capture some derivative exposure, which are not in the current trading, because in the presentation that we've made, derivatives are net replacement <mark type="ph" /> of the review (01:28:34) they are mark-to-market has been netted and so, there is no obvious link at all between the two metrics.</p>
