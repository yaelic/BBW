        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss second quarter results. Reviewing a few of the highlights, quarterly net income was sequentially flat, about 32% higher year over year. Brazilian market continues to grow at a rapid pace with demand up 9% from a year ago and 19% in rest of the year. <mark type="ph" /> With Santos pre-salt (2:30) the first well of Lula's Pilot produced 36,000 Boe per day and we have initiated three new extended well tests in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:44).</p>
          <p>We successfully released our five-year plan which maintains the same level of CapEx but with greater percentage outstanding dedicated to upstream activity, particularly the pre-salt. We will also begin our 13 billion divestment program to better allocate our resources. In June, Moody's upgraded Petrobras from Baa1 to A3 reflecting the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow and the profitability opportunities that lay before us in the future.</p>
          <p>Looking at the key indicators, operating income for the second quarter was down 4% sequentially while net income was flat. Our 1% decline in production by growing the net market higher cost for imported product and a strengthening real were the most important factors in determining our results. Year over year, quarterly operating income was <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:10) net income was up 32 <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:16).</p>
          <p>Production. The year-over-year production in the first half of the year was up 2% as expected. First- half production was below our 2011 annual target of 2.1 million barrels per day due to higher scheduled maintenance and planned maintenance and the small delays in the start-up of some new wells also contributed to lower production in the first half.</p>
          <p>Natural gas production is up 7% from last year as production capacity is now in place to meet growing Brazil demand for gas. Additional production <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:13) primarily LNG. Our international production declined by 5% primarily due to the schedules and of the cost <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:25) for our Nigerian production.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we concluded our operations in Ecuador. The ramp-up of <mark type="ph" /> DT7 (5:34) which was 180,000 barrels per day capacity and which produced 72,000 barrels per day in the second quarter and this is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:53) with 100,000 barrels per day capacity which began producing on Monday are expected, together with the Lula Pilot to be the principal driver of growth in the second half. By the end of the year, we expect to reach our peak production of 2,250,000 barrels per day. We will resume our daily average of 2.1 million barrels per day of oil in Brazil plus or minus 2.5% for 2011.</p>
          <p>Since 1980, our compounded annual growth rate has been 10% as shown in this slide. Sometimes growth has been slower, other times faster, but the average has been 10%. Our history has been to grow by finding new oil reserves, new frontiers that we buy advancing the technologies and know-how. As we have transitioned from onshore to offshore and from shallow water to deep water, there has been times when growth was less than 10%.</p>
          <p>When development is fully underway in the new frontier, growth accelerates. The pre-salt will be a repeat of our past. We are expanding into a new frontier. This takes time. Some of the resource now dedicated pre-salt have increased current production. But we are now beginning to see the results of our efforts in the pre-salt. As we ramp up production from these highly production and huge reserve <mark type="ph" /> wells (8:13) starting with fixing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:20) under construction, we are highly confident that we can exceed the 10% growth rate of the past, producing 4.9 million barrels per day in 2012.</p>
          <p>Update of pre-salt. This brings us to our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:48) pre-salt. We have drilled a total of 30 wells to date and expect to have drilled another five at the end of the year. Currently in pre-salt drilling, in the pre-salt launch there are currently three systems produced in the area, the Lula Pilot and this lower path of producing the extended well pass in Guar&#xE1; and Lula Nordeste.</p>
          <p>The development of pre-salt &#x2013; when we created our market plan for the development of the pre-salt, we divided the development into three stages. First we have Phase 0, responding to exploration and operations, Phase 1a which is development phase based on known technology and practice and phase 1b which is the application of new technologies we expect to happen out there.</p>
          <p>Phase 0 is fully underway with Lula Pilot and two systems capable of producing extended well tests. All the units contemplated in phase 1a are either under construction or being contracted.</p>
          <p>This includes four large pilots under construction to be delivered in tranches, '12 and '13 and the other two <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:37). The <mark type="ph" /> well (10:42) controls are also now under construction.</p>
          <p>Finally to develop the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:48) barrels, we recently acquired four <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:49) and have leased the Inha&#xFA;ma Shipyard <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:01). But Petrobras is committed to developing the local industry to supply the offshore oil industry in Brazil. The greatest efficiency can be achieved by having local suppliers who are committed with our needs located adjacent to our operations. But for the industry to be sustainable, it must be competitive in quality, cost and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:32).</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:37) and design of the concession terms, the regulatory system and Petrobras policies. Developing a local industry required careful planning, proper incentives and perhaps, most importantly, time. Along these lines, you can see that local content requirements have successfully <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:02) in these grounds. As you can also see, many of the projects that will be developed over next five years were acquired in the early parts where the local contents requirement was less.</p>
          <p>This gives us the flexibility and time to develop a competitive local industry while meeting the contractual terms of each concession, and present bids for these as their source comparison and other top side equipment. We are receiving internationally competitive bids in each <mark type="ph" /> and search try (12:37) for local content from the supplier increases over time.</p>
          <p>What makes Petrobras and the development of the local industry so unique is that it is in a <mark type="ph" /> cost term freighted (12:57) area with huge, huge coverage, deploying technologies that had been evolving over 20 years.</p>
          <p>These conditions give us the ability to understand <mark type="ph" /> each comparison (13:13) and plans for our needs for the long-term horizon. We can use our experience to create incentive for local investments by suppliers, such as standardization, the scale and long term pay hole agreements.</p>
          <p>Looking at the prices. Given that in the international price for oil during the last year is obviously an important factor in our results. In the last nine months the price <mark type="ph" /> of Brent (13:54), which impacts both revenue and costs, have increased by $40 per barrel. Due to our operating policy of minimizing price volatility in the Brazilian market, increased international price was not fully reflected in the domestic price.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter of 2011, the average realization price for all our products sold was $105 per barrel versus an average price in the U.S. of $122 per barrel for the same basket of products. Our pricing policy remains to <mark type="ph" /> pull international volatility (14:42) over the major carriers. As we have done since through the regulation of the Brazilian market at the beginning of 2002.</p>
          <p>Looking at the lifting costs. During the quarter, lifting costs <mark type="ph" /> for abutment (15:10) increased by 10% in reais, and 15% in dollars. This follows upon similar increase during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our systems in Campos Basin are maturing, which require additional maintenance that is reflected in lifting cost. Lower production from scheduled and unscheduled maintenance added to the cost.</p>
          <p>Also the high cost of oil and gas to raise the cost of third party services, material and other charges. In the last six months, oil price increased by $30 per barrel, while lifting cost increased by approximately $15 per barrel. During the last 10 years, our lifting cost have historically averaged 10% of our realization price for a barrel of oil, so this latest increase is consistent with past experience. Production taxes also rose by $5 a barrel as a result of the higher value of our oil, which is based on international benchmarks.</p>
          <p>Demand for petroleum derivatives in Brazil continues to exceed the GDP growth. The growth is driven by gains in real income, gasoline, <mark type="ph" /> petroleum, (16:49) due to price differentials and increasing due to using <mark type="ph" /> Brazilian roughly due with (16:57) other industry. To meet growth, we are investing to capture margins and produce more of the what the market requires.</p>
          <p>We are now seeing the results: capacity utilization of 92% was at all time highs with our <mark type="ph" /> headwind of (17:20) domestic oil, which is 81% of throughput. Production <mark type="ph" /> of diesel (17:26) and gasoline has increased while outputs for fuel oil has been reduced. The combined impact has been to produce higher volume products while reducing the logistical cost of importing and exporting oil and products.</p>
          <p>Natural gas consumption for several SKUs continues to grow up by 8% year-over-year. For non-thermal use, the growth was 8% year-over-year. Thermol demand was literally unchanged and with the <mark type="ph" /> hydraulic operation, our lateral scorings (18:22) were actually above normal, thermal escalation is in the second semester is not expected to materially increase. Our increase in gas demand was satisfied by domestic production which have much better margins relatively to import gas.</p>
          <p>Turning to financial results. Revenue for the second quarter were up slightly from the prior quarter due to higher domestic sales, volumes and exports at a higher price. The increases in revenue were largely offset by higher cost of imports, higher production taxes and higher lifting and refining costs.</p>
          <p>Expense increased by R$528 million with higher exploration expense and inventory adjustments, <mark type="ph" /> at least all items (19:33) believing to increased. As a result of these factors, operating income declined by 4% when compared with the first quarter, while EBITDA of R$16.1 million was stable.</p>
          <p>Net financial results increased by R$873 million from the prior quarter as a result of the devaluation of the dollar and its impact on liability that are linked to the dollar. Higher income from cash and equivalents also contributed to the gains. This increase was primarily offset by deducting the earnings of non-controlled subsidiary generated largely by exchange gains from dollars liability. As a consequence of lower operating income, partially offset by higher income from monetized assets, net income was flat from the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating income for E&amp;P in Brazil increased by 13% as a result of higher price. Partially offsetting the benefit of higher price was a small decrease in production and the higher lifting cost, particularly those associated with production tax. <mark type="ph" /> We ordered gas, oil, live urea (21:20) results of higher exploration and <mark type="ph" /> bright flow extend (21:23). The downstream segment experienced an operating loss of R$2.6 million in the first quarter versus an operating loss of near R$500 million in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Downstream revenues increased due to the higher export price, higher volume and higher price for domestic products that track international price. Cost of goods sold increased as a result of higher price for crude oil feedstock and imported products, which increased faster than the products sold in Brazil. Refining cost increased by R$1.2 per barrel or slightly less than $1. Program maintenance was responsible for 58% of the cost increase.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2011, we performed 61% of the planned maintenance versus only 37% last year. With much of the maintenance behind us here, we expect refining costs to be lower for the rest of the year, <mark type="ph" /> material companies (22:53) and chemicals account for much of the remaining cost increase. The growing complexity of our system, particular, to remove sulfur was largely responsible for this increase.</p>
          <p>The Gas &amp; Power segment results improved due to higher sales volume of natural gas, and better margins as low cost from natural gas due to more expensive imported gas. Electric generation was lower, but <mark type="ph" /> in the future (23:33) at least the exports to us have seen improved margin and have increased income.</p>
          <p>International operating income declined as a result of lower production, due primarily to the <mark type="ph" /> end of gas (23:48) volume from our Nigerian production. Income from our Distribution segment was lower by increasing volumes due to lower margin.</p>
          <p>CapEx. Capital spending totaled R$32 billion during the first half of the year. <mark type="ph" /> Since 2011 (24:12), a decline of 16% from the first half of 2010. The <mark type="ph" /> first capital expenditure (24:20) last year saw the completion of a number of large projects, which have year-over-year comparison. Also, the <mark type="ph" /> profit (24:31) appreciation of the real contributed to lower level <mark type="ph" /> to import to standing plant level gas and paid or (24:45) in dollars lower when expressed in real. Finally, excess rain caused construction delays on the <mark type="ph" /> Campos (24:59) refinery and Comperj refinery in the first half.</p>
          <p>Investment is starting to pick up in the second half of the year, with this <mark type="indiscernible" /> budget cycle. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:09).</p>
          <p>We continue to have a very comfortable position with respect to both liquidity and leverage. For the past year we have maintained our net debt to net capital of 17%, while the net debt to EBITDA remained as <mark type="ph" /> of 1st May (25:45) time.</p>
          <p>Cash and cash equivalents, including government securities with maturities above 90 days, were R$59.5 billion as of June 30. Our integrated model and pricing policy allows us to maintain stable cash flows, even in a declining oil market. This gives us the confidence that we can maintain our strength of our cash flow and balance sheet in these uncertain times.</p>
          <p>With that overview, we will now be happy to answer any questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Almir, two questions. One on the CapEx, first half you did R$32 billion. Your budget is a revised budget, the lower one is about 85. So if we base on the run rate I would suggest you need to do about R$26.4 billion a quarter in the second half comparing to the first half about R$16 billion. What's the likely that you're actually going to even hit opposed to the revised budget? Or should we assume that you're going to be at least about 10% below that level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, Petrobras solution is there's more CapEx in the second half than the first. But I would like to add some other views on that. The number of weeks we've received will increase <mark type="ph" /> the standing and really is a (28:20) viable amount on the CapEx for Petr&#xF3;leo Brasileiro, and we did receive a number of them during the course of this first half of the year. But when a new rig arrives, it takes some one, two, three months <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:41) full speed, or the rig itself they are brand new. The team operating the rig is a new team. Normally they are of course experienced people, but there are a mix with new people. And this requires some time to get used to the equipment and adjust to full speed.</p>
          <p>So gives us more &#x2013; I see that more as a matter of a mix of projects being developed than &#x2013; and the natural roles that happen in the course of time. We are always growing our CapEx. And at the same time last year, we have entered some important projects that requires at the end of the period a higher volume of investment. So that's why we see getting to R$45 billion as feasible or very close to that figure is what we are expecting at this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. For my second question, if we look back at the time I think a couple of years ago when we start taking about building the deepwater rig in the country, the original expectation is that the 28 rig, that package would start to coming on stream by 2013. Now of course, the first 8 rigs that we are now building that now will be coming on stream until 2015, so there's a vacuum or gap in the 2013 to '14 or maybe even '15 in terms of the number of rigs you need and what is currently already contract. How the company is going to close that gap? And if you're going to soliciting the rig from the market on the existing fleets, when you are going to do it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which gap?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. To some extent the question is obviously when we originally announced the 28 rigs and we've now contracted to build the seven, but at a longer timeframe than was originally discussed, I think the question, Paul, would be is there any gap in the number of rigs that we need over the next three to five years? Is that right, Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. And if there's &#x2013; I mean because originally you was assuming that 28 rigs, some of them will start &#x2013; will be available in 2013, '14 and '15. Now that they won't be available until 2015, so that means that comparing to your initial target, at least there's a gap. Now the question is that gap still exists? Or that has been changed because of your work program change?  And if that gap indeed still exists, how you are going to close the gap? Are you going to soliciting rig from the existing fleet market? If you do so, then when you are going to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This gap &#x2013; what's important here is saying that our current plan is based on the rig target. And the rigs that are being built under contract will be delivered mainly this year next year and 2013. We found rigs that are able to drill up to 3,000 meters of water. We expect to have 39, three nine, by the end of 2013. These rigs are what we need for implementing the plan we have up to 2015/2016. And we have, yes, there were some delays on the first rig of the 28 also we built here, but we did hire rigs from the market that were not in our plan two, three, four years ago. We acquired four or five rigs from the markets that were available, and some of them is already producing and <mark type="ph" /> bringing throughout this moment (33:34). So what we have in our plan here according to the availability of the rigs that are in our hands at this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; and then let me just want to make sure I understand, Almir. So that means that you do not believe there's a gap in your well program in terms of the need of rig &#x2013; of the additional rig in 2013, 2014 comparing to what you currently already contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. There is no more need of extra rigs in 2013, '14 and '15, 2015 or on to implement &#x2013; to reach the production target of 2020. We need the extra 28 to be delivered, each of them. We have seven under contract, and 21 in bidding process at this moment, but this is for the period beyond 2015.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had two questions. The first one just on the appraisal well that you guys are drilling now in Franco, I just wanted to understand its significance, and particularly with regards to the whole discussion about the flank of structure and the Franco area. The question I had was, are you guys drilling that in the flank of the Franco structure? Or is that at the tip of the Franco structure? And do you think that that's going to allow you guys to close the gap between the volume estimates that D&amp;M and Gaffney had that were so different for the area?  Then I have a second one, but if you want to take that one first it's probably easiest.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess maybe we're really looking for is will the second well help us to close the difference between what Gaffney Cline and what D&amp;M said in their estimate of the reserves in Franco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With regard what we have in that is two wells; we needed to drill two wells in Franco. We are drilling the first one. We are doing a pre-drill site today until the end of this year in expectation we will grow until mid of 2012, and then we will drill the second well. We are going to do an extended well test and only then we can declare the commercial visibility. By then we will know the volume that Franco has.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, that's fair. Let me then ask you the second question. Barbassa, I wanted to understand, and this comes back to the domestic fuel price discussion, but I just wanted to have a feel from you guys how much do you think you actually have as a cost to bring product into the Brazilian market?  So if you have decided to just simply shut down your refineries, I know it's a completely unrealistic assumption, but if you decided to shut down your refineries and just import fuel into Brazil, how much would be the cost on a dollar per barrel basis?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The logistics costs associated with bringing product to the Brazilian market, so yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The logistic costs is not only import. It is import and exported <mark type="ph" /> today (38:38). What we are saying here is that this cost is around $8 of total in two ways...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Gustavo, just to add some comments on this. If you noticed that as you had, this is a very difficult assumption to make because this value <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:08) telling you that we purchased at first, I mean 100,000, 200,000 or 300,000 barrels per day of import. But when you go further if you had, for example, as you said, a shutdown of our refineries, we would probably reach very sooner our limits in terms of the capacity of the terminals, the pipelines, everything. So importing a lot of products above this level of 300,000 or 400,000 barrels per day will actually move new CapEx in terms of adjusting infrastructure, segregating different grades of diesel and gasoline.</p>
          <p>So not the end &#x2013; and besides that, we would also have to import products from countries that are more distant than the lowest, the cheaper market. So importing marginally is a very different business when compared to importing massive volumes of diesel and gasoline and jet fuel. So it would mean all in much more &#x2013; much higher cost of imports in terms of ships, but also in terms of CapEx, a lot of new things to deal; it's a lot of pipelines to make feasible this operation that would be very risky besides the cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, guys, the reason I ask, and I just wanted to understand from your perspective, Barbassa. We heard in the Brazil call that there has been no real change to the policy of the company with regards to domestic fuel prices. And as I look at this quarter, there's one thing that's completely novel for me. I think it's the first time ever I've seen Petrobras have an average realization price that is actually lower than the price that you have for the sale just of your oil, okay?  In the past even though I could argue that you didn't have a positive spread via Brent, you always were selling more than what your oil was worth. And I just wanted to understand from you guys, is that in anyway a restriction? Is that, I would say, one of those little flags that we should note as being something that triggers a desire from the company to increase prices?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gustavo, really, this is the first time I start this comparison. What means that this is not an indicator we use internally to <mark type="ph" /> such (42:02) a price. The adjustment for us is more related to the expectation of future prices today in the market than what is happening in the marginal supply of the country or supply of our imports.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I have a question on the earnings sensitivity. I wonder if you could give us an idea of what would be the earning sensitivity to changes in oil prices after you take into account the regularly fixed prices on the downstream side, the special participation tax and the very large volumes of products imported?  I'm asking this because I have the impression that we are near a point where earnings are declining with higher oil prices. I wonder if you can help me understand that?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a figure to tell you, but from all the information I brought and the analysis we have done here we saw even if we don't move the price of gasoline and diesel we have other products, as we have exports, that go to international markets and other products that tax the international price. So there is an increase in the results of the company as we have international price with no change in the diesel and gasoline price in the mass market. In spot &#x2013; and when you see it on the dollar, you look at the dollar result of the company is that we had an increase in price in the realization price of 15% since last year. And as many other company reports in dollars or when we compare we had an increase in result as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm asking because that when you take a look at quarter-on-quarter comparisons, you see the upstream making R$1.5 billion more, and the downstream making R$2.2 billion less. I wonder if there's some &#x2013; probably some unusual factor or there's something more than that?</p>

          <p>No, there is one &#x2013; another factor that is 1% less in production for the E&amp;P. So if they had the same production, probably they would show a higher increase comparing with the downstream, and there were also during these two quarters another important point. We had an increase in our...</p>

          <p>The inventory effect, and definitely <mark type="ph" /> we are skewed up (45:50). We have to build our oil and gas inventories here in Brazil due to a stoppage in one of our important pipelines. So we did not &#x2013; all the oil that was produced by E&amp;P were not sold because we had new production platform that was built for production maintenance.</p>
          <p>The production platform maintained on them volume of oil. As they grow huge they have not then the first production accumulating and remain in the platform during the life of the platform, so the buildup of these export &#x2013; these volumes of oil reduced this volume <mark type="ph" /> of stale (47:03) during the second quarter of this year.</p>

          <p>Okay. If I can ask the last question. I mean, how confident you are that in a context of oil prices declining, let's say, $20 from current levels you will keep your local prices which are not adjusted by oil prices at the same level?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I'd like to go back a little bit to the discussion from the previous call, again, related to the rising costs of both lifting and refining. I'm not sure if you could help us separate here how much of the lifting cost increase is actually recurring and how much is non-recurring? We all acknowledge the explanations on heavier maintenance and limited production growth, but if at all possible, separate what's recurring and what's not and government take in the lifting cost ex government take? And then on the refining front I was, I mean, I was actually comparing, for example, the refining cost of the fourth quarter of 2010 where &#x2013; which was also heavily impacted by maintenance and the number was almost &#x2013; more than 20% lower than the number presented this quarter. So again, I guess there's something more than refining which would be very good to be able to understand with more clarity, so this would be question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two relates to local content, and actually you presented a very interesting chart showing that Petrobras has a lot more flexibility than what's apparent in terms of local content. So the question is would you be prepared to go for lower local content within the limits, of course, but the lower local content or different than what you've been stating publicly to make sure you manage to deliver on production growth? Or the 50%, 60% level of production of local content is something that the company is not going to give up in any scenario, so potential delays in costs and higher costs remain an issue?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. The speaker line has been reconnected. Please proceed. Ms. Kovarsky, if you could repeat your question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first question relates to lifting and refining costs. In the case of lifting cost, we all acknowledge the issue with higher maintenance and lower production growth in the quarter. But if it all possible, I would like to have a feeling on what's recurring and what's not. Let's say between $9 and $13 per barrel lifting costs, which has been one of the trends before that spike on the lifting. On the refining front that was actually comparing fourth quarter 2010 refining costs, which were at least 20% lower than the number presented this quarter and this was actually a quarter that was heavily impacted by maintenance, so again, trying to understand the difference between some $4.5 and $5.5 per barrel refining costs.</p>
          <p>And the second question relates to local content. You've presented a very interesting chart showing that Petrobras' flexibility towards local content is a lot higher than it seems to be. So the question is would Petrobras be prepared to use that flexibility, importing more, contracting more offshore, as a means to guarantee delivering on production growth and cost or the decision could go for higher local content to something that it's tough to touch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:43) No, but here and now we have many products in production that was, is strong and improved once we begin that slide <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:25) the regarding the lifting cost, I need to take with the special participation and royalty across the profit on the oil side and exchange rate. But if you take only the lifting cost without the government take, which is nearly R$ 21, that's better.</p>
          <p>Plus a great part of this is intervention cost for maintenance required from this mainly in the surplus space and while you have a wealth of maturing fields. So I think utilization will continue. That is something that we can expect that will proceed to the second half of this year. Maintenance monetization to avoid decline more the production in those mature fields. The bottom line is that we should expect that this rate of lifting cost <mark type="ph" /> will be (54:42) the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the refining costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be very clear, the question. You were asking me about the last quarter of 2010 comparing to the second quarter 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. As far as I remember, this was also a quarter that was heavily impacted by maintenance. You actually mentioned that last year maintenance was more concentrated in the second half. So I'm just trying to understand the $1 difference between the two quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As I told you, the first semester of 2010 was less &#x2013; we had less turnaround than we have right now and less after 2011. And the second part of the year, that's the opposite. In 2010 we had a lot of turnaround and right now we are expecting to have less turnaround. Just to give you some numbers, on the first quarter of 2010 it is like R$130 million of turnaround and for the second quarter of the year, it is like R$570 million of turnaround. Right now, we need, on the first part of the year, R$531 million of turnaround, and we're expecting something like R$300 million for the second quarter. So if you compare the semesters, you are going to see that by the end of the year we're going to have an expanded turnaround similar as we had in the last years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, understood, but I mean, you're confirming that, indeed, the second half of last year was as impacted by maintenance as the first half of this year. And when we compare the average refining costs, there's probably a $1 difference which is what we're trying to understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In other words, if you look at the fourth quarter of 2010 where there was additional program maintenance heavier in the second half and you look at the second quarter of 2011, I think what Paula was saying, is that it is about a $1 higher. So the reason that we're giving that it's higher maintenance this quarter &#x2013; I think you're trying to compare, Paula, the fourth quarter of 2010 with the second quarter of 2011. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah precisely, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so then the question is and if that was also impacted by higher maintenance, what explains the difference of $1 in refining cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And actually trying to explain that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:42) the third part of 2010 was a very heavy semester. So that's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:47). So I <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:50).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was wondering, Just for confirmation, you mentioned that the refining the lifting cost were going to continue this high going forward because the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:24). The second one is also related to the lifting cost, as the increasing related to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:35) project or is it nothing to do with that. It's just the increase of compatibility in the project and the increase of the intervention that we see that's driving the lifting cost higher?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We are producing today more than 80% from Campos Basin. We expect that the pre-salt will increase relatively this production in the future. But in terms of Basin, it's becoming a mature basin. It requires more maintenance and this maintenance is necessary to maintain the production area, the time and the cost of production is higher in the beginning and this is natural for fuels and when a new one comes on stream the average cost reduces. So this is the situation.</p>
          <p>But there <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:00:54) project they do not add cost, they reduce the cost. We are producing today from this program 133,000 barrels per day and we have another 67 exploring for opportunity on this same kind of prospects that can add new production and will be maintaining or reducing the average cost of production because, which I believe in part they may have lower lifting cost but most importantly, we are not going to leave these platforms. But we <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:01:47) development.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:04) production from the phase 1 becomes more important one will reduce see a reduction in the lifting cost is that is build our project helps to reduce the lifting cost of the platform and that the wells are leaking because we add production and we have the stage process and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:34).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you. Thank you, everybody. I have a question related to the cost increases that we've seen, not only this quarter, but recently. When we compare the financial performance of this quarter with, for instance, the same quarter of 2010 going back to the Slide Number 4, we see that, although revenues are significantly up, EBITDA is virtually flat for the second quarter of 2010, for the first quarter of 2011 and second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>The earnings are higher, yes, on a year-over-year basis but that's mostly because of the financial gains and most of it is coming from the currency appreciation which is something that is beyond your control. So the actual measurable operational performance from the company is actually not improving.</p>
          <p>Oil prices are much higher on a year-over-year basis, and the costs have essentially offset all the revenue gains that you would have captured in a more benign oil price environment. So my question is the following. When we see interviews from Mr. Gabrielli or even discussing with you, we have a sense that the company believes that the long-term returns are so good that we should accept a temporary glitch in near-term returns in near-term financial performance.</p>
          <p>So it seems that there is a certain level of lenience towards the current cost structure. At the time of the 2008 crisis, the company took measures to improve the cost structure and I remember seeing a couple quarters with improving cost performance. Those measures are no longer in place. Or what are you doing right now to try to mitigate this significant cost increase that we are seeing which are essentially removing any operating leverage from a higher oil price environment. That's my first question. And the second question is related to the block of <mark type="ph" /> DNS 12 (1:05:00). Do you have any update on how the drilling is going and what are your expectations for the results of this well? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand. The first question is an interesting question. It is the question that you are building this over a situation where we have a price differential, again, in the national and the international market. This is not a situation that's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:02) over time in third quarter. So that means it's not very clear to have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:14) because you are assuming we will remain in that situation. But this is not what the company has proposed. The company policy is to follow international law. So thinking in the average price in this year was the same as international price, we will not have the situation present, and then with the losses that you saw particularly in downstream during this quarter could not be <mark type="ph" /> permitted there (1:06:05).  And our operational income would be in line and adding to what we have during the quarter. And the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry to interrupt, just to make a follow-up still on this first topic. I'm actually comparing the second quarter of this year with the second quarter of last year and actually the realization prices that you had this quarter are 80% higher than the realization prices of the second quarter of last year. So I am not even making the point that prices should be higher. What I'm saying is prices were higher, volumes were higher, so your readiness were much better. But when it goes down the income statement, the operating profit doesn't feel that because the costs have increased even more. So your operating margins have actually declined in an environment where prices have improved. So this goes back to the previous question by a fellow suggesting that we are seeing higher oil prices and declining earnings. So my sense is we have seen cost escalating for a while and the question is where does this stops or reverses if it happens at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Honestly, again, we are in an environment of higher international oil price, so costs for the industry is growing. We are, at the moment, Petrobras won't stop oil production coming from old fields or maturing fields that has increasing costs. We did have some price increase in Brazil, but much less than what happened in the international and in the environment the industry is <mark type="ph" /> leading (1:09:30). So all the other costs and charge to the company follow international standard and, while our revenue came from a better priced year for this year, but what is the comparison?</p>
          <p>How much was the price increase in the international oil; 50% since last year. And we had, what, 15% in Brazil so this is the consequence of the <mark type="ph" /> moment we are here (1:10:03). Again mainly what is the main point of the question. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:13) gave us 50% of price increase that was based on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:23) international. Then our cost increased more than proportionally than the last price increase and produced revenue to us so far.</p>

          <p>Hello, good day. Just to return to the lifting cost; I'm sorry to harp on it and I was off the call for a few seconds, but I just wanted &#x2013; as you go through the second half of the year, assuming production rises as you expect it to in the August to December period with ramping up some of the production units and tying up some wells, and as you go into 2012 with the higher production level, should the lifting cost level come down substantially or not very much. What kind of indications can you give as to what the near-term performance would be over the next two to four quarters?</p>

          <p>Frank, we have lots of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:12:40) we accomplish daily. And July and August we still have many <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:12:45) So what I said is that, again, we are going to start drilling production in the last three months of the year. It will be produced higher than the average, the deposits that we had. The lifting cost that it will take without the special participation and without royalty, without the government take <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:17) we would expect this level to the end of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon everyone. I just had a quick question actually. Just a follow-up from the Portuguese call, you mentioned that you do expect some seasonal weaker gasoline demand in the second half of this year. So I just wanted to get some more precise view on how the company stands in terms of gasoline inventories and how <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:14:30) import should behave in 3Q; whether we should expect some stability or some other trend going forward?  Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well what can I say about that?  Despite some effort of 2011 actually calling for some assets as a high demand of gasoline. It's a certainly lower demand of gasoline for the second semester simply we are able to produce almost the capacity of gasoline necessary to extend our margin that is on the second semester of 2011 and these at the same level <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:16:20)</p>

          <p>Just wanted to respond to Paula's question because you looked at the fourth quarter refining costs of 2010 versus the second quarter of 2011, it was an increase of $0.69 expressed in dollars. Of that, $0.43 was related to additional program maintenance in the second quarter of '11 versus the fourth quarter of 2010. So the point is when you subtract all the differences, the increase from the fourth quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2011 is about 5%. So again, there is obviously within Brazil we also have the personnel issue, different cost knowing, but that really sort of 5% increase from the fourth quarter to second quarter when you factor out the maintenance cost between the two quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning, everyone. Just one very quick question on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:18:11) actually, If you could you give us an update on the tests of horizontal wells that we sold and what is your expectations there for even higher productivity? And just going back very quickly on the cost questions, has the breakdown of real-based versus dollar- based costs changed over the last several quarters. That also could explain bit of that increase over time. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Marcus. But regarding this pre-salt horizontal well, we have done the tests and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:19:00). It was very good results that we managed to give on horizontal well there. And the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:19:11) flat was not to reach any but just to of the drilling point of view to see the difficulty of drilling through the side with high- integrated well. and we plan to do one of the six wells that we planned in the potential that we save one of them will be result of that. So we don't know yet how is the platform behavior in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:19:53). So we will test that. That is one of the objectives of the pilot is to test highly deviated wells in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:20:11) next year in 2012 we will have test them. And regarding your second question, I really don't think that the real or dollar has changed in the reality. It is the same, about the same.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's still around 60% if I'm mistaken, 6% in dollars and the 40% reais right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Hey I wonder if you could just update on the current production coming out of the Lula Pilot and what you expect the exit rate for this year to be on that project and maybe the volume for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the Lula Pilot, we have just one well producing there. It's very high productivity. It is a bit more 36,000 barrels per day of oil and gas equivalent. If you consider only oil, it's 28,400 barrels per day. We will have another well in September that we are connecting to a second well. If everything goes right we may connect a third well at the end of the November or December. It is obvious, yes, the fixed cost <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:21:57) by the end of the year. If everything goes well we may have three wells already connected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess you're expecting sort of same productivity out of those wells as the first one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we think in the first half is that we can produce an average of 20,000 barrels per day. With those <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:22:35) 2008, our estimate was15,000 barrels per day. Now <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:22:46) that we have now just 6,000 barrels per day per well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:22:23) if you could talk a little more about the reduction and the spread between your realized price <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:22:54).Obviously it came down this quarter. I wonder if that is a result of selling from those Lula volumes, and should we expect that spread to sort of decline back to the $5 to $6 historical range you reported over the past year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the question <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:23:24)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Isn't that just a function of the light/heavy differential around the world? I don't think there's anything &#x2013; has there been &#x2013; in other words, it hasn't widened from the last few quarters. That's the question I guess, is that because of a change in the mix of ARPU or is that simply light/heavy differential generally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, actually, light/heavy differentials tend to be higher with higher oil price and that's the case. It's exactly what's happening now. Higher oil price, light differentials are now above our historical average and above our expectation, above our planned assumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the fuel oil that has a substitute that is gas, natural gas, so it gained the loss. So the average value of oil, heavier oil, get a lower discount &#x2013; a bigger discount than <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:24:16).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not because of a change in our production.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
