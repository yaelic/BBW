          <p>Good morning.  My name is Jackie and I will be your conference operator today.  At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the DuPont Fourth Quarter 2007 Investor Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> To listen to the webcast, please go to www.dupont.com.  Thank you.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chad Holliday, Chairman and CEO.  Sir, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's webcast covering DuPont's financial results and outlook.  Our CFO, Jeff Keefer, is with me today and so is Carl Lukach, our Vice President of Investor Relations.  He will be coming on in just a minute to take you through our results but I wanted to introduce today's call.</p>
          <p>First, thank you for calling in today, recognizing all the dynamics in the financial markets.  I believe you will be pleased with what we have to say about our company.  If you'll remember, we announced actions to accelerate value creation in November 2005, which are now largely complete.  As result our company is stronger, more productive and more profitable.</p>
          <p>We're announcing today the next phase of our acceleration plan.  I posted a letter to our shareholders today on our website outlining the key focus points of our plan and I invite you to read it.  The bottom line is DuPont today is on a springboard for growth from new science, new products and new markets.  I'll discuss this later in today's call, but also I want you to attend our upcoming meeting on March 14 for investors where we'll introduce in our press release today and will explain our acceleration plans in more detail.  Let me know turn the call over to Carl to kick things off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Chad.  I needed to first take care of some administrative items and then Jeff is going to walk you through our highlights and performance.  I'll come back after Jeff with our customary platform review and then we'll go back to Chad.  For those of you accessing this call through our website, dupont.com, we will be using slides today.  Please turn to Slide 2.</p>
          <p>During this course of this conference call we will make forward-looking statements.  All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements.  Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a number of risks and assumptions.  We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.</p>
          <p>We've also posted on our website today, supplemental information that we hope will be helpful to your understanding of our company's performance.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Keefer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Carl, and good morning, everyone.  It was a strong quarter and year.  We executed our plans and delivered results that exceeded our targets.  Underlying fourth quarter earnings per share grew 27%, $0.57 per share.  Underlying full-year 2000 (sic) [2007] earnings per share grew 14%.  The fourth quarter and full-year growth was broad and deep across our businesses.  In summary, for the quarter we drove strong top line growth of 11% globally and 20% in emerging markets.  Our pricing gains were well ahead of increasing raw material and energy costs. Fixed costs as a percent of sales improved 210 basis points, while we continued to invest in our higher margin businesses. In segment pre-tax operating income, excluding items grew 30% and our operating margin improved 210 basis points.</p>
          <p>Starting now with Slide 3. Fourth quarter reported earnings were $0.60 per share and includes a net benefit of $0.03 for significant items that include impairment charges, tax settlements and a litigation reserve reversal.  Excluding items from both periods, earnings per share were up 27%. The results are higher than the outlook issued by the company on January 9, largely due to finalization of the company's tax rates and higher business performance.</p>
          <p>Aligning with the double-digit earnings growth, segment pre-tax operating income increased 30% and margins expanded 210 basis points. All five segments grew earnings in the quarter and locked in full-year segment pre-tax operating income growth of 13%.</p>
          <p>While performance increased across all our segments, Performance Materials and Ag &amp; Nutrition delivered over 20% earnings growth in 2007. Fourth quarter consolidated net sales were $7 billion, up 11%. The top line results reflect our strong presence outside the US and the success of new products, particularly in Ag &amp; Nutrition and strong performance in KEVLAR and Nomex brand names.</p>
          <p>Looking at our global sales distribution on Slide 4, 67% of our sales in the quarter were generated outside the US, and sales in emerging markets grew 20%. While each business contributed to the top line growth, Ag &amp; Nutrition sales grew 23% in the quarter and had double-digit sales growth in every region around the world. The results reflect strong performance of our products during the Southern Hemisphere season, as well as a very solid start to the European selling season. As a company, we delivered strong volume growth in Asia, Latin America and in emerging Europe and improved price in every region.  We grew sales in Chine 14% versus prior year quarter. Performance Material product lines increased sales greater than 25% in the quarter. Glass laminated products are doing particularly well in the architectural sector. Coatings and Ti02 also had solid volume and price improvements in China.  Both businesses are working to increase their local presence. And as an example, in December we opened a collision paint facility in Jiading on time and on budget.</p>
          <p>We grew emerging Europe 25% and achieved a milestone by generating $2 billion in sales in 2007. Latin America sales were $941 million, up 16% with double-digit growth in all platforms and especially strong in Ag &amp; Nutrition.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the EPS variance analysis on Slide 5, the local pricing improvements delivered in each region contributed $0.25 per share. This marks our fourth year of consecutive pricing gains. Total variable costs increased $0.19 in the quarter, excluding the impacts of royalties, commissions and the impact of pass-through pricing inflation. Our underlying raw material, energy and transportation costs were up 6%. As we look back at 2007 we estimate the full-year cost escalation was about 5%.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, our price increases netted a $0.06 per share benefit over variable costs. On a full-year basis we introduced 1,200 new products. The value and use pricing on these new products and our pricing discipline kept our local price gains somewhat ahead of raw material and energy cost increases. All other was a benefit of $0.05 per share and primarily reflects proceeds from the sale of non-core assets.</p>
          <p>Moving now to fixed costs, we delivered over $100 million of cost reduction programs in the quarter, which covered inflation and partially funded growth programs, primarily in Ag &amp; Nutrition and Safety &amp; Protection. Accelerating growth in these high margin businesses will certainly create future value for our shareholders. The fixed cost variance was a charge of $0.02 per share in the quarter. For the full-year 2007 we delivered over $400 million in cost reduction program savings and an additional $130 million in restructuring program savings. Fixed costs, excluding currency and volume, was up just 1.5% for the year.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 6, fixed costs as a percentage of sales improved this quarter again and for 2007 was 41%, a 150 basis point improvement versus last year. From 2003 through 2007 we've reduced fixed costs as a percent of sales by a full seven percentage points.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 7, 2007 full-year pre-tax operating income margin improved by 100 basis points and return on invested capital improved 90 basis points. The 2007 performance locked in the fifth consecutive year of improvements in both metrics. While higher earnings are certainly contributing to both metrics, our work on underperforming assets is also underpinning the results.</p>
          <p>Each quarter we show you our RONA data, which is on Slide 8. We are pleased to show another significant increase in the underperforming assets classification.  Improving the metric is done business unit by business unit. Several of our target businesses adjusted their strategies and are now achieving attractive, sustainable returns. As examples, from December 2005 through December in 2007 the performance elastomers business improved 1300 basis points; ethylene copolymers, 800 basis points; chloromonomer and polymers, 750 basis points; and Ditel resins moved 500 basis points.  We also took key strategic actions such as shedding certain industrial chemical and coatings businesses.</p>
          <p>We have momentum. As we move forward, we will continue to improve underperforming asset returns and have faster asset growth in our high-return businesses, all with the intent to grow ROIC.  The internal decisions support processes we are using to guide our actions is cash flow return on investment, or CFROI. We believe this metric allows us to make the best asset growth decisions, as well as clearly target and measure improvements in underperforming assets.  Externally, we will continue to provide ROIC data as a method to measure our progress.</p>
          <p>Finally, the full-year abbreviated cash waterfall is on Chart 9. In summary; cash from operations was invested back into our assets and we returned $3.1 billion in value to shareholders via dividend and stock repurchases.</p>
          <p>Going into 2008 and aligned with our growth strategy, our capital spending will be about $2 billion. The increased funds are primarily for focused investments in our previously announced expansions in KEVLAR, Tyvek and TiO2; all high-return businesses.</p>
          <p>Looking back at 2007 helps to frame our plan for 2008. The US slowdown started in 2007. US residential housing starts were down about 28%, North American auto builds were down 2% and the Detroit pre-builds were down 6%.  In total, we estimate the slowdown in construction and auto cost us about $0.20 cents per share in 2007.</p>
          <p>Heading into 2008, we expect the headwinds of 2007 to continue and this is in our planning assumptions. Notably, we expect the US slowdown to continue.  US residential housing is still looking for the bottom and it's estimated we will again see another year-over-year reduction in housing starts. North American auto builds are estimated to be down again. In addition, raw material and energy and transportation costs are expected to continue to increase at a faster rate than we experienced in 2007.</p>
          <p>Let me assure you DuPont is well positioned to meet these challenges and in fact we see good opportunities.  Our fourth quarter pricing actions put us in a solid position to deal with the rising raw material and energy costs.  Our new product introduction, mix enrichment strategy, and disciplined pricing will support further pricing gains.  In addition, we are improving operations at our plants and using our global purchasing power to reduce costs.  All of these actions will address the upward pressures of raw materials.</p>
          <p>Global GDP growth is expected to be about 3.2% with solid growth in emerging markets.  With a sizable base of over 7 billion of sales in emerging markets, we will use our capabilities to capitalize on to growth and we will leverage our local presence across all our businesses.  We also see opportunities in the end markets of agriculture, and safety and security.  Both markets have strong fundamentals in 2008. We expect to build on our global leadership positions in these markets to deliver growth in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Cost productivity is another opportunity.  As Chad will cover later, we will build on our momentum from 2007 and continue to benefit from cost productivity actions in 2008.  The savings from our November, 2005 plan are running ahead and our goal remains to offset inflation and contribute to funding growth investments.</p>
          <p>With this as a backdrop, on Chart 10 we reaffirm our full-year outlook for 2008 of $3.35 to $3.55 per share.  We have the right plans in place and the ability to execute as we did in 2007 to achieve sustainable growth in 2008 and beyond.  We have also provided first quarter guidance in a range of $1.12 to $1.17 per share.</p>
          <p>Now turn it to Carl for platform specific data which supports first quarter guidance.  Carl?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Jeff.  Everyone will now move to our platform review.  Let's begin with our Ag &amp; Nutrition platform on Slide 11.  Sales grew 23% to 1.3 billion.  Underlying earnings improved 40%, from a loss of 148 million in the fourth quarter last year to a loss of 89 million this quarter.  I would like to point out that the fourth quarter this year includes a gain of 15 million related to a crop chemical asset divestiture. Excluding this gain, PTOI for the platform grew 30% quarter-over-quarter.  The strong performance delivered by our Ag platform was driven by strong international sales across the platform and across all regions, coupled with cost productivity improvements from the restructuring program we announced to you one year ago.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the details, beginning with crop protection products. Sales and earnings were up significantly, driven by strong regional demand and buoyed by favorable pricing in Latin America. Insecticide demand was particularly strong in Latin America and Europe. Asia Pacific volume was up significantly, driven by demand for Lawndex rice herbicide in Japan and broad market growth across the region. Margins expanded on favorable pricing and fixed-cost productivity gains.</p>
          <p>Moving to seeds, fourth quarter sales at Pioneer increased 40%, led by substantial growth in Latin America and Asia, and early-season sales in Europe and North America. Last quarter, we described the strong season underway in Latin America. That strong momentum carried through the fourth quarter as well. Corn market share was up four to five points in Brazil and Argentina on expanding acreage in both countries. In fact, 2007 was the fifth consecutive year of share gains for corn and soybeans in Brazil. For the full-year 2007 our seed business PTOI represented about two-thirds of total platform PTOI and in 2007 earned an 18% pre-tax margin. This includes our incremental growth spending in 2007 of about $100 million. We're already seeing a return on our investments in our seeds sales team, and in R&amp;D. Overall, we're pleased with the 23% platform growth in PTOI in 2007.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to the outlook for the Ag &amp; Nutrition platform for the first quarter. Our order books for the North American growing season are strong. Platform sales and earnings will be up low double-digits, driven by strong seed sales in North America and chemical sales in Europe and Latin America moderated by higher commodity costs and continued growth investment spending.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's move now to Slide 12, Coatings &amp; Color Technologies segment. Sales increased 8% to 1.7 billion. Earnings grew to 216 million, up 5%. Earnings grew substantially in our coatings business, reflecting the results of our restructuring efforts, and increased sales, but were partially offset by modest declines in TiO2 earnings, and the absence of gains from asset sales in last year's fourth quarter. TiO2 product sales increased slightly. US dollar price was up in Europe and Asia, volumes were up in Asia and Brazil, but volumes were lower in North America and Mexico, reflecting lower demand from our paint customers selling into the North American residential housing market.  Earnings for TiO2 declined modestly.</p>
          <p>The coatings business has increased sales moderately, but earnings improved substantially as our teams continued to execute on two key strategies: number one, restructuring the cost base; and number two, reorienting our business towards faster growth markets.  As proof points fixed costs as a percentage of sales improved 195 basis points and sales outside the US grew 10%, and as Jeff mentioned the collision paint plant in Jiading, China started up on time and on budget.</p>
          <p>For a little longer-term perspective on the status of our coatings transformation, after two years of transformative work and despite the North American market conditions, our coatings business grew the top line on average 17% in Latin America and Asia, and grew global earnings on average 22%.  The key growth drivers in this platform are continued growth in emerging markets, penetration in new markets, pricing actions and productivity gains.  As Jeff noted, we are not expecting improved conditions in North America housing or auto markets in 2008. Specifically, our first quarter outlook for Coatings &amp; Color Technologies reflect modest earnings growth, partially offset by the inclusion in the first quarter '07 of $16 million in insurance recoveries.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Slide 13 and our Electronic &amp; Communication Technologies platform, sales grew 13% to 1 billion.  Earnings increased substantially to 156 million and included a $28 million gain on a land sale.  Excluding this gain, earnings grew 14%.  Our fourth quarter performance reflects continuous improvement from the first half for several key product lines.  Fourth quarter sales growth was driven by volume growth in fluoroproducts and electronic materials.  Strong demand for photovoltaic materials continued, while sales for electronic materials rebounded in the quarter, particularly for the semiconductor and plasma displays supply chains.  The platform's earnings improvement reflected sales gains and cost control partially offset by changing business mix.  Earnings growth was particularly strong in our fluoroproducts, electronic materials and packaging product lines.</p>
          <p>Turning to the outlook for the first quarter, we expect to generate modest sales growth.  We anticipate benefiting from strong demand for photovoltaics, improved demand for electronic materials and continued cost control. Earnings, however, should grow significantly in the first quarter, driven by an improved product mix versus the first quarter '06.</p>
          <p>I'll turn to Slide 14 now and review our Performance Materials segment. Sales grew 12% to 1.7 billion, particularly on high US dollar selling prices. Excluding significant items in both periods, earnings increased 54% to 186 million, reflecting gains in all product lines. The segment's profit improvement reflects higher US dollar selling prices and disciplined fixed cost management, which were partially offset by higher raw material costs and a charge to write down certain manufacturing assets. We experienced global sales gains in all three major product lines. From a regional perspective, revenues grew in Latin America, Asia and Europe due to US dollar selling price gains and volume growth.  In North America, however, volume declined but sales were up slightly.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to 2008, the segment will face difficult comparisons to its strong '07 results; however we expect continued growth reflecting growth in emerging markets, higher US dollar selling prices, fixed cost discipline and successful launches in new product applications. These gains are anticipated to be partially offset by higher raw material costs, continued softness in the North American auto and housing markets and costs related to shutdown of the neoprene production facility at our company's Louisville, Kentucky, plant. Specifically for the first quarter, we expect modest sales gains and slight earnings growth compared with the strong comparable results in prior year's first quarter. US dollar pricing and cost management will be partially offset by higher raw material costs and plant shutdown costs.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 15 and looking at our Safety &amp; Protection segment, sales increased to 1.4 billion, up 5% excluding the impact of a divested business. Earnings in the quarter were 277 million, up 13% versus previous year. The quarter and the year closed strong, with diversity of the S&amp;P products, markets and geographies continues to support growth in the face of continuing slowing in the US residential housing market. Sales growth in all regions with continued double-digit growth in emerging markets. Kevlar and Nomex demand remained strong across most market segments. Global sales by our building innovations business was about flat even though US housing starts were down about 25%, as sales growth outside the US mostly offset lower US sales.  The combination of top-line growth, fixed cost productivity, particularly in chemicals, and favorable currency were the key elements for achieving double-digit PTOI growth.</p>
          <p>For full year 2008, we see solid fundamentals for safety and security products globally. Key-growth drivers are continued non-US penetration, new product introduction, Nomex capacity expansion and enriching the product offering. The growth will be tempered by continued weakness in US housing and cost increases to fund growth such as Kevlar capacity investments. Specifically for the first quarter, Safety &amp; Protection expect modest earnings growth, reflecting expansion-related activities in the Nomex business.</p>
          <p>Lastly, our Applied BioSciences Technology platform, we have two milestones to report on since our investor meeting just eight weeks ago. First in our biomedical business, we signed a strategic collaboration with BioSphere Medical under which the companies will evaluate potential peripheral vascular and embolotherapy research and new-product development. We will also apply DuPont's know-how to the manufacturing of Biosphere's Embosphere and EmboGold products in an effort to accelerate the improvement of manufacturing yield by these products. Second, in our biosurfaces business, we signed a new co-development agreement with a major downstream partner to commercialize new products based on DuPont's innovative biosurfaces technology.</p>
          <p>That concludes the review of our platforms; I'll now turn the call back to Chad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carl.  As Jeff and Carl summarized, we grew earnings per share 27% in the fourth quarter, and 14% for the full year. While a weaker dollar and Cozaar certainly helped, they were not the primary reason we overcame the challenging environment in US housing, auto and raw materials. We grew earnings because we were successful in growing revenue outside the US and because we were successful at reducing cost, while funding our growth investments. Our ability to exceed in these areas are two direct outcomes of the plan we presented to you November 2005 to accelerate value creation by our company.</p>
          <p>The actions we took of the November 2005 acceleration plan have made our company stronger and more profitable. Our pre-tax profit margin and return on invested capital are up significantly and continue to rise. Our R&amp;D costs and capital productivity plans are either on or ahead of plan. In the third quarter last year we completed our $5 billion share repurchase program and raised our dividend 11%. In short, we're not just talking, we're doing, and I hope you can see that in our results.</p>
          <p>With November 2005 acceleration plan largely complete, we're not taking any victory laps.  Instead, we're focused on the next phase of our acceleration.  Our focus is a higher rate of earnings growth to significantly increase the value of our company.  We want the proof to not just be in our results as it is now, but also in our stock price.  We must keep posting the kind of performance that's impossible to ignore or discount.  We're announcing today an extension of our November 2005 acceleration plan.  Our extension will achieve an even higher level of profitable and sustainable growth.  Please turn to Slide 16.</p>
          <p>We'll accelerate our top-line growth by applying our science to create new products, new markets; as only DuPont can.  At the same time, we'll extend our productivity improvements.  We think about it in five steps that are all accelerating at the same time: emerging market growth, Safety &amp; Protection expansion, increasing our competitiveness and propelling our agriculture-related units to faster growth, winning in bio-based materials and biofuels, extending our productivity gains.</p>
          <p>Let me expand on each of these five steps.  First, emerging market growth.  We've learned that more focused resources in emerging markets deliver profitable growth for us in 30-plus product families where we've been targeting.  I've challenged Dave Miller, Diane Gulyas, Terry Caloghiris to boost our rate of growth in these markets to an even higher rate over the next two years.  As a baseline, current sales in emerging markets of these 30-plus product families are just over $4 billion and their aggregated top line growth rate has been 18% for the past six years.  We can and will boost that rate higher.  Ellen Kullman will be the Executive Vice President with direct accountability for this growth.</p>
          <p>Second, Safety &amp; Protection.  This is a $5.6 billion revenue platform for us today with the highest profit margins in DuPont.  Our five-year average annual top line growth rate for this platform has been running about 13% through 2006.  We slowed in 2007 with the US housing market, but we can and will make a marked increase in our sales growth by 2010.  Mark Vergnano will lead this work with the support of Ellen Kullman.</p>
          <p>Third, Agriculture &amp; Nutrition.  Our third quarter results confirm the power of our seed and crop-protect products and organization.  This is a tremendous market for us with wide-open potential.  We increased our R&amp;D and marketing expenditures by $100 million in 2007.  We'll continue to expand these investments.  Erik Fyrwald, with the support of Executive Vice President Tom Connelly, will deliver these results.  This could include acquisitions to strengthen our arsenal.</p>
          <p>Four, Applied BioSciences Technology platform, which includes biofuels and bio-based materials. Last week we assigned group VP Nick Fanandakis to lead this platform, reporting to Tom Connelly.  Nick is charged with accelerating the value realization from these humongous opportunities.</p>
          <p>And fifth, productivity.  In November 2005, we shared with you our simplification and streamline plans that would drive down fixed costs as percent of sales.  Our target was to capture $1 billion in fixed cost savings over the three years ending 2008.  We've been running ahead of plan and expect savings through the end of 2008 to exceed our $1 billion target.  But we will not stop there.  Richard Goodmanson, our Chief Operating Officer, has the responsibility to take the depot production system and depot ingrained business management tools and extend the productivity gains in 2008.  We'll also accelerate variable cost improvements from energy conservation and process yield programs.  We'll be ready to share with you more details of the exact amount of the additional savings in our March 14th meeting.</p>
          <p>When you ask Americans what is acceleration; they respond generally with how many seconds it takes a car to go from zero to 60.  So acceleration is change in velocity.  The data speaks for itself.  Du Pont has changed its velocity since November 2005.  Jeff Keefer and I stay firmly committed to the second phase of velocity improvement in DuPont.  We see growth opportunities that are even larger than we expected.  We acknowledge short-term uncertainty in macroeconomic growth but the fundamental drivers we see in emerging markets, our Safety &amp; Protection arena, agriculture, biomaterials, biofuels, are not going away and DuPont's perfectly positioned to capitalize on them.</p>
          <p>Jeff, Ellen, Richard, Tom and I look forward to seeing you March 14th.  In this meeting we'll discuss, in more detail, our actions for 2008 and 2009 that will increase our velocity.  Carl, back to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  Well Diane did such a good job at Performance Materials I won't ask my usual question of when you're going to sell the business.  But on the agricultural side, Chad, you talked about acquisitions.  Would these be major acquisitions or technology?  And then just as a follow-up, can you update us on the achievability of your goal of stabilizing market share at Pioneer in US corn seed in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don, thank you for the question you asked and the one you didn't ask too.  On acquisitions, I put that in in particular because we see tremendous international growth and international strength and there could be some very focused acquisitions internationally that will add to our market reach.  Secondly, from a technology standpoint; we're constantly scanning and we've got better systems than we've ever had before to scan where the leading-edge technology is.  So picking up some of these companies that would really match what we need to do are the kinds of things that we're constantly focused on to make a difference.  It's too early to talk in the second part of your question about the year, but I'm very pleased.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don, I could add to that.  I think you may have heard some of this before, but certainly the factors that go toward holding share [in the North American corn market is the availability of our triples, as you know, is way up.  As we mentioned on the call our order book is strong for the season and on track in the direction that would indicate that, and we're expecting return on the growth investments that we've already made in our sales team.  So those would be the three factors that I would point to at this early part of the season.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course I pointed out that we completed ahead of schedule our $5 billion share buyback.  It would be inappropriate to speculate on future share buyback because I think if you look at our track record, we've been very good at returning money to shareholders either through dividend increases or share buybacks, but we see some good growth in this company.  We think now, in this stricter market, that there's room to increase the top line and some of that cash should go for that too.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the year-over-year numbers, we would expect probably about that same $0.20, in that range.  I would call your attention to, again, we've put in a lot of drivers to offset that.  We offset it in '07 and clearly emerging country growth, repositioning even in that segment, commercial and new products are going to stand us in good stead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Looking longer term.  Chad, in your letter to shareholders, you talked about through 2010 clear potential for average double-digit earnings growth.  That implies therefore looking at '08 your guidance is 3.35 to 3.55, average 3.45. 10% in '09 and 10% in 2010 gets you to a 4.20 number.  Are we to read that sentence as suggesting that you are signing on to $4.20 earnings in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Frank I wouldn't question your math but I wouldn't confirm it without checking it.  But what we are saying, and we chose those words carefully, that if you take 2008 as a base year, we think on average for the next couple years we can get double-digit earnings growth.  And that's because of the build-up of specific plans that we put in place both from the cost reduction side, which will still be very important, very critical to us, but also in the top line growth side, so that is why we put that out. So is that clear in answering the question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That is. The one caveat I guess, or the elephant in the room, is Cozaar/Hyzaar starting in 2010 to dip down.  And I understand what you are talking about, the existing DuPont businesses, but the projection of average double-digit earnings growth that is inclusive of a decline in Cozaar/Hyzaar in 2010.  Is that correct?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Good morning.  Jeff, you gave some new data we haven't heard before about specific sub-segment or business unit return on asset improvement and you highlighted some notables.  I was wondering if you could tell us how Auto OEM is doing on that metric? And then second one, maybe Chad, if you could give us a little more commentary about what is going on in Europe?  I sense that from a lot of investors an anxiety that Europe is going to be lagging the US and head towards recession as well.  It looks like your volumes are a little bit weak there.  Maybe you could give us some comment?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, Bob, on Auto OEM, I am not going to quote specific numbers but you saw I think the overall improvement I think Carl quoted at 22% across the, earnings growth across our coatings segment.  OEM has certainly benefited, the restructuring savings have dropped to the bottom line, so when I look at our return on net asset metric, that business has improved as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Bob, on your question about Europe, Obviously in the release, you could see where the volume was, yet our overall sales growth was 13%.  We've taken a very close look throughout the quarter as to the drivers there and it's the uniqueness of the comparison with the fourth quarter last year and some very specific inventory shifts that we were in control of because of phasing in new products and phasing out our old products.  We don't see negative growth in Europe, but we see slow growth in Europe certainly.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning.  My first question is for Jeff Keefer.  What was cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter and what percentage of the 2 billion in CapEx you expect for 2008 goes to the agricultural operation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On that second one, Jeff, not much on the Ag in terms of the CapEx spending.  What you're seeing there is more about the previously announced expansion plans in KEVLAR would be a lead one there, some of the Nomex expansion money and also some of the TiO2 expansion project kicking in.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi good morning. In the Ag, can you talk about what happened to seed and chemical prices in Brazil and what do you expect in the US?  And the second question is how many acres of triple stack corn do you expect to have for this growing season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's talk first, P.J. about Latin America.  For '07 Latin American seed sales for Pioneer were up 54% and I'm talking about the season now, P.J., so that's the third and the fourth quarter primarily and that was obviously driven by increased corn seed sales in Brazil and Argentina and a strong product performance, higher grain prices and higher share.  In Brazil, we gained 5 points of share in corn and that includes all three tiers of the market, including the one we don't sell into, the third tier and it means we gained about a point in share.  In Argentina we gained about 4 points in corn, so you have all of the drivers of growth, to my knowledge, of the seed business there at once.  You've got acreage going up, share gains going up, and a bit of price action, too.  In crop chemicals, we did have good pricing in Latin America.  Profitability was strong, aided by the expanded acreage and demand.  Your last question again, P.J., could you repeat that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Actually this is Dave Garineau with Herod Capital.  Couple of questions, Chad.  Congratulations on a good quarter.  Can you talk about where your operational improvement initiatives are regarding mini-manufacturing, TPM and Six Sigma?  And around the world with the economy looking at a recession, what are some of the plants that you are concerned with around the world, and what areas that you're concerned with throughput and operational efficiency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Dave , Thanks for the question.  We put in Six Sigma in 1999.  That's well baked into our company, which means every improvement program is measured and has a control plan and is audited at least once a year out to make sure we really got the results.  What we've done now under Richard's leadership, is to take that to the next phase, what we call DuPont Production System, which more engages our employees and gets the creativity much higher and the enthusiasm much higher.  Where we've been able to do that, we've seen just a step change.  Over 2X improvement in the kind of results we've had from Six Sigma.  We pioneered that on two of our largest sites last year.  We're going to 17 more sites this year, and then we'll eventually take it across the entire company.</p>
          <p>This DuPont integrated business management is a supply chain process, where we're rating and evaluating every product family on how effective their supply chain is.  That is the fundamental that is going to help us take working capital down to the next step.  Again, it's all statistically based, just like Six Sigma, but it takes it beyond what we've been able to do so far.</p>
          <p>So those are the two programs that are driving across the entire company, and what we see is several years of more productivity improvement from these, just like we thought it would be, because it's fundamental change, not just taking out costs.  And we'll describe that in more detail on March 14th.</p>
          <p>The second question around plants being set up for this kind of economy.  This current exchange rate is kind of playing to us a bit, because where you might think we might have had some trapped assets in the US, with the dollar value we're a good exporter right now and we've been pulling down our asset base in Western Europe for some time.  I think you've seen the announcements the last three or four years. I don't see any large assets in Western Europe that will not be successful in this period, and obviously our Asian and Latin American assets are going like gangbusters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Chad.  Given the level of anxiety in the financial market, I was wondering if you could comment on two higher level questions, both macro in nature.  First, could you comment on the monthly pattern of your sales and earnings within the quarter; in other words, did the quarter end any differently than it began? And second, what are your underlying economic growth assumptions for the Unites States and China, as well as the energy complex?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kevin, thanks for your question.  First, let me refer back to the letter that we put out this morning, too.  I know it's a little bit unusual, normally we issue it a couple of months later, but we thought with all the anxiety, with our plans being so clear in what we're doing and the balance of those, we thought it was important to put it out today.  So I think reading that letter will give you the tenor of how we see things, not specifically the short-term economics for the next month or two, but what we see as the potential for longer term growth.</p>
          <p>But let me give you a couple of data on your question about trends.  Look at Asia, which I know people are concerned about, will Asia hold up with the US where it is? We had the strongest quarter in the fourth quarter in Asia, by order of magnitude, of revenue growth.  It was over 16% in the fourth quarter versus 8% for the entire year.  So we didn't see in that region certainly, or the other regions, any pattern coming in the fourth quarter that makes us concerned over and above what we already had in our plans for next year.  So, I don't see any pattern that's a problem.  But what I like to stress is, our global strength and how these task forces I described with my Group Vice Presidents, are focusing on those opportunities. I think that puts us in a really good position if we were to see a hiccup somewhere along the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what would you be baking in for the US, China and energy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On energy, we're assuming it's going to stay very high, at least for the first half in the order of magnitudes we've been seeing and that's why we've been putting in place these very disciplined price improvement programs, and as I referred to in my talk, what we see is tremendous potential now in yield improvement and energy improvement all based on those systems I described a little bit earlier.  So we're dealing with those as they come up, and we're not expecting any tailwinds to push us along here, we're going to have to work for it throughout the 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys. On CapEx you increased it quite significantly, why such a large increase? Obviously you've got the TiO2 plant and the KEVLAR situation, but I think we all would probably agree that growth globally is probably going to slow in the next couple of years. Why not cut back on some of the other areas?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We've been spending about 1.5 to about $1.7 billion over the last several years and the growth in our capital is really related to those focused investments in KEVLAR and TiO2. Those are very healthy businesses, growing businesses, and we need to support that growth that will support higher profits and returns in the company overall.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I had some questions regarding portfolio restructuring. Chad, you've had this question a couple of different times, but given the softness in the economics outlook are there any more asset sales that you need to do to tighten up the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, as Jeff described, we've been focused on that for a period of time, I think that what you can see is those RONA results have really come up. We have made some focused divestitures. We are always out to create the most shareholder value. But right now I like the mix of products we have.  But just look at what we've done the last several years; we've made right sense for shareholders we're willing to make adjustments but I'm not forecasting any today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I also wanted to follow up on TiO2, one of your more important product lines. You've announced three rounds of price increases in about the last, what, six, seven months? Are the realizations from those three rounds of price increases sufficiently strong to encourage you to move ahead aggressively on expansion and seeing higher margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again I'm not going to get into the specific and the pricing, you've seen -- you've mentioned, Mark, that the three price increases were encouraged in that market. Again, that is a high-return business, we've got a low-cost position in a very rapidly growing market, and it's the right thing to do to invest in that business to grow shareholder value.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. My question is also on emerging markets growth. Chad, you spoke about the very strong trends you've seen recently, but over the past couple of days the emerging markets' stock markets are down double digits and seem to be predicting some type of slowdown. Could you elaborate a little bit in terms of why you think that growth there would remain strong and this theory on de-coupling, how valid do you think that is?</p>
          <p>&lt;A Charles Holliday, Jr.&gt;: Great question, I understand why you ask. It's hard to take into account a few days' movement in stock markets in our overall business case.  So, let me talk about what's unique about our company. We've got over 35% of our sales from products less than five years old and what we find is customers during down times want to be pushing out new products and that's what ours can do, it can allow them to have new products.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are much more specialized than the normal commodities, we have a few commodities, TiO2 is one of them. But generally we're more specialized and we're more locked in and they don't move suddenly just based on short-term demand. And again, remember we've got our agricultural business that we see the commodity prices, trends there, we just think that's going to be good for a very long time to come. So I don't think we're typical of what maybe others might experience, but I don't see any big alarm signs coming from our people on the field. I lived there six years, I stay really close to that market and I'm not saying that we're home free or that we can take away -- a look at what's happening but right now we're going to have a good year.</p>

          <p>Morning.</p>
          <p>&lt;A Charles Holliday, Jr.&gt;: Hi, John.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Shouldn't the growth rate for the first quarter earnings be targeted at higher than the growth rate for the whole year? You have a stronger lift from Agricultural in the first quarter and I assume the fourth quarter is going to have difficult comps given the low tax rate this year. So, don't you need to start the year off with a higher-than-average growth rate so that you can cover for the back end of the year?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John as we see it, you see that our first quarter is right in line with our overall guidance and so that's our best judgment right now and it's the guidance we've given.</p>

          <p>John, in the call script that we went through, each platform you can see the drivers and the headwinds platform by platform that we add up, as Jeff said, to calling it down the middle there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just making the observation that the back half of the year, unless you're assuming a low tax rate in the fourth quarter again, you got lower Ag participation in the back half of the year than you do in the first quarter that you ought to come out, at least start the year off a little bit above trend.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I understand what you're saying and we have really analyzed that from the revenue, cost, margin standpoint quarter-by-quarter, actually month-by-month. And the first quarter that we have got out there will yield the kind of year that we're looking at overall. I don't see a -- I understand your question fully. I don't see a pattern to be concerned about there at all.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Jackie, I guess that wraps up our call. Our investors, thank you again, as Chad said, for signing on. such a busy morning in the financial markets.</p>
