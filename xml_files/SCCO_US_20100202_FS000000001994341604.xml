      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Raul. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Today I will discuss Southern Copper's production, sales, operating costs, financial results, and capital spending program. After that, we will open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>First of all, I would like to mention that even last year, we started with a very negative market resulted from a weak economic and financial crisis suffered at the end of 2008. Through the year, the commodity markets improved significantly on the prices front. Simultaneously, our company has been focused in controlling cost, improving productivity and carefully managed cash flow. As a consequence, the 2009 financial result has been higher than expectations.</p>
          <p>I'm also glad to mention that Southern Copper Corporation operations have performed soundly during the year, exceeding our estimate for 2009. Southern Copper Corporation has one of the lowest cash costs of the industry and that advantage has allowed the Corporation to generate free cash flow, to continue its investments in capital projects in accordance with the company's organic growth and well &#x2013; as well as to take full advantage of its copper reserves.</p>
          <p>Now, let's start with our today's agenda. During 2009, we have seen a continuous recovery of metal prices, particularly copper, molybdenum, silver and zinc, which are the most important commodities produced by Southern Copper. At this time, we have positive view on the copper market and it can be summarized as follows; London Metal Exchange copper prices averaged $3.02 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2009, 40% higher than the third quarter of 2009. The year average has been $2.34 per pound. This compares with $3.16 per pound in 2008. We are expecting a copper price of $3.25 per pound for this year. Copper represented 71% of our sales in 2009.</p>
          <p>Our expectations are based on the following factors. We believe that inventories of copper will start to tight up during the year, reversing the last months' trend. Our estimates indicate a market relatively balanced for 2010. Emerging economies increasing consumption, lead by China, will give support to current copper prices in 2010. Regarding the U.S. and European economies, we expect a higher consumption as well. Another factor to consider is that some investor funds are entering basic materials as a way to protect themselves from inflation.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper's first byproduct is molybdenum. It represents 12% of total sales in 2009. As in the case of copper, the molybdenum market has improved through 2009 from $9.50 per pound at the beginning of the last year to the latest quote of $14.75 per pound. It is important to mention that molybdenum will start trading as an LME-mined metal this February. We believe that LME trading should improve molybdenum market transparency in the long run. As for reference, we can mention that each year, 200,000 tons of molybdenums are traded, yielding business for about 6 billion annually.</p>
          <p>Silver Comex price have averaged $17.56 per ounce during the fourth quarter 2009, a significant recovery from the 2008 year and for the 2008 year-end, when it was quoted at $10.79 per ounce. We think that silver prices will be strong in the coming quarters, due to inflation concerns and the recovery of industrial demand. Silver represented 7% of Southern Copper Corporation's sales in 2009.</p>
          <p>Regarding zinc, in the fourth quarter 2009, the LME price averaged $1 per pound, 100% higher than the $0.50 quoted at the beginning of the year. Zinc represented 5% of our sales in 2009.</p>
          <p>In terms of production, we are glad to report that our mined copper production have maintained its good sales during the fourth quarter 2009. Major reasons for these results have been better ore grades and higher recoveries. Southern Copper Corporation's operating unit production for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 126,000 tons, 5% higher than the third quarter. The Toquepala operation increased its production by 7.4%. The Cuajone mine operation increased production by 6%. La Caridad maintained its production level in the fourth quarter, but increased it by 6% during the year. And our underground mines increased its copper production by 5.3%.</p>
          <p>Regarding our smelting and refining operations, the production increased by 18.8% and 0.1% respectively when comparing the fourth quarter 2009 with the third quarter 2009. Our guidance for 2010 in copper production is approximately 500,000 tons of copper, not considering any production from Cananea.</p>
          <p>Regarding molybdenum, we had excellent production in 2009, reaching 18.7 thousands tons. During the fourth quarter, production increased by 26 compared to the fourth quarter 2008, due to improved recoveries and higher ore grades at La Caridad and Toquepala operations. Molybdenum production increased in 2009 14% on a yearly basis. The company expects to produce and sell 18.5 thousand tons of molybdenum for 2010.</p>
          <p>Zinc mine and refined production increased by 3.3% in 2009. Our underground operations have obtained better ore grades as well as improved concentrators recoveries. Refined zinc production increased also by 3.4% at San Luis Potosi zinc refinery. We produced 110 tons of mined zinc and 98,000 of zinc refined in 2009. The company 2010 plan estimates zinc sales in the line with 2009 production of 110,000 tons.</p>
          <p>Silver mine production increased by 1% in the fourth quarter 2009 when compared to prior quarter. On a yearly basis, silver production increased 7% to 13.2 million ounces. Refined silver production increased 15% for the quarter and 21% for the year, due to higher production in La Caridad and mill operations smelter plants. The company estimates to sell 60 million ounces of silver in 2010.</p>
          <p>Now focusing on Southern Copper financial performance, net sales for the fourth quarter were $1,136 million, 1.4% lower then the $1,152 million in the third quarter of 2009, or 153% higher than the fourth quarter of 2008. This big difference is the result of 409 million adjustment on sales in the fourth quarter of 2008, due to the important metal price reduction at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Copper sales volume maintained its level in 2009. Molybdenum sales volume increased by 25% compared with its fourth quarter 2008 level. Silver volumes sold increased by 27% and zinc volumes sold decreased by 2% when compared to fourth quarter 2008 volumes.</p>
          <p>Talking about operating costs, we would like to mention that our operating cost and expenses have decreased by 400 million in 2009. The cost reduction results mainly from power cost decreases of $166 million, fuel cost decreases by $30 million, lower labor cost reduction of $40 million, and other cost and expenses reduction explain the remaining difference. For the fourth quarter 2009, the operating cost was $607 million. This figure compares favorably with the $643 million in the third quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>As a result of the mentioned sales and operating cost variances, the fourth quarter 2009 EBITDA was $616 million or 54% of sales. This figure compares with 592 million in the third quarter 2009, 51% of sales and a negative $54 million for the fourth quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash cost, let me first mention that our company has challenged the methodology applied for cash cost calculation. We are now considering the net effect of third party's copper production and sales as a credit. In the past, our cash cost only included the cost of copper from third parties, but not the benefits deriving from this transaction. The practical consequence of this change in methodology is that our cash cost will track now more realistically the cost of our own copper production, not being distorted by the effect of market prices from third party costs.</p>
          <p>The company's fourth quarter 2009 cash cost per pound of copper produced before byproduct credits was $1.36 per pound, lower than the $1.42 per pound of the prior quarter. Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of byproduct credits, was $0.37 per pound in the fourth quarter 2009. This figure compares to a cash cost of $0.13 per pound for the third quarter 2009. This $0.24 per pound variance resulted mainly from lower molybdenum prices.</p>
          <p>Cash cost before byproduct credit for the full year 2009 was $1.36 per pound of copper. Cash cost including byproduct credit for the full year 2009 was $0.36 per pound of copper. The estimated cash cost for 2010 is approximately $0.38 per pound of copper produced. The effective income tax rate for the quarter was 28%, lower than our historical tax rate of 32 to 34%. The variance in tax results from a non-monitory credit adjustment in our deferred taxes as well as some other fuel geo tax credit accrued in this quarter. We do not expect our tax rate to defer significantly from our long term trend in 2010.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of the better market prices, higher byproduct volume sold and the positive cost reduction reported, net earnings in the fourth quarter 2009 were $363 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.43. This figure compares with the net earnings for the three quarter 2009 of 312 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.37, a 16% increase.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures, including exploration expense, amounted 105 million during the fourth quarter 2009, a year-over-year decrease when compared to the 215 million expended in the fourth quarter of 2008. The full year CapEx for 2009 was $439 million.</p>
          <p>We have announced in our press release that the Board of Directors has approved an investment program of $2.8 billion for the next three years to develop 342,000 tons of copper and 6,600 tons of molybdenum of new production capacity when this program is completed. The program also aims to improve cost competitiveness and efficiency.</p>
          <p>The approved program considers some ongoing projects as well as new initiatives. The ongoing projects are the Tia Maria project, which will increase production by 120,000 tons of copper; the Toquepala unit expansion, which will contribute to copper production with 100,000 tons and 3,100 tons of molybdenum, and the Cuajone concentrator expansion to increase production by 60,000 tons of copper.</p>
          <p>To that, we are adding the following new projects. At Cuajone, mine and concentrator equipment investments to increase copper production by 22,000 tons of copper and 500 tons of molybdenum, with approximately CapEx of $50 million. For La Caridad mining operations, we are planning a concentrator expansion that should add 50,000 tons of copper and 3,000 of molybdenum per year, with CapEx of around $300 million. The company intends to allocate approximately 1.8 billion to Peru and 1 billion to Mexico, of which approximately 600 million and 200 million are intended to be investment in Peru and Mexico respectively in the fiscal year of 2010.</p>
          <p>The Board has authorized with the commencement of the investments in Peru. However, the investments in Mexico will commence depending on development in the Mexican labor and legal environment. In our press release, we have reported the assessment in our projects, so let me move to some other issues.</p>
          <p>As we have mentioned before, on April 14 last year, the Mexican Federal Labor Court issued a resolution based on Force Majeure, confirming the termination of Cananea's labor relationship with individual and unionized employees, as well as the termination of its collective agreement with its employees and with the National Mining and Metal Workers Union. Such resolutions were challenged by most of the unionized workers individuals and the National Mining and Metal Workers Union, SNTP.</p>
          <p>At this point, the federal tribunals has dismissed almost all the individual cases filed by the workers. The ruling on the case filed by the union remains unresolved. We are positive that the situation will be resolved and operations will be fully restored thereafter.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividends, I would like to state again that it's the company policy to review at each Board meeting the capital investment plan, cash resources and expected future cash flow generation from operations in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, on January 28, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized a dividend of $0.43 per share. This dividend will be paid on March 04, 2010 to shareholders of record as of February 19, 2010.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we have announced that in an effort to enhance the recognition of Southern Copper's common stock in the market and better reflect the company's global presence, the Board of Directors approved the change of the ticker symbol under which Southern Copper Corporation Commercial are listed in New York Stock Exchange from PCU to SCCO. Such change of ticker symbol is expected to be implemented at the start of trading on Wednesday, February 17.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and now, we would like to open up the forum for questions. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody, this is Rodrigo. Just a quick question, I don't know if you are going to give some kind of guidance in terms of sales volume for this year for copper and molybdenum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rodrigo. Well, we already have some guidance for production in copper and molybdenum, but I'm glad to give you the numbers again that &#x2013; about our guidance. In terms of copper, we are expecting to produce 500,000 tons of copper and in molybdenum, 18,500 tons for 2010. In terms of copper, we are not considering production, any production from Cananea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one more if I may, when do you think that Tia Maria will start to start producing some copper?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tia Maria, we are expecting to start operations at the end of 2011.</p>

          <p>Your next question will come from Rene Clayleg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, gentlemen. Just two things really, one is, if you can give the ruling expected in January as regards the situation with the unions, and if there's any update on timeframe for that? And then, secondly, we're seeing signs from other players in global commodity industries in terms of customers restocking or ending their destocking. I was just curious to see what you guys were seeing in terms of demand from your clients and how much tightness you see, near term, in the copper market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, in respect of the timing for the Cananea resolution, unfortunately, we don't have any date that we can mention at this point of time. This is, as I mentioned, in the trial of tribunal decision and we, well, it's very difficult to control and to know when they are to reveal a direct decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of demand from clients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in that matter, I would say it's a question to Raul Jacob, that could give you information about this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Rene, and good evening to everybody. Regarding our client base, well, we had a very good campaign last &#x2013; at the end of last year regarding our production sales. In general, what we're seeing is a recovery on demand from our major clients in the U.S. and Europe. This is not a very strong recovery, but they are steps in the right direction regarding copper consumption in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>On the emerging markets front, they have been very strong in 2009, and we believe that some restocking has occurred already there in emerging economies. But we believe that now we will have reasonable demand, probably a portion of that is not noticeable right now, due to the Chinese New Year's Eve, but I think that as soon as that passes, we should have some good news coming from emerging economies and China, particularly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, gentlemen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question will come from Alejandro Luciano.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Credit Suisse. I just have two questions, I was wondering, I might have missed this if you talked about any hedging strategy or forward sales you planned for this year. Can you give an update, if there's any strategy there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, Alejandro. Well, as always we used to follow the market and we will be very, very careful with opportunities. But what I can tell you that at this point of time, we don't have any hedging strategy decided for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. And then my next question is regarding your financing plans for your CapEx, if you plan to finance the 800 million expected this year out of cash flow, or if you expect to tap any financings? And then further out, long-term, for the full 2.8 billion CapEx spend, if you expect to need any financing on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alejandro. In principle, we are expecting to finance our capital expenditure program for this year through our own cash generation. But at the same time, we are analyzing our capital structure and based on that, probably, if it's favorable for the company's result and the analysis has given us more information, then probably we will decide to finance a portion of the capital expenditure program.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is actually Bruno Montanari with Morgan Stanley. Thanks for taking the questions. I have &#x2013; first question is, do you have a guidance for the estimated CapEx to ramp up Cananea again, when that takes place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, we are estimating, of course this number is going to be defined as soon as we reach, or as soon as we get the facility again. When we enter to the mine and to the operations, we will evaluate what was been the damage and at this point of time, we are going to have a number. But even that, today or currently, we are estimating between 50 and $60 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And my second question is, you touched about the production start at Tia Maria. I was wondering if there were any comments as to which Toquepala and then the Cuajone concentration expansions would take place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Raul Jacob has information about Toquepala and Cuajone and he will give you the information. Please, Raul.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In the case of Toquepala, we're expecting it to be starting production by mid-2012. In the case of the Cuajone project, probably by 2013, that should be moving forward. Regarding the Cuajone, I'd like to point out that the new projects that we add to the Cuajone pipeline of projects will be in operation by next year.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Well, our estimation for molybdenum for 2010 is $13. I don't know if &#x2013; well, it compares a little bit low against the current market, but molybdenum has been very, very difficult to predict. The market is very &#x2013; well, we have been seeing a lot of volatility and drastic changes. Then, for that reason, we are cover ourself and we are being conservative and we are estimating $13 for &#x2013; as an average for 2010.</p>
