          <p>Welcome everybody to our Second Quarter Results. I'm joined by Renato Fassbind, our CFO. I'm going to make some very brief introductory remarks. Renato will take you through the details. I'll make a few more comments and then we'll obviously open it up for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>We also have, as is our custom, at the end of the second quarter our divisional CEOs with us. So we have Walter Berchtold, Eric Varvel and Rob Shafir here. They'll obviously be available all for to help answer questions.</p>
          <p>The second quarter environment was obviously a difficult one but nonetheless I think our performance wholesale resilient with a reported return on equity of 18%. Overall revenues at CHF8.4 billion were only slightly down on the same period last year. We had positive pre-tax results across all our divisions with pre-tax income at 1.8 billion, slightly higher than the second quarter of 2009. So we think there's a consistent pattern of lower volatility results reflects our client-focused, capital-efficient strategy.</p>
          <p>Second quarter results also demonstrate continued strong momentum in their client franchise. We saw inflows of CHF14 billion of net new assets in the second quarter. That makes for the half year 2010 a total of over CHF40 billion of net new assets.</p>
          <p>We also saw a continued market share momentum in our investment banking, especially in our equity franchise and also in our advisory and underwriting businesses. And asset management maintained a positive trend in asset inflows for the fourth quarter in a row.</p>
          <p>At the end of the second quarter, we maintained our industry leading capital strength with a tier 1 ratio of over 16% and a conservative liquidity position. We do think that we are well-positioned for the continued regulatory development. We're well capitalized, we're already subject to a leverage ratio and already comply with the strict liquidity regime.</p>
          <p>Despite the continuing macroeconomic uncertainty in the first half of 2010, we achieved a reported return on equity of 20% and underlying return of 17%, while making further substantial progress developing all of our businesses. We remain confident that our strategy is appropriate and resilient in the face of an uncertain and challenging economic and market environment.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Renato who will take you through the results in more detail. Renato?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brady, and good morning. I will start my presentation on slide five with an overview of the second quarter financial highlights. In the published spaces, we achieved revenues of CHF8.4 billion and net income of CHF1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Diluted earnings per share stood at CHF 1.15 for the quarter. Published after tax return on equity stood at 18% for the quarter. Total net new asset inflows of 14.5 billion reflected a continued strong contribution of our wealth management business.</p>
          <p>Looking at the bottom of the slide, as in previous quarters we have also calculated the underlying results. Overall net revenues were at 7.6 billion and the pre-tax income result was CHF1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>The underlying return on equity was 12% this quarter. This adjusts for a credit from the widening of spreads, a loan debt partially offset by the U.K. bonds tax payment, and significant litigation provisions. In addition, we recorded a discreet tax benefit this quarter. A detailed reconciliation of the underlying results is included on slide 41 in the appendix of your pack. This is a solid performance during a challenging period for the banking sector and demonstrates the resilience of our client-focused, capital-efficiency strategy.</p>
          <p>Underlying return on equity for the first six months of 2010 stands at 17%, close to our medium-term target of 18% as we continue to deliver an industry leading return on equity.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to slide six for an overview of divisional results. This shows our second quarter 2010 divisional results side-by-side against the first quarter and the second quarter of last year. With a pre-tax income of CHF64 million, Private Banking reported a similar result to the first quarter. We continue to experience strong asset inflows in a challenging market environment with subdued client activity.</p>
          <p>Investment Banking results represent a resilient quarterly performances with pre-tax income of CHF846 million despite volatile market conditions from sovereign debt concerns and client risk aversion resulting in reduced client activity across most businesses.</p>
          <p>Asset management continues to make progress on delivering a more focused business model. Pre-tax income was CHF22 million.</p>
          <p>Let me continue by looking at the Group's operating expenses in more detail on slide seven. The second quarter expenses included some non-recurring items, so we are showing this slide to better identify the trends in overall compensation and non-compensation expenses against the first quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>We remain disciplined in our approach to compensation. At the top right hand side of the slide, you can see that the increase in compensation compared to first quarter resulted from the payment of the U.K. bonus tax of CHF440 million. It was reported in the corporate center.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for this item, like-for-like compensation and benefits were down 9% and 19% from the first quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2009, respectively, as a result of lower performance related compensation. We continue to build our capabilities, increasing our head count by a further 900 people in the quarter. We have now increased our total employee numbers by 5% from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for significant litigation provisions, other operating expenses increased by 10% quarter-over-quarter as we continue to invest in business growth. Our priorities remain the strengthening of our flow businesses Investment Banking and expanding our international presence in Private Banking. Marketing costs were seasonally higher in the second quarter and professional services also increased. So, overall total operating expenses were down 2% versus the first quarter and 7% against the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Let me move to the divisional results on slide eight. Challenges in the market environment resulted in subdued client activity as the industry landscape continues to evolve. However, Private Banking continued to report solid second quarter results. We continued to demonstrate momentum in our industry leading multi-shore business model with strong net new asset inflows of CHF13.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Revenues were up on higher client foreign exchange income and brokerage fees driven by market volatility although performance fees were negatively affected by the market conditions. Clients remain cautious with regard to more complex investment products. As a result, the gross margin remains stable compared to the first quarter at the cyclical low of 120 basis points. We are encouraged by an increase in the number of integrated solution transactions in the first half of 2010 but the average transactions size is smaller than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Corporate and Institutional client business continued to perform strongly.</p>
          <p>Let me continue with further detail on our Private Banking results, starting with our wealth management business on slide nine. Pre-tax income for wealth management was CHF633 million, a decrease of 6% over the first quarter of 2010. The asset inflows were strong at CHF11.9 billion as we continued to gain market share. Revenues were up slightly and more than offset by higher expenses driven by continued investment in international platforms and client services, particularly IT related, and higher sales and marketing costs.</p>
          <p>We continued selective hiring, adding a net 20 relationship managers; gross new hires were 100, the delta of 80 here reflects the continued talent upgrade taking place within the business.</p>
          <p>In summary, the sold pre-tax result has been affected by the operating environment. However, strong asset inflows continued this quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, you will see our net new asset performance. The strong net new asset inflows of CHF11.9 billion combined with the 12.9 billion in the first quarter represents an annualized growth rate of 6.2%, a significant out-performance in a challenging market. The balanced regional contribution demonstrates the strength of our platform and the trust our clients have in Credit Suisse. Inflows were particularly strong in EMEA in the second quarter despite small outflows due to the situation in Germany.</p>
          <p>Now turning to net revenues and gross margin on slide 11. This shows you a three-year history of the net revenue and gross margin trends and gives you a clearer picture of how net revenues are being affected by the current operating environment. We have split out the recurring revenues between net interest income and commissions and fees to help explain the trends.</p>
          <p>Looking at the quarterly average revenue comparisons between the first six months of 2010 and full year 2009, the quarterly average net revenues are 1% higher overall with 4% and 2% increases in recurring commissions and fees and recurring net interest income respectively.</p>
          <p>Higher assets under management levels resulted in increased management and advisory fees. However, the percentage increase in recurring commissions and fees lacked the growth in assets under management as cautious client behavior resulted in lower demand for more complex financial products. Subdued client activity reduced transaction-based revenues by 6% from the average level seen in 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving to the average gross margin, you can see that the dilution from 131 to 121 basis points has resulted from the gap between the 1% overall improvement in average quarterly net revenues compared to a 9% increase at average assets under management, comparing the first half of 2010 with the full year 2009. New assets under management are not initially as productive in margin terms as existing assets under management, but become more productive over time.</p>
          <p>The overall year-on-year gross margin decline was due to a strong increase in assets under management compared to relatively stable net interest income levels, providing 3 basis points of the overall 10 basis points gross margin reduction. Lower commission and performance fees resulted in a further 2 basis point fall in the recurring margin and cautious client behavior and lower integrated solution revenues accounted for a 5 basis point fall in the transaction margin.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, there are a number of different levers that will drive the expansion of the gross margin, namely increased client activity, integrated solution revenues, a greater level of managed investment products, performance fees, and the rising interest rates.</p>
          <p>I will continue with our Corporate and Institutional Client business on slide 12. Compared to the second quarter of 2009, pre-tax income increased by 37% to CHF241 million as a result of 6% higher revenues, and the net release of credit risk provisions. Pre-tax margin is 15.7%, supported by a strong credit environment and the continued recovery in the Swiss economy. The companies generally are performing well. We are continuing to expand our market share in our Institutional business with further asset inflows this quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn to Investment Banking on slide 13. We delivered a respectable pre-tax return on capital and reported solid revenues across most of our businesses in the second quarter of 2010 during a more challenging quarter for the industry. Spiking volatility, macroeconomic concerns and regulatory uncertainty caused many clients to sit on the sidelines. Nevertheless, we continued to gain market share across products and geographies and made further progress in implementing our strategic initiatives.</p>
          <p>Within our sales and trading businesses, in franchises where we have been historically strong we continued to deliver solid results. In particular, we achieved strong revenues across our major equity sales and trading businesses. And our RMBS business continued to perform well. We also had good results in global rates and foreign exchange. Performance in these businesses helped partially mitigates the weaker sales and trading results in credit which were adversely impacted by a difficult market environment.</p>
          <p>Our underwriting and advisory results held up well, reflecting the market share gains we have achieved, even though industry-wide capital issuance declined during the quarter. So overall, we delivered resilient results given the volatile conditions during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows you a more detailed analysis of the quarterly results trend. Revenues of CHF4.2 billion and pre-tax income was CHF800 million. Although the results were lower compared to the first quarter 2010 and the second quarter 2009, they represent resilient results given the market backdrop. Similarly, our pre-tax return although lower than in prior quarters, continues to be healthy at 17%.</p>
          <p>And finally, despite the turbulence and volatility during the quarter, we maintained our focus on risk discipline. Our risk-weighted assets decreased slightly in dollar terms in the second quarter while VaR increased slightly as we grew our client businesses.</p>
          <p>Moving to our results by business line and starting with fixed income sales and trading and underwriting on slide 15, many of our fixed income businesses delivered strong results during the quarter while others were more severely impacted by the market environment. In particular, our RMBS business, where we have historically been a dominant franchise, performed very well.</p>
          <p>We had solid results in global rates and foreign exchange, those businesses where we have made significant progress in recent quarters in improving our market position; and where we are continuing to invest in order to further improve this market position.</p>
          <p>Businesses that had weak results included our credit businesses, impacted by the sovereign debt concerns and widening credit spreads. Similarly, our emerging markets and corporate lending businesses were also affected by increased client risk aversion and widening spreads during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, as we continued to build on our market share in our flow base business, we have now completed the majority of the planned flow sales hires that we had previously outlined. Most of these hires came on board fairly recently and we expect them to become productive by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to our equities business on slide 16. Our equities results for the quarter were strong both overall and across key businesses. Our revenues were in line with the previous quarter with strong revenues in all our key businesses: cash equities, including higher revenues from our electronic trading, prime services and equity derivatives.</p>
          <p>Prime services continued to perform well notwithstanding the fact that hedge fund leverage and activity levels remained low compared to historic levels. Despite the volatile environment, equity derivatives produced solid revenues.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 17, as I have mentioned before our advisory and underwriting revenues were resilient, even as issuance volumes declined, underscoring our market share gains in the underwriting business. Our M&amp;A revenues increased quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, driven by an increase in our market share and completed M&amp;A volumes. Going into the third quarter, our pipeline is significantly stronger compared to where we were a year ago, particularly in ECM and leveraged finance. However, the execution of this pipeline is heavily dependent on market conditions.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 18, this shows you a long-term view of our market share progression. Touching briefly on our major businesses, in equities we maintained our leadership position in key businesses, including cash equities and prime services. In fixed income, we have significant momentum across products but there is still room for improvement, especially in rates and foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>In underwriting and advisory, we have seen particularly strong market share gains in debt underwriting this quarter. Our share of wallet in leveraged finance also showed significant improvement within emerging markets. Meanwhile, we are continuing to reestablish leadership in products that we have been historically strong, such as IPOs.</p>
          <p>Let me move to the divisional bubble charts on slide number 19. The following slides are a slight variation, though, on what we have shown in previous quarters. In these slides, we have attempted to categorize our business &#x2013; businesses based on the trends we are seeing in the market share and the market environment so far this year compared to 2009 starting with slide 19, which addresses businesses where we saw improved market share as well as more favorable market conditions during the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets, we are currently taking advantage of our strengths in the business to further invest. We continue to grow our platform across products and should benefit going forward from a move to a local market focused strategy. We have increased our M&amp;A market share from a year ago with a 17% market share year-to-date in global completed transactions.</p>
          <p>Equity derivative performance was solid across all products and regions in a very volatile quarter. We continued to make significant market share gains, especially in Asia, benefiting from our shift to a client-focused, capital-efficient strategy.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 20, looking at those businesses with improved market share and a less favorable market environment. In some of these businesses, notably prime services and cash equities, increased market share has had helped largely offset the impact of the less favorable environment, resulting in broadly stable revenues. There's a similar story in leveraged finance.</p>
          <p>In foreign exchange, we have expanded our sales force significantly and are building out our electronic capability. In rates, the normalization of the environment had a significant impact, resulting in lower revenues, which we indicated would happen last year.</p>
          <p>Finally, on slide 21 we address businesses where revenue decline was driven by a combination of both lower market share and the less favorable environment, namely ECM, investment grade debt, RMBS and commodities.</p>
          <p>In ECM and investment grade debt, the revenue decline was largely a function of the environment in the first half of 2010 with significantly lower issuance levels, especially in the second quarter. In addition, investment grade debt was also affected by the difficult credit environment during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Commodities is an important growth area for us, but as you can see from the chart, not yet a significant revenue contribution. Revenues in the first half were impacted by weak client activity, but we are beginning to see an improvement in market conditions and have a better pipeline for the second half.</p>
          <p>Finally, in RMBS there has been a stabilization of the market environment compared to the exceptionally favorable conditions that we saw last year and market share remained relatively stable.</p>
          <p>Now slide 22 brings it all together by showing the relative performances of all our main businesses. Overall, our market share grew in the first half of 2010, although generally revenues were affected by a less favorable environment, especially in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The next slide, number 23, represents our medium-term outlook on the development of our market share and the market environment. Our views on prospects for revenue sustainability have not change significantly from what we have articulated in the past. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to gain further market share, as our flow sales higher in rates, emerging markets, credit and foreign exchange become fully productive and we will continue to invest in our equities businesses.</p>
          <p>We expect these market share gains to offset the impact of continued market normalization in rates and RMBS. In addition, over the medium term, we expect the market condition in most of the key businesses to remain stable or improve.</p>
          <p>Let me move to risk and capital usage trends on slide 24. The chart on the top shows the risk-weighted asset levels in the Investment Bank. Risk-weighted assets in the ongoing businesses remained stable while in the exit businesses they reduced by a further 2 billion. VaR increased slightly, primarily reflecting increased risk usage in our client flow businesses. There were no back testing exceptions in the quarter. Indeed, we experienced only two small loss-making trading days in the quarter. If you look at the daily trading revenue chart on page 63 of our financial release, you will also see a tight distribution in our daily revenue levels during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our change in strategy to a client-focused, capital-efficient business model delivers a very different outcome than four to five years ago when you would have certainly seen more loss base and a much wider distribution of daily profits and losses during any one quarter.</p>
          <p>I will now continue with Asset Management on slide 25. We continue to implement our Asset Management strategy, focusing on alternative investments strategies, asset allocation products and solutions and our Swiss platform. Following the very strong inflow of CHF11 billion last quarter, we continued to generate net new asset inflows in spite the challenging environment and against general market trends seen by some of our competitors and we continued to transform the business towards a more fee-based business model.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to slide 26. Management fees remained stable but difficult market conditions impacted the pre-tax income with performance fees minimal in the quarter due to the market conditions and much lower investment gains. Money market lift-out gains were 36 million compared to CHF107 million in the first quarter. This completes the exit of the money market lift-out portfolio. Repositioning of unprofitable businesses contributed to the off-writing expense increase of 3% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 27, the fee-based margin on average assets under management remained relatively stable. Management fees improved 6% on the second quarter of last year and were stable compared to last quarter. Placement, transaction and other fees have increased compared with the previous quarter. Lower performance fees are reflective of the difficult market environment.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at net new asset inflows in more detail on slide 28. Net new asset inflow in the second quarter of 2010 was achieved against the backdrop of a more risk-averse client base and represents the fourth consecutive quarter of net inflows for the business. The alternative investments business continued to see asset inflows, particularly in private equity fund-of-funds and hedge funds. In summary, despite the lower asset inflows we are encouraged by this performance compared to the quarterly industry trends and will continue to build on the positive trends we have seen over the last few quarters.</p>
          <p>This concludes the divisional results review and I will now continue with the Group's capital and funding position on slide 29. We continue to maintain a strong position as one of the best capitalized banks globally with a Basel II Tier 1 ratio of 16.3% notwithstanding the negative 21 basis point impact of calling hybrid notes during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our core Tier 1 ratio, excluding hybrid capital, improved slightly to 11.4%. The Swiss regulatory leverage ratio was slightly lower at 3.9% as a result of higher average total assets in the second quarter, mainly driven by exchange rate translation differences. The U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate movement also drove total risk-weighted assets slightly higher in the quarter. We have maintained our consistent dividend accrual policy from the first quarter and last year and this accrual is fully reflected in our June quarter end 2010 Basel II capital ratios.</p>
          <p>Credit Suisse is subject to FINMA stress tests regularly and undergoes a potential loss analysis quarterly. Although we have not been informed of all the specific parameters being used by EU institutions, our estimate is that the FINMA tests are more than twice as severe as the EU stress tests currently being carried out by the European Central Bank. We believe that if we were subjected to similar EU stress tests, we would remain one of the best capitalized banks in the world and well in excess of our targeted 12.5%, Basel II, Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation and with that I will hand back to Brady.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, Renato. Before we go to Q&amp;A, I wanted to spend a little bit of time saying a few words about our position in respect to the evolving regulatory developments. And there's obviously been a lot of discussion and debate on the topic and there's still a fair amount of uncertainty around a lot of these issues, but we thought it would be helpful, maybe, just to put a little bit of context on it and sort of where we think Credit Suisse is positioned in this.</p>
          <p>So while there still is a fair amount of uncertainty in the emerging regulatory landscape, we do think we have a strong starting point which we show in the box in the upper left hand corner of this slide. We do think our client-focused, capital-efficient business positions us well for most of the regulatory initiatives. We have a strong capital position with an industry-leading Tier 1 ratio of 16.3%, which is a good base to work from.</p>
          <p>We've been operating within the limits of the FINMA leverage ratio since 2008 and with our very strong liquidity position we have been able to comply with the FINMA requirements which we believe will be similar to Basel III. We also adapted our compensation policies a year early to ensure that they're aligned with FINMA's guidelines which are proving to be industry best practice. The evolution of our client-focused, capital-efficient strategy and lower-risk business model over the past three years means that the evolving U.S. regulation around prop trading and derivatives is likely to have limited impact for Credit Suisse.</p>
          <p>Looking at the right hand column on this slide, in general we are seeing indications of an easing of pressure globally both as to level and timing of the implementation of capital leverage and liquidity requirements, including significant transition periods. We're encouraged by what seems to be an increased consensus among policymakers on contingent capital securities as a key element of future capital structures. We're also seeing an increased interest in the idea of a so-called bailing concept as an additional means of strengthening capital.</p>
          <p>There's increasing clarity on regulatory outcomes in the U.S., the U.K., and the EU. We also believe that it's likely that Switzerland will regulate its industry in the context of the global competitive landscape. This is likely to be tougher than the rest of the world, but proportionate.</p>
          <p>If you go to the bottom of this slide you can see the Credit Suisse has a number of advantages which we think will help us to manage these changes over the transition period. First, our hybrid capital will remain an important capital component during the transition period with the potential to convert into other forms of effective capital.</p>
          <p>Second, our capital-efficient strategy means that although the Basel III risk-weighted asset developments are not yet completely certain, we believe that they will be more manageable for us. And finally, we have a very capital generative business model which bring us a number of advantages. It will enable us to build significant retained earnings but at the same time allows us to provide capacity for continued payments of dividends to shareholders.</p>
          <p>And this earnings potential also allows use of our deferred tax assets over the transition period. For instance, in the &#x2013; we've seen a CHF400 million underlying reduction of deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>So there's some way to go before the evolving picture becomes clear, but there are encouraging signs. We've already made and will continue to make our strategic choices in the context of all this.</p>
          <p>So hopefully this is just a very short summary but it helps to give you some context for assessing the possible impacts of these changes and our ability to manage through them while continuing to maintain the momentum of our business model.</p>
          <p>So now with that, I think we're ready to take questions; I guess we'll start here in the auditorium.</p>

          <p>Kilian Maier, NZB. I'd like to start with the regulatory topic you ended with. The first one would be the too big to fail discussion. The dust really settles here. The most important question for me that remains open is on the so-called predetermined breaking points <mark type="inaudible" /> and how that is reconcilable with the integrated banking model.</p>
          <p>And the second one, in September there will be probably a result on the Swiss/German double taxation agreement. What would be your best case scenario and what do you think is realistic outcome on that?</p>
          <p>And then a last, tiny question on wealth management; you increased your client loans by 3 billion. Yesterday at Julius Baer about 50% of increased loans remains within the group; what's the picture at Credit Suisse?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I see how much of those assets do we retain, you mean, in terms of ... okay. Well, why don't I try to answer the first question and then maybe I'll have Walter Berchtold address your second and third questions on the issues around the German withholding tax and sort of asset under management impacts of lending within the wealth management business.</p>
          <p>Well, I think on too big to fail, I guess what I'd say is first of all I think there is &#x2013; hopefully there is increasing recognition of everything that's been done in terms of the regulatory front and particularly here in Switzerland. Obviously, a lot of measures have been taken in terms of capital leverage liquidity. And clearly, business models have been evolved quite a bit. I mean, Credit Suisse's business model has been evolved quite substantially over the last three years to a much more capital-efficient business, et cetera. So I think all that is relevant to the overall discussion.</p>
          <p>As you say, there's a continuing, obviously, discussion around whether additional measures need to be taken, what kind of measures in the context of the too big to fail. I think it's obviously still under discussion, so it's &#x2013; I'm not sure that there is a very specific answer to your question.</p>
          <p>The expert commission, though, that reported &#x2013; the preliminary report of the expert commission actually ruled out a number of measures, as you know; things like breaking up the large banks, et cetera, were actually ruled out by that expert commission report which we thought was a pretty &#x2013; was encouraging and a pretty convincing answer to that. So they're obviously &#x2013; I do think that the discussion, it takes into account the totality of the issues, right.</p>
          <p>Capital, leverage, liquidity, business model, all those issues will be relevant to whether or not there are any organizational measures and at what point any organizational measures need to be put in place, living wills, et cetera. So my view is actually I still think that this obviously is an issue, it's under debate. But we believe that we're going to end up with a solution that will allow us to maintain our business model and continue to push forward with the strategy that we have.</p>
          <p>Walter, do you want to try to take issue around the German withholding tax?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not 100% sure that I understood it correctly, but just &#x2013; we had about 3 billion of additional Lombard loans in the second quarter and all of that basically stays within Credit Suisse; it's really leveraging securities position. Maybe Baer was referring to something else.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in that respect, when we speak about loans taken against securities almost everything stays within the bank.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> in say private clients -- in our private clients business if you &#x2013; mortgage lending obviously doesn't stay within the bank because it goes to purchase a house, presumably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And corporate lending as well; there it is different, but when it comes to Lombard lending, again securities, most of it, stays with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which I think is what you referring to that increase. I think your other question was just on the overall &#x2013; you were saying what is our &#x2013; what's the prospect of the agreement &#x2013; government agreements on cross border issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the double taxation agreement with Germany's &#x2013; probably will be reported in September and your best case scenario and what do you think is realistic, maybe?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously double tax fee is sort of like rules how we collect taxes from each other and <mark type="inaudible" /> back. So I think that will go the normal course. The question is what happens on the side; I &#x2013; when we speak about regulation of legacy assets. I don't know what the outcome will be, just what I would hope for is a solution that we can as well concentrate on our daily business and don't have to really discuss all the time about these legacies. And what that will be, I don't know. I mean that's obviously right now a political discussion going on. But we just need to find a way in Switzerland to deal with the legacy, especially when it comes to neighboring countries.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Philipp Zieschang from UBS. Two questions please, one on the Wealth Management side and one on the Investment Bank. On the Wealth Management side, when you held your Investor Day on Wealth Management in September last year, you issued basically the 40% pre-tax profit target and that was already at a time when you saw how 2009 evolved. We are now down to, I think, 25 in Wealth Management. Could you just comment what is the delta in terms of your expectations and what is cyclical and what's your reaction towards that?</p>
          <p>The second point on the Investment Bank is you mentioned that your view on revenue sustainability has not changed a lot. It's interesting to model based on your Investment Bank given you had three huge quarters in sales and trading last year and you've disclosed a couple of hundred million in bounce back revenues. But nevertheless, there's quite a gap between the past three quarters and the first three last year. So what is &#x2013; what would you say is the base you build your plans on? Is it the first half this year with a bit of upside or is it still in sight to move back to the levels last year given your comment on revenue sustainability and what's the impact on the profit margin? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think on the first question, I mean maybe I can answer it generally and then if you want more detail Walter could address it. But I think our medium-term view on the Private Banking business is still quite constructive. I mean we think that there &#x2013; we are at a cyclical low in terms of activity. We've had, I think, the strongest private bank in the context of net new assets that have been gathered over the course of the past couple of years. We have continuing momentum on that front. And our belief is that we will get sort of less conservative client behavior over time. At some point, we'll get interest rates moving up, which will benefit the business. And so, our view is still quite constructive on the business over sort of a medium-term. And so I think, ultimately, those profit margins that we laid out are still margins that we believe the business should get to, and that's probably our aspiration, but it's also our belief.</p>
          <p>The question is obviously, as you say, we presented that last September. Probably, if you had held our feet to the fire at that point and said when would you actually see this happen, I mean, we didn't answer it. We probably wouldn't have answered it if you'd asked us. But you know, a year later, obviously we'd like to see it happen and we would probably &#x2013; if you'd ask me, I probably would have expected it to have seen it starting to happen by now.</p>
          <p>So it's clearly been pushed out by a lot of the activity in the market, volatility, et cetera. But I think our view is still that this is a &#x2013; we've got a great fundamental business here. It is at a cyclical down point, but we actually still believe that those kind of margins &#x2013; that kind of margin expansion will occur over a period of time here. It's just obviously hard to say; it's the CHF64 question is what &#x2013; exactly what period of time will we see that on. I don't know, Walter, can you add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just quickly now. Obviously, we want to move this back up, but as Brady said, we do believe in the long-term growth of this industry. And what we are currently concentrating on is investing, but obviously keep it balanced around current levels. And then once the market &#x2013; and we need the market to come back, and we're all in the same environment so we know a little bit about how these markets are behaving.</p>
          <p>There is a lot of cyclicality. There's obviously very subdued activities from our clients, which needs to come back at one point in time. Then we want to move that back up, and we want to move that back up to 40. Now, whether 40 is then the right level, we will have to see, view that in the long run, but clearly we want to improve; we want to improve the margins on that business. That's our aim. But I need a little bit of help as well by markets. And in the meantime, we very carefully invest into the business and keep it around these levels.</p>
          <p>Now in terms &#x2013; what I am always getting asked, well do you have any triggers if it doesn't come? I don't have triggers. We just constantly observe the market; we constantly check whether our investments make sense, where the growth is coming through.</p>
          <p>Growth is very important for me. As long as I have growth, net new asset growth, I'm very confident that we're on the right track. That is how we currently manage the business going forward. And in all honesty, I probably would expect a little bit of a J-curve effect here; still have relatively subdued development of revenues in the current environment and then have leverage kicking in later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, do you want to address the issue about Investment Banking revenues sustainability, or ...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what you're trying to do is compare the previous year to the last two quarters. And I think what you saw in 2009 was an environment where you had extraordinarily high volumes and very good margins. There was a very directional market; investors were taking risk, which is a very good environment for banks to make good returns.</p>
          <p>In the first two quarters, you've seen, especially in the second quarter, very subdued flows; more turmoil in the market, more volatility. In that environment, we are going to make less money. The question is where is the market going to be? We actually think there's a lot of upside in our business. We don't think it can get a whole lot worse than it currently is.</p>
          <p>Our business model is built around client focus and capital efficiency. We don't run as much risk in our model as others do so we think it's very sustainable in good markets and bad markets. As we look forward, some of our big engines of growth, if you look at emerging markets, if you look at leveraged finance, if you look at the share that we're taking in rates and in FX, those are all very positive signs.</p>
          <p>If you look at our investment banking backlogs, our M&amp;A backlog is 20% better than it was a year ago; leveraged finance is 100% better than it was a year ago; equity capital markets is 90% better than a year ago. So we feel very good about our pipeline. For the constructive market, we think there's a lot of upside.</p>
          <p>In the Equity business, there's a lot of leverage in it. We're a top player across different businesses. As volume comes back into that business, we think the scale and the operating leverage in that business will bring a lot of additional pre-tax income.</p>
          <p>So where are the markets going to be? We're not sure, but we're obviously investing for a more normalized market which we think is better than what it is right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I would just add I think the &#x2013; we &#x2013; I think we gave the sort of &#x2013; in the third and the fourth quarter last year we talked about what we thought were the prospects for the business and we actually even talked about the fact that we thought there was upside from the levels produced in '09 because it was &#x2013; I mean '09 was a good market in many respects but there were &#x2013; we saw opportunities and we saw more ways to grow our business and to do more. Obviously, as Eric said, it's very much dependent on obviously market conditions that we see.</p>
          <p>But we do think &#x2013; I mean what we are trying &#x2013; what we've tried to build here is and we're continuing to build towards is a model that's actually more resilient and I think, which you can see, I think the equities business, as Eric mentioned, is probably the best example of that. If you look at the second quarter performance, we were flat on revenues in the first quarter and that's because of the very strong market share because the investments that we've made in that business in terms of our &#x2013; a lot of our electronic trading platforms, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And we think when you have very strong market share like that, even when the client flow shrinks, you can &#x2013; you actually probably get a higher percentage of the total flow which actually leads you to get a similar absolute amount of flow. So that's where we're trying to drive all of our businesses and continue to make progress towards that.</p>
          <p>So I don't, I mean, I don't even, I don't know that I would, I hope we can bracket some of the performance with the second &#x2013; the second quarter was, as Eric said, I think, a pretty difficult environment, I think, as all of you know and you can see that from the industry as a whole. But I do think actually that even as we looked at the business late last year, we still think there were areas of upside depending on market performance.</p>
          <p>So we'll see and I think the comment on the backlogs is a very good one which as you know we've got. If the markets are &#x2013; and obviously backlogs are notoriously hard to predict, whether you're actually going to be able to execute them, but we have terrific backlogs right now. So if we can just get decent markets through the rest of the year, then I think we can probably see a leg up in the business. Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Teresa Nielsen from Bank Vontobel. I have a question regarding the investment bank compensation expenses. You're going to &#x2013; you've hired a lot of people in the rates business, which I expect will be coming in as of the third quarter. When do you expect these people to be break even? Should we expect the cost base, the compensation cost base in the investment bank, to increase material due to these hirings? And are you hiring currently also in other businesses in the investment bank?</p>
          <p>Then my second question is on the wealth management. Do you see an increase in competition for client advisors in Asia? Is there an increase also in the compensation of these client advisors that you have in Asia and do you see generally like this having a material impact on the overall compensation going forward for wealth management? And regarding market share in Asia, do you see an increase in your market share in wealth management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe &#x2013; I don't know, Eric, if you want to take the first question and Walter, if you can take the second and third.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we've added about 600 people between the first quarter and the second quarter, which is 2.5, 3% increase in head count. A lot of that head count did come out of the expansion in the sales areas, both FX rates and credit. So what we are trying to do is really broaden and deepen our sales platform so we can create more volume and put them across our electronic trading platforms, create more volume, get more leverage in the business; very consistent with our client-focused, capital-efficient model.</p>
          <p>Where we also saw head count increase was in the technology side, but we're trying to continue to build those electronic models and support the ones that we've already developed in the cash equities and the AES businesses. That's very consistent with trying to take the technology from the cash equities and AES business, where we're a top player, and leverage that into the fixed income business in a similar way and create a similar sort of engine for profitability.</p>
          <p>We also increased head count in emerging markets to build out that area which we talked about in the first quarter. I think there was a question on that. We continue to focus on the emerging markets to build on our position. We also added some in the cash area and the prime area.</p>
          <p>So when do we cover costs? A lot of these, we think, are accretive immediately. In terms of the overall sales build out, we expect them to cover costs within the first year and then be very accretive thereafter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I don't think you'd see, in terms of the impact on the cost line, I mean obviously the compensation accruals are risk adjusted effectively so its not really &#x2013; I don't know that you would see an impact on the cost line from that hiring. You shouldn't, I mean, I think we expect &#x2013; we would expect the businesses, as Eric said, to really produce enough to cover that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, quickly on the competitive landscape in Asia, clearly &#x2013; I mean it is obviously a very competitive landscape, but we see now in this new cycle since the financial crisis is that we have new entrances coming to the market, i.e. the local banks like ICBC, Bank of China so on so forth will now start as well developing private banking franchises.</p>
          <p>That has obviously pushed up certainly the compensation levels; you have more attractive places to go to. And so far we have been very fortunate. We took the chances, as I pointed out many times before, to really upgrade. We have been hiring as well this year again very substantial growth amounts of new relationship managers in the area.</p>
          <p>In terms of market share, I do believe we gain market share. We are growing around 20% in Asia even though Asia is booming at still above, I think, the overall growth rate of wealth in the region. And then in general, I think, we have seen a little bit of salary increase &#x2013; mainly salary increase especially in the private banking industry. It has something to do with the people of that being certain salary advance because of overall retention problems. And that obviously has had an impact on the entire industry.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, can I ask some questions on wealth management and also on liquidity? On wealth management, can you talk a bit more about the inflows in the quarter and to what extent there's kind of a flight to quality and whether that was the issue at the time behind the very strong inflow in EMEA? I don't know; I would assume there were slight inflows and outflows out of Germany so if you could talk a bit more about that.</p>
          <p>And then you made a comment on the fact that the new &#x2013; the net new money growth is diluting the margin. Is that also something to do with the move from offshore to onshore? And also whether you've got any ide &#x2013; any hope or plans to do something on pricing because I think your peer group are talking about adjusting pricing upwards slightly?</p>
          <p>And then third question just on liquidity. I don't know if you could comment on the new rules and where you are versus them. I noticed your buffer or your stock liquidity went up 10 billion. I mean are we there now? Have you put in everything in place? Or is there more cost to come? Thanks</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the last part of that question first and then maybe I can &#x2013; I'll quickly answer the first one and then Walter can talk a little bit about the net new money growth and onshore, offshore, et cetera.</p>
          <p>On the liquidity front, yeah, I mean we have entered into this agreement with <mark type="inaudible" /> the regulator on what the liquidity requirements are and we are fully in satisfaction of that requirement. That's really a result of what's been a very conservative approach to liquidity by us, really, for the last year and a half; I mean we've basically continued to term out our liabilities.</p>
          <p>We have continued to take a very conservative approach to the structure of the liability side of the balance sheet. In fact, I think we've gone over the last three years from 12% long-term debt to 17% long-term debt. We pushed up the maturities by &#x2013; average maturities by a couple of years over the past period of time. So we've actually taken a lot of measures on the liquidity side which have put us in a much stronger position. That's going to cost us money as well when you look at our '09 results and our first half results this year. They clearly incorporate the cost that goes along with that, but we are, I think, in a very strong position on the liquidity front.</p>
          <p>On the wealth management side in terms of the inflows, as you said they were very strong really around all the regions in &#x2013; around the world, which was good; strong in Switzerland. As you mentioned, our flows in EMEA were the strongest. A lot of those flows were actually out of the emerging parts of Europe, so. But they were very strong flows there.</p>
          <p>I would say I think this issue of the flight to quality, I think in general obviously Switzerland is a very stable environment, strong currency, fiscal surplus, et cetera. I think all that is a positive, but I think it's &#x2013; I think it's a marginal positive; I don't think that we've seen a huge flight to safety, flows of net new money. And in fact, our flows in the second quarter were pretty &#x2013; I would say similar on a &#x2013; seasonally adjusted to our flows in the first quarter. So we just continue to have a very strong client momentum in that business.</p>
          <p>But, Walter, do you want to address this? That issue, or the net new money for business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, quickly on the net new money in EMEA; as Brady mentioned, the major part came from emerging markets, i.e. Middle East and Eastern Europe and onshore Europe. We had, as mentioned by Renato, modest outflows when it comes to Germany due to, obviously, the ongoing discussions we have around that.</p>
          <p>In terms of diluting factor, obviously a lot of assets which are coming these days are coming from outside high net-worth individuals. They have normally a little bit of a lower income, but obviously a higher multiplier underneath, and then it's all a timing issue. If you have strong net new asset outflow, it takes &#x2013; inflow, sorry, it takes a while 'til you can make them productive, and has nothing really to do with on or offshore. It has something to do with how much you can offer to a client on the various platforms available.</p>
          <p>And in terms of pricing, we do constantly look at our pricing models, and we do constantly adjust our pricing models, and we go up and we go down, because obviously our services are changing and what we are trying really to do is more and more price for advice. That's our strategy.</p>

Perhaps you could give us &#x2013; share with us any thoughts you have on whether you would see a progressive dividend for this year or given, I think, your outlook that Q3 remains much like Q2, we should probably just figure more on a stable? And I appreciate that's obviously the decision of the Board.</p>
          <p>And number two, just &#x2013; to give us, is it possibly &#x2013; if you could just share your views on the outlook for fixed income? I mean one way to read slide 22 is that actually the current environment is what you think of as a more ordinary environment fixed income and therefore we should actually expect more subdued returns in the future. And I'd just love for you to share any thoughts you have about, you know, where you go from here? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Huw. I think with regard to the dividend issue, I mean I think we've been consistent in our comments which is just that what we're saying is we continue to take a consistent approach to dividend accrual and kind of leave it at that. So I mean obviously, as you say, there &#x2013; the &#x2013; there will be an impact on exactly performance of the business, et cetera. We could have an impact on that, but in general we're taking a consistent approach to dividend accrual.</p>
          <p>With regard to the outlook for fixed income, I mean I could probably have Eric answer it in more detail, but I don't think we view the second quarter as a sort of status quo case for the markets going forward. I mean the second quarter was a very challenging environment. So I don't think we view it that way at all. I think in fact we see a number of areas where we'll see &#x2013; where we could see really pretty significant upside. So I don't know, Eric, if you want to address that a little bit.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if you look at the slide &#x2013; and I don't think we'll put the slide back on, but I think what it showed was ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They just put the slide back up.</p>

          <p>Did they? Oh, good. No, it's the one before that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One after that, sorry. 23. Yeah, there it is. I think what that slide shows is that in RMBS, which is a very strong business of ours, you're probably moving into a less favorable environment and we'll probably lose a bit of share just given our dominance in that area. In the rates business probably a little bit less of an attractive market; but we've got a lot of momentum there and we think with our sales build out, we'll actually take share and we'll actually make incremental money in that business.</p>
          <p>Away from RMBS and rates, we are pretty bullish on the rest of our businesses whether it be FX, emerging markets, credit; we think those are all very big engines that will have a pretty big uplift if we get into more favorable markets. So we don't see a similar market to Q2, we actually see a lot of upside as we move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you take areas like &#x2013; if you take areas like where we've talked about the backlog on the leverage finance side where we have a leading franchise and a very strong backlog and if the markets are available for it, that's a business where we could see a significant uptick in results.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have two questions. One is kind of a general question. The wealth management business, where the costs came in sort of above where I was going for anyway and reading qualitatively it sounds like that's an area you're investing in and makes a lot of sense, I guess, to invest there counter cyclically. But what would make you hit the brakes on the investment, I guess much like you did in the investment bank in '08? I mean what kind of &#x2013; what are the mileposts, if you will, that you're looking at that make you think yep, this business is going to turn around, market's going to turn around? And what would scare you and make you say nope, we're going to start cutting costs? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And then just a really detailed question on the Tier 1 capital, once again the other move in the quarter was a rather big other in terms of Tier 1 capital. It was a negative 1,349 million. I was just wondering if you could give some more color on what that move was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Derek. Well, I think on the wealth management, I mean, Walter a little bit addressed it before, but you're right. I mean we are investing in the business, although I think we're being pretty disciplined about it. I mean I think as we mentioned we added net 20 RMs in the quarter, which is &#x2013; I think that represents a fairly disciplined approach. However, we did add gross 100 RMs in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So as Walter mentioned, we're actually doing a lot of upgrading in the quality, et cetera, so. But it is a fairly disciplined approach to investment, but as we've said, we do have medium-term positive view on it. I guess I'm not sure there's any specific &#x2013; any sort of specific bright line test in terms of where we would feel that that would be something where we would re &#x2013; where we would make a change in approach there.</p>
          <p>Again, I think it's as Walter said, we're constantly looking at the business, looking at what the inflows are, wealth creation around the world, which continues to be pretty robust; market share growth rates for us, which continues to be pretty robust. And so I think based on all that, I think we'll &#x2013; we would obviously continue to monitor that, but I'm not sure there is any sort of bright line areas that would jump out at us.</p>
          <p>With the &#x2013; with regard to the Tier 1, you can't see it, Derek, but we're flipping through pages to make sure we're going to get a good answer to your question. Do you guys have that, or do you want to come back to that or...come back to it? Okay. So I guess what you're &#x2013; you were right, Derek, it was a technical question, so we'll come back and ... We'll &#x2013; these guys are look into and we'll come back later in the call and answer it.</p>
          <p>Next question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good morning. Three questions from my side. On the dividend, I understand you're consistently accruing through the quarters. And ignoring the results for a second, do you think there is any potential impact on the dividend from the findings that we get from the expert commission, which I think are coming out in late August? So that's my first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on wealth management; again, I felt that the expenses were a bit higher than I had gone for and wondering whether the current level is a sustainable level or whether there were any one-offs there? And third question was really on the investment bank. Just wondering if you could quantify the mark-to-market impact of the kind of traded corporate lending book in investment banking revenues; to what extent that might have an adverse result within fixed income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll try to answer the first one and then maybe Walter could answer the question around the sustainable level of, or the level of expenses in wealth management and I guess Eric or David can take the corporate book impact.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the dividend side, I mean obviously it's &#x2013; as we've said, there's a lot of uncertainty with regard to a lot of these regulatory issues. So I don't think right now it's &#x2013; we're not certain of anything. But I think what we tried to outline, if you look at the slide that we laid out, what we tried to outline was the combination of elements that make us feel pretty comfortable with our ability to manage through a lot of these issues and to be able to continue to accrete capital, continue to have the capacity to pay dividends, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, obviously, I guess there are &#x2013; there could be outcomes that might change that but I think our general view is that we believe that we &#x2013; the world seems to be kind of conversing towards a more predictable place in terms of a lot of these regulations. And so I think our general view is that we continue to be &#x2013; to feel confident in our ability to manage the business towards that.</p>
          <p>So Walter can you answer the question on the expense level and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the expense level going forward, certainly for the next couple of quarters to come, I do think we will stay around these levels which you see currently as we further invest into our business both be it in platforms and in people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you &#x2013; Eric, can you address was there any mark-to-market impact of the traded corporate &#x2013; but I wouldn't have thought so, right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really no, yeah, no material impact from the &#x2013; our mark &#x2013; I guess you're talking about our mark-to-market loan book, I assume, is what you're talking about; no real impact.</p>
          <p>You ready? Yeah, can you go back to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry for the delay and so the main elements for the negative Tier 1 development you see in the report. There are three elements there. As usual, we have dividend accrual that is reflecting in that line. Then we have compensation impacts there; for instance, some shares that have to be bought back for compensation schemes. And then we have quality hybrid, the two hybrids. The smaller hybrids to the tune of something like 450 million in the quarter. So that's negative line you see that to the tune of, I believe, 1.3 billion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. A few questions, the first one is related to cost. Could you give me an idea how much of the cost is actually investment cost for the future within your cost line, and in particular within private banking and within the IB? And then I'll come up with &#x2013; I'll follow-up with the rest of the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you ask the rest of your questions, because...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The second question is again related to comp. Comp clean is 46 in the second quarter, highest of the industry; yet the highest in the first quarter, I think last time we had the lunch with you, Brady, you indicated could be around the same level as '09. I think you had about 42 in '09. Should we assume that you will stick to the around '09 level in comp to revenue ratio?</p>
          <p>And the third question is on page 31, slide 31, you talk about increased consensus around inclusion of CoCos. And I'm just interested what you mean this consensus, this consensus within the Swiss banking industry, G-20; how should we look at this? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll take the two, the second, third and then we'll get back to your first question on the cost &#x2013; the elements that are investment in that cost. I think, well on &#x2013; just on your last question, I mean it's just of our observation, so you may have a different observation but it just seems like increasingly in the sort of regulatory debate around the world there's an increasing sort of discussion around the world that contingent capital could play within that.</p>
          <p>And obviously there's still uncertainties about terms of that and whether there's a market and how much could actually be placed, et cetera. But it just seems that there is an increasing discussion around that as a constructive part of the capital structure, which frankly was last the case, I think, six months ago. So I would say across all those jurisdictions, I think it is a more &#x2013; it's a more frequent element of discussion and obviously I don't think anything's been finalized on it, but I think it's a more frequent element of that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the comp levels, I mean as you say, I mean clearly quarterly comp accrual and particularly comp to revenue is a bit of a spurious number. I think, as you say, what we had said from the beginning of the year and what I said and where I still aim is that we would be &#x2013; I think our goal would be to be in the sort of low 40s, which is a similar level or maybe even slightly lower level from 2009 in terms of the comp accruals. That will depend, obviously, on the performance of the business and I would think that will be the case for the industry and that will be the case for us as well.</p>
          <p>And I would argue again &#x2013; and you're talking about the level of our comp accruals versus others in the industry. I mean again, I think there's a lot of apples and oranges in terms of comparing those kinds of numbers. I mean, we have the lowest risk-weighted assets in the industry, the lowest sort of capital that's being put at risk in the industry which arguably means you probably would have higher compensation as a percentage of your cost base. But in any case, we do still certainly aspire to get to those kinds of levels as we mentioned to you before, so I think we're consistent with that. But obviously the second quarter, slightly more difficult quarter, leads to a slightly higher comp to revenue number.</p>
          <p>And then on the &#x2013; you want to start with IB? Okay, IB, what element of that is investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In the Investment Banking about half of the increased cost is currency related, the other half is IT expense, which is investment into the electronic trading platforms. Another piece of it were fees, professional fees, related to the acquisition of the fund administration business that we purchased from Fortis for the prime services business. And then there's a little bit associated with CMBS disposal.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the Private Banking side, let's make it half year/half year, we have an increase of about 300 million. Now, just to remind you first that we had &#x2013; last year we had extraordinary insurance policy of about 100 million. Then another 120 million is really investments into the future, and 80 million is salaries higher running costs.</p>

          <p>Your next question, Jernej Omahen of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Jernej here from Goldman. Can I start you off on the following question? Just looking at the tangible book value progression quarter-on-quarter, I think it was done on 7.4% and obviously a large chunk of that is the dividend payment. But still, even if you strip out the dividend payment and add the EPS for the quarter there, I think the book down around &#x2013; tangible book per share is down around 4% Q-on-Q. Can you just break that down for us just to understand how much of that is currency and what else is going on?</p>
          <p>And the second question I wanted to ask is this timing to the previous questions on dividend accruals, et cetera. I think it was mentioned on more than one occasion that Credit Suisse see itself as actually best-in-class when it comes to capitalization levels. Should we interpret this in a way that you have now &#x2013; Credit Suisse has decided how high the capital buy will go and that any capital generation upwards from where you are now, so compared to your core and headline tier 1 ratio should be deemed as excess capital or surplus capital? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. No, I think on the second question, let me address that first and then we get to your question on the &#x2013; detail question on the book value.</p>
          <p>No, I wouldn't say that. I mean I think what we tried, again, what we tried to lay out for you with this regulatory slide was sort of considerations. As we said, I think we all know there's a lot of uncertainty in a lot of this and so we are not trying to make it overly precise, but we do think that there are number of elements that actually put us, we think, in the strong position against this. The capital generative business model; we are very strongly capitalized and, again, we can talk about the different components of that capital. We tried to talk a little bit about how we see those progressing as well.</p>
          <p>So I don't think I would go so far as to say that we know where the bar is in terms of capital because I don't think we do. We tried to point out some of what we see in the external environment and again, you all have your own views and your own information on that as well in terms of what you see happening in terms of the BIS discussions, et cetera and their impact on the industry as a whole, which I think is a relevant element.</p>
          <p>So we tried to just lay that out. So I wouldn't say that we &#x2013; I wouldn't go so far as to say that we know exactly where the bar is going to be, et cetera, but I think, again, what we were trying to lay out on this screen was not that there isn't continuing uncertainly because there is; we all know there is, but to try to show that we think there are a number of ways in which we think we're in strong position to start out with, the external environment is probably improved a bit in terms of some of these issues and we think we've got some Credit Suisse specific issues that allow us to &#x2013; that put us in a very good position against that.</p>
          <p>How about the question on the book value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you are applying your own calculation on the capital development and which I appreciate, but in order to better understand you probably want to take that off line. What we publish, and you can see that on page 72 of our report, it's just a half year development of the equity over six months and the main drivers there is, of course, the income in the first place but also dividend payment and share repurchases; they're all affecting that. But in order to better understand where you are coming from, I think we should take it off line and make sure that we follow the reasoning and then we can explain you in detail on how this works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think our view is that the bulk of the book value development in the second quarter was the dividend, really; it was the bulk of it, so, is the way that we look at it. But maybe as Renato says we need to kind of figure out what exactly you're looking at.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning; couple of questions on capital, please. Firstly, just could you tell us what the cumulative owned debt gains are at the moment and what they were at the end of the first quarter on a net of tax basis?</p>
          <p>And also, it looks like you've assumed a 30% tax rate on the tax gain &#x2013; sorry, on the owned debt gain this quarter, but I seem to remember it was much lower, around a 10% rate, when you were seeing negative mark-to-markets a year ago. I'm just a bit curious why there seems to be an asymmetric tax rate when you see owned debt gains and owned debt losses.</p>
          <p>And then a second follow-up question on CoCos; I mean you just seem to be very confident on this issue and I'm wondering whether you've had discussions with your hybrid investors as to whether they would be interested in converting into a CoCo structure or whether at this stage it's just your conjecture that they are might be interested. I'm just interest &#x2013; just curious how far along that process you are? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Matthew. Let me leave your first and second questions for a moment and go to your third question. I think just in terms of our views on it, I think just from general discussions as well as from understanding some of the &#x2013; we do have some chunkier investors in some of our &#x2013; some aspects of our capital structure. I think our general view is that we think that some of these structures, depending on how they ultimately end up in terms of where they're struck, et cetera, could be of interest to them.</p>
          <p>So again it's still unclear exactly what levels that are going to be required by the regulators, et cetera. So I don't think we have a good feel for that, but I think there were certainly structures here which we think would be of interest but it is still obviously quite preliminary because there aren't really any sort of specific terms out there that we know would work. So &#x2013; but we do think that actually in principal there are probably things that would be, we think would be of interest to an investor base.</p>
          <p>Do you want to try to answer that or you want to come back to it? Are you ...? Okay, Renato.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The fair value of owned debt number increased in the quarter by roughly 900 million from 1.6 pre-tax to 2.5 pre-tax. The tax rate that is applied depends on where &#x2013; these fair value owned debts, of course, are locally booked in the legal entities. We can apply, I mean, broadly the normalized, I would say, or the underlying group tax rate which we have the stratus being around 27, 28% for the first half, so you can apply the same rate roughly for the fair value of owned debt as well.</p>
          <p>You mentioned about the lower tax rate, the 11% and that was very much influenced by the one-offs we had on the tax line, so it was a lot of noise on the tax line, but if you exclude all the impacts of the one-offs you have an underlying tax rate of something like 27, 28% which is in line with the guidance we have given over the last couple of quarters in the high 20s.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had two questions. One was just on the geographic disclosure. Your Asia-Pacific pre-tax process for the quarter was down to CHF24 million, and obviously that's a very small number; it's down about 94% year-over-year. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate as to what's happened; that business has got near a 100% cost income ratio now, and I appreciate that it's a collection of businesses, it's your Asian private bank and it's your Asian equity derivatives franchise and so on. But it's still quite anomalous with the rest of your reporting that you're not making any money in Asia at all at the moment.</p>
          <p>And my second question was just coming back to the DTAs. Obviously, you are using your DTAs and that's a source of value, but the absolute amount of DTAs has gone up, because you've been able to merge these legal entities. Can you give any indication as to whether or not there are other unrecognized DTAs that are beyond the statute of limitations or in the wrong legal entities that you think would give you an opportunity to bring new DTAs on to the balance sheet as you utilize the existing ones? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think with regard to the first issue, actually I would say our Asia Pacific business in general is a strong franchise and it actually has &#x2013; actually performed in the second quarter, I would say, relatively consistently across the customer businesses, et cetera.</p>
          <p>We did have some position write-downs that we took in some of our wind down businesses in investment banking that were proportionately &#x2013; were disproportionately actually in the Asia-Pacific P&amp;L. And so that was really the impact was a &#x2013; was some of the continuing write-downs that we took in the wind down businesses impacted that regional P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>With regard to the DTAs, in terms of any unrecognized DTAs that are beyond statute, et cetera, I don't know, Renato, if you could answer that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We are not &#x2013; we have continuously valuing property according to U.S. GAAP. So I mean whatever is feasible we, of course, value accordingly and we put them as assets on the balance sheet and that is driven, of course, by future earnings expectation where we basically test every quarter with our future expectation for earnings is able to, let's say, to absorb these losses carry forward. So there's not a buffer in there.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I mean, he may be referring to some other institutions that have actually written assets back up as they've, I guess, seen earnings capability go up or something which &#x2013; we have none; we don't have any of.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. It's actually more than that. Some peers had such high losses at a time when the calculation would have been done. Their expected earnings would, of course, have been too low and now as they go they can use that more.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I have a question on investment banking, in particular on the volatility of your revenue line. And the key problem that I have is I would expect a client driven, capital light business model to have lower volatility in revenues than peers, but it doesn't seem to be the case. And also, if I look at the equity side clearly outperformed expectations; the fixed income side somewhat underperformed expectations this quarter. So how do you want us to think about the volatility of your investment banking earnings going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I guess, one question &#x2013; I mean I'm not sure how you come to the conclusion that it is more volatile. So I guess that's one question I would have. I mean from our point of view, we do view it as less volatile. I think you're right. The different businesses actually, though, have somewhat different characteristics and we're still at different, I'd say, different stages in terms of developing those businesses. So I do think, we've talked about the equity business as being one where, I think it's actually in a very good place in terms of being, I think, a very strong client model, very capital efficient business, benefits from the strong market shares even in more difficult markets so that helps to preserve and reduce the volatility.</p>
          <p>And frankly we are still, as we've discussed, we are still investing in the fixed income business to make sure that we get to those kinds of very, very strong market shares across the broad range of those businesses to put us in the same place. I do think, I mean one of the things that we look at and again it's hard to compare potentially with other with &#x2013; it's hard for us to compare with other businesses, but certainly compared within our business we see a lot less volatility in the revenue distribution.</p>
          <p>So I think if you look at the revenue distribution that's laid out, that may give you at least some data points and I don't know whether you'll conclude that that's less volatile or not, but from our point of view when we look at it, it's clearly a tighter distribution. We had in the second quarter, I think, two days that were negative trading days, small negative trading days, and I guess our view is that's a &#x2013; that certainly is a less volatile profile than we would have seen in the business that we had four, five years ago. Whether &#x2013; how that will stack up against the rest of the industry, I guess, we'll see when others report similar distributions of their trading. Positive &#x2013; we think that's one concrete way to look at the volatility in the revenues of the business, but I don't know ... anything to add or not really?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you said it right and that is if you look at our past business model to this business model I think you're seeing far more stable earnings as we move ahead. And I think Brady's also right if you look at &#x2013; as we look at our businesses in comparison to those that have already announced, we see far more stability in the business. Obviously, fixed income isn't where we exactly wanted to be and we're investing and we're growing that, but we think overall we have a pretty stable business model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean to have this &#x2013; to have the equity business basically flat revenues first to second quarter, given the differences in environment between those two quarters, is I think &#x2013; it's a very strong result and demonstrative of the &#x2013; I think the power of that model. So we'd like to &#x2013; we had the same thing on the investment banking side in terms of advisory, et cetera but we're &#x2013; and we're, I think, making progress towards getting our fixed income business in the same place, but that's still &#x2013; that will take some time. Next question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning; just one question at this stage, please? Capital usage and balance sheet in the investment bank went up quite a bit in the quarter. Looked like currency would be a small part of that, but I just wondered if you could talk about what other elements, which business areas or what drivers were causing the increase in capital usage and in assets, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean I don't &#x2013; I thought it was actually pretty flat, Jeremy, but when you look at the numbers that we laid out, but....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got capital allocation in the investment bank up 5% in the quarter and assets up 7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean I guess risk weighted assets were down actually. So they are down from 144 to 122 in the overall business and in the &#x2013; excluding the exit businesses it was flat at 127. Our VaR was up, as you mentioned, from 99 in the first quarter to 105, but that to me is kind of not that significant in terms of a move quarter-to-quarter. But you're also talking about notional balance sheet, though?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe there's nothing specific. Maybe it's random movements, but I just thought it was interesting, a 7% jump up against volumes being softer generally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I guess Jeremy what &#x2013; I think what we would say as we think its actually pretty consistent if you look at &#x2013; and particularly if you isolate some of the foreign exchange effects. Both nominal risk-weighted assets and then VaR is &#x2013; VaR did move up a bit more but it's still only a few percent so frankly in our view that's kind of all within the noise of a pretty consistent, disciplined model. And so I think from our point of view we think that that's in line.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Jon Peace of Nomura. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. I just wanted to come back briefly to the trading revenues and understand a little bit more color. Firstly, in equity derivatives, as you benchmark against your peers, I mean, why is it that you are so strong? We heard from one of your peers that they were short volatility against their clients going into the quarter and that hurt them. Were you perhaps the other way around? I'm trying to get a sense whether there were some fortuitous revenues in there which supported the number.</p>
          <p>And then in fixed income trading, again benchmarking you against your peers, back in the first quarter you underperformed a little because as credit spreads narrowed you didn't perhaps get some of the inventory gains and you had a lower prop contribution. As I look at Q2 versus Q1, I was maybe hoping for a little bit better of a performance versus the peer group as the opposite was true. And I wondered why do you think it may not have been a bigger number? Was it to do, perhaps, with business mix and perhaps the commodities contribution? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good questions. Yeah, do you &#x2013; Eric, do you want to take those questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the equity derivatives side, I think if you look at the mix of our business, we were very neutral on the risk side throughout the quarter. Where we outperformed was really on the corporate equity derivatives fronts, which tends to be much lower risk, tends to be more credit intensive by nature, and there we did quite well. I think the &#x2013; what was your other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other question was just on fixed income trading. So that was equity derivatives, the other question was on fixed income trading &#x2013; how that &#x2013; what do we view as &#x2013; in Q1 we didn't see quite the increases that some of the competitors saw; I'm just paraphrasing his question. We didn't see some increases that the competitors saw but in the second quarter, the question was then they would have expected to seen a better performance than competitors and why was that? Is there something with the mix? Commodities? Whatever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think there's necessarily anything with the mix. We actually saw significant gains in FX rates; had strong performance in RMBS. Probably the biggest underperformer was credit, where we didn't get credit quite right. I don't think there's anything systematic with it. We've got a great management team there and we're very confident in it. But we didn't get it right in the second quarter and that was probably the biggest shift.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think that was all the questions from the phone line. Any last questions here? Otherwise we'll wrap it up. No?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just a couple of summary comments. I mean obviously, as I say, our view is this was really a very resilient performance during a difficult second quarter for the banking sector. I think the continued strong flow of net new assets that we achieved in private banking for a successive quarter of positive inflows in Asset Management and the continued share momentum, particularly in investment banking, reflect the strength of the business model and the franchise.</p>
          <p>We think that our strong capital and liquidity positions us well to meet changing regulatory requirements. We do obviously continue to contribute to the industry efforts to build a more robust and stable financial system. Clearly, despite the continuing macroeconomic uncertainty in the first half of 2010, we achieved a reported return on equity of 20% and an underlying return on equity of 17% while making substantial further progress in developing all of our businesses.</p>
          <p>So, again, we remain confident that our business model is strong, our strategy is appropriate and it's resilient in the face of an uncertain and challenging economic and market environment.</p>
          <p>So thanks very much for everybody's time. Thank you.</p>
