          <p>Good morning. This is the conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the Credit Suisse Group First Quarter Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the conference is recorded. You will have the opportunity to ask questions directly after the presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brady Dougan, Chief Executive Officer of Credit Suisse Group. Please go ahead, Mr. Dougan.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and thank you all for joining us on this call to discuss our first quarter results. I have with me today Renato Fassbind, our CFO, and Paul Calello, the CEO of the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>I believe the results that we've announced today with net income of over CHF 2 billion and in particular our strong return on equity of well over 22% shows that our differentiated strategy and integrated business model, together with a lower risk profile, can be a powerful generator of earnings. Our results also show the benefit of the measures we took last year across the bank, including cost reductions and the further strengthening of our capital position. The acceleration of our long-term strategy and measures we put in place last year have ensured that Credit Suisse is well positioned in the new industry landscape. The results also demonstrate that our integrated platform is well suited to weather difficult conditions should they persist and perform well when market opportunities present themselves.</p>
          <p>What's particularly pleasing is that in the first quarter our strategically important client-facing businesses have proved to be resilient. Our Wealth Management and our Swiss Corporate and Retail Banking businesses were strongly profitable and had total net new assets of CHF 11.4 billion. We're benefiting from the steps that we've taken over recent years to expand our international footprint and build a more efficient platform. I believe our Wealth Management business is well positioned for success in a changing industry landscape, and we will continue to invest in growth both globally and in our Swiss business.</p>
          <p>Investment Banking made a strong return to profit while continuing to reduce its risk profile and execute on its client-focused, capital-efficient strategy. We believe that our realigned platform is capable of delivering sustainable profitability and good returns on capital with reduced earnings volatility.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we saw many of our key client businesses generate strong revenue growth and gain market share. At the same time, we made substantial progress in repositioning a number of previously loss-making businesses, returning these areas to profit this quarter through changed operating models and revised risk limits.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, we've continued to make progress on our strategy to focus on asset allocation, our Swiss businesses and alternative investments, and closely align them with the integrated bank. Our principal investments declined in value in the difficult first quarter environment in line with the public markets, which led to an overall pre-tax loss for the division. However, we are convinced that alternative investments will be an important asset class for our clients and one in which we can excel in providing the best returns in the business.</p>
          <p>You'll note that we've continued to strengthen our capital position with a Tier 1 ratio of over 14%. We see an unquestioned capital position as a distinct advantage in the current environment. And for those of you who focus on the tangible book value per share, I'd point out that the quarter intangible book value increased by 15% to over CHF 22 per share.</p>
          <p>We've also continued to take a prudent and consistent approach to fair value accounting. We did not early adopt the new accounting guidance concerning fair value issued in April 2009. We will be required to adopt these new standards in the second quarter, but this will not change our valuation approach. During the first quarter we had further writedowns on our much-reduced portfolio of illiquid assets.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on efficiency across the bank and are on track to deliver the savings we announced in December last year. In the first quarter we achieved a cost/income ratio of 66%. You'll also note that non-compensation costs in the Investment Bank, for instance, are down 19% in dollar terms compared to the same period last year, and that Private Banking has continued to control its costs.</p>
          <p>Credit Suisse's strengths are increasingly recognized by existing and potential clients, and this provides us with a distinct competitive advantage. Our combination of a strong capital position, strong funding and liquidity, well-positioned businesses, a robust business model, a clear strategy, a significantly lower risk profile, with one of the cleanest balance sheets in the industry, and no government ownership makes Credit Suisse a trusted partner for clients.</p>
          <p>We remain optimistic about the prospects for Credit Suisse, particularly in the context of the overall industry. Our prudent approach in the new market environment has served us well in the first quarter, and we will continue to manage our business in this manner. While we may still be affected by continued volatility and market disruptions if difficult conditions persist, we believe that we are in a position to weather the storms and perform well when market opportunities arise.</p>
          <p>Today we're also announcing that Toby Guldimann, Chief Risk Officer for the Group, will be assuming the additional responsibilities of Chief Risk Officer of the bank from Wilson Ervin. Wilson and Toby have worked closely together over the last ten years in the development of our risk strategy and more recently in planning the transition. This will ensure continuity in our disciplined approach to risk at an important time. I wish Toby every success in his extended role, which he will take up from June 1.</p>
          <p>After 10 years in Risk, Wilson will step down from the Executive Board and transition to a new role as a senior advisor reporting to me. Wilson has served on the ExB as Chief Risk Officer for the last four years and has provided strong leadership and wise counsel over a critical period. I'd like to thank Wilson for his enormous contributions to Credit Suisse thus far, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with him in the future.</p>
          <p>Renato will now take you through the details of the financials, after which Paul will talk about the Investment Bank, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Renato?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brady, and good morning. I will start my presentation on slide five with an overview of the first quarter results. We achieved strong results in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting our robust business model and delivering on our strategy following the actions we took last year across our firm. Revenues totaled CHF 9.6 billion. We have capitalized on the client momentum achieved since the start of the economic downturn, resulting in market share gains across a number of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax income was just over CHF 3 billion in continuing challenging markets. We did not adopt the new accounting guidance concerning fair value issued by the FASB this month. We are required though to adopt these standards in the second quarter, but it won't change our valuation approach.</p>
          <p>On a divisional basis, Private Banking achieved a solid result with pre-tax income of nearly CHF 1 billion. Investment Banking delivered a strong result with pre-tax income of CHF 2.4 billion, having made significant progress in executing its client-focused, capital-efficient strategy.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, we continued to make progress on delivering a more focused business aligned to the rest of the Group. However, we suffered further unrealized investment losses on our private equity portfolio in line with the public equity markets, resulting in a pre-tax loss of CHF 490 million.</p>
          <p>The Group's net income was just over CHF 2 billion. The effective tax rate was 32%, reflecting the geographical mix of the results with the stronger relative performance from the higher tax jurisdictions. We expect the effective tax rate to trend downwards towards the rate in the high 20s for 2009.</p>
          <p>Diluted earnings per share stood at CHF 1.60. I would like to remind you that we have less shares outstanding today than at the beginning of 2006.</p>
          <p>The return on equity was 22.6% in the quarter and the overall cost/income ratio was 66.1%.</p>
          <p>On slide six you see that Wealth Management recorded pre-tax income of CHF 646 million. This result includes a CHF 100 million insurance recovery of non-credit-related provisions. The Wealth Management results continue to be affected by the lower asset base. However, the business model remains resilient in these challenging markets, and we continue to deliver stable gross margins and good asset inflows, as you will see on the next two slides.</p>
          <p>Relationship managers have been reduced by a net of 120 or 3% during the quarter. As part of the bank-wide cost initiative, and given the slowdown in wealth creation, we announced further efficiency plans in December to create space for talent upgrades, particularly in respect of senior advisors.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to expand our global footprint in a disciplined way. For example, we have launched domestic Private Banking in Mexico and are increasing the global coverage of our Solutions Partners group.</p>
          <p>On slide seven we show the Wealth Management revenues levels on the left-hand side and the gross margin on the right. The 6% reduction in revenues compared to last quarter was in line with the decline in average assets under management. We continue to maintain a stable gross margin level at 116 basis points. Our recurring margin was 86 basis points as the net interest income contribution benefited from increased deposit volumes and higher margins. This increase was offset by lower asset-based commissions and fee income, especially from managed investment products. The transactional margin was unchanged from the fourth quarter, reflecting the continued cautious client behavior we had seen in the fourth quarter, with low client activity and defensive investment decisions.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to net new assets on slide eight. Despite the lack of wealth creation in the first quarter, we continued to see good overall levels of asset inflows, representing market share gains as the overall wealth share of our clients' assets increased. We achieved net new assets of CHF 9 billion with inflows across all the regions. There were good contributions from Europe and the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Switzerland. In absolute terms they are only just below the quarterly average inflows experienced in 2008. The client deleveraging we experienced at the end of last year was negligible in this quarter. And finally, analyzed net new asset growth increased to 5.6% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Slide nine shows development of assets under management in the first quarter of 2009. Although average assets under management fell 5% quarter-on-quarter, total assets under management increased 3% to CHF 667 billion at the end of March. Net new assets and positive currency movements were partially offset by negative market movements. The current asset mix reflects continuous cautious client behavior we have seen over the last few quarters. There has been a shift of assets from client securities accounts where managed investment products have reduced significantly to on-balance-sheet client deposits. For example, the structured derivative portfolio is at the multiyear low of CHF 15 billion but has now stabilized at half our peak levels.</p>
          <p>Let me continue on slide 10. Our strategy over the last several years has anticipated recent changes in the industry landscape. These changes are both financial and regulatory in nature. The points on this slide address what we have done over the last several years to prepare for these changes.</p>
          <p>First, the slowdown in global wealth creation is impacting us all, with assets under management now at more than 20% below their peak. While the timing, the scale and the speed of this development was not foreseeable, we always knew that we had to build the business for the long term and remain focused on making the right investments. As you may remember, we took a more prudent approach to hiring in the period from 2005 to 2007 compared to many of our peers. We invested rapidly in their platform during a very buoyant and expensive period of the industry. During this time we maintained focus on our long-term cost management initiatives.</p>
          <p>In addition, during the latter part of 2008 we also took further cost reduction measures to address the near-term revenue outlook. Further, we have adapted our product range to meet changes in our client needs for more transparent, more liquid and efficient solutions. And we have also been revising our product pricing to become less dependent on transaction volumes.</p>
          <p>While the lack of wealth creation persists we will be more selective in our hiring. We are especially focusing our hiring on attracting senior relationship managers that often bring with them established portfolios with ultrahigh net worth individuals' assets. Second, there is an increased focus on cross-border banking services, not just over the last six months. Our strategy over the past several years has been to focus on expanding our international platforms in both mature and emerging markets. And our integrated business model with strong ties to Investment Banking and Asset Management locally will continue to enhance our strong strategic position in Wealth Management globally.</p>
          <p>We believe that the Swiss government's decision to adopt the OECD standards on administrative assistance in tax matters will remove uncertainty concerning banking secrecy. We are also convinced that our expertise, client solutions and product offerings will enable us to thrive with the creation of a more level playing field.</p>
          <p>Cross-border banking will remain a key component of our Wealth Management Service offering. We have invested significant resources over the past years in ensuring that we continue to provide compliant cross-border banking services in line with client demand. In summary, by anticipating these industry changes it positions us well going forward.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, I want to address any misconception around the topic of why our clients will continue to use our cross-border banking. Let me be absolutely clear. Cross-border banking will continue to be an important activity for the very reasons shown on this slide. First, clients continue to seek means to diversify their financial assets due to political uncertainties in their home jurisdiction. In Switzerland the financial and political stability provides best-in-class security globally.</p>
          <p>Second, our home market of Switzerland provides the largest booking center and the most enhanced product and service offering. It is not economical for the Swiss service and product offering to be duplicated in all markets locally. The Swiss financial market has many advantages and attractions compared to many markets where our clients reside. It has a robust legal framework, strong regulations, and is highly sophisticated given our infrastructure economies of scale.</p>
          <p>Third, client confidentiality will remain at the heart of private banking. Confidentiality continues to be one of the most important requirements to ensure the personal security of many of our clients. And finally, for our ultrahigh net worth individuals whose financial and corporate assets span the globe, they require a local service for their global assets in more than just one location. It is even more important because these clients in many cases do not live in one country or destination. So for us, we don't talk about onshore or offshore. When we talk about cross-border, we think about multi-shore.</p>
          <p>So in summary, this highlights why cross-border banking is important and will continue to be part of our offering. Our investments have ensured that we are well placed to face the changes occurring in the Wealth Management landscape. By anticipating the changes that are happening, we believe that this positions us well vis-&#xE0;-vis many of our competitors.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to Corporate and Retail banking on slide 12. Pre-tax income in Corporate and Retail Banking decreased to CHF 346 million, and the assets inflows were strong, at CHF 2.4 billion, reflecting the continued client confidence in our business.</p>
          <p>We continue to support the local economy by expanding our loan volume by over 5% or more than CHF 5 billion over the previous 12 months. Provisions for credit losses were CHF 45 million, rising from the benign levels experienced over the last few years. We have seen some deterioration in the credit environment and could see our quarterly provisions charge rise somewhat from the quarterly level as we progress through 2009.</p>
          <p>This quarter's results include significant gains of over CHF 50 million on loan portfolio hedges compared to the first and fourth quarter last year. We have had good initial client reaction to an organizational alignment in the Swiss market covering affluent clients and enhancing the value proposition, which will become effective from the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to Investment Banking on slide 13. As Brady indicated, Paul will cover Investment Banking in more detail, but let me give you a brief overview of the results. We reported a pre-tax income of CHF 2.4 billion, driven by strong results in our client- and flow-based businesses, both fixed income and equity. We achieved significant market share gains across many of our client businesses. We have taken decisive actions during 2008 as we move to a client-focused, capital-efficient strategy with a lower risk profile. These actions have translated into a strong result for the Investment Bank at the start of 2009. You will continue to see significantly less risk capital allocated to Investment Banking as we continue to reduce the risk profile of the business, as you can see from the risk-weighted asset and Value at Risk francs in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows you a more detailed analysis of the 6.4 billion revenues achieved in the first quarter. At the fourth quarter results presentation in February we indicated those businesses that are key client businesses for us going forward, where we have built strong market positions, and businesses that we are repositioning, where we can operate profitably and with lower earnings volatility by moving to a lower risk model. As you can see, in the first quarter of 2009 the key client businesses generated CHF 6.3 billion of revenues, and the repositioned businesses returned to profit and delivered 1.4 billion of revenues.</p>
          <p>Many of you have asked us how much of our revenues have benefited from the bounce-back in performance from the fourth quarter. This is more of art than a science, but within key client businesses and repositioned businesses, we estimate approximately 1.3 billion of Investment Banking first quarter revenues were achieved as a result of the positive market rebound experienced in the first quarter. You can see on the slide that 700 million related to the key client businesses and 600 million to repositioned businesses.</p>
          <p>We saw a reversal of some of the fourth quarter negative revenues as they relate to basis risk, credit spread widening and decreased market volatility. However, the benefit from the reversal of the fourth quarter negative revenue trends was limited to CHF 1.3 billion in total, given that we aggressively managed down our risk exposures throughout the fourth quarter and continued this into the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Losses in the businesses where we are exiting totaled 1.7 billion, of which 1.4 billion related to further writedowns in the CMBS portfolio. In our February presentation we provided you with the last four years of pro forma Investment Banking results as if we had adopted this realigned model. The profits we would have delivered on the pro forma basis gave us confidence that the realigned business could produce higher average margins and returns over the cycle. Our first quarter result reinforces this view. Finally, the fair value gain in the Investment Bank was CHF 365 million.</p>
          <p>From the 1st of April we have put in place a hedge that will remove most of the earnings volatility resulting from the movement of credit spreads in our own debt. Although not a perfect hedge, the fair value gains taken so far will be amortized over the life of our debt, irrespective of the short-term movement in spreads. In the future we expect some CHF 300 million negative revenues each quarter. This will have no impact on our capital ratios, as fair value gains and own debt do not qualify as regulatory capital, and it also did not have an impact on first quarter earnings.</p>
          <p>Let me move to Asset Management on slide 15. Looking at the fourth quarter performance, Asset Management reported a pre-tax loss of CHF 490 million. The downturn in global markets resulted in unrealized losses on private equity investments of CHF 387 million and 21 million of writedowns on the money market lift-out portfolio. The net new asset development has stabilized compared to previous quarters, with a small overall outflow this quarter, but with continued net inflows achieved within the Alternative Investments business.</p>
          <p>At the top of slide 16, we show you the assets under management split into alternative investments; MACS, our asset allocation business; and the remaining traditional investment businesses. On the bottom half of the slide we show the fee-based revenues levels and the resulting gross margin. Assets under management have stabilized in the first quarter, although the average asset base is down by more than 27% compared to a year ago, reflecting a downward movement in the markets. But Asset Management fees held up well, down only 10% versus the previous quarter. They are down 19% year-on-year compared to the 27% asset base reduction as a result of the ongoing shift towards the higher margin alternatives business.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 highlights the progress on our strategic agenda in Asset Management. The business is now focused around our core competencies in alternative investments and asset allocation strategies, following the sale of our sub-scale traditional business to Aberdeen Asset Management. We remain on track to close the transaction in the second quarter. Geographically, our focus is on Switzerland and the U.S. while maintaining a smaller regional presence in Europe and Asia Pacific. We have made good progress on strengthening on global distribution capabilities. We hired a new global head of distribution and 25 distribution specialists who will focus on our institutional clients globally.</p>
          <p>As the asset base is down, we need to intensify our focus on efficiency and profitability. We have further initiatives underway to reduce our cost base. And we have intensified the focus on investment performance. As reference point, our flagship asset allocation product, managed by MACS and offered to our Swiss and international Private Banking and institutional clients, has performed very solidly. Since the beginning of this year, 75% of our classic mandates in MACS outperformed their benchmark. And 90% of strategically important credit strategies performed above benchmarks within the one- and five-year time bands.</p>
          <p>While financial performance was disappointing this quarter, we are convinced that we are on the right track in Asset Management strategically to return the business to profitability.</p>
          <p>This concludes the divisional results review. I will continue with the Group's funding and capital position on slide 18.</p>
          <p>We have maintained a strong balance sheet structure this quarter that has supported the business through the challenging markets of the last 18 months. Although the balance sheet footings only reduced 14 billion, business-related reductions were 74 billion, partially offset by foreign exchange differences of 60 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me look at the asset categories in turn. You can see at the top of the chart that cash balances, including cash due from banks, was CHF 88 billion. Reverse repos were reduced further to 289 billion, reflecting general market conditions across all regions. Trading assets are also down slightly in the quarter. Loans are up slightly, and they are underpinned by our strong deposit base, which is now 120% of loans outstanding.</p>
          <p>We continue to make progress on further strengthening our liquidity structure. Our short-term financing requirements are down 24% from the end of the year and now stand at CHF 76 billion, as a result of our balance sheet reduction and by substituting short-term debt with longer term debt and deposits.</p>
          <p>As we continue to reduce our balance sheet we may not need to refinance all of the 13 billion of long-term debt redeemable this year. Any additional funding costs on this debt, which is only 1% of total liabilities, will be more than compensated by our stable and low-cost deposit base. We believe that this will continue to be a key competitive advantage, especially when compared to institutions that primarily rely on wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>As a result of strong liquidity, we intend to redeem two upper Tier 2 issues callable in July 2009. We have already raised CHF 6 billion of longer term funding in the first quarter. We're one of only a handful of banks that were successful in issuing non-government guaranteed unsecured senior debt in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me now move and have a look at our credit risk positions on slide 19. The next three slides are an update of the credit risk information Wilson Ervin provided in February. The figures we show for the first quarter are fairly stable compared to the fourth quarter. In the Investment Bank most of our loans are in two areas: our Developed Market loan portfolio and our Emerging Market portfolio. In the developed markets the chart, top right, shows loans and unfunded exposures were stable in Swiss francs terms at 69 billion compared to 67 billion we showed you at the end of 2008. They are well diversified by industry and name and are around 80% investment grade.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the chart we have significant hedges that we use to protect the value of this book on both a portfolio and name-specific basis. These hedges total some 23 billion. While the hedging effectiveness of our CDS has varied from quarter to quarter, they have been effective over the whole period in mitigating profit and loss movements on the asset side.</p>
          <p>Our loans and hedges are mostly accounted for on a fair value basis. We have marked down our gross loans and commitments by CHF 3 billion since the beginning of last year as market spreads have widened. If these loans had been accounted for on an accrual basis our provisions would have been about CHF 700 million. Because of our fair value approach our loans are carried at much bigger discounts to par than they would under an accrual method.</p>
          <p>Overall developed market loans are carried at an average mark of approximately 95%, and they are more than four times covered compared to current impairment levels. They can therefore absorb any increase in credit provisions more easily.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of the page is the emerging markets loan exposure of CHF 21 billion, which are almost entirely funded. These loans are accounted for roughly half under accrual accounting and the other half under fair value accounting. We have 15 billion of specific hedges. So our net exposure to emerging market lending is only about CHF 6 billion. These exposures are well diversified and distributed fairly evenly across the major emerging market regions of EMEA, America, and Asia.</p>
          <p>The counterparty risk of the hedges are very well diversified by region and name. In addition to the hedges in place, our entire emerging loan portfolio carries an average mark of approximately 90%. This gives you the two largest credit books in Investment Banking. The remaining book is largely positions with financial institutions backed by pools of collateral with good haircuts.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, our Investment Banking credit exposure is generally highly rated with significant marked bonds already taken through fair value discount, credit provisions on accrual loans, and significant hedges. Although we see potential for a tough credit environment given recent economic developments, we feel these features provide significant protection against further charges to earnings.</p>
          <p>Let me move to an overview of the loan portfolio in the Private Bank on slide 20. This portfolio is predominantly focused on Switzerland and is accounted for on an accrual basis. Our loan portfolio is largely funded and around 85% is collateralized by securities or real estate. Combined with the high quality of the borrowers, the high rate of collateralization results in a portfolio that is over 90% investment grade. Loans in Wealth Management totaled CHF 71 billion. Just under half are Lombard or security-backed positions and the remainder are mortgages with conservative haircuts.</p>
          <p>The Corporate and Retail Banking loan portfolio in Switzerland totals CHF 106 billion. This is split roughly half and half between retail lending and corporate and commercial mortgage lending. Within the Swiss Corporate book, about a third of the portfolio is commercial lending with loan-to-value ratios of about 50%. The remaining two-thirds is in corporate loans where the credit quality is good with low concentrations.</p>
          <p>The Retail portfolio is primarily residential mortgages. The Swiss housing market remains conservative, with prices remaining very stable over the last 10 years, with annual gains averaging about 3% per annum. Underwriting is based on strict income and LTV requirements. Average loan-to-value ratios are about 65%. We do have some consumer lending portfolios in Switzerland, which total about CHF 3.5 billion, and they continue to perform well. We do not make unsecured consumer loans outside Switzerland. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen some deterioration in the credit environment and could see our quarterly provision charge rise somewhat within the corporate sector as we continue through to 2009.</p>
          <p>Finally, on slide 21 is an overview of the current risk issues in the markets, as we provided you already in the past quarters. Firstly, we do not rely on any monolines to hedge our subprime positions in RMBS or CDOs. We do have some trading and other positions that are wrapped by monolines, but we have CDS and other forms of protection against this exposure, and the gross exposures are modest.</p>
          <p>Secondly, net exposure to U.S. auto manufacturers and suppliers is less than CHF 200 million. Third, our total exposure to private equity investment is CHF 2.5 billion. Over the last six months we have written down the book by 25%, and it remains well diversified with exposure to mainly mid-cap companies and with moderate leverage. Fourth, our auction rate securities portfolio is among the smallest of the settlement banks, with a market value of CHF 400 million and an average value on our books of $0.56 on the dollar.</p>
          <p>Finally, we expect our Level 3 assets in our final numbers to reduce by about 18% to around U.S. $74 billion in the first quarter. Just over half of the reduction was due to sales, as we reduced our balance sheet in the first quarter. The remainder was split between market movements and changes in market price visibility. 13 billion of these assets are private equity and other unlisted investments, of which 9 billion are in the form of third-party minority interest in funds, but there is no economic risk to Credit Suisse. This leaves about $60 billion of Level 3 assets, which consist of a couple of different categories. About half of the remaining Level 3 assets have significant offset from Level 3 liabilities that have similar characteristics and which are valued based on similar market assumptions.</p>
          <p>About $10 billion or CHF 12 billion relate to the gross value of the dislocated asset categories that we have shown here historically. I have not mentioned this category, as Paul will cover it later. Our largest exposure remaining is CMBS, and our exposure was CHF 7 billion, prudently marked at 59% of par, down from 72%. And another roughly 10% of 7 billion is related to the gross loans in our Investment Bank, as we mentioned on the previous slide. Here we feel fair value marks we have already made are a more conservative approach than an accrual method, as I discussed earlier. There are some other smaller categories, but I hope this demystifies the Level 3 category to some extent for you.</p>
          <p>Let me go to slide number 22 on the capital position. During the quarter the Basel 2 Tier 1 ratio improved by 80 basis points to 14.1%, making us one of the best if not the best-capitalized bank globally. Our Core Tier 1 ratio, excluding average capital, now stands at over 9%.</p>
          <p>The FINMA regulator's leverage ratio, where we now disclose the calculation in detail on page 55 of the quarterly report, stands at 3.8%, already comfortably in excess of the 3% minimum requirement, which is effective from 2013. The regulatory capital level includes a deduction for a significant but prudent 2009 dividend accrual.</p>
          <p>Risk-weighted assets rose slightly in the quarter, resulting mainly from the weakening of the Swiss franc against most major currencies. Risk-weighted assets also increased by 12 billion due to the regulatory treatment of certain assets. Using constant exchange rates and excluding these methodology changes, risk-weighted assets reduced by 9% or CHF 22 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation, and with that I will hand over to Paul. Please, Paul.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Renato, and good morning to everyone. You've had an overview of the quarter from a Group perspective demonstrating the potential of our integrated bank model. Now I'm going to provide you with an update on our progress in implementing the strategy for the Investment Bank as we discussed in detail in December, our client-focused, capital-efficient model.</p>
          <p>As Renato highlighted earlier for the first quarter the Investment Bank produced revenues of CHF 6.4 billion and pre-tax income of CHF 2.4 billion. As to how we achieved these results, I want to go back and remind you of this view shown on slide 24, which I discussed at our fourth quarter earnings presentation. This slide shows how we are managing our franchise and allocating our resources across the Investment Bank. Each of our businesses is aligned to a category seen here, starting with the darkish shaded column on the left, key client, and moving across to the repositioned, and exit to the far right.</p>
          <p>The Group at the farthest to the left are key client businesses, the ones we consider core to our strategy. They meet our strategic criteria by being client-oriented, capital efficient, less volatile, less complex, more liquid, and those in which we believe we have a strong strategic advantage. The repositioned category, those shown in the middle, are the businesses that are important to our franchise but which did not meet our strategic criteria. We believe they can be repositioned to run with an operating model that does fit our strategy, with importantly a lower risk profile &#x2013; businesses like emerging markets and U.S. leveraged finance.</p>
          <p>In the exit group, the one to the far right, are the businesses that are fundamentally disadvantaged in this environment or that we feel cannot be repositioned to fit our strategic criteria. They do not meet our clients' needs. They provide low return on balance sheet or capital. They're more volatile, more complex, or less liquid, or businesses where we don't feel we have any particular competitive advantage. We developed this strategy, as you know, in early 2008, accelerated its implementation through the year, and we can now point to good progress in the first quarter of 2009 on executing on this client-focused, capital-efficient strategy.</p>
          <p>On slide 25 you can see the core elements of our strategy are to grow market share with clients to become more capital-efficient and reduce our risk and volatility and to cut costs. Executing on each aspect of the strategy, we've had a good quarter. We are growing the client and flow businesses, with 6.3 billion of revenues in client businesses driven by market share gains and highly favorable market conditions in some businesses. We've had a focus on improving our performance in the repositioned businesses at CHF 1.4 billion gain over the quarter; remember these areas lost approximately 4.5 billion for all of last year.</p>
          <p>And as for the exit category, our results included losses of CHF 1.7 billion over this quarter, primarily a result of the 1.4 billion writedown in CMBS, which I'll speak more to later.</p>
          <p>We continue to reduce risk, as evidenced by a reduction in underlying RWA by 11% and VaR down by 14% over the quarter, and dislocated assets down 31% over that same period. We reduced costs, with non-comp expenses down 19% year-on-year and significantly more quarter-on-quarter in dollar terms.</p>
          <p>If you turn now to slide 26, we'll take a look at the businesses that drove our results. Here is fixed income, where we had a very strong quarter. We achieved record results in several key client businesses, including rates and foreign exchange, investment grade trading, and we had strong performance in U.S. secondary mortgage trading with clients. And we saw improved activity and revenues from investment grade debt issuance.</p>
          <p>We made good progress in turning around the repositioned businesses by implementing new operating models and lowering the level of risk. Specifically, we improved our performance in emerging markets in U.S. leveraged finance. And on the right you can see the trend for our exit businesses: significantly lower writedowns and continued exposure reduction in these legacy assets. For the quarter CMBS writedowns were CHF 1.4 billion and we reduced marks further during the quarter, moving the average entire portfolio price from 72 to 59%.</p>
          <p>On slide 27 you see equities, which posted a very good result even in the face of low primary activity, reduced secondary market volumes and lower market levels. We drove strong results in key client businesses: prime services, cash equities, and flow derivatives, with good progress in market share. We achieved a solid turnaround for our repositioned businesses with lower risk and new operating models.</p>
          <p>We saw improved contribution from convertibles with our continued risk reduction, the sell-down of inventory in the convertible trading book, which is down 86% from the beginning of 2008 and is now mostly complete. And we achieved good results from our equity trading business, which is now very focused on quantitative and liquid strategies. As you can see the exit businesses here, we consider risk reduction for our illiquid prop trading activities also largely complete.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 28, I mentioned risk reduction as a prerequisite to executing on our strategy, and we continue to show good trend here. Headline: risk-weighted assets ended the quarter at 154 billion, including the impact of methodology changes. Excluding the methodology changes, RWA was just 145 billion, an 11% decline, from the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>I think it's important to note that we're not just cutting risk; we're rebalancing and reallocating our capital to our key client business. By doing this we're able to address our clients' needs and decrease our risk and P&amp;L volatility. In fact we have increased the proportion of risk capital or RWA allocated to our key client businesses during the quarter, while decreasing that for both the exit and the repositioned businesses on an absolute and relative basis. In the quarter average one-day VaR also fell. It fell sequentially quarter-on-quarter 14% and 30% year-on-year. We've talked about being disciplined and early to act on reducing risk, and we've consistently reduced exposures in distressed areas.</p>
          <p>On slide 29, which we've shown you before, you can see our progress here. We've brought dislocated assets down 92% since the end of the third quarter in 2007. Residual risk is concentrated in CMBS, our last legacy area with material exposure. In the first quarter CMBS was reduced by 20% through a combination of sales and writedowns. We have more detailed information about CMBS exposure in the appendix to this presentation on slide 39. In summary, I would reiterate that we continue to have a consistent, conservative approach to valuations with no reclassifications told or accrual books.</p>
          <p>Slide 30 speaks to developments in our expense line. The compensation number on the top right is the one you see that's up from prior periods, reflecting a couple of things. Number one, divesting of our partner asset facility, the PAF, that was the illiquid asset portfolio that was distributed to employees as part of the 2008 compensation, and divesting of other deferred compensation awards is included in this number. Variable compensation accrual also reflects a risk-adjusted profit in contribution of the Investment Bank by business line.</p>
          <p>I want to highlight here that comp to revenue is not the basis of our variable compensation accrual; it's simply a mathematical result of our risk-adjusted contribution-driven process. On the bottom you see our non-comp expenses down 19% in dollar terms versus the first quarter of 2008 and down more than that, I think 28%, on the fourth quarter, but there is some seasonal adjustment here. This reflects our long-standing focus on reducing non-comp expenses, which has been additionally boosted by the efficiency measures that we announced in the second half of last year and from lower BC&amp;E expenses in equities.</p>
          <p>I think slide 31 is an interesting slide, and that's our attempt to describe some of the industry dynamics for our major business lines. These measures all compared with fourth quarter of last year reflect where we think industry volumes and margins have trended for each of the businesses shown on the left. The last two columns show you how Credit Suisse's market share and revenues are developing in each product area over the same period. Obviously, market shares were affected by the fact there are fewer firms. But what we've also highlighted here is the overall trends in the key businesses where we have focused our resources. And I'll take a second to touch on some of the specific examples behind these trends.</p>
          <p>Let's start with the top section of the page. In rates, we've benefited from both strong industry volumes and improved market share. In foreign exchange, while volumes did fall over the quarter, we were able to double our market share from 3 to 6% and partially offset this impact. In mortgage trading, we increased our lending market share and pass-throughs and rank number one so far this year in secondary trading with clients.</p>
          <p>Equities is highlighted in the middle section of the page. In cash equities, our market share in the U.S. and Europe grew from 9% in 2008 to 11% this quarter. These market share gains more than offset the impact from the lower volumes in this market. In electronic trading our market share of total U.S. electronic trading volume also grew to over 7% in the first quarter. And in prime services, we estimate our market share has increased from 6% in 2007 to about 10% in 2008. Our revenues have continued to grow and our improvement to a top-three market position has clearly helped us offset the impact of the hedge fund deleveraging that we've seen during the course of 2008.</p>
          <p>And finally in our Investment Banking businesses, revenues and activity levels have generally been lower in the first quarter. That said, we've seen some areas of improvement, especially in Europe, where we are ranked number one in announced M&amp;A in the first quarter. And we've also been involved in several key transactions since quarter end; recently the sole advisor to Sun on its sale to Oracle is just one example. Much of our focus in the IBD business is on pitching and winning new business and focusing on the key industry segments where we expect to see activity pick up during the second half of 2009. So that's an overview of how we're thinking about some of the key dynamics and trends in our business as we execute on our strategy.</p>
          <p>Now turning to slide 32 and wrapping up on the Investment Bank, we are confident that our strategy is the right one. And we think, having been at it for a while now, that we are seeing real evidence of our progress and real interest from clients who want to do more business with Credit Suisse. Of course, this is just one quarter, and we don't expect 2009 to be without its challenges. But we are clear on what we need to do to drive our strategy through the rest of the year. And this includes growing our client- and flow-based businesses and our market share with clients; improving the contribution from our repositioned businesses; staying disciplined about reducing risk, particularly by maintaining our focus on the orderly wind-down in exit areas and redeploying that capital released; and achieving our cost targets through the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>We're positioned to address any continued challenges in the market and we're able to identify and capture good opportunities as they arise in our key focus businesses. Our leaders in the Investment Bank are committed to working hard to execute on this strategy, and we feel confident that we will continue to produce good progress and results.</p>
          <p>With that, I thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the agenda back to Brady. Brady?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. First of all could you clarify the tax rate going forward, as it's I assume impacted by deferred tax for leases? And how should we look at this going forward compared to your historic tax rate? The second question is on your comp ratio: you mentioned this is a result, it's not an input; you're running at 48% in the IBX CDS gains. Could you tell me should we assume that as a run rate going forward? And the last question is on Asset Management. When should we expect that you actually make a profit in Asset Management? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much for those questions. Why don't we start with the tax rate? Renato, could you address that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I would. The higher tax rate we have coming from the business mix has benefited us of course in 2008 when we had our losses, but of course it hits us now and profits come back, because they are in the high tax countries predominantly and therefore we have a higher tax rate than we typically have. We gave you guidance that we will be in the upper part of the 20s for the full year going forward. But once you know, these &#x2013;  as I say we have worked out the disposition we will go back to the normalized tax rate we have seen in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think with regard to the compensation issue, and I'll maybe just answer it more from a bank-wide point of view, obviously it's a very dynamic environment in terms of compensation in the industry. There's a lot of dialogue with regulators, et cetera, at this point, and we obviously do have the comp accruals not only in Investment Bank but for the bank as a whole. I think our view is at this point that was a &#x2013; when we look at how we think about we accrue compensation particularly in the Investment Bank we have adopted an approach which is much more in line with sort of looking at returns on capital, risk taking, et cetera. So it's a much more nuanced approach than simply some percentage of revenues, which is why we mention that that is not really the way we're looking at it in terms of just a straight percentage of revenues, but really it's linked into returns on capital, business mix and how well the business does. But I tell you, at this point it's pretty hard to predict in what direction the compensation environment will go, but our view was that that was a reasonable accrual for the first quarter. And I don't know, Paul, if you have anything to add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's right. As you said for the Investment Bank and as we said it's a mathematical result, it was 45% and 48% ex the fair value owned debt calculation. That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think with regard to Asset Management obviously the absolute result from the first quarter is disappointing. But it's obviously also in line with &#x2013; as you know well how the markets in general and how private equity investments have performed in general. I mean we believe we have excellent capabilities in the alternatives area. We think we've got a very good private equity portfolio, but obviously in this kind of an environment it will naturally suffer. I think the more important thing for us is to focus on the strategy. We think we have taken a number of important strategic steps. You know, the decision to sell our traditional business to Aberdeen, which as we mentioned we're on track to closing, we think is a very important step toward allowing us to focus our strategy on businesses that we can be excellent at, where we think we can provide great returns to our clients and where we think we will get very good returns for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>So we're going to continue to drive that, but obviously the performance in the Asset Management area will continue to have an element of how the markets perform in them and we obviously can't predict that. So, we do continue to believe though that we will make progress on our strategy, that that will over time continue to improve the bottom line performance, and we're obviously going to do that as quickly as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I can have one more follow-up, can you just talk a bit about revenue? I mean you mentioned 6.3 billion of ongoing business in the IB. Can you talk a bit about the movement of revenues that you have seen through the quarter from January into March, between fixed income and equities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe I'll just answer for the overall firm and then Paul could add from the Investment Banking, but I think the question of kind of the revenue development, and one thing just to note and I think it's important is that the first quarter was not a uniformly good environment for all our businesses. In fact it was challenging in probably almost every one of our businesses during the first quarter and I think you're all aware of a lot of the things that happened. So, this result wasn't delivered in the context of an easy environment to produce. So I think that's an important thing to point out. And as a result there were challenges that came up during the quarter, but I think this result was delivered in spite of that.</p>
          <p>I would say in general I would not differentiate between the different times in the quarter in terms of how our businesses performed, and I'd say it was reasonably consistent. And we've also made the statement that we've really continued in, through April even though it's obviously a short period of time, we've continued to see consistent performance of the businesses, this month to date as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I may add to that is that first of all the ongoing revenues as you saw on that slide 14 was a 7.7 billion, not the 6.3. You have to add the repositioned businesses to that 6.3 to 1.4. And as Brady said, no real discernible differences month-to-month in the market conditions and the progression of our P&amp;L. And I think also importantly is that we showed no back testing exceptions, which just show a level of stability, daily stability of our earnings I think, as the result of some of the long-standing reductions in risk that you followed that we have made.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a couple questions on banking secrecy actually. Let me preface it by saying I've read slide 11, it all makes perfect sense to me, and I agree 100% with slide 11. But my questions are sort of going to the strategy. I mean first and foremost I guess what are you doing to try to get on the front foot ahead of double taxation treaties if anything? Number two, are you doing any contingency planning in anticipation of tax amnesty programs out in the future? Number three would be in the event of a tax amnesty do you think you could take market share with your onshore/offshore business model? And then the fourth question is if so, which type of competitors would you be targeting? Not specific names, but who's disadvantaged in that environment? And then my last question has nothing to do with banking secrecy, it's just in your 14.1% Tier 1 ratio is there a dividend accrual or are we sort of at the same level as last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Derek, thanks very much. Well on the first question, it's obviously an important question. I mean we have basically been driving the strategy and structuring the business over the past several years in our Private Banking business really in order to make sure that we continue to be well positioned in what was clearly going to be continuing, I think, focus on the cross-border business. So I think the strategy, it's not really a question of things that we're doing right now so much as things that we've been doing for the last two or three years. So we've been over the past, I'd say, 3 to 5 years, been aggressively building up our onshore businesses all around the world. And that obviously positions us well. In addition, we've made a big effort to make sure that we're compliant with all of the regulations that apply to the business all around the world. So we feel like we are &#x2013; we have a business that's resilient. Just take a look at the first quarter net new asset flows in the business. I mean to be up 11.4 billion across our Private Banking division I think shows that we've continued to have very strong client flows in.</p>
          <p>I think with regard to the specifics you mentioned about tax amnesty and things like that, I mean as you know we've actually already lived through a few of those. I think we've been through two Italian tax amnesties and the German tax amnesty. And in each of those cases, we actually fared quite well through that, both as you mentioned because &#x2013; I think partly because our approach is a very compliant one. But secondly, because we do have the onshore capability as well and in general we've actually been able to maintain, and in fact in both Italy and Germany, continue to grow our market shares through those periods. So I think certainly our &#x2013; what we've been planning for is this kind of an environment, and the truth is we believe that we hopefully should be able to take advantage of that over time as this environment continues. So, we do think that we're well positioned.</p>
          <p>In terms of the type of competition, I would say it's hard to say where that business would come from, but again with a strong global onshore network, the ability to offer those services, we think we are well positioned, and we will hopefully continue to grow market share. And with regard to the 14.1% Tier 1 accrual I think as Renato mentioned we have accrued what we would call a substantial but a prudent dividend. So effectively it's probably, you know, we're not going to go into the specifics of it, but it's down from sort of the peak levels that we were probably at in past good market years, but it's still quite substantial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just to follow up quickly on the tax amnesty. I mean Italy, and I'm sure I can go back and look this up, but I remember Italy kind of being &#x2013; having an impact, and I remember seeing slides that were kind of net new money, net new money if you hadn't had the Italian tax amnesty. I mean just some order of magnitude in terms of &#x2013; do you have any kind of quantitative order of magnitude in terms of how much you lost and then how much you were able to regain later? Anything there or maybe it's unfair to sort of hit you with that out of left field?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess. It's a little hard to say because obviously as you recoup over time it's hard to know how much of that is &#x2013; where those assets are coming from. I think in one case in one of the Italian tax amnesties we actually kept about 80% of the assets under management.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we think we're &#x2013; and in fact the businesses continue to maintain their momentums. So it's obviously &#x2013; we obviously believe there will continue to be challenges in the business overall, but we do think that we're really well positioned for this changing industry landscape.</p>

          <p>Hi. I wanted to ask a question about capital, and obviously your Tier 1 is rising quite fast. How are you looking at it going forward in terms of firstly, risk-weighted assets, because I think you do say $135 billion is still the number for the Investment Bank? So is it that we should start to see risk assets growing as you think the world becomes a better place, or are you going to sit there and have the Tier 1 ratio going up well above 15, or are you looking at core Tier 1? I just want to understand a bit more about that, what it could look like going out. And then secondly, just on the Private Banking, the margin, so the 116 basis points, could you just spend a bit more time on how resilient that is, whether you're surprised and you know, expectations? I think 110 is usually the number that the head of Private Banking uses as the long term. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, Fiona. I think on the capital point as you mentioned, we obviously have taken steps over the past six months to make sure we have an unquestioned capital position. We have a very cash generative model overall. So as you can see this quarter if we can have reasonable markets we will generate a lot of capital. I think that as Paul mentioned in his comments I think the important point is there &#x2013; we are reducing our risk-weighted assets in some areas, but we're also reinvesting that and making sure we have disciplined allocation of that capital, and that's something that we will continue to do. I think we will hopefully continue to have a very capital generative model. Our long-term target as you know is 12.5%, so we're well in excess of that at this point. And so I would expect that as we continue to generate capital, some of that's certainly going to go into our businesses where we see excellent opportunities right now. But it's also &#x2013; it'll be something we'll gauge over time. But I certainly think that with the continued capital generation that'll be &#x2013; certainly we will use some of that to take advantage of opportunities.</p>
          <p>On the Private Banking side, the 116 basis points as you say was a good performance in the first quarter. It has held up quite well. I think that there has been some shift in terms of the composition. The recurring commission-based margin is down obviously with lower managed investment products, but the recurring interest-based margin is up and that overall has &#x2013; the interest margin is up. So, overall that has helped to keep that margin very stable. You know, and I think we continue to have a lot of initiatives and efforts to continue to maintain that, and we'll see how markets will develop over time. We also continue to be very focused on our overall margin that we're generating overall, including the liability side, you know, which we still do see opportunities to grow, and also our cross-sell across the entire bank, where as you know that's a big focus of ours. And all that can help to increase the productivity out of our client base, provide better services to the clients as well. So all that will be a focus, but you know we're pleased that the gross margin continues to hold up and I guess our hope is that that will continue.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could I just ask a really quick follow-up on this fair value of own debt issue that Renato mentioned? So I just wanted to understand what the stock was owned debt that you take the benefit for the equity is, and should I understand it that every year I'll get the tangible book value hedged for about 1.2 billion or is that tax affected? Could you kind of help us a bit more about how it will &#x2013; what the absolute magnitude of it will be over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe I can give you an answer. The fair value of own debt, the P&amp;L that we have so far has not affected capital at all. This is taken out from any capital calculation we have for regulatory purposes. So it will not affect the capital either when some of these amounts are coming back. That is kept absolutely neutral from a capital point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it will affect the book value that you report. So I think you're saying that you're going to &#x2013; it's going to cost 300 million a quarter, which I assume you get a tax shield from. I just didn't know the total amount that you've taken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The total amount of the offset taken so far is about 6.9 billion for the program today, if I may say so, and the 300 million you have to divide will of course go against the nominal balance sheet equity as we report.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just really after a couple of clarifications please. Firstly on the Investment Bank, thank you very much for the detailed disclosure. On slide 14 where you give us your impression of ongoing revenues during the first quarter, Brady, did I understand you suggested that April had continued at a similar pace? And the second question was just on the outlook for net new money in the Private Bank. You've obviously had this medium-term target of around 6%. How achievable is that number in the light of the changes to Swiss banking policy? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yes, with regard to the Investment Bank, yes, I would say, you know we're not making obviously very specific comments, but in general I think, as I mentioned the business pretty much across all the businesses including Investment Bank have been pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. So I'd say reasonably consistent. And I'd say the same thing in terms of outlook for new money. It's been probably one of the most reliable statistics over the past two years. We've pretty much &#x2013; we had very consistent net new money flows almost every quarter. I think our target is still 6%. It's not affected by any of these tax secrecy issues. And overall we think that with the first quarter at 5.6%, even though there wasn't obviously any wealth creation in the first quarter, we think that obviously shows that we're taking market share and we've got a strong momentum in the client franchise.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Good set of results. First question, I found it very useful to think about the increase in market shares at the expense of your competitors. How long do you think this wind of opportunity will last where you can seize market share and how much more upside do you think you've got? Secondly, thanks for the extra disclosure on Level 3, but to what extent is this a concern for you? Because Level 3 remains three times your tangible common book value, substantial common equities, sorry, and I'm just wondering to what extent this is a focus for the Group to continue to manage this down? And then thirdly, I think Renato said on one of the wires that market conditions remained strong in Q2 for Credit Suisse and whether you could give any other color to that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Huw, thanks very much. It sounds like your market share question is more towards Investment Banking probably, so maybe I can ask Paul just to give his outlook on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thanks. But thanks, Huw. You know that the trends really is this &#x2013; we outlined on this chart really the three components, what are the industry volumes, what are the margins and what are our market share trends? The first two I think are going to be an outlook on &#x2013; wouldn't project where those two are going to go. In terms of our market share and the trends there, they've been very good. Obviously the significant gains that we've achieved in many of our business areas are a result of some of the market participants dropping out of the market. I think some of them are a result of just the focus we put on many of these client businesses overall. So, they've been good market share gains. I think we can keep them. I think there obviously was in the first quarter over the last couple quarters probably the most benefit from some of those exiting the market. So, the trends are in place. There are fewer competitors. We are stable, well financed, seen as the counterparty of choice. So the trends that you've seen where we've gained market share have been in the areas that we've allocated more resources, those areas that we've discussed under those key client strategies. So again, I think good trends and hopefully we maintain them and can gain even more in some of those specific business areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Huw, on the question of Level 3, we're actually not very concerned about it. We thought you guys were concerned about it so that's why we mentioned it. I think that you know, we &#x2013; you know, there are various reasons why assets get categorized into Level 3 obviously. But we do not view that as for instance a sort of risky &#x2013; I know it's &#x2013; I think in general people take it as like a risky catch-all category. We believe we're being pretty transparent about what our risks are and letting you know where we think our risks are, frankly. And Renato I think tried to give a bit of an overview on that. A number of the areas in Level 3 aren't even our asset &#x2013; aren't even our risks, as we mentioned for instance in the case of 10 billion of minority interest on the private equity side. A lot of the others are actually completely matched against liabilities that are of the same nature. And so there really isn't very much risk in that.</p>
          <p>So the truth is, no, we're not concerned about the actual assets in there. But we do think that probably as we continue to reduce our illiquid risk areas, like say CMBS, which we have mentioned those, those are in the Level 3 area. That will obviously help to bring it down. In addition, we're obviously continuing to see more market, more normalization of market pricing, and that will also help to improve the transparency in pricing, which will also move more out of the Level 3 area. And obviously, the 20%, close to 20% reduction from fourth quarter to the first quarter was partly a reflection of that. So, no, we don't have concerns about that, but we thought we would give you some disclosure on it. And the last question you mentioned, market conditions, as I mentioned we're seeing pretty consistent market conditions into April so far. And it's obviously early in the quarter, so who knows where it'll go from here, but we're seeing pretty consistent conditions as we mentioned.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A couple of questions please. Firstly, some of your U.S. peers have given indications of their expected impact of potential changes to the scope of consolidation of assets under FAS 140 and FIN 46. Just wondering if you've done a similar exercise and can given any indications on whether you think your total assets are going to go up or what might happen to your Tier 1 ratio. Because I think some of the U.S. peers are going &#x2013; who said their Tier 1 ratios might be affected. I'm not sure if the same would happen to you. And then secondly, if I could just get a comment on how the zero rate environment has affected the Investment Banking revenues, if it's good, if it's bad, what are the moving parts of that? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think with regard to the question about changes, the scope of assets, that's still something that we are working through. So we don't have really an answer for you right now. What we can say categorically is that will not affect the Tier 1 ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would simply say that the overall is that there is a lot of volume as I pointed to earlier in the rates business. Generally I think it plays to our &#x2013; one of our focus areas under our current strategy. We have a good presence in the government area as well and overall it's I think presented some opportunities for us in the business, which you've seen come through in the first quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Just a couple of questions on the Investment Bank really. Firstly, after this fantastic Q1, does that change anything in terms of your strategic view, I guess particularly of your repositioning businesses, either in terms of the definition of which businesses are in repositioning or are in fact core or the degree of repositioning or the direction of repositioning? And with that is there any change in your head count target? You've come down here in the quarter from 19,600 to 18,800 and you've been targeting 17.5. Does that remain the case or do you start to sort of think about carrying more people because the conditions are better than expected?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. I think &#x2013; but Jeremy, just with regards to the strategic view the answer is no. We're very committed as I said to executing on our strategy here. We think we're committed and it's the right strategy to operate within the integrated bank and we'll stay committed to that. With regards to the head count, I think the answer again is no. We have done as we have done with all our resources, I mentioned earlier that we're reallocating a significant amount of capital; as we free up capital on businesses we exit, we reallocate those to the key client business. The same is true with our head count, and there is still further benefits of reallocating some of that capital from the exit and repositioned businesses to the key client businesses. So, again, we're committed to executing on their strategy, no changes there, and we're committed on our overall head count. We're down to 18,800 as you've seen for the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Three questions mainly on the Investment Bank. Coming back to slide 31, just wanted to get your views on what you see as the sustainability of the wider bid offer spreads across a variety of products that we've seen over the last couple of quarters. It does seem to me that maybe bid offer spreads might be coming down from the kind of peak levels that we saw in the fourth quarter. Just to get your views on that. Secondly, to what extent is the steep U.S. yield curve supporting your fixed income trading revenues? Final question, on position risk disclosure, that's on page 58 of your report, I see a 17% sequential growth in international lending and counterparty exposure and emerging market at the levels of a year ago. So perhaps if you could provide some color on that. Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Paul, maybe you can address the first two parts of that question first of all, which is sustainability of the wider bid-ask spreads and then how a steeper yield curve might impact the business overall. And then I can address the third question, but why don't you do those two first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as I had mentioned earlier, I do think that the &#x2013; we have seen gains particularly from fewer clients in the market with regards to the margins. We have no doubt that as more players focus on the liquid client-facing businesses, there may be some pressures. Some of these spreads come in somewhat. Having said that, I think some of it does reflect the change in nature of the market. Good example of that would be swap spreads. Look at 10-year swap spreads. If you looked a year ago, they were about half of what they are today. And I don't see that normalizing. That may come in a bit, but I don't see that normalizing back to the levels that we saw a year ago. So, I think you could see some marginal pressure there at some of those coming in, but some of them reflect new market realities, and I think we will continue to see them at more healthy levels than they were pre this crisis.</p>
          <p>With regards to the yield curve, in our particular case, there hasn't been &#x2013; but it's presented opportunities as I said before, some along the lines of the zero interest environment, the yield curve has created a lot of speculation, a lot of interest in trading and volatility in the rate sector. And that again has created opportunity, but there's not a particular trade or benefit specific from the yield curve that we benefited from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think with regard to the emerging markets question, I think actually that's most &#x2013; it's probably mostly accounted for by a reduction in counterparty ratings. So we've taken a more conservative approach to how we're looking at our counterparties, and that's actually increased there for the ERC we're allocating to that business. So it's not a reflection. I would say as you've seen the past couple of quarters, we've given you a pretty transparent view of our emerging markets lending exposure, and I'd say that &#x2013; obviously we didn't give it to you for the first quarter of '08, but I would say it probably wasn't inconsistent with where we were in the first quarter. So the ERC, the whole business I think has been reasonably &#x2013; has probably been stable to down over that period. And I think it's actually &#x2013; the flatness as indicated, I think is mostly explained by the decreases in counterparty ratings.</p>

          <p>Yes, a quick follow-up. PPIP, there's a lot of excitement about commercial or CMBS assets being put into PPIP. And we saw a bit of a rally in AAA CMBS. You're marking it down at 59; AAA is around $0.70. How do you see this affecting your book, especially considering your book is less U.S., more European? Why 59? And how does that affect potentially your pricing or disposal of your assets?</p>

          <p>Yes, well, I think in general, the announcement of PPIP has helped to stabilize the market a little bit. But as you know the composition of our portfolio, I think, we have a slide in the appendix that shows you that, a good portion of that's European; some of it's in Asia as well, which are I think not eligible for the PPIP, I think. But in general, it's probably provided a little bit of support for the asset class generally. But I think that you know it's &#x2013; I'd say at this point, it's unclear how much that will follow through and how much it will benefit the asset class generally. And I'd say because of the assets we have and where we are, we're unlikely to participate in it directly.</p>

          <p>Yes, it's on slide 39. It shows the geographic breakup and the exposure by the loan type, you can see there. It's we noted about 23% of the portfolio is in the U.S. And as Brady said, I think it provided certainly some stability to the market which is positive and some confidence there, which has provided some support for the entire market. How we get to the 59? It's a loan-by-loan process as you're well aware; that's an average. So there's a good deal of &#x2013; there's a good variation obviously between the different loans, different parts of the capital structure that are held there.</p>

          <p>Yes, the portfolio does continue to perform pretty well on a current basis, but we're obviously marking it appropriately conservatively and we think that's probably the right place to be.</p>

          <p>Your next question today comes from Jeremy Amahan of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hey there. It's <mark type="inaudible" /> here from Goldman's. I only have three very small questions left, given your answers up until now have been very extensive already, so thank you for that. The three questions are as follows. First, on the net new money flows you've had clearly a high inflow during the quarter. And your slide 11 explains why you think to some extent this should continue going forward as well. My question is as follows. After the point of time in Q1 when the verdict on UBS's settlement, or the news of UBS's settlement came in, was there a disruption to your net flows, or have you seen any impact in the dynamics during the quarter at all? I.e., was there a pick-up in the second half of the quarter or a fall-off?</p>
          <p>The second question is purely a very technical question on your Tier 1 capital composition. Am I right in assuming that essentially all of the roughly 1 billion increase in your hybrid instruments is due to FX? And I'm assuming the answer to that question is yes. And the final question may be the last strategic question I would like answered, is Credit Suisse is clearly in a strong position within Switzerland as well. There's been interest from your side in some of the Swiss private banks before and I think it's becoming clear from some of your smaller competitors that assets in private banking are going to come up for sale in Switzerland during 2009. I guess the question is whether there is any interest on the side of Credit Suisse to grow it &#x2013; or I guess Swiss private banking through that channel as well. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you, thanks for the questions. On your first question about net new money flows, I think the answer is no impact. So there really was no impact, there's no discernible difference in pace during the quarter. Secondly, on Tier 1 capital, in terms of the increase in hybrid, yes, it's all FX. It's all FX. And then third, I think we've been, as you know we've been pretty conservative over the past year and a half in terms of making any tactical acquisitions. That's served us pretty well. On the other hand, we've always said that we will certainly look at things opportunistically if there are opportunities out there, but I think that's still going to be through the lens of continuing to manage our business in a conservative way. It's served us pretty well so far. But we will obviously look at opportunities and if they're really very compelling then we obviously might pursue them. Is that okay?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning and congratulations on the results. Couple of questions, first of all on the net new money flows again. Switzerland 1.5 billion. Obviously given the outflows that we've seen elsewhere in the industry and given what you did last year certainly in the first three quarters, what do you think is happening within Switzerland? Do you feel you that you are being slightly affected by the overall noise around the big banks and that you're seeing clients perhaps not come to you from some of the other larger players, or is it just that it was a slower quarter?</p>
          <p>And the second question really is to Paul, and that is the fact that historically, if I talk to your competitors about the Investment Banking business of Credit Suisse, people would say yes, very good bank, historically number one in leveraged finance and CMBS; sure, those are the businesses that have perhaps gone away now for the time being. But perhaps not top three players in many of the other major areas. I'm just wondering what aspirations you have given the change in the competitive landscape in terms of some of the main business lines within Investment Banking. I don't see you've touched on client banking as one where you think you've moved into the top three. What aspirations do you have and are you setting your people to really get them hooked in to perhaps some &#x2013; put that extra effort in to take some of the leading market positions in some of the markets, some of the segments, and obviously in that way you perhaps take more of the share of the client's wallet? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Chris, thank you very much. On the first question as you mentioned I mean we did have good solid flows in Switzerland in the first quarter. But I think in general your point is correct that we've &#x2013; I think we've done okay, we've certainly held our own and we've had stable assets in Switzerland and some growth, but maybe not as much growth as you might expect given our stability through the crisis, et cetera. And I do think &#x2013; in Switzerland I think there has been a tendency not to put new money with the big banks and in some cases to take some money away from big banks and put it with some of the capital banks, et cetera. And I think that somewhat puts you into Switzerland. I mean we have &#x2013; obviously because of our performance we've bucked that trend somewhat. But I think it certainly is &#x2013; I certainly think it's a fact that we've dealt with. I do think &#x2013; we've continued to be very solid in Switzerland and I think we I think continue to gain momentum there. If you look at the progression from fourth quarter where we had a lot of deleveraging among the Swiss business to the first quarter, it's a really nice progression and turnaround. I guess our hope is that we'll continue to see that follow through, but we'll see. With regard to the investment Banking business and our positions, maybe Paul I'll turn that over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for the question, Jeremy [sic: Christopher], I would say that when we thought through our strategy we were really thinking about what is it that our clients need? What businesses meet the criteria as I mentioned before of capital efficiency, less volatile, less complex? And we also took into account, as I mentioned, those in which we believe we have strategic advantage. So if you look at leveraged finance, for example, there clearly the most attractive business in leveraged finance was the U.S. leveraged finance business, and we're still very committed to that business as we mentioned. So we're not out of that business per se. But also I think if you look at our performance and our market positioning, our success is much broader. You look at the cash equities position, clearly a top three position. Electronic trading a number one position. Our prime services has moved to a top three position and increasing and growing the position and rates and FX the number one position in RMBS. So I think if you look across many of our business lines, you'll see that we have really many businesses that meet our criteria, that meet our strategic advantage.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks everybody for calling in. I know obviously these calls run a little bit long, but we're trading off hopefully more disclosure and transparency for taking up a little bit more of your time. I hope you find it useful.</p>
          <p>I would just reiterate we are pleased with the first quarter performance and in particular the return on equity. We do feel like we've got a very robust business model, which can, as we've seen in the first quarter, can be a powerful generator of earnings, even with a disciplined risk profile. We think we're doing well with clients. They recognize our strengths. We really view it as I think one of the winners out of this period. We think our Wealth Management business is very well positioned in this changing industry landscape. Very strong revenue growth across our key businesses and Investment Banking on the client side. We think this realigned capital-efficient platform is really capable of delivering sustainable profitability, very good returns, and reduced earnings volatility. We do think we've got our strategy right on Asset Management and our focus there we think will lead to success over the longer run.</p>
          <p>Clearly, a differentiated strategy, strong capital position, strong funding liquidity, we think well positioned businesses, significantly lower risk profile. The fact that we don't have any government ownership we think puts us in a very strong position to be a trusted partner with our clients and an attractive place to work. So, we remain optimistic about the prospects for Credit Suisse, particularly in the context of the overall industry, and we think we continue to be positioned well for difficult markets but also to benefit if things continue to be positive. So thank you very much for your attention.</p>
