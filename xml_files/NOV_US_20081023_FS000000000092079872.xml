          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the National Oilwell Varco Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, October 23rd of 2008.</p>
          <p>And at this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Pete Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Marcy, and good morning. Welcome to the third quarter 2008 National Oilwell Varco earnings conference call. I am Pete Miller, Chairman and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, and with me on the call today are Clay Williams, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeremy Thigpen, the President of our Downhole Tools and Pumping Solutions Group.</p>
          <p>Earlier today we announced earnings of $548 million or $1.31 a share on revenues of $3.6 billion. Included in the results are a $0.04 charge for costs associated with our recent Grant Prideco acquisition and about $0.09 of after-tax charge associated with the Hurricane Ike disruption that we had in Houston.</p>
          <p>While the facilities made it through Hurricane Ike very well, we lost a lot of power and as a result lost about two weeks of productive capacity out of many of our facilities; that's what entails this $0.09. This in fact will be recouped over the next couple of quarters as we ship out products that we did not get out.</p>
          <p>Overall we are very, very pleased with the results that we had in this quarter. Additionally, we announced a record capital intake of new orders of $2.4 billion, bringing our current backlog up to a record level of almost $12 billion. It's really 11.8 but I like to say 12.</p>
          <p>Clay will provide a lot of detail on this in just a moment, but I think it does indicate the continuing need to retool our business and to rebuild the infrastructure that we have around the world. We are very pleased with these results, as I said earlier. While there is anxiety and concern over the near-term prospects of the oil and gas business, most especially because of the financial anxiety around the world, we believe our outstanding employees, our strong balance sheet, our exceptional products and our wonderful business model are going to present us with opportunities that we haven't seen for quite some time. We feel very, very good about our opportunities and the way we are going to advance through the future.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'd like turn it over to Clay Williams to will give you a little bit of color on the numbers, tell you a little bit about our backlog, and then we'll turn it over to Jeremy to talk a little bit about his business in the Downhole Tools and the Pumping Systems. Clay?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Pete. Before beginning this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2008, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates including but not limited to forward-looking &#x2013; or comments about the outlook for the company's business. These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>They are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the year. I refer you to the latest forms 10-K and S-4 that National Oilwell Varco has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more detailed discussion of major risk factors affecting our business.</p>
          <p>Further information regarding these as well as supplemental financial and operating information may be found within our press release, on our website at www.nov.com, or in our filings with the SEC.</p>
          <p>Later on in this call, Pete, Jeremy and I will answer your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to two in order to permit more participation.</p>
          <p>National Oilwell Varco generated earnings of $548 million or $1.31 per fully diluted share in its third quarter ended September 30, 2008, on revenues of $3.6 billion. Results included $0.04 per share transaction charge related to our second quarter merger with Grant Prideco in line with our prior guidance and estimated impact of $0.09 per share from Hurricane Ike. Excluding both items earning would have been approximately $1.44 per share, a terrific result for a stormy quarter in more ways than one.</p>
          <p>Hurricane Ike took a significant toll on our Texas employees, customers and suppliers in the quarter, as Pete mentioned, and continued to have an impact into the fourth quarter. While we were fortunate to avoid any serious damage to our facilities, our 40-plus NOV facilities and hundreds of our Houston-area suppliers were without power and working shorthanded.</p>
          <p>Company-wide, we estimate that $114 million in revenues were lost or deferred, mostly in our Rig Technology segment at high detrimental leverage. Unfortunately, only a small portion of this will turn around in Q4, which was also affected during the first few weeks of this month but most will come back in Q1 2009. Additionally, hurricanes affected certain portions of our operations in Mexico, but thankfully on a much smaller scale.</p>
          <p>Things are turn &#x2013; returning to normal and we are working hard to take care of our customers. Our thoughts and prayers are also with our local and Mexican employees and their families as they patch roofs and replace sheetrock and try to get their homes back to normal, too, after a severe hurricane season.</p>
          <p>Yet another hurricane descended upon the financial markets just a few days after Ike, carrying with it a blizzard of questions about our order book.</p>
          <p>Before I review the third quarter operating results for our three segments, which, by the way, were excellent, I would like to take a few minutes to tell you more about the nature of our backlog. Most importantly, the backlog ascended to a new record of $11.8 billion, roughly 14 times the amount of orders we had when National Oilwell and Varco merged three and half years ago. It has increased every quarter since the merger due to the pressing need to upgrade an old, tired land-rig fleet and jack-up rig fleet to modern new AC power electronic controls and robotic pipe handling technologies and to build out a deep water fleet capable of drilling vast, unexplored swaths of the planet covered by 500 feet of water or more.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we shipped nearly $1.4 billion out of backlog, a little less than expected due to the impact of Hurricane Ike. We expect nearly $1.5 billion to be recognized in revenue from backlog in the fourth quarter of this year, $5.7 billion in 2009 and the balance of $4.6 billion thereafter.</p>
          <p>Despite the severe crisis &#x2013; the credit crisis, National Oilwell Varco managed to post a record level of orders of $2.4 billion during the third quarter, including four deep water packages for Brazil and two more deepwater packages for other established publicly traded drilling contractors. Notably, only three of the four Brazilian floaters were among the 12 letters of intent issued by Petrobras in March, the fourth was for a domestic Brazilian drilling contractor moving ahead with building in anticipation of growing demand for that market.</p>
          <p>Our backlog contains only contracted work; it does not contain letters of intent for notional projects. Nothing goes into the backlog without a contract. Our contracts on major projects do not permit cancellation for convenience. Our contracts do not allow for cancellation for lack of financing. We require substantial down payments to begin work, sometimes 10% and usually much more, and require progress billings, which were structured to, in the aggregate, keep NOV cash-positive during the construction.</p>
          <p>As of September 30, NOV has collected in cash or has cash due by the end of next week, amounts that exceed our investments in these projects by more than $3 billion. If all of our customers were to walk away from all of their projects, thereby defaulting on their contracts, we'd have substantially more in cash than we've invested so far, plus we'd have the undelivered inventory, too. And much of the inventory is fungible, items like top drives, drawworks, and mud pumps that we sell day in and day out.</p>
          <p>So let me be clear: we expect our backlog of projects to move ahead as planned in accordance with their contracted terms.</p>
          <p>At September 30, 90% of our backlog was for international markets; 66% of our backlog or $7.8 billion was directed at major offshore rig new builds; 19% or $2.2 billion was for various offshore components spending platform rigs, construction vessels FPSOs and replacement or upgrade items for offshore drilling rigs; and 15% or $1.8 billion was for land equipment, of which $1.1 billion was for a domestic market expressing a strong preference for modern rigs.</p>
          <p>This illustrates well the breadth and diversity of our product offering through our rig technology segment.</p>
          <p>In aggregate, we are 31% complete with the $7.8 billion of major offshore projects I referenced, which totaled $11.3 billion when first ordered. 56% of these orders were placed with NOV when the 12-month WTI strip was below $75 a barrel. Most of our large offshore projects are contracted through shipyards, which accounts for 58% of our total backlog. Based on their latest public financial statements, our top five shipyard customers have $6.6 billion more in cash than they have in debt, which totaled less than $3.5 billion. They appear to us to be very well capitalized. Most of their customers are established drillers. Only 13% of our backlog is for start-up drilling operations and slightly more than half of these are established shipping companies with existing strong cash flows venturing into drilling.</p>
          <p>34% of our total backlog is either with government-owned enterprises, as secured export import financing guarantees, or is in a process of applying for guarantees now.</p>
          <p>We have one customer behind on payments, which places $182 million of our backlog about 1.5% at risk. We have notified that customer that we have stopped work until we are paid. Notably, we have collected nearly $40 million more than we currently have invested in their project.</p>
          <p>In short, we are very comfortable with the stability of our current backlog. However, we recognize that financing new large projects has become much more difficult for industry participants lately and we expect that NOV's orders will be down over the next few quarters. We are continuing to work with our customers on new rig construction projects but several are pausing in the face of lower commodity prices and tougher financing. That's okay. In the meantime, we have a solid $11.8 billion worth of work to do, plenty to tide us over.</p>
          <p>NOV is well positioned to weather this storm. On September 30 &#x2013; our September 30 balance sheet illustrates how the company has completely de-levered our business on a net debt basis despite a large cash acquisition in the second quarter. We've done this through solid cash flow from operations, which is $1.7 billion year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow after CapEx but before acquisitions has been $1.5 billion through the first three quarters. As a result, on September 30, we had cash in the bank totaling $1.8 billion and debt fell to $1.5 billion, only 19 million of which is current. The majority of our debt is due between 2011 and 2015.</p>
          <p>I am also pleased to report that as of yesterday we have fully repaid the remaining balance on our revolving lines of credit that we secured to finance the acquisition of Grant Prideco. This means we've repaid over $2 billion in acquisition debts since April 21, 2008, and that we now have over $2.5 billion of available capacity on our lines. We enter this financial hurricane with a rock solid balance sheet.</p>
          <p>We also entered the storm with a very strong portfolio of service businesses, something that National Oilwell Varco doesn't get enough credit for. Many on Wall Street seemed to pigeonhole National Oilwell Varco as a rig builder and a backlog story. This is easy to understand given the sharp rise in rig construction and the headline grabbing order and backlog results we've been consistently posting.</p>
          <p>I would like to offer a new framework to use when thinking about NOV. In reality, our portfolio of businesses is far more diverse and durable. NOV is a full-cycle participant in the oilfield. Our petroleum services and supplies and distribution services segments are highly driven by rig count and oilfield activity. We have noted in the past that rig technology segment is mostly but not entirely fueled by capital expenditures by oilfield service companies and lags the other two segments by a year or two.</p>
          <p>Notably, about 23% of rig technology sales in the third quarter are not CapEx driven but were rather from the aftermarket support of our large installed base, which is growing monthly. Aftermarket support is generally tied more to activity levels than to CapEx.</p>
          <p>All three segments are fundamentally driven by oil and gas prices, but the petroleum services and supplies and distribution groups, comprising 43% of Q3 earnings, are a first derivative in commodity prices while the rig group comprising 57% of Q3 earnings is a second derivative.</p>
          <p>Combining two groups of cyclical businesses, where one lags the other, even though they are based on the same fundamental driver, tends to add stability to earnings and cash flow. As activity falls, we expect to see it first in our PS&amp;S and distribution areas, while our strong backlog in rigs should enable us to bridge the valley.</p>
          <p>If one side of our house hits a downturn, the other can provide cash and capital to invest in the extraordinary opportunities that inevitably arise in depressed markets. NOV is a far more thoughtfully constructed company than the highly cyclical rig builder that we are often perceived to be with balance between activity-driven and CapEx-driven business lines that are sometimes out of phase.</p>
          <p>Significantly, NOV occupies exceedingly strong positions in a number of oilfield service arenas, not just rig construction. We are the largest provider of tubular inspection, internal coating, hardbanding and threading services worldwide.</p>
          <p>We are the largest provider of pump expendables and small centrifugal pumps worldwide. We make more than half the world's coil tubing and coil tubing units. We are the leading provider of solids control equipment, shale shaker screens and thermal desorption treatment of drill cuttings.</p>
          <p>We are a leading provider of composite pipe to the worldwide oilfield. We are a leading provider of procurement and distribution services to the upstream oil and gas industry. We are the world's largest manufacturer of drill pipe collars and spiral vein.</p>
          <p>In a moment, Jeremy will tell you more about the remarkable position his business has built in the supply of Downhole tools used in horizontal, directional and performance drilling. We have a lot more here at NOV than just building rigs.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter margins petroleum service and supplies and distribution services both records offer excellent evidence of the great work these groups perform for their customers.</p>
          <p>To summarize, we think that strong worldwide oilfield activity-driven service franchises backstopped by a strong worldwide provider of capital equipment with solid orders to execute over the next three years make for a powerful financial combination that can handily weather the cyclical ups and downs of the oil business.</p>
          <p>Finally, if there is a silver lining to the current credit meltdown and the downturn in the drilling business that everybody believes is coming, it is this: we are very, very good at executing transactions in a capital-starved world. NOV was born in a capital-starved world. That's where Pete, Jeremy and I spent most of our careers. Capital-starved worlds open up extraordinary opportunities to those with cash and capital. We have stepped up our efforts to find solid acquisition opportunities and believe that the deeper activity falls, the more interesting the acquisition opportunities will get.</p>
          <p>This process takes time and patience, but having closed close to 200 acquisitions in the past dozen years between National Oilwell and Varco, we have the talent and fortitude to do some great things here. Not to mention our bulletproof balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Turning to operations, overall, excluding the transaction-related noise, third quarter results were excellent. Consolidated revenues were $3.6 billion, up 5% from the second quarter and up 18% year-over-year including continuing Grant Prideco operations in all periods on an adjusted combined basis.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was $818 million or 22.7% of sales, excluding transaction charges, and operating profit flow-through or leverage was 24% sequentially and 32% year-over-year compared to the adjusted combined historical quarters.</p>
          <p>Rig technology generated $1.9 billion in revenue and $500 million in operating profit in the third quarter, giving an operating margin at 26%. The impact of Hurricane Ike hit this group the hardest deferring about $79 million of revenues. As a result, revenue at our backlog increased only 2% sequentially to $1.363 billion, and overall segment revenue increased only $15 million. Operating profit fell slightly, owing to high detrimentals on the deferred work due to underabsorption.</p>
          <p>Orders for land rigs jumped significantly in the third quarter due to lots of demand for AC land rigs for North America backed by term contracts, including several orders for ideal rigs and our new drake rig design. Expect the first drake to spud in mid-2009. We continue to quote lots of land rigs into markets in the Middle East, North Africa, and Latin America with nine to 14-month deliveries, but have seen the market for land rigs in Russia and China cool recently due to credit and political issues.</p>
          <p>On the offshore front, in addition to the six floater packages I mentioned earlier, rig technology also secured a handful of jack-up packages consistent with the past several quarters.</p>
          <p>While the credit picture has been discouraging lately, several factors point to improving economics at rig building, namely rising day rates for ultra deepwater floaters, falling steel costs and a strengthening U.S. dollar. Offshore rig building tends to be naturally long in the dollar for drilling contractors because the day rate market is denominated in U.S. dollars and rig fabrication predominantly occurs overseas.</p>
          <p>Shipyard-sourced steel from foreign mills and buy lots of welding hours denominated in Sing dollars and Yuan, the National Oilwell Varco manufactures much of what we sell into these projects overseas too. Improvements in all three areas, day rates, steel and FX should lift returns on projects, credit notwithstanding.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect rig technology to post strong sequential growth sets and operating profit flow-through in line with our long-term 30% guidance resulting in margins comparable to our second quarter margins.</p>
          <p>Controlling services and supply segment generated revenues of $1.3 billion in the third quarter, up 66 million or 5% from the second quarter including a fourth quarter contribution from continuing Grant Prideco operations in both quarters.</p>
          <p>Operating profit leverage or flow-through on this same basis was 50%, owing to excellent results from ReedHycalog, which picked up <mark type="inaudible" /> control and the seasonal rebound out of breakup in Canada. Year-over-year, including a full quarter from Grant Prideco and adjusting for products transferred to other segments in the second quarter, petroleum services and supplies revenues improved about 10% at 44% flow-throughs.</p>
          <p>Hurricane Ike impacted Q3, petroleum services and supplies segment revenues by about $35 million, about 60% of which we expect to recover in Q3.</p>
          <p>Orders for drill pipe improved again this quarter after nearly doubling last quarter driving our drill &#x2013; backlog for drill pipe back up close to $1 billion. Revenues improved but drill pipe margins declined due to the hurricane impact and unfavorable mix of smaller API pipe and higher steel costs. The group outsourced more green tubes due to a planned shutdown of our Voest-Alpine mill during the quarter.</p>
          <p>The rig count moves down as expected, we would expect drill pipe demand to soften somewhat. Recent high demand from domestic operators for drill pipe together with high domestic rig counts in the third quarter lifted the domestic mix of U.S. revenues for the entire petroleum services and supplies group to 54% during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We have seen no credit-crisis impact in the field either internationally in North America but nevertheless believe that an impact is coming probably in early 2009. At this point we expect North America would be hit hardest and that most international operations would continue with their 2009 drilling plans.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to the next quarter, we expect strong results with low single-digit sequential growth in the petroleum services and supplies group but expect margins to fall slightly due to mix and temporarily higher steel costs and drill pipe, which should begin to turnaround in Q1.</p>
          <p>Distribution services had an outstanding quarter with record results. Revenues were $498 million, up 17% from the second quarter and up 38% year-over-year. Operating profit was $44 million and operating margins were 8.8%. Sequential operating leverage or flow-through was 26% and year-over-year flow through was 14%. U.S. operations led most of the increase, comprising 18% in revenues with 20% plus flow-throughs on improving margins and activity with the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain areas leading the way.</p>
          <p>The hurricane impact was minimal on domestic operations but did delay shipments out of the port of Houston, but for a modest amount of international revenue, it contributed to an overall slight sequential decline in international sales. However, international margins improved as compared to the second quarter. Canada posted strong results coming out of breakup due to high demand for pipe in Saskatchewan and Eastern Canada. Artificial lift also posted a strong quarter.</p>
          <p>The costs in our outlook for distribution services for Q4 owing for the potential for a drilling slowdown and pricing pressure late in the year in North America, which accounts for about two-thirds of the group's revenues. Consequently, we expect revenues for this group to be down a couple of percentage points and for margins to fall in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning back to National Oilwell Varco's consolidated third quarter income statement, SG&amp;A increased $36 million sequentially on a GAAP basis as we picked up a full quarter of Grant Prideco results and accrued higher incentive compensation levels and benefit costs. Interest expense declined $5.6 million as we steadily paid down Grant Prideco acquisition debt.</p>
          <p>Other expenses were $29 million from a debit in Q2 to a $14 million credit in Q3 due to large FX movements in Europe. Equity income from our Voest-Alpine JV increased slightly to $20 million, where higher pricing helped offset a mill shutdown and a stronger dollar impact.</p>
          <p>And allocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule, which is pro forma for the Grant Prideco acquisition for all periods, were $55.5 million, up $5.8 million due to higher incentive compensation accruals and a turnaround of insurance credits in Q2, partly offset by higher savings from the Grant Prideco acquisition.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization was $116 million in the third quarter, excluding transaction-related inventory step-up charges, and exceeded our Q3 CapEx of $104 million. EBITDA was $974 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our September 30, 2008, balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $2.4 billion, up $84 million sequentially and equaling 16.6% of annualized revenue, consistent with recent prior quarters.</p>
          <p>DSOs improved slightly from Q2. Cash flow from operations was $462 million and, less Q3 CapEx of $104 million, yielded free cash flow for the quarter of $358 million.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn it over to Jeremy for his comments.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clay. I really appreciate this opportunity to share with our listeners some additional information about a few of those product lines that are not quite as visible as our rigs for distribution business.</p>
          <p>Our particular portion of the PS&amp;S segment accounts for approximately 2 billion in annualized revenue and is comprised of four distinct product areas that we refer to as mission products, drill string telemetry, downhole, and drill bits and services.</p>
          <p>At mission, we design and manufacture a complete portfolio of multipurpose pumps utilized in both drilling and production. And we also provide the fluid-in modules, pistons, liners, and other expendables that enable our customers to optimize their performance, simplify their maintenance processes, and reduce their total cost of ownership by extending the life of their pumps.</p>
          <p>I suppose the simplest way to describe mission is to tell you that it's a microcosm of NOV. We have the most recognized, respected and trusted brand names in the market, impeccable quality, industry-leading technology, a global manufacturing and distribution network, and well positioned and well capitalized customers, that just happen to include NOV distribution, NOV Rig Solution and all the world's largest land and offshore drilling contractors.</p>
          <p>Therefore, while we're certainly keeping a watchful eye on the global economy and its impact on commodity pricing and drilling activity, especially in U.S. lands, we feel very comfortable with our position. As of this morning we have not yet experienced any weakening in our day-to-day expendables business.</p>
          <p>We still have a healthy backlog of CP packages with the various new builds that are in process and with our premium products we continue to capture market share, both domestically and abroad. However, in the event that we do experience a slowdown in U.S., we believe that we are well positioned to quickly shrink our pipeline to reflect the change in demand.</p>
          <p>Quite honestly, a modest slowdown would not be the worst thing in the world for our business. Today we are running two ten-hour shifts at most facilities and we are still heavily dependent upon our outsourcing to keep up with demand. Therefore, if required, we will quickly move to in-sourced manufacturing, eliminate overtime and, if needed, reduce our number of shifts. Whatever happens, as the undisputed leader in the market, we will be well equipped to continue to prosper.</p>
          <p>Although not nearly as large or established as our mission products, our drill string telemetry product, more commonly known as the intelligent network, is an existing new technology that continues to impress the early adopters of the service.</p>
          <p>The real time information provided by the network enables our customers to instantaneously interpret data that is typically only available after the well is drilled. Therefore, our customers are now able to enhance drilling performance, while significantly reducing the risk associated with downhole tool failures and well-bore instability.</p>
          <p>Though market acceptance is a bit slower than we would like, I am pleased to report that we've successfully commercialized the technology and expanded the network to provide high-speed data telemetry services to customers in the U.S., Mexico, South America, the North Sea and Australia. To date the performance of the system has proven to be exceptionally reliable and our customers are demonstrating their commitment to the technology by awarding us with multi-well and multi-year contracts.</p>
          <p>Given these contracts and our ever strengthening partnerships with companies like Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker and Rutherford, we fully expect for this technology to begin gaining real traction in Q1.</p>
          <p>Finally, within our Downhole and Bit product lines, we design, manufacture and service a complete array of Downhole tools utilized in both drilling and well-intervention applications. Over the past few years through significant investments in acquisitions and product developments and our global service and manufacturing capacity and our rental fleet, we have migrated from a relatively small North American-based business with a fairly limited product offering to the industry's largest and most comprehensive independent supplier of downhole tools.</p>
          <p>Whether our customers require drill-bits or motors, drilling jars, shaft tools, non-meg drill covers, under reamers, stabilizers or any combination of the above, we are the only independent supplier currently capable of meeting all of their downhole need on a global basis.</p>
          <p>As I think about our downhole and bit products, I'm probably most pleased by the way in which the legacy downhole, Andergauge and ReedHycalog employees have so quickly recognized the value of this newly combined entity and so eagerly latched on to each other to pursue various growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>For example, all of our folks immediately recognized that Andergauge is a perfect complement to Downhole. It markets to the same customers; it supplies technologies that can and should be run in tandem with our other downhole tools; it requires capital to support the build of its retrofit fleet and it requires global manufacturing and service capabilities.</p>
          <p>Therefore, with Downhole's existing customer relationships and supply contracts, and a very strong balance sheet, Downhole manufacturing facilities in Canada, the U.S, the U.K, the UAE and Singapore, and Downhole service facilities in every major operating area around the world, we have all the pieces in place to immediately and substantially grow the Andergauge product line.</p>
          <p>To help put this opportunity into perspective, prior to the acquisition Andergauge outsourced 100% of its manufacturing and supported its worldwide operations out of only two service facilities, one in Aberdeen and one in Houston. Now that we've combined Andergauge and Downhole, we are in the process of manufacturing Andergauge components in-house and migrating tools to our various service facilities around the world. As you can imagine, both of these actions are driving tangible growth in revenues and operating margins.</p>
          <p>As another example of collaboration, we're recognizing the value of sharing resources between Downhole and Bits. Within Downhole, we enjoy outstanding relationships with companies like Schlumberger and Halliburton, and Rutherford and Baker. However, our exposure to the operators has been somewhat limited. Conversely, within Bits we are in front of operators every day, actively competing for every section of every well. It obviously represents a great opportunity for us to gain market intelligence, while also leveraging our relationships and our technologies to present a single face and a more comprehensive solution to our various customers.</p>
          <p>We're also actively coordinating our engineering efforts across our various product lines. Perhaps the most exciting example of this collaboration involves the utilization of the ReedHycalog's blackbox technology, which is a downhole vibration recorder. With blackbox, we are able to gain a better understanding of drilling dynamics in various environments and applications; and with this information, our engineers are able to analyze different combinations and different configurations of our existing tools to meet our customer's various drilling challenges. They are also able to use this information to develop new technologies that will help our customers to enhance drilling performance.</p>
          <p>So I hope you can see we're extremely excited about these various growth opportunities and we believe that we can leverage the strengths of our newly combined businesses to capture market share even in a soft market.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we are actively preparing the organization for a potential slowdown. Our guys in the U.S. know that they are not going to receive the same amount of capital for new tools and new machines as we approved in '07 and '08, and they also know that we could begin migrating some of our existing U.S. tools to some of our newer facilities and newer markets, including Vera Cruz, Tripoli, Abu Dhabi, Acobar , Mumbai and Tenggu.</p>
          <p>Our manufacturing guys know that they need to be prepared for a potential reduction in demand. Much like I described in our mission plants, our downhole facilities are currently running two ten-hour shifts and all of our bit plants are operating on three eight-hour shifts. Therefore, if required, we know that we can quickly shrink our pipeline and our expense base without cutting so deeply that we risk compromising the future health of our business.</p>
          <p>In summary, barring a total collapse in the economy and commodity crisis we, like all of the other NOV businesses, are very well positioned to continue to flourish in any market, with recognized, respected, and trusted brand names, impeccable quality, industry-leading technologies, global manufacturing and distribution and well positioned, well capitalized customers. In short, we are in good shape. Thank you for your time and I'll turn it over to Pete.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeremy, and thanks, Clay. I just want to make a couple of quick comments myself and then I'll turn it over for a Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>I think one of the things that's important for everybody to realize, while we certainly believe that North America is going to get softer, I think everyone out there realizes that, kind of one of the unique things about our business today is the &#x2013; it basically is very rapidly self-correcting.</p>
          <p>If you look at the number of wells that are being drilled today, the vast majority are becoming horizontal wells, they are shale plays, and &#x2013; quite frankly &#x2013; the depletion curves on shale plays are very significant. When you stop drilling, it will all of a sudden cut into the production capacity, it will all of a sudden cut into the amount of gas out there, which in turn means you better start drilling again. We've seen this happen, whether you go back to '99, whether you go back to 2001, and so we do believe things will be rapidly self-correcting.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you've heard a lot of the drilling contractors talk about the need for the newer rigs. I think yesterday, Nebris mentioned that their new rigs are in great shape. And they were going to get rid of some old rigs and they are going to actually cut some up. Quite frankly, that plays into exactly what we've been talking about for a long time: we need infrastructure replacement.</p>
          <p>Irrespective of what happens over the next year or so or two on the financial economy, rust never sleeps. And you're going to continue to need the infrastructure replacement. We think we're in great shape to be able to handle that. I think Clay gave you a very good definition and description of what our backlog's all about, and it gives us plenty of opportunity to be able to withstand any shortfall, but to be able to prepare ourselves to give this industry the things that it needs. It's all about technology; it's all about repairing that infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Real quickly, on an international basis, I think there is lot of areas that continue to be pretty exciting, the Northeast and &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; the Middle East and North Africa are still great areas. And for them and again it comes to back to replacement of reserves. It's not so much the price today, even though they are concerned about that, but it's much more about: are they building up the reserves for the future?</p>
          <p>Quite honestly, I can't make a big argument that I don't like 70 or $75 oil, because I think it will help the economy rebound faster. It also is not going to impact their projects, that they're doing in places like the Middle East, and we continue to have very robust activity there in bidding products.</p>
          <p>Kind of one of the more interesting areas, too, that I think is far below the radar is Latin America. You look at lot of the IPM's that are going on in places like Mexico, Jeremy just mentioned, we're there with our products to help the folks out on these IPM situations. Brazil, while it may cut back a little bit, I think in the short term, on the number of rigs they are announcing, they still have to continue to want to advance and get the equipment down there to be able to increase their productivity.</p>
          <p>Did you notice, I think it was yesterday in the [Houston] Chronicle, they talked about having production of 4.2 million barrels a day by 2015. That was from their CEO. And let me assure you, if they are going to do that, they are going to need rigs and they are going to need the support of those rigs and they are going to need the equipment that we have.</p>
          <p>So we feel very comfortable that while there certainly are some short term wins and maybe even would push into the intermediate term, we are positioned to take advantage of this. And I think really do some fairly unique things.</p>
          <p>One other area that I will talk about for a second and it's not exactly a country, but it's the Arctic. And we are seeing a lot more interest today in the Arctic, the type of rigs that can drill in the Arctic. They are saying there is more opportunity up there, if you look at the Stockman rigs that we announced couple of quarters ago in the Baltic Sea, I think you'll see that there is more and more things that will be done in the Arctic arena, and they'll need new rigs, and those, quite frankly, are very expensive rigs. So we're excited about some of the prospects there.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me touch just a second or two on technology. Clay mentioned our Marcellus, our drake rig for the Marcellus Shale, really a cool rig. We've already sold a bunch of these, designed specifically for the terrain and the type of wells that are being drilled up there and we are doing more and more things every day with AC technology, our permanent magnet motors.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we feel pretty good about where we're positioned. We certainly aren't Pollyannas; we understand that there's headwinds out there; but we also understand that &#x2013; my hair didn't get gray because I haven't been through this before. The fact of the matter is we've got a management team that knows how to do things and we're going do things that are correct. But right now we are excited about where we are, we are excited about our balance sheet, and I think there are lot of good things going on as well as a lot of challenges.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to thank all of our employees. It's been a tough time between hurricanes in China, between flooding in Mexico &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; the earthquakes in China, flooding in Mexico, and hurricanes on the Gulf Coast. Our folks have come through it well. They've continued to be very productive and help this company out, and for that we are very, very thankful.</p>
          <p>So at this time, Marcia , I would like to turn it over to you for any questions that our callers might have.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder, please ask two questions and re-queue for any additional questions. Our first question is from Jim Crandell. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys, Jim Crandell from Barclays Capital. Another great quarter, congratulations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is about Brazil. I think Clay mentioned that you would see three of the 12 orders from Brazil in the third quarter. Would you expect the majority of the remainder in the fourth quarter, and can you give your thoughts on spending by coming out of Brazil and rigs coming out of Brazil over the next two to three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, I would say &#x2013; I wouldn't say that we'd be getting the orders in the fourth quarter. I think there is a potential we'll have some of them in the fourth quarter. I do think they're having a few challenges there, getting the financing straightened out the way they want it.</p>
          <p>If you will note yesterday I mentioned earlier about the CEO from Petrobras being in town and he kind of mentioned that they were helping a lot of these folks find financing. But in the event that they couldn't Petrobras was all on &#x2013; was going to prepare themselves to provide some of the financing. So, I think these are going to go on, the exact timing I think is probably a little problematic at this point. Where we could get some in the fourth quarter, I think the majority would probably stretch out into '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, probably worth noting, too, that there are avenues of financing available out there. Most of the major shipbuilding countries around the world have export-import banks that offer guarantees and can assist builders with financing these rigs and so there are discussions going on with some of those entities around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question is: Clay, I believe you told our group three weeks ago that of the 102 projects that you're involved in, 100 have long-term financing. If that's not, my recollection isn't right, please correct it. In the light of that, do you see this situation where you had one customer behind on payments; do you see this as a one-off or very close to a one-off situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me, let me clarify, Jim. I said that we had a couple of projects we were aware of that we knew didn't have long-term financing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are others where we're not 100% positive, remember we contract through the shipyard pretty frequently. We do have a lot of insight into most of our customers and feel good about their financing. Just to clarify that, but yeah, we do view the one project that we're having issues on right now as really a one-off. As I mentioned, it's less than 2% of our backlog and we're substantially cash-ahead on that project. And also to add to, this isn't entirely unusual, this is kind of the business that we're in and sometimes people get a little late on payments. So, we're talking with that customer, and hopefully things will get back on track here.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Kurt Hallead. [RBC Capital Markets]. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Obviously, given where your stock's trading right now, it's down a pretty significant increment in business, probably much more severe than we're actually going to see going forward. I appreciate all the color you've given. Maybe, on a, more on a near-term basis then, Clay, you referenced on TSS that the fourth-quarter margins would be down, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering, was that frame of reference off the hurricane impact at third quarter, or should we think of it a little bit differently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's sequential. So it's compared to the third quarter, which was very, very strong. But it's less a hurricane impact, Kurt because the hurricane will really affect both quarters. It actually trickled into the first couple of weeks of Q4. It's less a hurricane issue than it is just a general mix issue that we foresee there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And look if business actually does slow down to the extent that your stock is predicting, it looks like you guys are going to throw off a tremendous amount of cash. So I guess that dovetails into your viewpoint about the opportunities that may be presenting themselves right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. We &#x2013; it's important to note that we have very scalable businesses that aren't terribly capital intensive. As I mentioned, we are underspending depreciation and CapEx and so we do generate a lot of cash. We've been careful with our balance sheet before this. We haven't had a stock buyback in the past to preserve capital, because as a management team we've been through a lot of cycles in this industry, we recognize that when business is very good, you really kind of need to hang on to that cash, because it has a lot of option value when business turns and gets bad.</p>
          <p>And so now that we appear to be moving into a world where the market's going to be a little bit softer, we do believe that there are very, very good opportunities that are going to present themselves. We're glad that we have a very strong balance sheet. We've preserved capital. We are glad that we are going to throw off a lot of cash and capital, and we look forward to deploying capital into those opportunities that present themselves as a direct result of the world that we find ourselves in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think that means there's a fourth leg, or do you think you'll just find some things that will tie into your existing like PSF businesses for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Kurt it could be a lot of different things. I think as we look strategically as to who we are, if a fourth leg presented itself we would certainly do it. We like the business model we've created. As Clay pointed out earlier, we've got a lot of &#x2013; this is a true full-cycle play. And I think that if there's some other things that we could add into that that make sense financial and strategically, we'd certainly be willing to do it.</p>
          <p>I think we've shown in the past that we're pretty good at that. We're very good at integration and we're going to keep our eyes open. And the nice thing is that a lot of -- I always tell everybody if you're going to build a rig, you always come to us to at least get a quote and use us as a stalking horse, if nothing else. And if you're going to sell or if you are interested in selling, you're always going to come to us to at least see if we're interested. So we like the opportunities that are out there today.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Robin Shoemaker. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Robin Shoemaker, Citigroup. Congratulations, Pete and Clay, on a great quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Robin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, wanted to ask you about the additions to backlog again for the quarter. I think you mentioned six deepwater rig packages, a few jackups were in there. Could you just indicate whether these orders, of course during the quarter there was kind of a big change in the credit markets and so forth and oil prices continue to fall, could you describe these as having come earlier in the quarter rather than later?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was -- I know in the month of September, we booked about 600 million out of the 2.4 billion. And so that was kind of while the storm was going on. So I guess it fell off just a tad, but Robin, I'll stress, these things are so big and lumpy, I don't &#x2013; I am not sure that means anything. We have continued to win some orders since September 30.</p>
          <p>So through the first three weeks of this month, we've had orders continue to come in the door since all this news broke. So &#x2013; but, in spite of that I'll kind of reiterate what Pete and I said earlier. We do expect our customers are going to take a little pause here generally. So it is softening a little bit.</p>
          <p>But, we -- a lot of our customers went into our backlog with eyes open about the current credit crisis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then my follow-up is regarding the drill pipe business. You mentioned the backlog of $1 billion roughly of drill pipe orders. I think that has been pretty steady. We know, in past downturns, of course, that drilling contractors in the U.S. tend to take drill pipe off of idle rigs and it looks like a number of the rig counts are going to come down. What's the plan for Grant Prideco in the event that we had, let's say, a rig count decline from 2000 level to 1500 or something like that. And you began to see the same patterns you saw in the past where drill pipe is taken off of idle rigs and to use on working rigs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Robin, I think, as with anything, we're pretty darn good at responding at what goes on in the marketplace. I think one of the nice things that you have today is that the Grant Prideco folks have done a great job, but we're also very much of a worldwide company, and the nice thing about drill pipe &#x2013; it is very fungible. And you can move it around &#x2013; contractors moved it from rig to rig and, fortunately, manufacturers can move it from country to country. And as you take a look at lot of the deepwater rigs that are out there today, a lot of those rigs that are on order, don't necessarily have a pipe.</p>
          <p>I think there is a secondary thing that's happening, that's a little different than in past. When you look at the number of wells that are being drilled that are in fact horizontal extended reach, the wear and tear on drill pipe is a lot different than it's been in the past. And so, the long-winded answer of that is, number one, I think the world's going to need a little bit more pipe that it's needed in the past, even with the reduced number of rigs; and secondly, if in fact we have to slow down, we slow down and we know how to handle that, and we are able to pullback very effectively and keep our cost in line.</p>

          <p>Heck Bill, I would never admit that anything was awarded to anybody else. I think that as you go forward, there are probably still plenty of those to be awarded. I think that some have been awarded but I also think that that number 12 is probably a floating number, too. I think that number could go up, it could go down. So the only thing that I can tell you is what we got. But I am not really too worried; we've got a pretty good position in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One follow-up, Clay, for you: margins on the backlog, if you think about the 11.8 billion right now and what kind of the aggregate margin is embedded in that versus what you've already recorded to the P&amp;L so far, I take it on average higher than what we've seen so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you've generally seen a shift over the last couple of years towards more offshore and more ultra-deep water and more sophisticated equipment, which is good for our margins, that's accretive to the margins generally. But it's not &#x2013; there is not a huge difference; we get good margins in the land rigs that we sell, too.</p>
          <p>So that's kind of one effect, you saw as we move through the cycle, we've had margins expand somewhat, they kind of flattened out I would say over the past year. The other is, though, that we're also getting better and better in executing on these rigs. We are now performing installations and commissioning work on the second copy and third copy of rig, and we just &#x2013; there is a learning curve effect here. And as we do the second, third and fourth and fifth version, costs tend to come down. So, I think that will help add to the margins as we go forward, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the incremental orders you see here in the next few quarters, margins should be consistent with what we've recently seen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in broad terms, I believe so. As I mentioned, there are a couple of good economic drivers that are helping the economics in building rigs with steel rolling over about 10 to 20%, with the dollar strengthening. That helps us, we make a lot overseas that is costed in foreign currencies. And so translating that, those costs to dollars, reduces them.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Brad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess following up on Bill's line of questions, can you speak just specifically to the steel rolling over &#x2013; does that &#x2013; I know you buy forward &#x2013; actually I am sure you buy forward &#x2013; but how much of the backlog might you be able to sort of benefit in terms of margins relative to steel if it continues to decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, not that much. We do work very hard to try to lock steel in. We learned a long time ago, we are not very good at speculating on steel price directions and we prefer not to do that. So when we win an order, what we like to do is just lock it in, so it's no longer a big variable. And to do that, we place orders for castings and forgings and structural steel as quickly as we can after we win a contract.</p>
          <p>So in terms of our existing book of business, we expect to have not that big of an impact on &#x2013; from falling steel prices. But looking forward to kind of the next projects that we bid with a little cheaper steel cost, that helps us in terms of our cost structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, it helps all of our day-to-day businesses. If you look at the PS&amp;S Group, we don't buy forward that much and we don't carry large inventories of steel. So as we see steel starting to rollover and decline here over the course of the next couple of months, it certainly helps our cost structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you &#x2013; Jeremy, thanks for that. Can you comment a little bit on kind of proportion of costs; I know you were talking about a lot of different businesses but &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, yeah it ranges across the businesses. If you look at our downhole business, steel makes up approximately 45% of the total cost of our goods. And if you look at the mission businesses it ranges anywhere from about 45 to 80%. Those modules are very steel intensive and so we benefit greatly from the reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. If I could steal just sort of an unrelated follow-up and it's just out of curiosity, anything else that you can tell us &#x2013; the comments that you made. It sounds like actually the &#x2013; we had a lull, relative to when Grant was running the business, it was quite a lull in terms of getting follow-on orders to the initial work. It sounds like you're suggesting that's finally turned and activity will ramp. So, perhaps how many strings might you be running as of the first quarter of '09 just as a way of referencing the turns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now we have 13 strings. We're going to be adding another three in Q1. And so, it's a combination of both the strings and kind of the resources to perform the jobs. But we'll be at the point where we will have 16 strings in Q1.</p>

          <p>Hello Michael. How are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm doing okay. Thanks Pete. A question for you, Clay, on the CapEx side. You mentioned that you're underspending depreciation. I know that you've been spending on facilities with cellular manufacturing and that kind of thing. Where are you now in terms of CapEx plans in this effort to try to wring cash out of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we've talked about in the past, converting a facility over to cellular manufacturing is a fairly lengthy and involved process. You can't just shut down a plant for three months while you rearrange all the machine tools. And so, it's a two-, three-year, four-year, in some cases, type effort. So we are a pretty good ways of the way through on the facilities that we plan to make this conversion in, probably touches two-thirds of our manufacturing facilities that we have in rig technology and we also have facilities in PS&amp;S that have adopted cellular -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All of the downhole and mission manufacturing businesses have adopted the cellular manufacturing approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the one of the key aspects of it, too, is that it's not terribly CapEx intensive. You're really more rearranging work flow and processes, job descriptions and kind of how you are organized more so than going out and writing big checks for roofline and machine tools. We have made rifleshot purchases of machine tools along the way to kind of bolster our manufacturing capabilities. But the thing about rig technology is that it's really a fairly capital-light business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we think about current CapEx levels, it's probably pretty sustainable, even call it a maintenance level at this point, ex-acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in fact we can spend less if we need to. In fact, Jeremy's businesses are one of the &#x2013; consume kind of a disproportionate amount of capital because they have such high growth opportunities. That's something we can kind of adjust to the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>High-growth opportunities and the fact that it's a rental model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was going to say: what percentage is now in rental, roughly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends by product line, but between 50 and 60% depending on the month or the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To add a little more color, three-fourths of our third quarter CapEx, which was a $104 million, so a little over $75 million was in our Petroleum Services and Supplies group. Rig Technology truly is a pretty capital-light business. Our PS&amp;S business is a little heavier on capital because there are rental businesses. In addition to Jeremy's, we also rent a lot of solid control equipment and other things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And 50 to 60% of that &#x2013; 75 &#x2013; is rental-tool related?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's quite that high, but it's certainly over half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As a follow-on, if I think about the M&amp;A environment of previous downturns, NOV was and the predecessor companies were really in very different stages of their own corporate development as was the business itself. If I think about value and use of cash, why not step on a share repurchase plan. I mean, is there that much out there that could plug holes or create other business lines that would potentially create as much value as buying back your own stock here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I think everything's on the table for us today. I mean, I think we're in a little bit of uncharted waters right here when you take a look at what we perceive to be a pretty undervalued stock price. But we &#x2013; but others out there have undervalued stock prices, too. And I think as we look at this, I wouldn't want anybody to ever think that we'd just exclude anything.</p>
          <p>But I think as we go to our Board, and we talk about our strategy, we put everything out there on the table, and that's not to say that a stock buyback wouldn't be one of the things that we clearly would have right on the table.</p>
          <p>But we want to make sure that we're creating a lot of value for our shareholders. And t many times, if we can find something out there that really adds to true growth and to true earnings and get that value, that's what we are going to do. But you can rest assured, this management team's committed to creating value for our shareholders, and we're going to do that the best way possible.</p>

          <p>Hi, Geoff.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Geoff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of follow-ups. You guys keep a very good track of what's on the &#x2013; let's say the shadow calendar in terms of orders and so on. Have you seen anything that you would have rated as a high probability either get pulled off the list or at least moved to a low probability over the course of the last three months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've had specific customer say, hey, we want to see where this credit market's going, where commodity prices shake out, that sort of thing. So yeah, we've got a couple of customers. I don't think anyone is coming to us saying absolutely not, we have decided we will never ever buy this rig. It's more a case of let's slow-play this for a little bit and see how things go.</p>
          <p>Bear in mind, Geoff, these conversations with these customers, they're kind of three-way conversations. There's us, there's a shipyard, there's a customer, and then they will be talking to their sources of financing if they need external financing for the rig. They're often also talking to oil companies about specific specifications that their customers want to build into the rigs and so they are a lengthy conversation. They go on for months and quarters and sometimes even years.</p>
          <p>And so today we have a lot of time invested in these various conversations. And so I think people truly do believe that the world does need more deepwater drilling capacity, that there will be a need for these rigs but they kind of view this as kind of a short-term dislocation. Many, as I mentioned earlier, are looking for other sources of financing and talking to some of the export/import banks, the government-sponsored agencies around the world that guarantee financing, and they seem to be filling in some of the gaps here. So we are hopeful. We do acknowledge there will be headwind here for a couple of quarters but hopeful things will turn around after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of your comment about your orders coming down in the next several quarters, are you also signaling that you will expect to see backlog coming down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that I would say that. As you take a look, Geoff, over the last, what, couple of years, I mean our book-to-bill has been in some cases two to one and the like. So I think it would be too early to say that I would say backlog's coming down. Certainly the book-to-bill isn't going to stick up at around 1.8 or 2 to 1, for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, still, and I think what's important to realize is orders are coming in and this is the 23rd of October and we've taken some very significant orders in October already, so I think it would be premature to say exactly what would happen because we're in uncertain times but still I &#x2013; orders are coming in and I think that in the long run it's still a very positive business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just on a separate topic, on the M&amp;A, are you willing to give us sort of any of your current thoughts as to what looks most interesting as everything starts looking cheaper?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have quite a broad range and lot a good opportunities on the table.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I'd hate to tell you, Geoff, because then the price is liable to go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But in &#x2013; to give a little more color &#x2013; I think most public companies in oil field services have pretty strong balance sheets. They've watched their stock prices decline and they are going to take the long view here, too, and I think, realistically, what's probably most doable are companies that are facing a little bit of balance sheet distress or need to refinance and need external capital and in both public and private arenas. We've had some private equity players roll into the space the last few years that have highly levered a couple of oil field service companies that we know. So, realistically, that's probably the most doable deal in the short-term and where we're applying our resources.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At a very kind of a conceptual level, would you &#x2013; should we expect it to be primarily manufacturing oriented. Or are you looking at anything more &#x2013; a deep involvement in the service area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Geoff, as you look conceptually where we've always been strategically, we think any product and service in the upstream oil and gas business makes a lot of sense, but also secondarily we sell and some of our best customers are people like Schlumberger and Halliburton and folks like that and we don't exactly go out and look for ways to compete against them. What we like more are the products that we can provide them, and the service that we provide associated with those products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We've done a couple of acquisitions this quarter in petroleum services and supplies. We do a couple of acquisitions every quarter. So I want to stress that this is something that we do day in and day out, and given what's going on in the marketplace and potential for downturn out there, we just think there'll probably be more coming and they are anxious to &#x2013; we think it's going to be a pretty interesting time. We look forward to doing some big deals.</p>
