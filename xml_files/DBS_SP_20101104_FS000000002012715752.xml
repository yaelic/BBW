          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our quarterly results media briefing. This is &#x2013; this morning we announced our third quarter results. We have here with us, here live in person, Piyush, our Group CEO and Sok Hui, our CFO. On the phone we also have our Hong Kong CEO, Sebastian, he's on the line and also our Hong Kong CFO, Chris Do Chou.</p>
          <p>Without further ado, I'll ask Sok Hui to start off with the results. Sok Hui, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another strong set of results. Net profit was up 28% from a year ago, and 1% from the previous quarter to a new record high of 722 million. The performance was underpinned by loan growth and customer driven non-interest income as execution of our strategy progressed at good pace.</p>
          <p>Loans rose 1% or 1.4 billion from the previous quarter, but would have grown 4% or 5.7 billion if currency translation effects were excluded. This reflects largely the appreciation of the Singapore dollar against U.S. dollars and Hong Kong dollars during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The loan growth offset the impact of lower interest margins, resulting in net interest income remaining stable at 1.08 billion in a soft interest rate environment. Non-interest income was customer driven. While loan-related fee revenues declined from the previous quarter's strong levels, most other fee income revenue streams were little changed.</p>
          <p>Revenue from cross-selling treasury products to customers grew 10% from the previous quarter, but overall trading income was affected by lower trading gains recorded. Other income, which includes gains from the sale of investment securities, was higher as market conditions were conducive for profit taking.</p>
          <p>Total expenses rose marginally to 726 million on higher technology spend. Credit cards on the other hand declined 4% to 195 million.</p>
          <p>For the nine months, earnings rose 26% from a year ago to 1.97 billion. Revenues grew 6% to 5.34 billion driven by customer flows for treasury products. Net interest income was lower. A 15% increase in loans over the past 12 months, which included market share gains and Sing dollar loans, was offset by the impact of lower interest margins.</p>
          <p>Expenses rose 13% to 2.15 billion as head count was increased to support increased business volumes and investments were made to ensure future growth. With improved asset quality, allowances fell 34% to 754 million. Specific allowances declined from 75 basis points of loans a year ago, to 49 basis points.</p>
          <p>Net interest margins fell 4 basis points from the previous quarter to 1.80%. The decline was due to new Singapore housing loans being made at lower yields than those that had run off. Deposit costs in Hong Kong were also higher due to competitive pressures.</p>
          <p>Excluding currency effects, underlying loans grew 4% or 5.7 billion, and deposits by 2% or 4.5 billion during the quarter. Singapore dollar loans rose 7% or 4 billion during the quarter, accounting for a significant portion of this quarter's growth. Singapore dollar housing loans increased 6%, while business loans rose 10%, driven by both corporates and SMEs.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong dollar loans grew 2% in local currency terms from corporate and SME borrowing. There was also underlying growth in foreign currency corporate loans across the region.</p>
          <p>Underlying deposit growth was led by an increase in U.S. dollar fixed deposits. Singapore dollar deposits were flat for the proportion of savings deposits growth.</p>
          <p>We have achieved a reported loan growth of 13% since the beginning of the year and 15% over the past 12 months. If currency translation effects were excluded, loan growth would have been 17% since the beginning of the year and 19% over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>In absolute terms, the amount of underlying loan growth was 22 billion and 25 billion, respectively. The growth was broad based across customer segments and across countries. Our market share of Sing dollar loans has risen by one percentage point since the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income was little changed from the previous quarter. Fee income declined 5% to 340 million, as loan-related fees fell from a high base in the previous quarter. This was partially offset by higher investment banking revenues. Most of the fee activities were little changed.</p>
          <p>Revenue from customer flows for treasury products rose 10% and accounted for significantly more than half of overall trading revenue this quarter. However, lower trading gains and a more prudent valuation reserve methodology more than offset the improvement in customer flows. This resulted in a 20% decline in overall trading income to 223 million. The lower fee in overall trading income was offset by higher gains from the sale of investment securities, which rose 26% to 123 million, as market conditions were conducive for profit taking.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses rose 1% from the previous quarter to 726 million. The increase was led by higher technology costs as we invested in systems to support business expansion. This quarter's cost to income ratio was at 40%. Our cost income ratio has been stable over the past three quarters, as strong revenue growth accommodated our continued investments in people, systems and technology. We will continue to invest in the coming quarters and expect the cost to income ratio to rise gradually.</p>
          <p>The figures on this slide incorporate an appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the Hong Kong dollar. And for this earnings analysis, it is the average appreciation that counts. So the Singapore dollar has appreciated against the Hong Kong dollar by an average of 6% from a year ago, and 3% against the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong's performance improved from the previous quarter, which had included a non-recurring expense arising from compensating cancellation customers. Adjusting for this change, net profit would have increased 27% from the previous quarter as revenues increased in allowances fell. The improvement in revenues was due to an 18% rise in non-interest income.</p>
          <p>There were higher trading gains, improved fees from credit cards, trade and loan-related activities, as well as gain from the sale of fixed assets. Net interest income on the other hand was affected by a 12 basis point decline in net interest margins to 1.56%, due to higher deposit costs. Expenses were marginally higher after adjusting for the cancellation compensation.</p>
          <p>Cost income ratio for the quarter was 38%. Allowances declined 44% to 18 million, largely due to lower general allowances. Overall, specific allowances remained low as the NPL ratio improved from 1.2% to 1.0%.</p>
          <p>Non-performing assets declined 6% to 3.51 billion, as recoveries and write-offs exceeded new non-performing loans. DBS remained prudent in its classification and 38% of non-performing assets are still current in interest and principal repayment. The non-performing loan rate improved to 2.1% from 2.3% in the previous quarter. An additional 195 million was set aside as specific and general allowances during the quarter. Cumulative allowances remained strong at 97% of non-performing assets and at 124% if collateral was included.</p>
          <p>Our capital position remains strong. The Tier 1 and total capital adequacy ratios at 13.1% and 16.3%, respectively. This was little change from the previous quarter. We have delivered another set of high-quality earnings, driven by customer revenues and underlying loan growth.</p>
          <p>Asset quality remains benign and allowances charges at more normalized levels. There our performance has been achieved in an environment of soft interest rate, reflects the progress we have made in the execution of our strategy. With a balance sheet that is strong, in both liquidity and capital, we'll continue to focus on customers and grow our franchise to capture opportunities across the region. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Change the slide.</p>
          <p>Okay, what I thought I would &#x2013; again, thank you all for being here. What I thought I would do is, like the last couple of times, take a few minutes to address where we are in terms of our strategic agenda and the priorities we have laid out.</p>
          <p>And just to refresh, when we've defined those priorities into these three buckets: nine priorities, three around position in the geographies, so build Singapore, build Hong Kong, rebalance our earnings mix over time; build the SME franchise, build a wealth franchise and improve the cross-sell of our treasury and markets and our GTS [Global Transaction Services] businesses into our customer base; and then, get more customer centric, build the regional management, an organization which can manage across the region and then, improve the technology and infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Slide please. So, I thought I do is to wind on each of these, as I did the last time. Just give you a sense for how I feel about where the Bank is, in the middle of the fourth quarter, frankly, or the end of the third quarter, relative to where we set out our strategic frame.</p>
          <p>Some of the things that I think we've made really good progress well, in the course of this year. The first is up there, which is embedding our strategic imperatives through the organization. This sounds straight, but this is generally not an easy thing to do. We spent several months not only figuring out what needed to be done, but we spent a lot of time through the rest of this year making sure that there is a unified organizational sense of ownership for what we're trying to do and where we're trying to go. So we did that through a lot of communication, we were setting up groups, forums, a series of workshops.</p>
          <p>As anecdotally last week, we use Gallup to run an employee survey every year, employee engagement survey, and Gallup showed us our set of scores for the year and it was very gratifying. First of all on an overall basis, our employee engagement is reaching what Gallup now calls, world-class levels. We had a significant uptick in our employee engagement scores for the year. But what is really gratifying to me is employee identification with the company's mission, purpose and strategic intent, is the single most improved category in our scores. Which means that the degree of alignment we have down this path, our strategic imperatives, is actually real. It's not just at the top. So I feel very good about the progress we've made with that.</p>
          <p>The second thing we did and as I think about this thing, we spent the first half of the year really driving this and we spent the second half of the year, slide please, with essentially strengthening our management team. And so we moved people internally and we have people like Melvin who we move to run China and so on, so we moved a lot of our internal folks around. But we also brought in talent from outside. And particularly in the areas where we thought that we had substantial gaps or need to up our game. So we improved or brought in more country management talent. We moved Melvin, we brought in Sebastian, we brought in Sim [Lim] to create Singapore. So I think we're more comfortable with the country management team we have. We brought in a lot of talent in the wealth consumer space, that consumer head will join at end of this month. But in the wealth space, we brought in a whole management team, which has integrated well with the existing DBS team. So I'm pretty comfortable with the management team we have there.</p>
          <p>We've build out a very solid management team now in transaction banking and in SME, both businesses we want to grow, so we have good leadership in both. We've built in and put in place the people in each of our country organizations. So I'm pretty comfortable with the team we have there.</p>
          <p>And what's less visible, we actually beefed up a lot in terms of our support units. So we've put in a Chief Operating Officer now with every key business. We have one for the Corporate business, for the Consumer business, for the Wealth business, we have one in Singapore, we have one in Hong Kong. And this created an enterprise and architecture, which allows us to be a lot more robust in terms of being able to execute our end-to-end delivery.</p>
          <p>So by and large, I think in terms of building the management team and where we are, I think we're pretty much there. I mean a lot of this, we've got to grow the businesses, so we will need a lot more talent in terms of growth. But in terms of having the right people in the right teams engaged against the businesses, I think we are pretty much there. Slide please.</p>
          <p>I think &#x2013; the third thing, which I feel very good about what we've done this year. I've talked about this once or twice, but I just want to reflect on it, because I think it's quite a watershed for DBS. It's got &#x2013; we created a corporate treasury function, which DBS has never had. Our thinking around corporate treasury was subsumed in our treasury and market's function, we've extracted that, we've created a corporate treasury function with a regular corporate treasury as part of self-refinance organization. And this allowed us to be a lot more disciplined about managing capital, managing balance sheet and managing liquidity.</p>
          <p>We've been able to put in place frameworks through this year, in terms of both risk adjusted and nominal. How do we leverage, what do we do with our money, where do we use our liquidity, what are our capital returns, what kind of hurdles do you want? And part of the Sing dollar loan growth we've seen, part has come from better segmenting in sales, but part of it has come from just being a lot smarter about understanding duration gaps, understanding the ability to transfer price funds more effectively, understanding and recognizing the actuarial sticky nature of our deposits, all of which has been driven by the corporate treasury function. So, I think that has been significant and substantial for us in the course of this year. Slide please.</p>
          <p>In terms of our principal businesses. We have started making progress on our branch model. So we've made tactical progress in the first half of the year, which is essentially putting more safe people into the branches and putting in place KPIs [Key Performance Indicators] in the branches we'll start measuring sales generation. So this allowed us to move the needle in terms of the kinds of businesses, our business volumes are bringing through the branch network, as opposed to their direct sales channel.</p>
          <p>What we're doing right now is launching, in a pilot way, for a select number of branches a whole branch entrepreneur model. I talked about it before, I wanted to copy essentially what Wells Fargo does, have a branch manager who owns a branch trading area, owns a customer base and then acts as an owner entrepreneur of the branch space, provide them with the appropriate MIS and analytics to be able to reach out and build a more holistic customer relationship.</p>
          <p>We're going to kick off the pilot sometime in the next week. We will run that pilot for a few months with this select number of branches and then if we get comfortable with that, we'll be ready next year to take it and roll it out in a bigger way.</p>
          <p>On the SME and Wealth. In both cases I said, we've got the teams in place, what we are engaged with right now, which we will get done by year end, is putting in place the blueprints for growth. I'm a big believer that if you want to get exponential growth, a quantum leap in these businesses, then we cannot just focus on incrementals, we've really got to rethink the architecture and rethink how we're going to do this. We have the right teams engaged right now, the task forces in both putting this together. So hopefully, beginning next year I think we'll be ready to start putting our feet to the pedal on both fronts, on the SME front and on the Wealth front.</p>
          <p>On the Wealth front what we have done in the meantime is that, we've really re-architected our wealth construct. So earlier like a lot of the global, lot of the banks, we ran a private bank business and we ran mass affluent and HNWI [high net worth individual] business in our consumer system and it can sometimes be inefficient because at the end of the day your product offerings, your customer approach, your market research, your active technology platforms are very similar, but you run them separately.</p>
          <p>We really re-architected this and we are also trying to run the wealth space in its entirety, so we can actually benefit from getting better synergies across a spectrum, both from client migration opportunities as well as staff opportunities. So we think that this end-to-end approach of wealth continuum will give us several significant leverage as we start growing this business out next year.</p>
          <p>And finally, in terms of increasing cross-sell efforts, as I said, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making on the treasury and market side. Our business in the last couple of quarters with customers, has grown exponentially. I told you folks last quarter that our business customer pools were 45% between quarter one and quarter two, they're up another 10% from quarter two to quarter three. And the truth is they would have been up a hell of a lot more except that we've decided to get ahead of the game, so we made some changes to our accounting policies. Sok Hui referred to that, got a little more prudent in terms of our valuation reserve policies.</p>
          <p>We figure if we continue to run policies as we had historically, we could have booked another 70 million bucks of income this quarter on customer revenues, but we've just chosen to change our accounting policy to be more conservative and then recognize these income streams over the life of the customer activity, as opposed to recognizing them upfront. So I'm very pleased with how that's going.</p>
          <p>Particularly in Hong Kong, we've done a really good job of being ahead of the curve in the Renminbi internationalization. We feel good about that. Through this year, we already made a big effort on the Renminbi trade settlement side of the business. We've been opening Renminbi trade settlement accounts very rapidly, over 1,000 accounts now in the last two, three months. So we're very active in that space. But what &#x2013; we've been really leaders in the last quarter. As they've liberalized Renminbi into the Hong Kong market, our Renminbi dollar, Renminbi Hong Kong dollar business has just been market leading. So in the last two, three months we've done $18 billion of Renminbi spot. We've done several billion dollars of Renminbi deliverable forward.</p>
          <p>The Renminbi interbank market is &#x2013; volumes are about $300 million a day right now. We are doing somewhere between $50 million and $70 million of that. So in terms of Renminbi interbank market, which is a good gauge, we have about 20% market share of everything happening in the Renminbi interbank market till the last week.</p>
          <p>So a lot of this is not trading, it's all customer flow back. We had &#x2013; and we're being able to do that with customers, not just in Hong Kong but we did a roadshow in Taiwan, week or two ago with huge interest from our Taiwan customers. We've brought the team out of Singapore, huge interest from our Singapore customers. So the fact that we can make the Hong Kong, China connectivity work and the fact that we can do the Renminbi, is really helping us push our customer franchise on the T&amp;M [Treasury and Markets] space. So it's part of the cost to them, I'm quite pleased with.</p>
          <p>I mentioned outside the room just now, we continue to have market-leading position in Singapore on the entire capital market suite. So we're top of the league table for equities, for IPOs, for REITs, for follow-on. We are top of the league table for fixed income Sing dollar. We've actually dramatically improved our M&amp;A position in a regional context as well. I saw a league table which had us up at number seven from number 17 last year, which and that's the Asia-wide league table, that's not bad when you compete with all the big boys in this space.</p>
          <p>So by and large, I'm very comfortable with our cross-sell efforts on this front. We have to do more on the GTS side. On GTS side, we are still building out our product suite, cash management in particular. We are still building out our product suite and that's going to take us into the early part of next year, before we have the product suite complete. We've built out the team, we've built out the selling capacity but there's some more work to do on that front.</p>
          <p>So at least in terms of what we call the enablers, again if you write good about the whole regional management framework and what we've been able to do with that in the course of this year. So I talked about earlier we've got our matrix indiscernible] organization streamlined, we have a country management construct in every country, which is consistent at this point in time. We've established a new Singapore organization and we're slowly working our way into making sure that that is not disruptive, but productive and value added.</p>
          <p>We set up regional policy units for accounting and operations for risk policy, as well as for technology and these units have now started working in terms of standardizing the policies and then taking those standardized policies out into the region. So we can then manage more consistently, as a single unified regional bank. We've put in place a new MIS framework for recognizing client contributions as clients work with us in multiple countries around the region. So we can recognize the bankers who work on these deals and we can recognize the clients for their contribution.</p>
          <p>And we're in the process of finalizing a returns-based performance model. So we made good progress. It's a little soft but hopefully by next year we will have a more durable and more robust model. I think we made good progress on the customer experience. I spoke last time, we've created a customer experience council, that's working well. It focuses on the key areas that we need to improve in a general sense. We are launching a values-based service program come January. We spent a lot of time in the last few months engaging with our people to figure what exactly our service credo should be. I think we will be able to make a dramatic impact when we roll that out.</p>
          <p>And we've focused a lot of this process improvement. And I gave some examples of it the last time, so I won't deliver it. But suffice to say that as I told you we set a very consistent standards for branch queues for example and I'm pleased that four out of the last five months we met those standards, 15 minutes, 80%. It's stuff which we've not been able to do in several years. So it's good that each of these big &#x2013; we call them the big and obvious, and we're currently focused on getting the big and obvious sorted out. We've got about a 100 new ATMs out there, so ATM queues are under control, they're not great, but they're under control.</p>
          <p>And finally the technology front, notwithstanding the July 5th incident, I'm actually very pleased with the progress we're making with technologies. We've got our resiliency plans, I said we have a two year program, we're about halfway through it. Ex-July 5th we've put in more effort, more money and we've put in more of these things, so we're trying to accelerate that.</p>
          <p>We've got a blueprint for our technology roadmap for each of our businesses now done. And we are actively working at doing that. We just rolled our wealth management technology platform in Singapore earlier this week. So we've got a consistent risk management platform now, et cetera, et cetera and so on. We launched an Innovation Council, we're focused on actively thinking about how we get to be more innovative. We're focusing on, as everybody, mobile and payments. But it's not the only thing we're doing. We had a really refreshing presentation this morning at our employee briefing from a young chap who won our *SCAPE, we set up a competition to design a branch, and we threw it open on Facebook to all the young people. And so these two kids who won this thing, one of them came and talked to us. And I'm going to tell you, if he can get the device done, which I hope, by middle of the year, it will redefine how consumer banking, it's like the Apple iStore this will be for banking, right? So we are just trying to be ahead of the curve, I guess, in terms of being innovative. Slide please.</p>
          <p>I just wanted to put this there, I'm not sure I put it up the last. And people asked me a couple of times about our KPIs, and I just wanted to lead this, this is how &#x2013; this is a set of KPIs, the balance scorecard that we set for ourselves. This is what I get evaluated on and the entire team does. If you see, there's about half and half, half of it is traditional metrics, so shareholder value, customer value, employee, we focus on revenue, profits, returns, portfolio risk, cross-sell because it's important to us, customer satisfaction. The bottom half focuses on our nine priorities and this is really more long term. So what do we do to build the franchise, to be able to deliver value in the long term, so that's how it is. And we actually, there is a lot more, we simplified it for this presentation. This is actually quite granular in terms of what we need to do in the subcategory and how we distribute the weights of performance. So I just wanted to put it out there just to give you some sense for how we're trying to build a balanced business, but how we're also evaluating our team in a fairly balanced kind of way.</p>
          <p>That's about what I have from a prepared presentation standpoint. I do want to make a couple of comments to the financials that Sok Hui talked about. The way I think about this thing, our results for the quarter, we have obviously a very strong set of headline results at 722, it's a record quarter for DBS, record in our history. So that's good news.</p>
          <p>If you go under the hood, your first observation of the first level is the headline numbers are good, but interest income is flattish, loan good, looks like it's 1%. Non-interest income &#x2013; fee income is soft, particularly driven by loan and we made a lot of money on other income, particularly selling securities, if you will. And so that's the first thing we're saying here is the quality of the results are very good. And I guess my reflection that is if you go and feel that in only one step more and you look at it one step further down. And Sok Hui made the point on loans.</p>
          <p>We're actually very pleased with our loan growth. Ex the Sing dollar appreciation, our loan growth of close to $6 billion or 6% loan growth is very strong. Sing dollar loan growth at 7% is very strong. And that's why it's resulting in a continued gain in market share in Singapore. And so we're quite pleased with the traction we have in terms of being able to build the customer loan book. As you know, our deposit growth has been more subdued and as I mentioned the last time, there are some conscious choice because we figured that given our deposit surpluses and liquidity surplus, we really don't want to compete in the high cost fixed deposit game.</p>
          <p>And so we're willing to grow our savings account and our cost of balances, but we're not out there competing aggressively for high-cost fees deposits. And therefore, it shows up &#x2013; it's still nevertheless deposits are attractive, particularly in Hong Kong, whereas I mentioned before there is a structural issue in the market with the Chinese banks being very active in that market.</p>
          <p>Our net-net, I think our loan growth has been composed of four business points drop in NIM and given the overall softness and the increasing environment, that's really not to shabby. And so I'm not overly concerned with where our interest income is.</p>
          <p>On the fee income, partly there's a timing issue. Our fee income, a lot of the fee income creation activities that we did will actually wind up deals which are done in October and not in September. But if you look at our whole range of fee income activities are reasonable. Our loan fees are down because in the last quarter we grew loans that are really above normal 12 billion. I had flagged for all of you that time, you're not going to be able to continue, 12 billion growth quarters is going to slow up.</p>
          <p>Where we have work to do is in our fees and things like trade remittances and so on. And that links back to the fact that our whole SME franchise, while it's growing and we're growing market share, the exponential lift we hope to get in that franchise is something that we'll see next year. And that's what will address some of our fee income issues on those couple of lines.</p>
          <p>On the other income, which is what people were focused on, couple of people asked me questions. Now, I really think of my whole treasury and markets business an integrated business, right? So on the one hand, while the trading income looks like it took a drop, there are two elements to that which are important. One is that the customer flow in that is actually very strong. And second element is what Sok Hui alluded to and where I started off, the thing is that in reality, we've been very conservative in terms of our income recognition. We've changed our accounting policies and income recognition to more correctly reflect the duration of some of the customer business that we're doing. And so the adjustment for that explains some of the drop in the trading income. They looked at the customer activity that we did and they failed to compare it on an apples-to-apples basis, the customer activity was substantially stronger than even shows up in this number.</p>
          <p>And on the other &#x2013; what's called the sale of investment thing, the truth is, last quarter was a fantastic time to take gain on fixed income securities, the yields came off so low. Tenure was down at 2.4%. So around the world, anybody who's a smart trader figured that it was a good time to book fixed income. It's not something which I manage, the trade &#x2013; the treasury people manage it. But frankly, if people hadn't taken gains on fixed income when the rates were 2.4, then somebody should be asking why not. It's a good thing to have done.</p>
          <p>So bottom of my message, you go one level further down into our results. I'm actually pleased with the quality of the results that we have, they speak to the strong underlying drivers of the business and I'm quite comfortable that many of the strategic thirst that we have, have indeed started kicking in and they're showing up in our performance. So I'm going to stop there and leave it open for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Gabriel Straitsteins. Just wanted to get a sense on the impact on your net interest margins because of the Fed's QE2, which was bigger than expected, 600, 500. Can we get a sense of it? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gabriel, the thing is the issue is &#x2013; all of this quantitative easing and loose monetary policy, as you will, is resulting in this whole flood of capital into the region and that's going to keep interest rates subdued for a period. And that's true for us, it's true for Singapore and this really was &#x2013; it's still 60% of our business, so it's material for us.</p>
          <p>If you notice, the Aussies raised rates yesterday, the Indians raised rates yesterday. So around the region, how the rest of the central banks going to combat this is by following a tighter monetary policy. They also do prudential regulation, but they get too tight a monetary policy. So the spread issues around the region and certainly some of these countries is beginning to alleviate a bit. But in Singapore, we follow our currency, an exchange rate policy, not an interest rate policy.</p>
          <p>So what this will likely result in is that spreads and NIM is going to continue to stay subdued. Now, which is why I said on context, I'm actually quite pleased that we've been able to hold our NIMs at the levels we have. As I've mentioned before, we've done that principally through getting the right duration. So I think we still have some more capacity to do that. But beyond the point in time, we don't want to go very high, very long in the duration curve and certainly not where the interest rates are right now.</p>
          <p>So we're going to have to start pacing that out a little bit as well. So I'm &#x2013; I can't look at a crystal ball, our projections for the next six to nine months, into the next three quarters, continue to call for subdued interest rates. If you think out longer, if you think out maybe a year from now and that's a toss-up. But certainly if you go beyond that, there's no question that the extent of the deficit in the U.S., both deficit in the U.S., means there's no question that the rates are going to have to move up and move up quite sharply when they start moving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So how long that takes and whether it's a 12, 24, 36-month cycle, it's kind of tough to call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Gula.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, Piyush. Could you give us an idea of what the IPO and your M&amp;A pipeline is likely to be for the next six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I don't know if I can answer that question, off the top. It's a good pipeline, but I don't remember a dollar number -I'm not even sure I would have given you a dollar number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean in terms of that &#x2013; do you think you'll have half a dozen...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, easily, easily. Our pipeline for &#x2013; on the equity space in both Singapore and frankly, now increasingly getting out of Singapore, is quite robust. So if it's a qualitative thing, I can tell you.</p>
          <p>We've &#x2013; as I said, we were &#x2013; if you look at all the trades that happened in Singapore in the last two months, there's only one common factor for every big trade and that's us, we were in every big trade in Singapore. But we have been in the past, some years have been better, some have been worse. Because of our focus on cross-sell, we're now beginning to make sure that everywhere we have a relationship we make sure we get appropriate position on the capital market side.</p>
          <p>What we are more pleased about is that our pipeline is beginning to start spilling up outside of Singapore. So as I mentioned earlier, one of &#x2013; part of our whole mid-cap semi focused, in addition to be anchored around trade finance, we do want to build out our position in the mid-cap space in several markets in the region. We said we'll start with Hong Kong, China and Indonesia. Hong Kong, China, we have &#x2013; already have seven or eight active mandates that we are working on, all mid-cap mandates in this thing. So that's quite good for the last six months of work. We've also now got a couple of mandates out of the Indonesian space, early days, and we are actively marketing beyond Indonesia, now into India, since the Indian companies who want to look at Singapore-based capital raising.</p>
          <p>So I am pleased with the fact that our mid-cap trust in this is beginning to gain some momentum and it's still early days. So I want to caution this thing. It's still early days and while we have the large &#x2013; a reasonable pipeline, I'd rather wait sometime before I start declaring victory on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Syit. You have a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. One, in the presentation, you showed that &#x2013; I was looking at the presentation and on Page 19, it says that the new NPAs have gone up to 552 million. Could you give us color of why this has happened? And what are those new NPA non-performing assets? It's gone up from, say, 115 in the previous quarter and 208 in the third quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And the other question is about housing loan applications. OCBC recently said it's gone down by 20% after the government measures. What are your expectations at what has happened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the NPA, it's a couple of small things. Principally we decided to be &#x2013; again, aggressive about the treatment of one large Middle East &#x2013; our residual Middle East problem exposure, we have one large one, it's actually it hasn't defaulted, it's a performing exposure from that standpoint, we're still continue to earn on it. But the restructuring of that is taking longer than we were anticipating. And so in the interests of being prudent, we decided to reflect it and put it into the NPA bucket.</p>
          <p>If you look at our current percentage of NPAs, it was down at 26, bumped up to 38 because these loans, I see are current loans, right? It's still current from that standpoint. We're just being prudential around it, and the large substantial &#x2013; last or our large substantial Middle East exposure, which is a tricky one.</p>

          <p>Housing loans.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the housing loans, applications have dropped. Quite clearly after the August actions of this thing and I think our experiences around the same that the CBC said this thing. So I think applications are off about 20%, 25% from the August level. Now whether they stay off or whether they pick up and go back, I think it's sometimes a question of when do people adjust to the normal kind of thing. I don't know the answer to that. But the last September, October, both applications have been off.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>From August.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've maintained the Singapore savings amount. I think middle of last month, you &#x2013; almost half the savings rate for all your postbank and so on, will it drop to zero? I mean, it's pathetic, but still...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we didn't postpone it and I don't think we almost halved it. I don't know. We adjusted it to be in line with other banks in Singapore. So I just want to make sure you reflect on this correctly. We were trailing the market and frankly, just honest with it, people asked me early in the year, everybody has dropped rates and given where SIBOR is, we should drop rates and I kept holding off. Because, you know what, we have a responsibility which other people don't. So we kept holding off. But with SIBOR being where it is, we finally said you know what, let's just align with the rest of the market. I really don't see how they can go much lower than where they are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Question Inaudible] .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of being able to continue to grow the fixed rate portion of our loan. That's what I meant, not the weight side. Is that &#x2013; as I mentioned before, if you compare our duration, which is a net life of our loan book versus the net life of our deposit book, DBS's duration is zero.</p>
          <p>If you think about the way commercial banks operate, the notion of commercial bank, commercial banks do two things, and this is 101 of banking, right? You do maturity transformation and you do risk transformation. So maturity transformation is households save with you in the short tenure, you would take that money and then you'd give it out in longer tenure, so you get a yield curve benefit. And risk is obviously households save money with you because they know you and then you give it to people they don't know, so you do a risk transformation.</p>
          <p>Now in the maturity transformation, DBS is zero, which means we're really not doing any maturity transformation. This reflects our huge deposit base and the fact that we are putting it all in the shortest tenures and very liquid. If you look at our competing banks in Singapore, they both have maturity transformation or durations of like 1.5, two years, that's the duration. So we have a lot of capacity to build duration, which means go fixed. There's very little &#x2013; it reflects back on the point that we have a lot of sticky savings account deposits which we never used too intelligently.</p>
          <p>So we have that, the only fly in the ointment is, that this is a bad time in the cycle to go fixed. I mean, the rates are so low, why would you really want to go fixed rate in this thing. It's a fantastic deal for the consumer to take three year or five-year money at today's low rate, but you don't want to overdo it. So we're building duration but very cautiously and carefully, so we don't want to wind up building this, so we still have some capacity to build duration, but we're not going to go overboard with building duration until the rates start turning up. That's what I meant.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sam, you have a question left?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Sam from Dow Jones. You &#x2013; just looking at the loan volume growth in the third quarter, I think, banks, some banks here have been talking about, they were talking about an anticipated slow down in volume growth in the second half, the third quarter though looks fairly healthy. Do have any views on how volume growth is going to head in this quarter that we're in now? And also in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Slower. So, Sam, I was one of the ones &#x2013; end of my meeting the last time, I told people don't expect second half to be anywhere as strong as the first half, because it's got to slow down and it has. And just based on the earlier conversation we had, housing loan applications are down 20% in September, October, so that's going to have some impact. Now, fortunately the way the housing loans thing works, the drawdowns happen based on previous applications, right?. So it's not going to fall 20%, 25% because the few's up, but it's going to start trickling into the loan base for sure.</p>
          <p>So there will be some slow down, next year is a difficult question to answer. We did our budgets and our planning for next year, we've been reasonably aggressive in terms of what we can grow the loan book at for next year because we're still seeing a lot of investment demand from clients, so none of them can do, but in general we've seeing a lot of investment demand for clients who are willing to invest and build out for in general Asian demand. So I'm reasonably optimistic that we'll start seeing more investment in business loan driven activity around the region. So in overall projections, we've kept our loan growth about &#x2013; is it about the same level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Much lower. This year we're going to grow like double digit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, forget the first half, right, so yeah, but I think it is...</p>
