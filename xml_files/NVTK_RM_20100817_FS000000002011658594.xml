        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Oleg. Good evening and welcome to our second-quarter 2010 earnings conference call. I would like to thank everyone for joining us this evening and extend our sincere gratitude for Troika Dialog for hosting and organizing this important conference call.</p>
          <p>As customary, before we begin with the specific conference call details, I would like to refer you to our disclaimer statement. During this conference call, we may make reference to forward-looking statements by using words such as plans, objectives, goals, strategies and other similar words which are other than statements of historical facts. Actual results may differ materially from those implied by such forward-looking statements due to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and reflects our views as of the date of this presentation. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.</p>
          <p>Please refer to our regulatory filings included in our annual review for the year ended the 31st of December, 2009, as well as any of our earnings press releases for more description of the risks that may influence our results.</p>
          <p>For today's conference call, I would like to separate my discussion into two parts. The first part focused on providing our investors and analysts with an operational update for the first-half 2010, as well as some views looking forward; and for the second part, a brief discussion on the financial results during the second-quarter 2010, particularly with a focus on the quarter-on-quarter seasonality effects.</p>
          <p>Let me begin the first part of my discussion by highlighting some of the exploration results we achieved during the first half of 2010. We managed to drill and complete two exploratory wells at the Severo-Russkiy and the Severo-Yamsoveyskiy fields, as well as continued ongoing drilling activities in the Olimpiyskiy license area and the Termokarstovoye field. At the Severo-Russkiy field, we managed to discover five new gas and gas condensate layers, and as a result of these discoveries, our geologists are presently finalizing the approval of the reserves in accordance to Russian reserve classification C1 and C2. We expect that the Severo-Russkiy reserves will be appraised and included in our annual reserve appraisal reports in accordance with international reserve reporting standards prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton.</p>
          <p>For the Severo-Yamsoveyskiy field, we managed to discover two new layers containing gas and gas condensate, and our geologists will continue to praise this field accordingly. At the Termokarstovoye field, where ongoing exploratory drilling continues, we removed and tested core samples from some of the targeted production zones, confirming our geological model of the subsurface. We will continue to work closely with Total's personnel on preparing the field's integrated geological model, as well as to continue exploration activities at the field as required by our licensed terms and conditions.</p>
          <p>We undertook a series of geophysical activities at a number of our fields and license areas as part of our exploration activities. Specifically, we ran and interpreted 200 and 324 square kilometers of 3D seismic at the Yarudeyskoye and the West Yurkharovskoye fields, respectively, which allowed our geologists to analyze subsurface characteristics to determine future drilling targets, as well as 2D seismic at the South Tambeyskoye field.</p>
          <p>At South Tambeyskoye, we ran 320 linear kilometers of 2D seismic over an area of the field known as the transition zone, which is a zone from the present onshore licensed area to offshore. The seismic work was performed to determine the potential resource migration offshore and determine, if any, what levels of future exploratory activities may be required to assess this potential area as an extension to the field.</p>
          <p>We also completed the hydrodynamic model at South Tambeyskoye used by our geologists to better understand the reserve characteristics and pressure dynamics of the field, and upon completing this stage of the work, we are now in the process of finalizing the field development planning. We are presently preparing for some additional exploration drilling on this field during the winter drilling season.</p>
          <p>We also ran and interpreted 3D seismic at the El-Arish field in Egypt, and based on the interpretation, we have identified the primary targets for exploration drilling on the first wildcat well called the El-Arish A1, which we plan to commence drilling in the middle of October 2010.</p>
          <p>The second exploration well is expected to begin drilling toward the end of 2010 or early 2011. We will work closely with our joint venture partners to fulfill the concession's initial contractual obligations during this exploratory phase of work. I would also like to highlight that we have successfully extended the Khancheyskoye license on 2019 to 2044, which essentially covers the economic life of the field. We have now successfully completed the extension of licenses through the economic life of the field for all of our three core producing assets &#x2013; the East-Tarkosalinskoye, Yurkharovskoye and now the Khancheyskoye fields, as well as the South Tambeyskoye field.</p>
          <p>That concludes my brief update on the exploration activities. I would now like to briefly discuss some of the highlights of our development program. As you know, we have some of the best statistics in the global oil and gas industry relating to the efficiency of capital deployment and the corresponding flow rates from our producing wells. Collectively, the combination of these factors has consistently ranked NOVATEK as one of the lowest cost producers in the industry. Obviously, we are very proud of this unique distinction but more importantly it demonstrates the quality of our resource base, the efficient design of our field development program and the close attention we have paid to controlling costs throughout our operations.</p>
          <p>There are a couple of points I'd like to make in this important yet often overlooked area. Firstly, I would like to comment on the production wells completed in the first half of 2010, and then, secondly, I will provide some data on the production and number of wells across all our fields. Hopefully, this information demonstrates the robustness of our producing assets, which ultimately translates into low cost capital intensity, as well as our low future maintenance capital.</p>
          <p>During the first and second quarters of 2010, we completed and launched seven new production wells on the Yurkharovskoye field with initial daily production ranging from 923,000 cubic meters, 33 Mcf per day, to 4.7 million cubic meters or 166 Mcf a day, along with the requisite production of unstable gas condensate. We capitalized approximately RR 2.5 billion to launch these seven wells as part of our depletion cost base, culminated in an average well cost of roughly $11.9 million per completed well.</p>
          <p>Based on the productivity of these new wells relative to the cost to complete, we estimate that the average payback period per well based on the financial results achieved in the second quarter of 2010 ranges from approximately 70 days to 330 days, thus reconfirming our position as one of the most efficient producers in the global oil and gas industry.</p>
          <p>Last year we managed to produce approximately 32.8 billion cubic meters from our three core producing fields, despite the economic crisis, representing a 6.2% year-on-year growth, which was accomplished with 108 producing wells at the East-Tarkosalinskoye field, 22 producing wells at the Khancheyskoye field, and 40 producing wells at the Yurkharovskoye field. The Yurkharovskoye field has been the main driver of production growth and represents the cornerstone of the company's midterm strategy. Production from the Yurkharovskoye field's Valanginian layer has more than doubled since the IPO from 8.4 billion cubic meters to 17.8 billion cubic meters on an increase in a number of operating wells from 13 to 35. We also have five wells producing from the Cenomanian or dry gas layer. The growth in wet gas production has been instrumental in the company's ability to correspondingly grow our gas condensate production and to optimize field development.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we expect the number of producing wells required to grow and sustain production from this key field to essentially double from the current producing well stock, implying relatively low capital intensity based on our present cost structure and absent significant inflationary pressures. We believe the company will continue maintaining its cost competitiveness on our core producing fields vis-&#xE0;-vis the global oil and gas industry, as well as demonstrating the low maintenance capital cost to sustain present production levels as borne out by the recent levels of invested capital at our legacy assets.</p>
          <p>During the first half of 2010, we invested approximately RR 12.3 billion in capital expenditures, representing a 41.7% increase over the corresponding 2009 period, of which RR 10 billion was spent on the Yurkharovskoye infrastructure and second phase field development. Besides completing the seven new operating wells as previously mentioned, we also completed a series of infrastructure-related activity at our field aimed at enhancing the efficiencies of our operation.</p>
          <p>Namely, we completed and launched a 40,000 ton methanol unit at the Yurkharovskoye field, thus increasing the methanol capacity at the field to 52,000 tons, which provides enough methanol production for all of our four field operations. We will transport the produced methanol via the new 326 kilometer unstable gas pipeline to the Purovsky processing plant where it will be separated and transported onwards to the East-Tarkosalinskoye field. Methanol is presently used to reduce condensation in the pipeline, and as a result of launching this facility, we expect to decrease our third-party purchases classified in our operating expenses by approximately RR 620 million, which will be partially offset by internally generated costs such as electricity, labor, transport and materials.</p>
          <p>We also launched and completed a 3 million ton de-ethanization unit, which allowed us to construct a smaller diameter pipeline to transport unstable gas condensate from the Yurkharovskoye field to the Purovsky processing plant. The utilization of our own facility allows us to optimize the production of unstable gas condensate relative to de-ethanized gas at the field, while minimizing process and output and line losses, which we experienced as a result of using third-party facilities. We estimate reducing third-party charges by approximately RR 370 million during the remainder of 2010 with the launch of the de-ethanization unit and the unstable gas condensate pipeline.</p>
          <p>Other capital-related projects during the period included completing the compressor booster station at the East-Tarkosalinskoye field to maintain current production levels of gas and gas condensate in the valanginian layer, the construction of a 10,000 cubic meter storage facility at the Purovsky plant to store raw materials for de-ethanized gas condensate, and ongoing land preparation activities and design work at the Ust-Luga facility. We plan to increase our capital expenditure for the Ust-Luga project over the next two years, and we expect the initial 3 million ton gas fractionation unit and related terminal facilities to be operationally ready by late 2012.</p>
          <p>I would like to spend a few minutes now discussing some updates on Yamal LNG, the recent acquisition of 100% of Tambeyneftegas and Malo-Yamalskoye field and the recent announcement of a 50-50 joint venture with Gazprom Neft called Yamal Development. We are presently working on the pre-FEED stage, which stands for front-end engineering and design, at Yamal LNG, which we expect to be completed towards the end of the first-quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>After conducting a series of meetings and discussions with contractors on various project design options, one of the most interesting outcomes from the work performed on this pre-FEED stage is significant deviations in initial cost estimates, approximately around plus or minus 30%. The substantial deviations are one of the main reasons why we are reluctant to discuss potential capital expenditures on the project until such time as we concluded this crucial stage of work. Once completed, we will have more concrete information on a conceptual design and type of facilities providing a more defined scope of work for contractors to bid.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we are still undertaking proprietary work at the field to continue moving forward with planned activities. The Russian government also recently considered a future development of the Yamal Peninsula, including our Yamal LNG project, and based on the outcomes of these meetings, we expect a governmental decree to be adopted by the end of 2010. It is very important that we understand the government's commitment supporting the future development of this hydrocarbon-rich area.</p>
          <p>For these two main reasons, we have temporarily suspended our discussions with strategic partners until we get more clarity on these important issues. I had previously mentioned that the participants to our tender have expressed clarity on a number of important topics, including the government's support for this project. The concerns raised by potential strategic partners on these important points are fully aligned with our own view. Up to today we are pleased with the detailed discussions we have conducted with potential strategic partners and the terms and conditions offered for an equity stake in the project. The commitments offered by the strategic partners demonstrate to us their serious intent and interest in this large-scale LNG project, and we look forward to renewing our partner selection process once some of the aforementioned issues are resolved.</p>
          <p>Final investment decision on the Yamal LNG project should be taken towards the end of 2012 or early 2013. The acquisition of Tambeyneftegas for U.S. $10 million was originally discussed as part of the overall agreement when we acquired the South Tambeyskoye field, but a subsequent decision was made to exclude this entity from the initial transaction, although the purchase price to acquire the asset was already agreed upon. The Malo-Yamalskoye field reserve base of 161 billion cubic meters of natural gas and 14.4 million tons of gas condensate or approximately 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, is fairly established in terms of the Russian reserve classification C1 and C2, thus making this acquisition accretive to the shareholders of NOVATEK at current reserve multiples. We have established an exploration plan on this field for the next three years and will begin work activities in 2011.</p>
          <p>We also recently announced the establishment of Yamal Development, a 50:50 joint venture with Gazprom Neft with the primary aim of developing new oil, gas and condensate fields in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous region. We felt that Gazprom Neft offers a joint venture direct with professional experience in oilfield development and refining and marketing, whereas we contribute our expertise in gas and gas condensate development, processing and marketing. We believe the professional experience of our respective teams provides the necessary synergies to consider new marketing and development opportunities that are mutually beneficial to both companies, some of which we may not have considered individually due to the oil characteristics of the targeted reservoirs.</p>
          <p>Strategically, our goal is to undertake projects to continue growing our gas and gas condensate production as well as expand on our processing and marketing capabilities. The ability to facilitate this strategic goal through joint development of oil, gas and gas condensate projects that are mutually beneficial to the joint venture achieves this aim.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the ability to improve the operational utilization of the Purovsky processing plant and eventually the new gas condensate fractionation and terminal facility at Ust-Luga once it is completed is completely consistent with our strategic objective of enhancing downstream margins in our liquid value chain. We will provide more updates on the activities of this joint venture on subsequent conference calls.</p>
          <p>Demand for natural gas on the Russian domestic market has shown signs of improvement relative to 2009, despite some seasonal weaknesses in May and June, and as such, we continue to believe that domestic demand will recover quicker vis-&#xE0;-vis the pre-crisis levels. Despite recent signs of a slowdown in industrial output, largely caused by the excessive heat wave, the overall statistics confirm year-on-year growth in domestic GDP and power generation consumption.</p>
          <p>Our natural gas production over the first-half 2010 has increased by 2.4 billion cubic meters or by 15.3% over the prior period, thus representing a continued growth in our production profile. The production growth achieved so far this year is not skewed by lower 2009 production levels, stemming from the effects of the economic downturn. Instead, we have continued to maintain higher production levels throughout the seasonal trough period as compared to the prior year, and based on the production levels achieved to date, I can confirm that we will achieve the higher end of our production guidance for 2010, assuming normal weather patterns for the remainder of the year. Our natural gas production output for the first half of 2010 averaged 102 million cubic meters per day or 3.6 Bcf per day.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from continued and/or sustained economic recovery in the Russian domestic market, and correspondingly we are presently preparing our natural gas contracts for the upcoming year. Based on these positive economic trends supporting domestic demand recovery, combined with the fact that we will be adding an additional 7 billion cubic meters to our production capacity in October of this year, we are now in a position to provide to you this evening with our production guidance for 2011.</p>
          <p>We are forecasting 2011 natural gas production growth of approximately 12% over 2010 levels, and based on this forecasted growth, we will continue to grow our gas condensate production at comparable volumes we achieved in 2010. These forecasts are predicated on the assumptions of continued economic recovery in the Russian domestic market, as well as normal seasonal weather patterns.</p>
          <p>During the first half of 2010, we increased our total production of liquid hydrocarbons by 272,000 tons or by 18.5%, driven primarily by continued strong production growth of 38.6% at the Yurkharovskoye field. Even though we had a combined 1.5 billion cubic meters reduction in natural gas production between the first and second quarters of 2010, we still managed to increase our liquid productions, mainly unstable gas condensate, quarter on quarter by increasing natural gas production at the Yurkharovskoye field by 145 million cubic meters and decreasing output at other fields, again demonstrating how we optimize field production and, hence, our financial results.</p>
          <p>The expansion of our liquid production and the further penetration of new markets is a key element in our corporate strategy, and as such, we officially dispatched the first high tonnage tanker to navigate the Northern route. The Aframax vessel, Baltica, owned and operated by Sovcomflot with dead weight capacity of over 100,000 tons was dispatched from the Murmansk port carrying the consignment of approximately 70,000 tons of stable gas condensate destined to the Asian Pacific region. The tanker will be accompanied by icebreaking support provided by Russia's Atomflot and will represent a significant milestone for being the first tanker of hydrocarbon to navigate the Arctic Ocean's Northern sea route. Moreover, the strategic importance of this high tonnage voyage will facilitate future development of the Arctic regions, as well as provide future logistical and commercial support for our LNG project.</p>
          <p>I would like to now move on to the second part of my conference call and talk about the financial results for the second-quarter and first-half 2010. Let's begin by discussing the effects of seasonality on our oil and gas revenues. We have consistently highlighted the seasonal variations in our natural gas production and sales by stating that we peaked during the first and fourth quarters, the winter season, and we troughed during the second and third quarter, the summer months. We have not deviated significantly from these seasonal patterns since we began publishing our financial results to the investment community. So if we look at the decrease between the first and second quarters of 2010, it is definitely more pronounced disparate because of the very cold winter we had this past year combined with the shift in our sales mix towards more power generation.</p>
          <p>The first-quarter 2010 also represented the first time that we exceeded 10 billion cubic meters in sales volumes. If you look back at our sales volume in the corresponding 2009 period, power generation as a percentage of end customer sales represented 58% and 32% in the first and second quarters respectively, which is significantly lower than the 73% and 76% penetration we achieved in the corresponding 2010 periods.</p>
          <p>Another point I would like to highlight relates to the change in our underground storage position. During the first quarter of 2010, we withdrew approximately 272 million cubic meters of gas from underground storage to meet our contractual sales obligation. Conversely, in the second quarter of 2010, we injected approximately 358 million cubic meters into underground storage, thus reporting a net change of 640 million cubic meters between the respective reporting periods. Our balance in underground storage at the 30th of June stood at approximately 829 million cubic meters.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, I would like to make a few brief observations on average realized prices and transportation. We do not anticipate large variations in our average realized prices throughout 2010 since the FTS tariffs are expected to increase only once in 2010, which already occurred effective in January. Last year they were adjusted four separate times.</p>
          <p>Despite this fact, our average netbacks will continue to change slightly quarter on quarter based on the sales mix and transport distance. Between the first and second quarters of 2010, our average netback for end customers' sales decreased by 0.006 or marginally from RR 1,205 per 1000 cubic meters to RR 1,198 per 1000 cubic meters respectively. The change in our average transport distance was also marginal between periods, decreasing from 1951 kilometers to 1944 or by 7 kilometers, meaning that the primary difference between reporting periods was solely related to the changes in our regional deliveries of natural gas.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter of 2010, our proportion of sales to customers in the regions of Sverdlovsk and Orenburg with higher transport costs increased as a percentage of our total natural gas sales, which was partially offset by proportionately higher sales to the Chelyabinsk region with lower transport costs.</p>
          <p>I have repeatedly stated that one of our key commercial trading KPIs is maximizing product netbacks rather than averaged realized prices. For example, we delivered a little less than one quarter of our sales volumes to the Perm region, which is why we established a subsidiary in this region to further penetrate this important industrial market. The average netback we received for this important industrial region was higher than the overall total average netback we received during the second period by approximately 8%, again demonstrated that our netbacks varied depending on the mix of the customers, regional markets and transport distances despite any topline pricing concessions we may consider to grow potential market share. Our focus is on maximizing our netbacks.</p>
          <p>Sales of natural gas to end customers were 65.7% in the second quarter as compared to 60.3% in the first quarter. I want to again emphasize the commercial importance of maximizing a proportion of end customer sales and our overall natural gas sales mix because the underlying commercial strategy continues to be missed.</p>
          <p>The more we control the amount of natural gas sold to end customers, the better we control our operations. Last year, for instance, during the height of the economic crisis, we were able to continue growing our natural gas production, whereas those companies relying solely on ex-field sales to traders were curtailed. As a result, we were able to continue growing our gas condensate output, thus optimizing our revenues and margins. The netback trade-off between the first and second quarters was approximately RR 25 per thousand cubic meters or less than $1.00 on the differential volumes sold ex-field versus the end customers, which, by the way, is really only a theoretical argument because we cannot control the volumes sold by traders. More importantly, we can control the volumes sold to end customers.</p>
          <p>Overall, we're very pleased with the seasonally adjusted financial results achieved for our natural gas business. The average realized price for end customer sales during the first and second quarters were in line with our price expectations vis-&#xE0;-vis the general tariff increase and the regional geographical mix of our primary customer base.</p>
          <p>Our total volumes sold for liquids increased by 20% or by approximately 137,000 tons as compared to the first-quarter 2010. Specifically, we increased the volume of stable gas condensate sold quarter on quarter from 412,000 tons to 539,000 tons or by 30.8%, of which we recognized approximately 111,000 tons of stable gas condensate that was previously recorded as in transit. We also managed to marginally increase our volumes sold for LPG and crude oil by 6000 tons and 4000 tons respectively.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we increased the volume of stable gas condensate in transit and storage by approximately 55,000 tons, culminating in a period ending inventory balance of 332,000 tons at the 30th of June as compared to 277,000 tons at the end of the first quarter. At June 30, 2009, we had period ending inventory volumes of 172,000 tons, representing a year-on-year increase of 160,000 tons or by 93%. We dispatched 10 tankers carrying approximately 596,000 tons from the Vitino Sea Port Terminal, of which four tankers or 40.3% of the volumes dispatched were destined to the U.S. market as compared to seven tankers or 77.4% in the first quarter 2010. The remaining tankers were evenly dispatched to Brazil, Singapore and China. Therefore, we had no tanker sales to the European markets in the second quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>Our Purovsky processing plant operated at 67% of its rated capacity with a total plant output reaching 825,000 tons comprised of 595,000 tons of stable gas condensate and 230,000 tons of LPG. During the first quarter 2010, our average processing plant utilization was approximately 65%.</p>
          <p>One of the most notable differences in our liquid sales year-on-year was the continued increase in commodity prices between the respective periods which positively impacted our liquid netbacks. Our average export netbacks on a U.S. dollar basis for stable gas condensate and LPG volumes sold during the period increased year-on-year by approximately 8.8% and 98.8% respectively, despite increases in both export duties and average transportation expenses.</p>
          <p>In comparison to the first quarter 2010, however, our average export netback for stable gas condensate and LPG decreased by 2.4% and 1.7% respectively, largely attributable to increases in transport and export duties of stable gas condensate and a reduction in the contract price for export and domestic sales of LPG.</p>
          <p>For stable gas condensate, we sold 536,000 tons, realizing an average netback per ton of $292 in the second quarter 2010 as compared to $268 per ton in the second quarter 2009 and $299 per ton in the first quarter 2010. The reduction in quarter-on-quarter netbacks of approximately $7 per ton was largely attributable to a 5.4% increase in export duties and a 3.4% increase in transport charges, which was partially offset by a 1.6% increase in the average contractual price period-on-period.</p>
          <p>For LPG, we managed to significantly increase our year-on-year average export netback by $187 per ton on sales volume of 115,000 tons, whereas our quarter-on-quarter comparatives showed a reduction in our average export net price by $7 per ton on an equivalent sales volume basis. This quarter-on-quarter reduction was largely due to a reduction in the average contractual price we received, which was partially offset by the application of the rail and export duty concessions. Domestically, we had a slight reduction in both volumes and average netback received. There were no sales of LPG to the CIS countries during the reporting periods. The export netbacks, we received for our liquid products were reasonably consistent quarter-on-quarter and again fully in line with price expectations and market conditions.</p>
          <p>Overall, we are pleased with the strength of our liquid business in the second quarter 2010, despite the buildup in stable gas condensate volumes in transit during the period, which have been recognized as revenues in the third quarter. Volumes in transit are essentially a timing difference in revenue recognition. Unfortunately, we expect to continue experiencing volatility in our transit volumes period-on-period as we move products across a diverse geographical area.</p>
          <p>Our total operating expenses increased year-on-year in absolute terms from RR 15 billion to RR 15.7 billion, but decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 65% to 61.1%. However, for the remaining discussions on operating costs during this conference call, I will primarily focus all my attention between quarter-on-quarter comparatives.</p>
          <p>Total operating expenses decreased by approximately RR 200 million between the first and second quarters, but increased as a percentage of total revenues from 57.5% to 61.1%, largely due to the decrease in total revenues. One of the primary differences between our operating expenses quarter-on-quarter was the overall impact on total operating expenses due to volumetric changes, which reduced some of the variable-related expenses that one would expect.</p>
          <p>For example, our total volumes sold to end customers decreased by 904 million cubic meters or 14.8%, which meant that we had a corresponding reduction in transportation expenses, even though our end customers sales as a percentage of total sales increased quarter-on-quarter from 60.3% to 65.7%. Furthermore, we had a slight reduction in our average transport distance by 7 kilometers, which also reduced transportation expense during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Conversely, our liquid transportation expense increased quarter-on-quarter on more volumes sold, but a portion of the expense category, or approximately RR 154 million, was recaptured in the change in inventory adjustment for the period and will be recognized in operating expenses when a product reaches its intended destination. We also had a similar adjustment of RR 126 million to operating expenses for the increase in our inventory balances of natural gas. The same sort of volumetric analysis can be applied to the variable nature of our taxes other than income.</p>
          <p>For example, quarter-on-quarter, we reduced natural gas production by 1.6 billion cubic meters or by 16%, which reduced the variable mineral extraction tax burden between periods. The only real notable change between the first and second quarters was the introduction of the excise and fuel tax we incurred for movements of LPG into Poland through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NOVATEK Polska, which amounted to RR 56 million in the second quarter. All other changes in the tax balance were considered immaterial.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we do not experience anything unusual with our non-controllable expense items between the respective quarters that are not explainable either by the effects of seasonality, inventory in transit, or changes in volumes produced and/or sold. The increase in material serviced into other operating expense by RR 192 million during the second quarter was largely attributable to employee compensation and materials and supplies, which accounted for roughly 90% of the change between periods. Employee compensation accounted for RR 49 million of the change, whereas materials and supplies accounted for the remaining RR 123 million.</p>
          <p>The main reasons for the quarter-on-quarter increase in employee compensation relates to the expensing of RR 59 million for repair and maintenance work on employees housing located in the far north, included as part of their overall compensation package and a payment of bonuses in the amount of RR 16 million, which was partially offset by a reduction of head count and related salaries of RR 26 million.</p>
          <p>We expect to periodically incur expenses relating to ongoing repair and maintenance activities through the renovation and general appearance to the employees housing complexes located at our field sites to ensure that these facilities are adequately maintained. The quarter-on-quarter increase in our materials and supply expense line item was solely due to the purchase of the more expensive raw materials for the feed stock used in the production of polymer products, namely BOPP film wrap. Correspondingly, we also managed to increase our revenues from the sale of polymer products by RR 142 million or by 30.3% as compared to the first quarter 2010, largely attributable to the sale of BOPP film wrap.</p>
          <p>Each quarter there seems to be much attention paid to our general administrative expenses, even though, we consider this important expense category to be well controlled by senior management and does not fluctuate dramatically period-on-period. Specifically, the focus tends to center on employee compensation. So, as usual, I will attempt to alleviate concerns that our employee compensation is not excessive for the scope of our business or the stellar results that we have achieved.</p>
          <p>We increased our general and administrative expenses, or G&amp;A, by RR 168 million or by 11.5% between the respective periods. Within this expense category, we had various fluctuations between different line items during the reporting periods, some of which we considered immaterial. Our employee compensation expenses increased quarter-on-quarter by RR 163 million, accounting for approximately 3.9% of our total revenues for the period as compared to 3% in the first quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>For the sake of full disclosure, employee compensation represented 3.3% and 3.1% in the first and second quarters of 2009, respectively, when all salaries were frozen and held constant during the crisis.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we increased our total head count by nine employees to 1,027, which are expensed within this G&amp;A category. Although the absolute number is relatively small, the largest increase in our head count was due to the startup of NOVATEK's new research center in the Tyumen region, which increased its respective head count by 22 employees, as well as increasing other general operating expenses as part of this startup.</p>
          <p>The primary reasons for the increase in salary and employee compensation was the increase in bonus payments based on the 2009 results and the initiation of the share-based compensation as part of our long-term employee motivation program, which excludes members of the management board.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we expensed RR 86 million to employee compensation for the share-based program, which was initiated during the quarter. Moreover, we paid an additional RR 107 million in bonus payments in the second quarter as a result of finalizing our year-end financial results in March 2010, which were offset by a reduction in miscellaneous social payments included in compensation, thus accounting for the net increase in the period of RR 163 million. It is our intention to continue paying our employees annual and semiannual bonuses based on the financial performance of the company, as well as periodic inflation, wage adjustments.</p>
          <p>During the recent economic crisis, we asked all of our employees to make personal sacrifices in terms of salary freezes, reductions in some of the social benefits, and other cost control initiatives. Each and every one of our employees fully understood the need for the company to remain profitable and focus on cost control during this difficult period. They made a personal sacrifice in the best interest of NOVATEK despite a large portion of our employees living in climatic harsh conditions throughout the year. Moreover, providing a portion of our employees' total compensation package and share-based compensation or any other incentives linked to the creation of shareholder value is considered best practices and should be considered positive by our shareholders as this aligns our respective interests.</p>
          <p>Effective July 1, 2010, we made a 10% companywide inflationary wage adjustment, which represents a partial recovery from frozen salaries in 2009, and this is the first wage adjustment for employees at NOVATEK's headquarters in three years. Within our other operating expense categories, we increased our compensation paid to members of the Board of Directors as recently improved at our annual general meeting of shareholders on the 28th of April, 2010, as well as increase the compensation paid to members of the company's revision committee, which was also approved at the same AGM.</p>
          <p>The company has grown in size and complexity over the years and is necessary for us to attract and maintain qualified candidates to the board, as well as compensate them for their active participation in board committees. As for members of the revision committee, the increase in our annual compensation was completely justified on the increased scope of the review activities across NOVATEK and its subsidiaries. Also, within this expense category, other expenses accounted for RR 40 million or 35.7%, largely comprised of miscellaneous bank charges and the cost of maintaining a bank guarantee with the Bank of Moscow as part of the acquisition of Yamal LNG, which expires on the 27th of August.</p>
          <p>Although depreciation, depletion and amortization, or DD&amp;A, decreased quarter-on-quarter by RR 53 million, the actual per barrel of oil equivalent unit cost used in the unit-of-production method increased from RR 19.6 per barrel of oil equivalent to RR 22 per barrel of oil equivalent, largely due to the capitalization of an additional RR 6 billion to the cost depletion base. We fully expect that the depletion cost base will continue to increase over the course of the year as we capitalize costs to our oil/gas properties each period, which is fully explained in our MD&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Our exploration expense increased quarter-on-quarter by RR 204 million or 158%, largely due to the geophysical and geological work at our fields and license areas and is consistent with our accounting policy to expense these type of activities in the period incurred.</p>
          <p>As mentioned above in my summary of work activities over the course of the first half 2010, I mentioned that we ran and interpreted a series of 2D and 3D seismic. This type of work activity is a charge against profit and loss statement in the period incurred.</p>
          <p>As a result of the factors enumerated above, our EBITDA and net profit margins have remained healthy and consistent with our financial guidance, despite contracting relative to the record results we achieved in the first quarter of 2010. Our profits from our operations decreased quarter-on-quarter from RR 13.4 billion to RR 10 billion, largely due to the recognition of a RR 1.6 billion gain on disposal in the first quarter 2010 and the corresponding reduction of our oil/gas revenues due to seasonal adjustments for natural gas and a buildup of inventories for our stable gas condensate.</p>
          <p>Our net profits between periods continues to be positively or negatively affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Russian ruble relative to the U.S. dollar and the application in foreign exchange movements to a portion of our debt position denominated in U.S. dollars. During the second quarter, the Russian ruble depreciated against the U.S. dollar by 6.2%, resulting in a non-cash foreign exchange loss of RR 1.1 billion, whereas our first quarter net profits were positively aided by a RR 646 million non-cash foreign exchange gain. Our balance sheet and liquidity positions continue to remain strong throughout the second quarter of 2010, although we increased our debt position in the second quarter relative to our year-end balances in the first quarter of 2010, largely due to deplacement of a RR 10 billion bond in June 2010, as well as some minor drawdowns on some of our credit lines.</p>
          <p>We decided to place our debut ruble bond to extend the maturities of our existing loan portfolio, as well as reducing the cost of financing on our Russian denominated debt. We accomplished these aims with the successful placement of our Russian ruble bonds with the majority of three years and a coupon rate of 7.5%. Post balance sheet, we repaid the RR 5 billion Sberbank loan facility in full and made a scheduled payment of $114 million to our syndicated loan in July 2010. We will continue to service our syndicate loan facility and other debt facilities as they mature.</p>
          <p>We also received a corporate investment grade rating of BBB stable outlook by Standard &amp; Poor's during the period, and now have corporate investment grade ratings from all three of our credit reporting agencies. And finally, we continue to remain free cash flow positive during the first and second quarters of 2010.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we have delivered another solid quarter of financial operational results, completely in line with the seasonality trends of our natural gas business. Our ability to continue growing our production is directly linked to the continued recovery of domestic demand, as well as the normal seasonal weather patterns.</p>
          <p>Tonight I was able to provide you with our initial guidance for 2011 natural gas production, which continues to underscore the fundamental growth story of the company. I trust our shareholders understand that senior management is focused on controlling costs throughout our business operations, despite period-on-period fluctuations in particular line items that we feel are justifiable and explainable for the size and growth of our business, and that you also understand that from time to time, we will make the necessary adjustments to wages and compensation packages to our valued employees because we expect to maintain a dedicated and highly competent workforce that fulfills the strategic objective that we have outlined for NOVATEK.</p>
          <p>The results achieved during the first half 2010 attest to the strength, viability and operating leverage of our business model and reflects positively on the strategic and operating decisions entrusted to senior management to create sustainable shareholder value. We continue to remain highly confident in the future prospects of NOVATEK and the growth strategy that we have adopted.</p>
          <p>I would like to end this portion of the conference call and open the session to questions and answers. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You guided for 12% year-on-year gas production growth, and what level is this growth stenciled against 37 or 38 billion cubic meters? And the second related question is, given that you provided guidance fairly early in the year, should we assume that these volumes have already been contracted to your end customers, traders and as well agreed upon with the owner of the pipe? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to the first part of the question is based on achieving at least 37 billion cubic meters by the end of the year. Again, it's dependent on the remaining weather patterns for this upcoming peak season. We, as I mentioned, are also finalizing the contracting process, and yes, we have agreed to transport side of the volumes delivered.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is unfortunate that we're experiencing this difficulty, but I hope the text of the presentation answers a lot of the questions that were raised in your reviews. We try to follow a pattern by addressing some of the major changes between the period that we felt that were of an interest to our shareholders and the analytical community.</p>
          <p>I just want to again reiterate that we believe that the results achieved to date were completely in line with what we expected seasonally adjusted, as well as the results of &#x2013; or the expenses that we acquired, excuse me, in our operating expenses as they were also seasonally adjusted. The large increases that you saw mostly in employee compensation, I believe, were fully explainable, and I think they are completely in line with our business.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, do you have any specific questions on the operating side of the business as it relates to expenses, Oleg?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello gentlemen, can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you can discuss CapEx, maintenance CapEx going forward after you built infrastructure on the Yurkharovskoye field, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, if you look at the production and the contribution from the East-Tarkosalinskoye and the Khancheyskoye field, for two consecutive quarters, we spent about $7 million each, the ruble equivalent of $7 million each on both of these periods. I don't expect that we'll continue to see significant increases in any capital expenditures to these particular fields. But we will undertake some additional drilling activity at Khancheyskoye to ramp up production to the field level of abut 5.6, 5.7 bcm.</p>
          <p>So theoretically, on that perspective, the intensity to maintain revenues generated from that particular field are quite low. I've kind of alluded, you can do the math, if you assume that we added seven wells at approximately $11.9 million per well, add a little inflation, you can theoretically back in that the overall remaining capital expenditure program at Yurkharov field should be in the tune of about $500 million, give or take 10% either way in terms of the additional capital. So I mean that should just support, going forward, that continuously maintaining production at these levels and drilling a few wells from time to time, the ongoing maintenance capital to sustain the full field to production will correspondingly be low.</p>

          <p>All right, Oleg, I guess, there's really nothing we can do about it. Again, I apologize, everybody, for the technical glitch. And if you have any questions that you were unable to get asked during this particular conference call, as Oleg suggested, please send them to us, and we'll answer all questions. And we'll post the questions that were asked by everybody on the website so that it's available to everybody so they can see what the questions and answers were, okay?</p>
          <p>Again, Oleg, thank you very much, and it's unfortunate we had this glitch. But hopefully that the information provided tonight clarifies some of the differences, and I also believe that the guidance that we provided tonight again continues to demonstrate the strong growth story of NOVATEK.</p>
          <p>So I guess at that point we should just end the call.</p>
