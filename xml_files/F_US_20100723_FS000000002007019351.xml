        <plist>
          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Towanda and I will be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Brian Harris, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Towanda, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us today, either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning.</p>

Also in attendance are Bob Shanks, Vice President and Controller, Neil Schloss, Vice President and Treasurer, Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting, and K.R. Kent, Ford Credit CFO.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Copies of this morning's press release and the presentation slides that we'll be using today have been posted on Ford's investor and media website for your reference. The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q.</p>
          <p>The financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the Appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made here. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly and current reports.</p>
          <p>With that, I would now like to turn the presentation over to Ford's President and CEO, Mr. Alan Mulally.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brian, and good morning to everyone.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased today to report very solid financial results for the second quarter, which we underscore &#x2013; which underscores our One Ford plan is clearly working.</p>
          <p>Ford earned a pre-tax operating profit 2.9 billion for the quarter, as each of our major business operations around the world posted improved profits compared to last year and the first quarter of 2010. We generated positive automotive operating related cash flow of 2.6 billion and strengthened our balance sheet, paying down $7 billion of debt and lowering our interest costs. At the same time, we're increasing our investments to support greater growth in the future.</p>
          <p>Overall, we are headed where we thought we'd be after this excellent first half. We clearly remain on track to deliver solid profits and positive automotive operating related cash flow for 2010, and we expect even better results in 2011.</p>
          <p>The driving forces behind our progress include our new products and our leaner global structure. We have developed what we and many others believe is our finest ever product line-up, a full family of vehicles with world-class quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart design, and the best value.</p>
          <p>I will start off this morning by providing you with an overview of our financial results and business, product, and sales highlights. Then Lewis Booth will walk us through the financial results in even greater detail. Finally, I will summarize our 2010 outlook and our plan going forward.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 3, I will begin by reviewing the key financial results compared with a year ago. As we mentioned last quarter, based on our agreement to sell Volvo, all of our Volvo's 2010 results are reported as special items and excluded from our wholesales revenue and operating results. 2009 results include Volvo.</p>
          <p>As shown on the top of the slide, second quarter vehicle wholesales were 1.4 million units, up 224,000 units. The increase was explained by higher wholesales in all of our automotive segments, offset partially by the exclusion of Volvo. Excluding Volvo for 2009, the wholesale increase was 303,000 units or 27%.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter revenue was $31.3 billion, a 4.5 billion increase. The increase was explained primarily by higher volumes, favorable net pricing, and a favorable exchange translation, offset partially by the exclusion of Volvo. Excluding Volvo from 2009, the revenue increase was $7.4 billion or over 30% increase.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, was 2.9 billion, a 3.5 billion improvement. Automotive results improved by 3.2 billion and Financial Services improved by 280 million.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter net income attributable to Ford, including unfavorable pre-tax special items of 95 million, was $2.6 billion, a 338 million improvement. For the first half, pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, was about $5 billion, a 7.5 billion improvement, and net income attributable to Ford was 4.7 billion, about a $3.9 billion improvement.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with 21.9 billion of Automotive gross cash, up $1.5 billion from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Slide four details some of our key business highlights since our last earnings release. During the quarter, we repaid $7 billion in Automotive debt, including about 3.8 billion to the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust or VEBA. In addition, we repaid $3 billion of our revolving credit facility earlier in the quarter. These actions will save Ford more than 470 million in interest costs on an annualized basis.</p>
          <p>Ford was recognized as a leader in relationships with its suppliers by key third-party studies, including being awarded number one in a UBS Investment Research Quarterly Survey of OEM supplier relations in the United States for a second consecutive quarter.</p>
          <p>We also announced several investments aimed at continuing to strengthen our global business going forward. In Thailand, we announced a 450 million investment in a state-of-the-art flexible passenger vehicle manufacturing plant. We also announced a $250 million investment in Argentina, in order to outfit our Pacheco plant. We announced a 135 million investment to design, engineer, and produce key components in Michigan for our next generation hybrid electric vehicles that go into production in 2012. And last month, we announced a plan to discontinue production of the Mercury brand in the fourth quarter of this year, allowing us to increase our focus on the company's core brands in North America.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 5 please, we'll look at Ford's product highlights since our last our earnings release.</p>
          <p>Ford continues to receive affirmation from third parties with regards to quality of our products. In June, Ford ranked as the top non-luxury brand in J.D. Power and Associates' closely watched Initial Quality Study for the U.S. market. We received 7 top safety picks in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Awards for the 2010 model year, tying the highest mark for the industry.</p>
          <p>On the brand front, we committed to focus more on the Lincoln brand, including 7 all new or significantly refreshed models in the next 4 years.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we revealed a freshened Mondeo in Europe with a restyled exterior and an upgraded interior. Mondeo is leading the way in our revolution under the hood in Europe, as it will receive a new high-efficiency EcoBoost gasoline and TDCi diesel powertrains.</p>
          <p>We also announced our plan to begin delivering the Transit Connect Electric to European customers in late summer of 2011. Also in Europe, we launched a limited edition Focus RS 500 high performance model, and it quickly sold out. And in Thailand, we began the production of the Fiesta for Southeast Asian markets, representing the latest milestone in the vehicle's successful global launch.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 6, we'll look at Ford's sales highlights since our last earnings release. We are very encouraged by our continuing market share gains in the United States. During the quarter, we posted a 21% year-over-year sales increase and gained a half point of market share, driven by the strong retail market performance of our products, including the F-Series, the Taurus, and the Transit Connect.</p>
          <p>In the Asia-Pacific and Africa region, we posted a 27% year-over-year sales increase, including a 20% increase in China. Transit, Mondeo, and our small car lineup remain strong performers in this region. We reported record quarterly sales in India, more than tripling sales due to strong initial demand for our Ford Figo. The vehicle, launched earlier this year, received 25,000 orders in its first 100 days on the market.</p>
          <p>And in Canada, we strengthened our leadership position, expanding market share to 17.5% during the period, up 2.1 percentage points from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to turn over to Lewis to provide more detail on our second quarter financial results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alan.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to slide 8 to summarize our financial results compared with a year ago. Our second quarter pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, was $2.9 billion, a $3.5 billion improvement. Most of the remaining slides will focus on these pre-tax operating results.</p>
          <p>Our pre-tax operating profit excluded unfavorable special items of $95 million, which we'll cover on the next slide.</p>
          <p>We recognized $251 million of tax expense, a $266 million increase, explained primarily by the non-recurrence of a prior year tax settlement. As a reminder, our continued low effective tax rate is primarily the result of our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. As we establish a sustained period of profitability over time, we will need to evaluate elimination of the present valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. This change will result in the accrual of tax expense at a more normalized rate. And this will impact earnings per share, but importantly, will have no impact on cash flows.</p>
          <p>Bottom-line, second-quarter net income attributable to Ford was $2.6 billion, a $338 million improvement, which was reduced by the non-recurrence of a prior-year gain of over $3 billion on debt restructuring actions.</p>
          <p>Slide 9 covers special items, which were an unfavorable pre-tax amount of $95 million in the second quarter. We recorded $229 million of personnel and dealer-related charges, including primarily costs related to the discontinuation of Mercury.</p>
          <p>The first half cost associated with Mercury discontinuation and total U.S. dealer reductions is expected to be somewhat less than half of the total expected special item charges for these actions during the 2010 and 2011 period &#x2013; but were also $94 million of favorable held-for-sale adjustments for Volvo, reflecting its operating profits and other held-for-sale related items, including cessation of depreciation.</p>
          <p>As shown in the memo, if we had continued to report Volvo in our operating results, we would have reported a second quarter pre-tax operating profit of $53 million for Volvo. This would represent an improvement of $290 million compared with a year ago, more than explained by favorable volume and mix, net pricing, and material costs, offset partially by higher structural costs. This is continuing evidence that the Volvo team has returned the business to sustainable profitability.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we recognized a $40 million gain related to the full prepayment of our VEBA Note A debt obligation at a discount. This and other debt reduction actions will be discussed in more detail later.</p>
          <p>Now onto slide 10, which shows our pre-tax operating results by sector. Our second quarter pre-tax operating profit was $2.9 billion. This includes a profit of $2.1 billion for the Automotive sector and a profit of $875 million for Financial Services. As Alan mentioned, and as shown in the memo, total company second quarter pre-tax operating results improved by $3.5 billion compared with a year ago. In addition, this is an improvement of $932 million compared with the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide 11, which shows second quarter pre-tax operating results for each of our Automotive segments and Other Automotive. In the second quarter, all of our Automotive segments reported a profit, and as shown in the memo, showed significant improvement compared with a year ago and with first quarter 2010. We'll cover these Automotive segments in more detail on the upcoming slides.</p>
          <p>The second quarter Other Automotive loss was $551 million. This includes net interest expense of $459 million, which is comprised of about $520 million of interest expense, offset partially by interest income. In addition, there was $93 million of unfavorable fair market value adjustments, associated primarily with our investments in Mazda. And as shown in the memo, the non-recurrence of Volvo's prior year losses improved our pre-tax operating results by $237 million compared with a year ago.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows the change in second quarter pre-tax operating results compared with 2009 by causal factor. Overall, second quarter results improved by $3.2 billion compared with a year ago. Volume and mix was $1.5 billion favorable, explained primarily by the non-recurrence of prior year stock reductions to align with demand, as well as higher global industry volumes. Net pricing was $1.1 billion favorable, explained primarily by improvements in North America, including continued reductions in incentive spending and selective top-line pricing.</p>
          <p>Costs decreased by $200 million, reflecting primarily material cost reductions and lower warranty costs, offset partially by higher structural costs to support volume and growth to our product lines, as well as higher commodity costs.</p>
          <p>Exchange is $500 million favorable, reflecting primarily the non-recurrence of unfavorable prior-year balance sheet revaluations in North America. Net interest and fair market value adjustments were $400 million unfavorable, explained by the non-recurrence of prior-year favorable fair market value gains, largely attributable to our investments in Mazda, and higher interest expense associated with the VEBA debt added as of the end of 2009. And Volvo's impact represents a change in reporting, as we have previously mentioned.</p>
          <p>As shown in the memo, the $900 million improvement compared to the first quarter 2010 reflects primarily higher volume, offset partially by higher cost to support the volume increases and our product mix.</p>
          <p>For the next section of slides, we'll cover each of the Automotive segments, starting with North America on slide 13.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, wholesales was 659,000 units up 201,000 units from a year ago, clearly primarily U.S. industry growth and the non-recurrence of a prior-year reduction in dealer inventories.</p>
          <p>Dealer inventories during the second quarter of 2010 were unchanged compared to the first quarter. Second quarter U.S. total market share for Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury, was 16.9%, up one-half of a percentage point from a year ago, which will be discussed in more detail later.</p>
          <p>Second quarter revenue was $16.9 billion, a $6.2 billion increase from a year ago, explained primarily by higher volumes and favorable net pricing. For the second quarter, North America reported a pre-tax operating profit of $1.9 billion, a 2.8 billion improvement from a year ago, and we will cover this in more detail on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 provides an explanation of the change in North American results compared with 2009 by causal factor. Volume and mix was $1.4 billion favorable, reflecting primarily higher industry volumes, favorable changes in dealers stocks, and market share improvements.</p>
          <p>Net pricing was $1 billion favorable, reflecting primarily continued reductions in incentive spending and selective top-line pricing, consistent with the success of our full range of products in the marketplace. And costs increased by $100 million, reflecting primarily higher structural and commodity costs, offset partially by material cost reductions.</p>
          <p>Exchange was $400 million favorable, reflecting primarily the non-recurrence of an unfavorable prior year balance sheet revaluation.</p>
          <p>And slide 15 shows U.S. market share for Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury. In the second quarter, U.S. total market share was 16.9%, up one-half of a percentage point from a year ago, more than explained by higher market shares of F-Series, both the F150 and the new Super Duty, the new Taurus, and the Transit Connect. Additionally, U.S. retail share of the retail industry was an estimated 14.1% for the second quarter, up one percentage point from a year ago. Although not shown, Canada total market share in the second quarter was 17.5%, up 2.1 percentage points from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Improvements in quality, fuel efficiency, and residual values are driving stronger consideration and demand for Ford products, enabling the company to achieve market share gains and improved revenues. In addition, customers continue to equip their vehicles with high levels of content and technology, which also contributes to higher transaction prices on most Ford vehicles.</p>
          <p>Now onto South America on slide 16. In the second quarter, wholesales were 130,000 units, up 19,000 units from a year ago, reflecting primarily higher dealer stocks and industry volumes, offset partially by lower market share. The stock increase reflects in part achieving more normal levels in anticipation of plant shutdowns.</p>
          <p>Second-quarter market share was 9.5%, down nine-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago. The decrease includes adverse segmentation from our decision to not match escalation of competitive discounts. And second quarter revenue was $2.6 billion, an $800 million increase from a year ago, reflecting primarily higher volumes, favorable exchange translation, and favorable net pricing. And for the second quarter, South America reported a pre-tax operating profit of $285 million, a $199 million increase from a year ago. The increase reflects primarily favorable net pricing, favorable exchange, and higher volumes, offset partially by higher commodity and structural costs.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 covers Europe. In the second quarter, wholesales were 420,000 units, up 20,000 units from a year ago. Higher volume in Eastern European markets, Russia, and Turkey was offset partially by lower volume in our 19 major markets. The decrease in our 19 major markets reflect primarily lower market share and industry volume, offset partially by an increase in dealer stocks to return to normal planning levels.</p>
          <p>Second quarter industry SAAR for the 19 markets that we tracked was 14.9 million units, down 1.2 million units from a year ago as scrappage programs were reduced or concluded throughout the region.</p>
          <p>Second quarter market share was 7.9%, down 1.1 percentage points from a year ago. This reflects escalation of competitive discounts and our decision to reduce participation selectively in low margin businesses, as well as at the end of the favorable effects on the scrappage programs on our small cars.</p>
          <p>Second quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, a $500 million increase from a year ago, reflecting primarily higher volumes and favorable mix, offset partially by unfavorable net pricing and exchange translation. And for the second quarter, Europe reported a pre-tax operating profit of $322 million, a $265 million increase from a year ago. I will cover this in more detail on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 provides an explanation of the change in Europe results compared with 2009 by causal factor. Volume and mix was unchanged compared with a year ago. Lower market share and industry volume in the 19 markets we tracked was offset by a stock increase to return to normal planning levels and higher volumes in Eastern European markets, Russia, and Turkey.</p>
          <p>Net pricing was $100 million unfavorable. Higher vehicle pricing was more than offset by higher incentives, as we selectively responded to competitive spending increases following the end of the scrappage programs. And costs decreased by $300 million, reflecting primarily lower material costs, driven in part by a decrease in distressed supplier spending, and lower warranty costs, explained primarily by a favorable warranty reserve adjustment, which is not expected to reoccur.</p>
          <p>And slide 19 covers Asia-Pacific and Africa. In the second quarter, wholesales were 209,000 units, up 63,000 units from a year, reflecting strong industry growth in China and India, and the introduction of the new Figo in the Indian market, as well as an increase in dealer stocks to match market demand as we recover from strong industry growth in the first quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>The second quarter industry SAAR was 28.1 million units, up 5.2 million units from a year ago, explained primarily by increases in China, India, Indonesia, and Thailand. Second quarter market share was maintained at 2.4%, despite a strong growth in segments in which we do not fully participate.</p>
          <p>Second quarter revenue, which excludes sales at our unconsolidated China joint ventures, was $1.8 billion, a $600 million increase from a year ago. This reflects primarily higher volumes outside of China and favorable exchange translation, offset partially by unfavorable mix.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, Asia-Pacific and Africa reported a pre-tax operating profit of $113 million, a $114 million improvement from a year ago, more than explained by higher volumes, reflecting primarily higher industry, lower costs and favorable exchange. This strong quarterly profit provides a solid foundation for future growth.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 shows automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $21.9 billion in Automotive gross cash, down $3.4 billion from the first quarter of 2010, as a result of substantial debt reduction actions. Our Automotive operating-related cash flow was $2.6 billion positive in the second quarter, reflecting the Automotive pre-tax operating profit of $2.1 billion. Capital spending during the quarter was about $1 billion, equal to depreciation and amortization. We continue to realize efficiencies in our capital spending from our global product strategy, and we still expect spending  to increase in the second half to support future growth.</p>
          <p>Changes in working capital of $500 million, reflecting primarily higher payables associated with higher production. Other timing differences was $300 million favorable. For the first half, working capital and other timing differences were largely unchanged, with payments of $300 million to Ford Credit, reflecting upfront payments of subvention.</p>
          <p>Other major changes in second quarter Automotive gross cash included separation payments of $100 million and pension contributions of $400 million, and debt reduction actions, including paying down our revolving credit line and making scheduled payments on our VEBA debt, and fully prepaying our VEBA Note A debt obligation. These actions will be discussed further on the following slides. And equity issuance of about $300 million and other cash change of $200 million, more than explained by the impacts of exchange on our non-U.S. cash balances.</p>
          <p>Slide 21 summarizes recent Automotive sector debt reduction actions. Excuse me. As previously announced, we completed debt reduction initiatives during the second quarter that reduced Automotive debt by $7 billion and will lower interest expense by more than $470 million on an annualized basis. These actions include a $3 billion repayment in early April of our revolving line of credit, a $3.8 billion payment to the VEBA Trust. In addition to our scheduled payments, this fully retired our VEBA Note A obligations.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit's $1.3 billion purchase of VEBA Note A is a settlement of existing inter-company tax liabilities. Further, we made a $255 million cash payment to bring current previously deferred quarterly distributions on our trust preferred securities.</p>
          <p>As part of the VEBA actions, subject to regulatory approval, we obtained greater flexibility until mid 2013 to pre-pay all or a portion of the remaining Note B obligations in cash at a discount. These pre-payments can be made periodically during the year. The discount is 5% for prepayments made prior to 2012 and a 4% discount for prepayments made during 2012 and 2013. Previously, we could prepay no fee once a year at par.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 summarizes our Automotive sector's cash and debt position. At the end of the second quarter, Automotive debt was $27.3 billion, of which $1.1 billion matures within one year. Our gross cash net of debt as of June 30 was $5.4 billion negative, an improvement from the $9 billion negative as of the end of March.</p>
          <p>Total liquidity including available credit lines $25.4 billion. This liquidity includes $3.1 billion under our secured revolving credit lines and $450 million of other affiliate automotive credit lines.</p>
          <p>And now let's turn to slide 23 and Financial Services. For the second quarter, the Financial Services sector reported a pre-tax operating profit of $875 million, a $280 million increase from a year ago and a $60 million increase compared to the first quarter 2010, as shown in the memo.</p>
          <p>Other Financial Services reported pre-tax operating loss of $13 million in the second quarter, a $38 million improvement from a year ago, including the non-recurrence of a loss related to a real estate transaction.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, Ford Credit reported a pre-tax operating profit of $888 million, a $242 million increase from a year ago, which I will cover in more detail on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 24, provides an explanation of the change in Ford Credit results compared with 2009 by causal factor. Volume was $100 million unfavorable, reflecting declining receivables. As shown in the memo on the lower left of the slide, Ford Credit's managed receivables at June 30, 2010, were $87 billion, $13 billion lower than a year ago. This decline reflects primarily the transition of Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, and Volvo financing to other finance providers, the decline in industry volumes over the past few years, and changes in currency exchange rates.</p>
          <p>The decline in the provision for credit losses of $600 million reflects primarily lower credit loss reserves and improved charge-off performance. And residual losses declined by $100 million, reflecting primarily the impact of higher auction values on vehicles returning during the quarter. Other decreased by about $300 million, reflecting primarily the non-recurrence of prior year net gains related to unhedged currency exposures.</p>
          <p>We now expect Ford Credit's full year 2010 profits to be higher than its 2009 profits. The second half of 2010 will be lower than the first half, because Ford Credit expects more improvements in the provision for credit losses and depreciation expense for these vehicles, compared with the improvements during the first half.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2011, we expect Ford Credit to continue to be solidly profitable, but at a lower level than 2010, reflecting primarily the non-recurrence of lower lease depreciation expense and non-recurrence of credit loss reserve reductions of the same magnitude as 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 shows &#x2013; covers the liquidity and funding outlook for Ford Credit. The left box shows committed liquidity programs in cash and the utilization of liquidity sources at the end of the second quarter. Ford Credit's liquidity exceeded utilization by about $21 billion, about the same as first quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>We remain on track to achieve our full-year funding plan, completing about $6 billion of funding in the second quarter and about another $1 billion in July. Additional highlights including a U.S. public retail transaction at pre-crisis credit spreads, $12 billion of committed capacity renewals, and $2 billion of net incremental capacity.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit's funding strategy remains focused on access to public and private securitizations, asset-backed commercial paper, and unsecured debt. Our liquidity remains strong, and we will continue to maintain cash balances, funding programs, and committed capacity to ensure liquidity adequately meets our funding requirements. And at the end of the second quarter, Ford Credit's managed leverage was 6.6 to 1, and equity was $10.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 26 covers our third quarter 2010 production plans. In North America, the third quarter production schedule was 570,000 units, up 80,000 units from a year ago and unchanged from our prior guidance. In South America, the third quarter production schedule is 130,000 units, up 15,000 units from a year ago.</p>
          <p>For Europe, we expect third quarter production of 356,000 units, down 29,000 units from a year ago, and this decline reflects primarily the non-recurrence of prior year production increases to support European scrappage programs.</p>
          <p>For Asia-Pacific and Africa, we expect third quarter production of 213,000 units, up 60,000 units from a year ago. Overall, we expect total company third quarter production to increase by 126,000 units from a year ago, reflecting continued strong customer demand for our products, maintenance of competitive stock levels, and the non-recurrence of prior-year stock reductions.</p>
          <p>Compared with the second quarter, our third quarter production was down 174,000 units. The decrease reflects planned vacation shutdowns during the third quarter that are generally used to prepare for new models. Fourth quarter production also will be affected by planned holiday shutdowns and new product changeovers for vehicles such as Focus and Explorer.</p>
          <p>Overall, our third and fourth quarter production schedule is lower than the first half but is consistent with our strategy to match supply with demand.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to turn it back to Alan to summarize our 2010 outlook and our plan going forward.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Lewis.</p>
          <p>On slide 28, I will provide an overview of the business environment going forward. The global economic recovery continued in the second quarter, and we expect a modest pace of growth to be sustained. This year's global industry volume is projected to be up by 5 to 10% compared with last year's level of 65 million units.</p>
          <p>Many scrappage and other government incentive programs are ending, primarily in the European markets. This impact on global volume, however, is offset by year-over-year gains in China, India, the U.S., and Brazil as well as other emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Market recoveries in Asia are moderating, but the markets remain very strong. We also continue to see relatively weak growth in consumer spending in the United and States and Europe, reflecting weak labor markets and tight credit conditions. These conditions are improving slowly.</p>
          <p>The debt crisis in Europe will generate significant fiscal tightening, which is likely to act as a near-term drag on growth. Central banks around the world are beginning to wind down many of the special lending programs that were implemented at the height of the financial crisis. However, low levels of interest rates in the United States and Europe will continue to support economic growth.</p>
          <p>In China, India, and Brazil, the strong rates of growth earlier this year have already generated some tightening to the monetary policy to contain inflation pressures. Commodity prices remain significantly higher than last year's lows, although the strength has moderated in recent weeks. Crude oil prices in the 70 to $80 per barrel range are up about 50% from last year's lows.</p>
          <p>Overall, the global business environment remains challenging, but we expect global growth to continue.</p>
          <p>Slide 29 summarizes the status of our key planning assumptions and operational metrics for the first half, and our 2010 full-year outlook.</p>
          <p>First half industry volume SAAR was 11.4 million units in the United States and 15.4 million in the 19 markets we track in Europe. We have tightened the range of our industry outlooks based on an assessment of the first half performance. We expect full-year U.S. industry volumes to be in a range of 11.5 to 12 million units. Full-year European industry volume is expected to be in the range of 14.5 to 15 million units, reflecting a stronger than expected first half offset by a weaker second half.</p>
          <p>On the Automotive operational metrics, all of our regions are on track to improve quality compared with a year ago. Automotive structural costs were 350 million higher in the first half. We expect full-year Automotive structural cost to be about 1 billion higher to support growth and key product introductions. Our cost structure, however, continues to improve as a percentage of revenue. Although not shown, commodity costs were 400 million higher in the first half, and for the full year, we expect commodity cost to increase by about $1 billion.</p>
          <p>U.S. total market share was 16.7% and the U.S. share of the retail market was 14.1% in the first half. Both improved compared with 2009, and we now expect full-year U.S. market share to improve.</p>
          <p>Europe market share for the first half was 8.7%, and we now expect full-year European market share to be about equal to the first half of 2010 but lower than 2009, reflecting our decision to limit increases in incentives in the region.</p>
          <p>Automotive operating-related cash flow was 2.5 billion positive in the first half, reflecting our improved profitability. For the full year, we remain confident of our plan to generate positive operating-related cash flow.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures were 1.9 billion in the first half. We expect full year spending to be about 4.5 billion to support our product plan, as we continue to realize efficiencies from our global product development processes.</p>
          <p>We expect to have solid financial results in the second half, continuing to exceed the expectations we had earlier this year. As in most years, our first half results will be stronger than the second half, reflecting normal seasonality, including lower second half volumes related to planned shutdowns and product launches. This year, we also expect higher investment and cost in the second half to support growth and key product introductions, as well as higher commodity costs and smaller reductions in reserves at Ford Credit. Overall, we expect to achieve great results for the full year, providing a solid foundation for continuing growth.</p>
          <p>For 2011, based on our present planning assumptions, we expect continuing improvement in total company profitability and Automotive operating-related cash flow, including improvement in our Automotive operations. These improvements are driven primarily by the growing strength of our global products, continuing cost structure improvements, and the gradual strengthening of the global economy.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit will continue to be solidly profitable but at a lower level, reflecting primarily a lower occurrence of this year's favorable factors. In addition, by the end of 2011, we expect to move from an Automotive net debt position to a net cash position.</p>
          <p>Slide 30 summarizes our plans. We remained focused on delivering the key aspects of our One Ford plan, which are unchanged. Aggressively restructure to operate profitably at the current demand and the changing model mix, accelerate development of the new products our customers want and value, finance our plan and continue to improve our balance sheet, and work together effectively as one team, leveraging our global assets. Our product momentum is growing, and our leadership in quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart design, and the very best value is resonating with consumers.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we are entering another period of exciting new product introductions around the world, such as the redesigned Ford Explorer that will redefine the SUV segment with class-leading fuel efficiency, with an improvement of more than 30% versus the current Explorer, plus industry-first safety features and technology innovations.</p>
          <p>The new Global Fiesta, already a success in Europe and Asia, is reaching showrooms now in the U.S., and the new Transit Connect Electric, the first of several new Ford electric vehicles is coming later this year. In India, the new Figo is off to a very strong start. In Europe, we introduced the new C-Max and the Grand C-Max multi-activity vehicles, the first offering of our new Global C car platform. This will eventually underpin more than 2 million vehicles a year around the world, including the new Focus that launches early next year, an important next step in our One Ford plan.</p>
          <p>Overall, our performance this year gives us great confidence going forward, allowing us to focus on continuing to expand our business, particularly in the growth regions of the world, such as China and India, improve our overall cost structure and achieve competitive cost, while strengthening further our operational excellence, and taking actions to strengthen our balance sheet and becoming investment grade. We believe we are well positioned to deliver profitable growth for everyone associated with our Ford.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And congratulations on a very good quarter. I guess one place I wanted to start was just a little bit more on FMCC, which clearly came ahead of expectations. A couple questions there.</p>
          <p>And I don't know if you said it already, but can you just remind us of what the dividend plan is? How much there is left? I think you'd originally said 2 billion for this year. How much of that is left? Is there any kind of intention to sort of increase that, just given the very strong results there?</p>
          <p>And I guess the second question, I just wanted to get your sense of &#x2013; I realize that you said that some of the credit quality improvement aspects would be not as positive in the second half, but I wanted to hear a little bit more about that, because it seems like, if we look at past credit cycles, improving credit quality was indeed something that you were able to see sort of positive tailwinds from for a while. So wanted to get your &#x2013; your sense of that.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, can you talk a little bit about the impact of the sub-prime, which has been kind of in the press recently as being one of the factors responsible for sort of lower than expected sales? Obviously, we saw this large GM deal announced yesterday. So wanted your thoughts on that, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet. Lewis will do the first question, and we have K.R. with us here also, and he'll address your other ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just for clarification on the dividend. We said it would be $2 billion for the year, and there is $1.5 billion still to go.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'm going to pass over to the CFO of our strategic assets, K.R. Kent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lewis. Hey, Patrick, on the credit quality, I will give you one perspective, and that is on the lost receivables. And we'll cover a bit more in the Fixed Income Call later today.</p>
          <p>So on a worldwide basis, we had lost receivables of 39 basis points for the quarter, which was extremely low. And in the past, we've only had actually four quarters that were lower. So, for example, people are paying their bills. It's very encouraging in an environment where you know consumers are stressed out there.</p>
          <p>And as a result of the low lost receivables, we had to reduce our credit loss reserve. For the first half of the year, we've reduced it for about $450 million. Our view is kind of that it won't continue at that pace. Obviously, the reserve just can't keep going down over time. So eventually, that will slow down. That's what's we're saying in the second half, is that reduction will slow down.</p>
          <p>Your last question was on sub-prime and how that plays into our sales. At Ford Credit, we do support sub-prime. We have always supported sub-prime. It is a important part of the market for the company to sell vehicles in that market. And effectively, we've always participated in it. We buy a broad spectrum of business, and we've been very successful. I think you can see it in our securitizations that are out there that are publicly traded. They include sub-prime, they include prime, and they all perform very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good, K.R. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me just as a follow-up to that K.R., how has sub-prime been behaving? I think there is some data that's been published out there to suggest that, whereas credit availability has been pretty good across the board, that's one area where it's actually tightened. And the idea being that, if it were sort of go back to more normal levels, it would obviously be favorable for sales. What are your thoughts on that, just broadly for the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can really speak about for us. In total, we do have &#x2013; obviously have the details that we split out and look at, sub-prime versus near prime versus prime in our portfolio. But we don't typically express that on a public basis. But in total, the portfolio continues to perform very well. And that's about as far as I can go.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, two questions. First, I just wanted to clarify, did you say $1 billion rise in 2010 for both structural costs and also commodity costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What is driving the 1 billion increase in structural cost? Is it capacity, engineering, labor? Can you just give us some color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's a mixture of things. It's the cost associated with increased production, so it's volume-related cost. It's increased engineering, depreciation, amortization of the new products that we are developing for future growth. And finally, the advertising and sales promotions associated with the launch of some of those new products.</p>
          <p>So it's all the things you'd expect for a company that's going into a growth period and seeing its volumes increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Lewis, I mean would you think of that number seeing another sizable uptick in 2011, assuming production starts rising next year, as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if production rises, we'll continue to see some costs associated with it. We've got a very, very busy launch second half. So I'm not sure that I'd view the launch as necessarily a running rate. But I haven't spent a huge amount of time looking at that for next year, Himanshu.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you also give us some color on European inventories? We're seeing the Western Europe SAAR sequentially soften, but a lot of these third-party vendors, like CSM and J.D. Power, are upgrading their European production forecast. Where do you characterize inventories in Europe, whether it's for Ford or for industry? And where were they at the start of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the start of the year, we were incredibly tight on the inventories. We'd been struggling to build enough cars because the scrappage programs were so strong on small cars. We continued in that vein through the first quarter with very tight inventories.</p>
          <p>We would normally have an inventory build in the second quarter for two reasons. One, because we're getting really ready for the summer shutdowns. And secondly, because we were so tight. So we &#x2013; it's about 55 days, which is a very comfortable level, lower than the typical &#x2013; than typically Europe's run at. So we feel our inventories are well under control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One last one, coming back to Pat's question to K.R. What was described yesterday by one of your competitors was that asset wasn't just a good strategic fit, but it was also broadly characterized as the sub-prime market is just a very compelling growth opportunity for them.</p>
          <p>I'm just wondering how Ford and Ford Credit view the competitive landscape in sub-prime right now? Have enough competitors left that space right now and have credit trends improved sufficiently where maybe it does makes sense now for Ford to try to expand penetration rates in that segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are a bit different from some of the other people you've been talking about. We didn't get out of the credit market. We didn't desert any of our customers across the spectrum. We are still supporting those customers. We expect to continue to support those customers as they come into our showrooms.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Two questions. A pricing one in Europe for Lewis, and then a more strategic one for Alan.</p>
          <p>Lewis, where would you characterize, within that 300 million of incentive activity, the pockets that you &#x2013; the kind of flash points for incentives? Either by segments &#x2013; you know, B, C &#x2013; or by geography? Country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd characterize it as across the board, Brian. It's in most countries, it's in most segments. We've &#x2013; and some of the most active of our competitors, I'd say, are more biased towards the small end of the spectrum, in terms of their product range. So they've been bulking up on incentives in that area.</p>
          <p>I think an important message for what we're doing in Europe is we are backing away from chasing some of our competitors down to very, very high levels of incentives for business that we don't think is necessarily real, and you can see that at the end of each month.</p>
          <p>The year-over-year incentive level is up, but since we saw the volumes coming down in this second quarter, we have really backed away from some of this business that people started indulging in. And our per unit margin, actually, second over first &#x2013; you can't see it in the data &#x2013; is up modestly, which I think implies that we're doing the right thing for our business.</p>
          <p>We are pursuing profitable business, not market share business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>And a question probably for both you and Alan, which is how do you see the Light Commercial Van Vehicle business developing in Europe and Brazil, where you are active, as well? Is that an entry for you to grow in China? And is that going to be a bigger part of your business going forward, say over the next three years?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Well, the commercial vehicles down to the Transit size and the Transit Connect have been, as you know, a wonderful business for us, and we see that continuing to grow in all the regions of the world, the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A very &#x2013; maybe a very basic question, but I think an important one, as you guys are talking about cost inflation, structural cost going up.</p>
          <p>Is it fair to say, and how do you think about, when you launch new products, that they are higher margin than outgoing products? I mean is that &#x2013; is it a fair assumption to assume as you launch a new product, you expect it to be higher margin and plan for it to be higher than the outgoing product, even though there might be some cost inflation as we're going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a multi-faceted question. Let's just talk about the structural cost.</p>
          <p>If we build more of them, we expect to attract some structural cost associated with it. Right at the very beginning of the new product launch, you have some specific structural costs associated with the high levels of depreciation/amortization at the beginning of the cycle, the launch expense in the plants and the advertising and sales promotion.</p>
          <p>In terms of the margins, we are going through a period where we are improving the competitiveness of our products, and improving, as part of that, improving the attributes and the equipment levels of our products. That's the thing that's driving the positive performance on pricing, closing the gap with our Asian competitor in the U.S., for example, because we've got much more competitive products. Along with that does go some increased material costs. But typically, we would be looking, at the start of the cycle, to have a better margin than on the last job of the previous cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question is on slide 14, when you go through the walk for North America, there's no mention, and I may have missed this, but it's not on the slide deck, of what warranty expense did in the quarter. What your warranty performance was in the quarter. And if it was negligible, or do you expect that to improve going forward? And just sort of more color around warranty expense in North America.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say probably the thing that to me was the most surprising and most impressive was the price performance in the quarter. I have a couple of questions on that.</p>
          <p>First, what's your expectation for pricing as we get into the second half, if I think in terms of your year-to-year profit walk, like you were just talking about, from slide 14? And then what do you see as any risks to the pricing story, be it your product mix or introductions or any kind of competitive actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've talked a lot of our pricing improvements being driven by improved products. We obviously have a lot of improved products coming in the second half.</p>
          <p>We don't expect to maintain the performance we saw in the first half, but we do expect to continue to see positive net pricing. And included within that, we do expect to see incentives continue to ameliorate a little bit, as our products get more and more competitive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Chris, we're also absolutely saying laser-focused on our plan to match our production to the real demand, which is the most important thing we do from a value point of view on the products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your question I think was primarily aimed at North American market, but I think the steps we're taking in Europe not to chase the marginal units is also important evidence of the way we're trying to run the business responsibly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the increase in commodity cost, the $1 billion, you used to talk in terms of both commodity and product cost. Is there some breakdown within the billion, or is it all really just raw materials? Or is some of that the increased content that's going into make these new products better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the billion dollars is raw material. And it's the usual suspects. Steel, aluminium or aluminum, and copper and the like.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So where do we see &#x2013; where are we missing the increase in the actual content? Be it regulatory or just for better components, to be more competitive?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Just a question. Your guidance for Q3 North American production. I would have thought, given kind of the low inventory and your market share gains, and just kind of the continuing improvement in the industry, I would have thought that there would maybe not be quite as much seasonality as you're indicating. What are you seeing there that leads you to be &#x2013; to sort of expect things to be as normal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it really starts with our assessment on the economic growth and of course the industry, the 11.5 to 12. And then staying really focused on the right inventory and supply with the dealers. And so we worked a little bit of that and the production in the first half to make sure that, with the shutdowns that we normally take, and the new product launches, that we're matching that production to demand.</p>
          <p>So it's about right, looking at the market and looking at us gradually increasing market share, too.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we &#x2013; as you simplify, within the product lines, as we simplify our product offerings, we believe we can get closer to the customer and run lower inventories. But it's going to take some time for us to get that.</p>
          <p>Long term, we want to move from &#x2013; I think typically we planned around 60 &#x2013; to somewhere maybe 5 to 10 days lower than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we're very encouraged with the progress we're making, because not only have we simplified the product lineup and made that really clear, but also we're continuing to simplify the order book combinations to get really packaged the way the customers really want it.

        <plist>
          <p>Looking at slide 12, what was the explanation for the positive exchange impact and the net interest adjustment? I was actually surprised exchange would be positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The exchange positive news is the non-recurrence of bad news last year, which was a balance sheet revaluation because of exchange rate movements.</p>
          <p>And I'm sorry. Your second question was about interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the net interest impairment market value adjustments that offset that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things. One, our interest has gone up because we've got the VEBA debt on our books, compared to last year.</p>
          <p>And the second element is our fair mark-to-market value adjustment for our investment in Mazda has gone done. I think last year, during the quarter, it was going up, and this year, during the quarter, it was going down. So the year-over-year looks somewhat exacerbated.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the exchange side, should we expect similar benefits in the second half, or is exchange going to be a headwind on it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this was &#x2013; we did have a big chunk in second quarter last year. So we're not expecting &#x2013; who knows what you expect on exchange rates. But based on present planning assumptions, we don't expect a big item like this in the second half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was just a year-over-year issue. Okay. And can you talk about Europe in the second half? I mean, pricing is getting tougher. Production is going to be down. Can you stay profitable in Europe? Or just any sort of color on this?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First I just want to talk a little bit more about this 11% margin that you achieved in North America. And I know a few analysts have asked about whether there were unusual exchange items or warranty items in there.</p>
          <p>I guess just more broadly, were there any unusual items in there? Was mix unusually strong? Any thoughts about the sustainability of the business? Obviously you do have some cost coming in, but there is a lot of operating leverage in the business as the cycle recovers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Rod, I think the only unusual thing is looking at the margins by quarter are quite dangerous.</p>
          <p>Second quarter is a very full production quarter typically. So we don't expect to stay at an 11% margin. But we look at it more on a &#x2013; it's more instructive, I think, to look at it on an annual basis and see the trends there, rather than &#x2013; there is a lot of noise quarter-to-quarter that isn't signals.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two questions on the 2011 outlook. Can you maybe directionally share what you are sort of assuming there for net pricing year-over-year?</p>
          <p>And also, it's interesting to see that you expect continued cost structure improvements. Does that mean that the Automotive structural costs just don't increase at the same rate that we maybe saw them increase this year? Maybe do you have any color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect your first question, we're pretty much aligned on the GDP growth projections that people are making. We just &#x2013; the U.S. just updated their guidance 3 to 3.5 for 2010, and then moving to closer to 4 maybe in 2011.</p>
          <p>So with that, and the industry moving along with that, and our increasing position on share, that kind of outlines still the slow growth with respect to past recessions. But clearly a really positive thing that we're growing.</p>
          <p>And on the pricing itself, our real plan is to continue to offer the quality and the fuel efficiency and the safety and the smart design that people really do want and value. So we anticipate that the consumers, like they are now, really appreciate and resonate with the new product line. And as we continue to refresh our vehicles to get to the precious product line, we anticipate that the customers will continue to appreciate the Ford and pay for the features that they really like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early for us to give detailed views of next year. We would expect the pricing component to probably &#x2013; to be somewhat less than it has been this year. And we're going to continue to work on our cost competitiveness.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then on the net debt guidance for the year, obviously impressive outlook there. Lewis, can you maybe help us directionally of where you think net debt could end 2010? Just wanted to get a better sense of some of the seasonal cash flow that you are expecting in the second half of this year?</p>

          <p>But just a reminder that we still have about somewhere between 300 and $350 million of <mark type="inaudible" /> and previously declared, but the rest of the net debt this year, we're certainly expected to be doing whatever we do to continue the great performance out of the operating business.</p>

          <p>Well, Dee-Ann, we absolutely look forward to that point, because that clearly will show that we &#x2013; reflect in our growth.

          <p>Well, we've been pretty clear in the specials that we say it will be &#x2013; that the amount we showed in the specials, which includes not just Mercury, but includes some other dealer restructuring. The amount we show here is somewhat less than half the total amount we expect to book in 2010 and 2011. We're not being any more explicit than that, Keith.</p>

          <p>We are going to invest in Lincoln what it takes to deliver the product program. We don't split out our CapEx and our engineering by brand. But you will &#x2013; you see, this year, our CapEx going up year-over-year. And you will see us continuing to increase our CapEx as we go into this growth period. And we've got this plan for 7 new or refreshed products in the next 4 years.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's clearly a really positive development because we're managing our uses of cash, and we're looking at the overall business environment, and it appears to us, with all of our fundamental assumptions, that we're going to be able to continue to improve the balance sheet and pay down the debt. And that's why we're very pleased to give the guidance that we'll be in a net positive position in cash at the end of next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brent, I just wanted &#x2013; because I misspoke a little bit earlier, when I talked about the operating divisions that explicitly call out. Obviously, the dividends from Ford Credit are a big help to continue to pay down our net debt. So it's both the Automotive business units and Ford Credit.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
