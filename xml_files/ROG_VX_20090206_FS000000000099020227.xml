          <p>Good morning or good afternoon. This is Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome to the Roche Full Year Results 2008. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dr. Severin Schwan, Chief Executive Officer; you are now joining to the conference room. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We can start? Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome here in New York after a couple of, I'd say, bumpy days. Before we get into the numbers for 2008 and the outlook for 2009, let me just reiterate again and make a comment on the Genentech transaction.</p>
          <p>We have been in negotiations with the special committee of the Board. Unfortunately, we could not agree on the negotiated transactions. This is the very reason why we decided to directly approach the minority shareholders of Genentech.</p>
          <p>I'd like to emphasize again that this move does not influence at all our plans, how we want to combine the two organizations. We have high respect for Genentech, we have high respect for the employees of Genentech. We want to protect, we want to nurture the specific innovation driven, science-driven culture of Genentech.</p>
          <p>One important element to achieve this is that we will keep the Genentech Founders Research Center, research and early development, as an independent center within the Roche Group. As you know, we will operate the headquarters in the U.S. out of South San Francisco and we will keep the Genentech name. Let's have a look into the numbers for 2008.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we have delivered on the promises, which we gave exactly one year ago here in New York. We have outgrown the markets in both our core businesses, Pharma and Diagnostics. Pharma twice as fast as the worldwide market, with a 10% growth in local currencies. And also Diagnostics, even if we correct for the Ventana acquisition, which accounts for about four percentage points of growth, again outgrowing worldwide markets. We are particularly ahead on a group level with 10% growth versus the single-digit growth, high single digit growth we guided you at the beginning of last year. And we did come in on core EPS on our guidance with 2% above the previous year levels, again in local currencies.</p>
          <p>We look into the figures, pharmaceuticals up 10%, if we exclude for Tamiflu pandemic, driven primarily by the oncology franchise. Today, oncology accounts for SFC20 billion of the total Pharmaceuticals division. Two thirds of our Pharmaceuticals business are true biopharmaceuticals.</p>
          <p>Diagnostics, 10% growth, partly due to the Ventana acquisition, but also to a very good development in Applied Science Professional Diagnostics, offsetting the more disappointing result in Diabetes Care. If we look at the group level and see the 10% double-digit growth in local currencies, how come that we decline in Swiss francs by 1%? Let me just go into the bridge here.</p>
          <p>You can see an organic growth of SFC4 billion on our top line, 2 billion from Roche Pharma and another billion each from Genentech and Diagnostics. You can see the decline of 1.6 billion for Tamiflu, exactly along the guidance we gave you beginning of last year. And you can see a dramatic impact of SFC3.2 billion due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc against all major currencies; the U.S. dollar, the euro. But as you will see later, also against a number of other currencies.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in local currencies was up 4% versus the sales growth of 6%. This is an under proportional growth and this is primarily due to the over proportional investments into research and development, in particular late stage development. And I will come back to that.</p>
          <p>Core EPS in line with 2% growth. This is then also reflected in a strong operating free cash flow. You see that we again increased the double-digits to 12 &#x2013; over SFC12 billion, which is now a very healthy 27% relative to sales.</p>
          <p>As we go forward into 2009, what is our working hypothesis? Foremost, we believe that the pharma business model is not broke. We think in particular, in such turbulent times, it is important to steer the cost to stick to our strategy. And our strategy is a focus on our two core businesses, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. And we will not, as you see with a number of our competitors, diversify into other areas such as medical devices, OTC or generic. We will stick to what we are good at, because we believe in those businesses. And the key for success &#x2013; the key for success in the long-term will be innovation, which we define as medical differentiation. To bring innovative solutions to patients, which truly improve the quality of life and which prolong life. We believe there will be a demand for that in the mid-term, in the long-term. That's what is the key for success.</p>
          <p>As you have seen from the 2008 results, we have not been impacted by the financial crisis. In fact, we could keep the dynamics in our business for the third and fourth quarter. We did, however, see a lower financial income in the second half of 2008, and we expect that full year effect in our guidance for 2008, as we go forward. And Erich will go into more details.</p>
          <p>With our commitment into innovation, we will continue to invest into research and development if we have the right opportunities on hand. And this is exactly what has happened and started to happen in 2008 and we're optimistic that this trend continues into 2009.</p>
          <p>Let me illustrate this with the new molecular entities we have moving over the last year and which we will move into 2009. Now I focus here on late stage development Phase III and new molecular entities, because the greater part of our development cost is in late stage and the greater part of our development cost is in fact in new molecular entities.</p>
          <p>As you can see, in 2007, we had two programs running; Tocilizumab and Actemra. Actemra has been completed, but we added another three programs into 2008, which brought it up to four new molecular entities in the expensive late stage Phase III. And we hope that during 2009, we will be able, again, to move forward another four new molecular entities into Phase III. That is the underlying reason, ladies and gentlemen, why we guided you at the beginning of last year that in 2008 R&amp;D would increase over proportionally. And that is the very reason why R&amp;D will increase over proportionally to sales as we go into 2009.</p>
          <p>And I am glad that we have those opportunities. I am glad that we are not forced to drive core EPS in the short term at the expense of the mid and long term future of this organization.</p>
          <p>Bill will go into more details on a host of programs beyond the new molecular entities key projects, which we also moved forward into late stage development in 2008. You do see that we expect some further progress as we go into 2009. Equally in Diagnostics, we have an increase of important product launches. We had this already in 2008. Again, you see this reflected in the R&amp;D expenses, partly also driven by our investments into the acquisition, such as Ventana. And you do see that we expect a strong delivery into 2009, actually mainly driven by Diabetes Care, that we have four important introductions as we go forward.</p>
          <p>So in spite of the over proportional increase into R&amp;D, in spite of the lower expected financial returns, we expect that core EPS will remain at the 2008 record level due to our organic portfolio growth, due to positive product mix effect and due to continued efficiency improvement.</p>
          <p>To close, we expect an above market sales in both our businesses; Pharma and Diagnostics. We expect a mid single-digit growth for Diagnostic and Pharma and on a group level.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Bill. Bill?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Severin. Pleasure to be with you again and to have the annual review of what we've been achieving. I think we have put to bed an extraordinarily good year and that we have a rich future to look forward to. I think what's come across to me in the last couple of days is just how countercyclical we seem to be to the sector and this is probably taking a little bit of communication in that the industry sector has been characterized in probably recent months and years by concern over the number of products that are going off patent, concern about increasing requirements from the regulatory authorities. And this has led within this room and others to a weakening in the belief of valuing pipeline into the model. This has led to a preoccupation, and I saw it with one major pharma company in the last 24 hours, where the run up to the disclosure was more concerned about the number of job losses that would take place rather than what was happening to the fundamentals of the business.</p>
          <p>So we find ourselves as you will see and probably had a chance to look at the figures, I'll try and bring this alive in the next few minutes. But frankly, we find ourselves in a position concluding the fifth year of double-digit growth, in a position with one of the lowest exposures to generics over the next four to five years, of a margin that has improved over those five years, now to the top decile at 36% for us, and in a privileged position that we have a number of real assets that balance risk. We have some high risk, high reward programs; we have some medium risk, medium reward programs and so on, in our rich, late stage portfolio. A portfolio, which we hope that we are helping you to see and feel and touch. But it does require that we get your support that the Pharma model is not broken, that the Pharma model driven by innovation, which can result in clinical differentiation in the products, which then society pays for.</p>
          <p>And that's the thesis, that's where we are. So let's give you the overview of how the year shaped up and indeed, of the richness of the decisions that we're having to make and the investments to bring that late stage portfolio through.</p>
          <p>You can see that outside of the Tamiflu revenues, which we guided you on last year, actually &#x2013; on this platform, I would say 1.7 billion was the guidance. It actually came in at 1.6. So I think we were pretty close, as close as you can really get there. 10% growth, that's twice the world market growth at the moment and you know better than I, that the world market has been slowing down. Indeed, in this country, we're looking at 1 to 2% growth. So there's certainly a slowdown. But a lot of that is caused by the patent expiries and the washout of product revenues from patent expiries. Frankly, folks, it is oxygen if you are an originator with interesting new molecules, with a real clinical role.</p>
          <p>We've continued on our operational excellence programs, as I'll take you through in the P&amp;L. We've been chipping away at the back office costs and I do believe that that has helped the fund and the release of resource there, helps to fund the invest that we've been making into the development programs.</p>
          <p>In securing our future during 2008, we saw the major approvals that you are as well aware of as I am, from Avastin getting into the United States in metastatic breast cancer; the European equivalent on the AVADO study being submitted; Avastin and glioblastoma here and in Europe; and so forth.</p>
          <p>We've had good clinical data coming through. The AVADO, RIBBON-1, so we now have three pivotal studies in breast cancer that show the role of Avastin in that setting. Xeloda early breast cancer, profiling the product strongly there. And Tarceva in first-line maintenance. I don't see much pick up yet on this, but there is really interesting data that shows the use of Avastin after the treatment setting has a real role to play. And then the second study, with the ATLAS study this week &#x2013; I think it's supposed to be this week, it was at the beginning of the week &#x2013; also, which shows Avastin does have benefit, and then add Tarceva on top and you've got incremental benefit, to the point that the study was stopped. So I do think this is also setting the stage for important duration of treatment on Avastin and also incremental role for Tarceva. We'll work on that for regulatory submissions.</p>
          <p>On the scorecard that we shared with you at the beginning of last year for memoria this is here just to show the outcomes where we've seen a lot of progress on the filings. At the bottom, probably the only one that I would have to say I'm disappointed in is the delay that we have here in the United States for ACTEMRA. This was submitted as the same dossier as we have internationally and we will be back third quarter this year in reopening the discussions.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, the same data set has secured an extraordinarily good label for this product in Europe. The launch has started in January in Germany and this will roll out nicely. When you see the strong underlying momentum, then as I mentioned, this is the sixth year of &#x2013; fifth year or sixth year of double-digit growth. And also to this point, we have an interesting challenge internally in trying to explain this. In the morning press in Switzerland, people would say Swiss francs growth of 2%. Internationally, growth of 10% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>If we were a U.S. based company, we'd be thrilled to be showing you a 13% growth. It just shows you that it depends where you consolidate in the world today. The one that I focus on, the one we run the business on is on that local growth. We can't control world currency. We have natural hedging in place as we spend a lot of money where we make our money, but we track our business on the local currency growth. You similarly see the momentum was sustained across the four quarters of the year, good growth, different parts of the units contributing in slightly different ways, but the aggregate of our portfolio working well.</p>
          <p>Chugai with the more modest growth. I should say had the price reductions end of first quarter of 2008. They also had a package of products returned to Sanofi-aventis of about $100 million worth of turnover. And we've now seen the launch, Avastin, MabThera, Tarceva, and that's starting to pick up momentum. So looking forward, I think we'll see more growth coming from Chugai than in this historic period.</p>
          <p>This resulted in the sustaining of a very high and good, OROS as I mentioned in top decile. And when we look at the P&amp;L of the Pharma division and here to get to the profit, we'll take the 5% growth, which includes that Tamiflu revenue that we have; what you see is a modest in absolute number term, of 91 million increase in royalties and other operating income. We were successful in selling off some of the tail products, but not much more than we have been doing in recent years. I am glad that we did, because actually there's not as much cash around today to secure some of these fields. This is a constant tidying up of the tail, the complexity of manufacturing, the complexity of drug safety vigilance and it allows us to chip away at the cost structures there too.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost of sales, a virtual zero figure. Actually behind that figure is minus 8% for our cost of goods and our period costs. The period costs being the non-absorbed costs of idle capacity.</p>
          <p>So a good performance here, some of it contributed to by product mix, some of it contributed to by operating efficiencies. We now have a relatively modest footprint around the world, 16 locations for manufacturing and this is really where we focus. We see many of our peer group with quite a larger number of sites.</p>
          <p>In marketing and distribution, recognizing that the growth of our business was not the Tamiflu pandemic, which needs only a small number of our colleagues working on it. The main army of our marketing and distribution effort lies behind the product range that drove 10% growth. So a 2% growth in M&amp;D here, I think is a fabulous performance by our commercial colleagues around the world.</p>
          <p>In research and development, as predicted, as planned, an 11% growth. We were alerting the organization under our colleagues here to the fact that this is a period of invest. G&amp;A at zero. So frankly, we're chipping away at the back office costs. We're being as efficient as we can be across all the cost elements and even within research and development. You have seen us this last year make significant progress, a lot of the transactions that we conduct. We've partnered with TATA Services in India. We have a number of our trial centers in Eastern Europe in a much better organized way. The balance of our internal resource versus our use of CROs in good shape. So even within the R&amp;D part, we do look for operating efficiencies, step by step. And that resulted in the operating profit going up 8%, so larger than the growth in sales.</p>
          <p>One way of trying to exemplify the way the operating efficiencies come together, we've tried to share with you here, looking at this last five years, the CAGR growth on the sales 13%; the CAGR growth on head count, 3%; and within that CAGR on head count, last 18 months or so, more than a thousand people out of manufacturing, 10% of the staff in the head count of our manufacturing. In marketing and distribution, a similar number out of the so-called developed markets, the mature markets and we've reapplied that resource from Eastern Europe to Asia to Latin America to the developing market. So a significant redeployment of people behind that. And of course, the net result of the differences there is that we have a 9% CAGR on productivity of the Roche colleagues.</p>
          <p>So behind that, let's go into a review of the core assets on the therapeutic areas that we're in. First of all, oncology, and as you've heard from Severin, here we are just a touch shy of 20 billion. 27% growth in Japan as they launch the new product and there's much more to go there. It was a 9% growth here in the United States as a combination of the Genentech oncology portfolio and the Roche oncology portfolio with Xeloda. And outside of the United States, 20% growth.</p>
          <p>Now for some of these assets, like Avastin, like Tarceva, there's probably about one year delay in the rollout of the products in the world market. So you do see us making more progress on the non-U.S. business than was made this last year in the United States.</p>
          <p>When we look at the key assets, five brands now above five billion in revenue. The growth of MabThera largely coming from first line indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the maintenance setting, the longer treatment period. And indeed, in tracking the aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we're now out with the GELA study in France and Switzerland and Belgium to seven years' post treatment without the lines coming together. So this product is offering the word cure now into the vocabulary for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A hard act to follow, but an act to follow you'll find we are embarking on.</p>
          <p>Avastin at 37% growth worldwide here in the United States, as you would hear from my colleagues in Genentech, the uptake of the growth this last year, predominately in that launch of metastatic breast cancer. In Europe, we had a broadening of the label in colorectal cancer. And we also have in breast cancer good rollout, probably more modest so far of the uptake in lung.</p>
          <p>With Herceptin, we are now seeing the penetration in the five major European markets at 75%. That's a touch shy of the penetration that Genentech shared with you here in the U.S. A little bit more growth to go for there. But as I have presented in the past, one of the intriguing things is typical oncology, 50% U.S., 50% non-U.S. Herceptin, one-third U.S., one-third Europe, one-third rest of world.</p>
          <p>So with the stunning results that product offers, it is not proving to be a drama for people to pay for this, whether or not there is reimbursement in their country. We actually even saw the reimbursement of this product become an election issue in New Zealand. They were trying to contain the use to nine weeks and it became a major election issue and the Prime Minister had to say this will be reimbursed for a year. So good are the data sets that we have.</p>
          <p>Tarceva was plus 23%, good strong growth. And as I hope I evidenced earlier in the ATLAS study, we think there's more to go here.</p>
          <p>And for Xeloda, we had 13% growth. We saw expansion in the markets where we got in the XELOX data, the use of Xeloda plus oxaliplatin. This was delayed for some statistical analysis reasons here in the U.S. We're back on track and first quarter this year, we should be seeing Xeloda recommended for approval in that area, or approved, and then we can get going broadening the patients that can benefit from Xeloda.</p>
          <p>To exemplify the Avastin take-off, I share with you an external tracker called Synovate, looking at the top five European Union countries. And what I'd like you to take from these two charts, showing first and second-line in colorectal cancer are essentially three points. First of all, strong off-take, whether it's first or second-line setting. Secondly, you can see an inflection point coming in just about underneath where the word Avastin is on the left of your screen there and a bit more acute to the right of the A on the second line.</p>
          <p>This coincides with the expansion of the label in Europe on the one hand and allowing us to go many more patients. And also coincides with being able to put into perspective the Erbitux attack trying to use K-RAS as a positive predictor, as they went into ASCO and as we came out of ASCO, it was a negative predictor. So, further endorsing that Avastin is the first line of attack and that it should leave the use of the EGFR monoclonal antibodies to later lines.</p>
          <p>You can see &#x2013; sorry, the third point I wanted to make: more to go. The penetrations here at 30% in first line, 25% in second line are more modest than our colleagues here in the U.S. have achieved. So much more penetration to go.</p>
          <p>In terms of oncology late-stage pipeline &#x2013; I beg your pardon, let me go back. You've seen the real good responses in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This is important not only because it gets it on the label &#x2013; here in the U.S., there was a distinct use of the product off label. Outside of the U.S. in countries where the reimbursement is linked, this provides a real opportunity. And it also closes a small gate that was in the defense wall against one potential competitor that was choosing CLL as their approach to the market. The fact that we've now submitted and got first line utility in Europe registered and the second line, the REACH study, is now is submitted and our colleagues at Genentech are submitting both of the dossiers during the year we're in.</p>
          <p>Avastin in first-line metastatic, the RIBBON-1 study, we'll be filing also this year. As indeed will the SATURN study and ATLAS. A word of update on Herceptin, many people have asked because they knew there was a drug safety monitoring interim analysis on the second year of treatment of Herceptin in the adjuvant setting. That did happen towards the end of last year in November and they just said continue. Nothing to be done, nothing to be talked about.</p>
          <p>So, we continue and the good news for patients is that there were not enough events happening. The &#x2013; probably from a financial community point of view, the bad news is final analysis 2011. And as you know the pivotal point from out here is, does a second year of treatment of Herceptin add incremental benefit? If it does, we open the gate to a second round for ladies with breast cancer and for revenues.</p>
          <p>If it does not, then there's likely to be the question, particularly in resource restrained markets, would we ease back a little bit. And maybe a final, sort of pro memoria on this, because a number of people have been asking me in the last 48 hours about the duration of studies, MabThera started in the year 2000. We got the interim analysis in 2005 early, because the stats were so stunning and it's likely we'll have the final report in 2011. Some studies just take an inordinate length of time to keep going with the patients phase.</p>
          <p>So that's on that one. Let me just try and quickly cover some of the rest. Inflammation/autoimmune. Interestingly enough for Rituxan/MabThera is now up to 800 million is our best estimate of the revenues in rheumatoid arthritis. The people that are not responding or not tolerating the anti-TNF's. So off to real good roll there and globally, that's the market leader in that segment. We have Actemra now with six months on the market in Japan. Post marketing surveillance requires about 3,000 patients plus to be treated under pharmocovigilance settings, share the data of a duration of time period with the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. And ones that's cleared, then we can go more broadly into the population.</p>
          <p>Really interesting nugget of information though for you, that I've shared in London. When the 4,000 patients came through the Phase III programs, 98% of them wanted to continue with the therapy. And, of course, ethically, if people are stabilized we don't take them off therapy, they carry on. It's also good for us to get the longer term data from efficacy and safety. The other excellent point is only 3% of the patients have now come off therapy. So that's about 18 months to 2 years later.</p>
          <p>So really an extraordinary good performance. The people that respond, respond well, they like it. And we're hearing the same from the in-market use in Japan and we just started, as I mentioned in Germany, beginning of this year, in that rollout. Now relevant to also here in the U.S, you need to look at CellCept. Good year of growth of 13% and the only cloud in the horizon being the fact that the patent expires here in the U.S. May of this year.</p>
          <p>Typical at the moment of the cautious approach of the Food and Drug Administration. What we are seeing is that people are wanting to update the label to put anything, that's of any concern at all on to that label, while they still have the originator at the table. Easier to get that underway before there are multiple players. The other interesting thing is that out of the FDA Act 2007, we're been asked to put in place a REMS program, which than could be applied to subsequent entrance. So again, you're seeing a regulatory complexity, that's the rules of the game, we go with it. Not a drama. But also I would ask you take into account that adds complexity to incoming entrance.</p>
          <p>Also we've shared with you &#x2013; for you our best guess at the moment of the split between transplant and autoimmune diseases, really on the basis that in the transplant sector people that are stable and self helped, I think are unlikely to change quickly. People that are in the autoimmune sector, they may find more substitution at pharmacy level or the more typical expiry profile on the 30%. But I think you should expect a slower profile on the 70%.</p>
          <p>In virology, this has been in the U.S. and then Europe, essentially a market share gain game. There's quite a delay in expansion of the market. But here I'm pleased to say that my colleagues in the U.S. have now got to 70% market share. And we have also seen good volume growth coming from the emerging markets. So, we are winning this. We are the standard of care. Anyone with new molecules is wanting to work with us, and that's a pleasure and a privilege. And in addition to that, as you know, we have a couple of really interesting oral molecules that we're profiling both with Pegasys, one a protease inhibitor, the other a polymerase. And we are also the first company that's trying to get an answer to what's been intriguing many of you and many of the treatment physicians; is there a role for oral-oral? And so we do have a Phase I study on our polymerase and our protease in New Zealand, and we'll learn whether there is a roll &#x2013; this is in patient, is there a roll or an emerging concept that we can build on?</p>
          <p>In terms of outlook, the first one's really pro memoria, just to exemplify that low generic exposure that we have. The next one shows you the food for growth for the organization. Sometimes it's awfully easy when you see significant Phase III results to drop it down into the spreadsheet and look at it from the earnings per share. I have to tell you the journey from the first top line result, new registrations to rolling out into all world markets takes a bit longer. So, there's plenty of areas of the world where the approved indications will play out. We have CLL first-line to launch in Europe, relapse to get before the authorities, the rolling glioblastoma to launch both in the U.S. and Europe, first-line renal cell carcinoma here in the U.S., first-line metastatic breast cancer with docetaxel in Europe.</p>
          <p>And then, when we look at the Phase III starts in 2008, you see a rich balance of key products, many of which I've had the opportunity to share with you before. We see pertuzumab coming in to development now. For a while, we wondered if this product could be a replacement product to Herceptin. We found rather quickly in early studies, it's an enhancement on top of Herceptin. So we're profiling it in late stage metastatic breast cancer.</p>
          <p>In the earlier part of breast cancer, one of the decisions already taken with Genentech is to move TDM-1 into late stage cancer, the armed antibody that uses Herceptin as a homing device, operates its role on HER2 but also releases Rituxan at the tumor cell.</p>
          <p>We've seen ocrelizumab, which you know is in Phase III for rheumatoid arthritis as the fully humanized version, and also we've looked at results there to take it forward in lupus nephritis, and we're also expecting some Phase II results in those finding results in progressive multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>The ones on the left including our CETP and taspoglutide, our GLP-1, those Phase III started last year. Much of it will continue, of course, for the full year roll out. Taspoglutide, we should have the first Phase III results by the end of this year. And for dalcetrapib, as you know, it's a 15,000 mortality / morbidity outcome study. So this will take us towards 2013. What we have to be really thoughtful on and this is really the shopping list on the right, to start putting it on a radar screen, not all of these projects are going to make it.</p>
          <p>We will see Phase II, we have stringent requirements, what are the first-in-class, best-in-class, what's the hypothesis, how strongly can it be differentiated versus competition? And we will choose wisely what we need to go forward with. But just to show you the richness of the choice, we have an insulin growth factor, which at the moment is in Ewing's sarcoma Phase II. We need to be thoughtful on that data. It's a relatively crowded space. We have some of the Avastin work. GA101 is our glycosylated product. If you remember we bought a company called GlycArt. This has a third-generation anti-CD20. We've looked with ourselves with Genentech, with Biogen Idec, at multiple candidates here. This is the one that we've chosen. Genentech and Biogen have opted in to this program and we are now looking at how to intelligently take this forward, it's in Phase I, II. How do we get it into Phase III quickly so that we have this asset well profiled before Rituxan goes off patent?</p>
          <p>And then the final one, that will be an intriguing discussion, is on aleglitazar. Stunning results in Phase II across multiple dimensions and the question is this is still a PPAR. There is a regulatory reluctance. We've got some really interesting ideas about a group of patients to go for in discussion with the regulators. And we'll have some rich debates in the first quarter to half year to know how best we unlock the value from this molecule.</p>
          <p>So, just to give you a flavor of why we feel that we are in this countercyclic phase of the industry. Why we're discussing strongly, key candidates that can be the mid-term growth for this company, continue unlocking shareholder value.</p>
          <p>And finally, here is the scorecard for this year of some of the major clinical trials and a sighting shot of when they come in the year, of the filings that we are planning for and of the guidance that we have for that above market mid single-digit growth.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to hand across to J&#xFC;rgen Schwiezer to take you into diagnostics. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The Diagnostics Division continued its strong sales momentum, growing 10% in local currencies. Once again, this was faster than the IVD market growth, which is estimated at around 5%. Our operating profit margin decreased 5.3%, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, lower Diabetes Care sales and increased investments in the business. These investments however help contribute to our top-line sales.</p>
          <p>Three main drivers of our growth, were a strong increase in the number of instrument placements, a number of important product launches of both new tests and new automated systems, along with the strategic acquisitions made in '07 and '08. These investments will continue to drive our growth in 2009 and onwards.</p>
          <p>In 2008, the Diagnostics Division recorded sales of CHF9.7 billion, increase of 10% in local currencies, Professional Diagnostics, Applied Science and Tissue Diagnostics continued to drive growth, with all three clearly outperforming their markets. Diabetes Care declined 1% for the year due to the continued strong competition and price pressures particularly in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>Molecular Diagnostics had a good 5% growth, also in a strongly competitive market. Tissue Diagnostics grew 23% in local currencies on a standalone basis for the year, and contributed around 4% for the overall growth. All regions contributed to our growth, with a particularly strong contribution from Japan and the emerging markets. The established regions of North America and EMEA also grew above their market.</p>
          <p>Despite a strong double-digit increase in sales, our operating profit margin declined from 17.6% at the end of 2007 to 12.3% of sales. Our cost of sales increased primarily due to amortization of product intangibles along with some one-time charges due to our acquisitions over the last two years. In addition, we had a strong increase in instrument and meter placement, we expand market share. Both M&amp;D and R&amp;D increased due to investments made to develop acquired businesses, as well as increase investment to strengthen Diabetes Care.</p>
          <p>On the other side, G&amp;A decreased by 12% as a result of a number of programs aimed at rationalizing the business. You can see over half of the decline is due to the impact of recent acquisitions; the rest of the decline is due to increased investments to further drive the ongoing businesses along with portfolio mix effects and the lower contribution from Diabetes Care.</p>
          <p>To offset this, we have implemented a number of actions aimed at cutting costs and improving the profitability of the business. Examples include nearly all organizations we have a zero based budget process, as of September we have in place a head count freeze. We have initiated several efficiency programs aimed at reducing cost of goods. With these and other measures, we plan to improve our profitability while still ensuring that we continue to invest in the business for continued strong growth.</p>
          <p>Now looking into details of the business areas, the main growth driver behind Professional Diagnostics continues to be immunoassays with 19% growth for the eighth consecutive year. This is due to strong placements of the cobas 6000 and 4000 systems along with a continued uptake of our new assays, a number of which are first to market.</p>
          <p>And here you see a list of some new assays that we launched in 2008, as well as those we plan to launch in 2009, to not only close gaps in our menu but also allows us to enter new market segment.</p>
          <p>Roche now has one of the leading menus on one platform, keeping us ahead of the competition. This will continue to drive both system placements and reagent sales and strengthened our leadership in the largest IVD market.</p>
          <p>The Diabetes Care business declined due to continued competition and pricing pressure, particularly in the U.S. market. New products such as the Accu-Chek Aviva and Performa had double-digit growth and helped to offset the decline in the sales of the older products which now represent less than 30% of sales.</p>
          <p>We have also taken strong actions to return this business area to growth. We have strengthened our sales force both in number and in training and support to increase our commercial presence. We have initiated programs aimed at reducing our costs to compensate for the pressure on prices.</p>
          <p>Within manufacturing for example, such programs have already started to reduce our cost of goods. Over the coming months, we will launch a series of new products to increase our competitiveness in market segments where we currently have a low presence or there is an unmet need.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to announce that Molecular Diagnostics is returning to growth with the impact of the expiry of the foundational PCR patents almost washed out. Virology continued growing to automated real-time PCR platforms with the FDA approval of our automated HCV and HBV tests. Within the weeks of approval several large U.S. laboratories signed new contracts for viral load testing.</p>
          <p>The FDA also approved our multiplex HIV, HCV, HBV tests for blood screening. So, now we have a more competitive offering in the important U.S. market. Applied Science continued to outgrow the Life Science market with 19% growth. Sales of DNA sequencing products nearly doubled due to the ultra-fast Genome Sequencer with a new Titanium software which increases read length five times. And microarray systems contributed to the growth with the launch of new high-density arrays which are faster and more cost effective than conventional methods.</p>
          <p>And as you know, we completed the acquisition of Ventana in February, which forms a new business area, Tissue Diagnostics. Integration is completed and I'm pleased to report that strong and focused sales execution has ensured no slowdown growth. Commercial initiatives are well under way to expand the business especially Europe and Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, 2008 was a busy year with important launches in each of the business areas. 2009 is no less busy with a number of new platforms and innovative tests that will further strengthen our offering to our customers and will continue to drive our business.</p>
          <p>Due to this, the outlook for the Diagnostics Division for 2009 to continue to growth above the market in local currencies. And ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you that Roche is the clear number one in in-vitro diagnostic market with 20% market share, which is about 8% &#x2013; percentage points more than our next competitor.</p>
          <p>While focused on improving efficiencies in the laboratory combined with producing products that offer a clear medical value, we aim to stay number one and continue to gain market share.</p>
          <p>With that, I want to thank you and hand over to Erich.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, J&#xFC;rgen. Ladies and gentleman, it's a pleasure to be back with you here in New York. Let's have a look at situation at Roche Group level. On the left of this chart, I've built a bridge to what Bill Burns has shown you and I think some of you may remember several years ago, when we had a huge upswing of the Tamiflu pandemic sales, helping world governments putting together over 200 million in dosages to prepare in case of a bird plague.</p>
          <p>We told you that in the wind shadow of such an upswing, there is a huge risk or a huge temptation to build up fixed costs. And I hope that you also notice that as we didn't fall into this trap, sales decreased by comparison 1.6 billion, there is no fixed cost left, there is no impairment. We did this almost all with virtual cost structures and you see, this was also the driver of not having a stop and go policy &#x2013; going overboard in times where it could be defendable and then should stop and just make big cut.</p>
          <p>So if we look into the operational performance of the group, you see that the production side, the cost of our sales if you go into the small print absolutely under control with all our plants having a very modern setup and this few remaining very old ones actually to go. This is also a good sign and you have seen it in Severin's chart that the free cash flow has actually doubled in just three years. This is also a sign that the big CapEx investment program to bring this group into a very modern state is actually flattening out.</p>
          <p>And it shows now also in maintenance cost and production cost. And what you see still as the driver in the cost of sales line and I've realized that many of you look into the details of the financial report; you find all the elements there. Of course, successful products and successful ventures like with Glaxo on Boniva in the United States then show up by having their cost with the profit sharing on this cost of sales line.</p>
          <p>Also marketing and sales, I think one of the leanest organization and if you compare it, even if you with all our peers, we are now down to a level of customer support cost, I think, which &#x2013; society always expected this industry to go and we have hoped a lot and of course, also read a lot about R&amp;D investment, which is actually a really counter cyclical. Will &#x2013; I looked into it at a global scale.</p>
          <p>With this absolute amount of 8.8 billion Roche is now the number five of all companies R&amp;D investments into the future. And why are we number five, because many, many companies, which were ahead of us, are strongly cutting into innovation. And I don't want to become philosophically, but I think this generation has other obligation not only for sure to pass on a huge debt burden to our children and even grandchildren. But I think we should also have the courage to invest into the future and into innovation. And you see G&amp;A is under-control and is not growing.</p>
          <p>There was one big surprise and I apologize for this because it developed mostly &#x2013; mostly in the fourth quarter, apologize in advance that the development was that the Swiss franc was just or almost apart from the yen the strongest currency. And you see, we now and many of our friends and partners and the analysts set up; they got the U.S. dollar absolutely perfect, they got the euro absolutely perfect.</p>
          <p>And in the past, all the other currencies more or less net it out. But last year, we had a very untypical situation that in addition to the British pound losing, sorry Bill its former glory. Actually that also prompt the Brazilian real to Turkish lira, Korean won everything went down and this had a slightly substantial effect.</p>
          <p>But now also just not only seeing this on the negative, what does this mean ladies and gentlemen? This actually means that the Roche business in all these emerging markets is putting itself on, on the map. China in absolute terms &#x2013; Roche Pharma China is now the eighth largest market within Bill's area of responsibility. Though it's not only the currencies, which show up. It's &#x2013; the good news is our business and our position in these markets show up.</p>
          <p>So if we go to the financial income another situation where of course, we have to show a major downturn and I would like to address all these steps in detail.</p>
          <p>Of course, the big one I will take up in the next chart of 609, what you now see equity income down by 180 million. Bad news for 2008 but good news is that Roche sold almost all equities off at &#x2013; when in 2007 because we didn't believe in them and then you have this negative year-on-year effect. We have consequently delayed our debt and therefore the interest expenses went in a positive direction and I think to achieve in such a highly volatile environment, the positive currency effect on the ForEx situation of the group was actually not a bad situation.</p>
          <p>So let's look in this 609 million which where it was lower. Again, here it's actually a quite basic and very easy explanation, if you look into our liquid funds at a group level, we have really made major steps last year by acquiring Ventana, by increasing our stake in Chugai from 50 to 59.9% and by acquiring very clear targeted pharmaceutical companies which fit into our innovation network and this was altogether over 5 billion. So if you compare liquidity levels to be invested between 2007 and 2008 on the average we had more than 4 billion Swiss francs left to be invested.</p>
          <p>And then all &#x2013; I don't have to tell you the second half-year of 2008 was suddenly a situation where if you had 20 billion, more or less, to be invested, you cared more about do I get my money back, than how much returns do I get on our assets. And I think the fact that you see that's what the interest income has come down &#x2013; and maybe just one clear point, we are not going to increase the risk profile of our financial assets just to get some higher returns. That's absolutely out of question. We want to preserve this asset. And of course, within the risk taking we have agreed upon to generate reserve.</p>
          <p>We then have, of course &#x2013; we have occurred, if you have altogether in a group 20 billion to be invested, you have certain impacts of the financial crisis, but I leave it up to you to put these absolute amounts you see here into the relationship of the overall assets. Tax rate, very nice development; it actually has come down. And to really give you a hint for the next year, there were some very nice one-time effects in this calculation. So, please don't just extrapolate. If you add 1.5 percentage points, then you would be on the right side for next year.</p>
          <p>This brings the overall P&amp;L together. And yes, 2007 in the full bloom of Tamiflu pandemic was an exceptional and a record year in the history of the Roche Group, but if you look at the absolute terms, if you look at the percentages, at the ratios, I think the term that we say, 2008 was an excellent year for the Roche Group, can be supported.</p>
          <p>If we go into cash generation and many of you have heard me saying the cash flow statement is much more important than the P&amp;L, because the cash flow statement is the entrepreneurial picture of a company and the P&amp;L is distorted with a lot of accounting aspects. So what you see here, this is a group generating 12.3 billion in operating free cash flow.</p>
          <p>And then of course, we pay taxes and we pay dividends. But what you can see the free cash flow remaining to 5 billion, yes, last year we have reinvested into the future mainly as I mentioned into Ventana and building up our position in Japan, where as Bill pointed out, all our Roche products are now showing &#x2013; appearing to show up. The first years, we were together mainly were actually still supported by the Chugai product, but now as you could see very clearly also in the annex of the financial data in this presentation, quarter-by-quarter the Roche product now start to generate very nice returns out of the Japanese markets. This gets you to situation where this group stands. Roche has almost paid down every debt. There are just two bonds outstanding. One of them will be paid down in July this year, and then there is one single bond left on a long-term basis in British sterling.</p>
          <p>Equity, you can follow the movements actually very clearly. How this whole has developed, nothing surprising in this and maybe the last one is of course a balance sheet is a momentum where everything which the group owns around the world is mirrored and Swiss francs. And if the Swiss francs, as I just said, has strengthened against almost all currencies you have this aspect of translations, but over the last year it has gone up and down and it will go on. This is not &#x2013; nothing to worry I think.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet strong, and we are thinking of our shareholders; it's now the 22nd consecutive year that we intend to increase the dividend. The Board will suggest to the annual shareholder meeting of March 10 that we actually pay out a dividend of 5 Swiss francs to the shareholders.</p>
          <p>And you can see this is fully in line with our guidance on the payout ratio. And we are not forgetting our commitment. Last year, we had the commitment that for three years we intend to increase the payout ratio. So you see here number one and we keep our promise for the two consecutive years in the future.</p>
          <p>So this brings me to the guidance and in the interest of the Q&amp;A session with Severin we'll now start &#x2013; I won't read it for you again. Thank you.</p>

          <p>With regard to the Genentech acquisition or proposed acquisition. I was wondering if there is a middle ground that could be reached, whereby you would increase your stake to a certain level as such that you'd be able to achieve some of your objectives. But at the same time, leaving some shares outstanding such that there would be an autonomous Genentech shares for the employees to participate in. In a sense there would be independent culture that would satisfy those employees as opposed to having them rely on the promises that you've made to maintain the autonomy?</p>

          <p>I'll take the negative part and leave the positive part to Bill. We will &#x2013; the main patent expiry we will have this year is CellCept which expires in the U.S. in May 2009. If you look into our guidance for 2009, there we guide you with a mid single-digit growth versus the high single-digit growth in 2008. And this is one sector. And the second sector is the effect of the Ventana transaction where we had the full year benefit in 2008. And of course, this will wash out as we go into 2009. Bill on the positive.</p>

          <p>I've don't have today's hymn sheet. I was looking at chart 91, which is the major Roche managed project submissions, that's also I think a reasonable one. Looks like there is some &#x2013; so really to try and help in the answer to the question, there's a number of submissions that we have this year; Avastin, Herceptin gastric cancer. If the ToGA study reads out positively, that will be a new dimension to Herceptin.</p>
          <p>Tarceva in first-line for lung. Tarceva and Avastin, potentially Xeloda, we've got on adjuvant colon cancer that should read out if that's positive then we get there. And the key new product that is launched into world markets this year is Actemra into Europe. Last year we started in Japan, as I mentioned, this year into Europe and much of the rest of the world. What's also important usually for some of Latin America and Asia are the approvals in the home market, so the Swiss approval that we also have is linked to that rollout.</p>
          <p>Later this year, we'll have the &#x2013; I think November, December we should have the first readouts of taspoglutide our once weekly GLP-1. So I think there are a number of really interesting activities that are happening and in rollout and a relatively limited exposure for the next few years on the patent expiries.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can you dimension the spending on the Roche Pharma side in the coming year as you anticipate it? I look to two areas, first on the marketing, the products that have already been commercialized and have really attained tremendous uptake at this point. How much incremental spend do you need to put into those products versus allowing the incremental dollar to drop to the bottom line. Where is the marketing investment booked for this in the long term? And then on the R&amp;D side, can you help quantify to a greater degree how much R&amp;D is in basic research, how much R&amp;D is in late stage and where in &#x2013; just the increase investment comes from? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first answer the question on R&amp;D and then Bill perhaps will take over the question for the cost development for Pharma. Now if you look at the total R&amp;D spend about 80% is development, about 20% research. Again if you look into the development part about  over 60% is related to new molecular entities, which is actually quite surprising. If you look at the huge programs we are running with our existing franchises such as Avastin.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of our guidance for 2009, you have here mainly an effect, which translates forward from 2008, the fact that we have moved important programs like the CETP inhibitors; on this program alone, we have 15,000 patients. The fact that we have moved in GLP-1 by the second half of 2008, again 5,000 patients. That of course will create a full year effect as we go into 2009. And that is perhaps also part of the difficulties we have in guiding you over the longer term for R&amp;D because when we stood at the beginning of 2008, we knew that we were moving forward a number of projects.</p>
          <p>We knew that our investments in particular in oncology were not yet dropping off, but we were not sure whether we will move on with the CETP inhibitor. We were not sure whether we would move on with the GLP-1. We did some interim analysis before we took this decision because there is so much investment involved with it. So only now we can give you the certainty as we go into 2009, and what I can say is that it will be an over proportional growth of R&amp;D relative to sales. So the new programs, which will come in, in 2009 will have a lesser impact because they will phase in later in the year, and they will not hit the 2009 results to the extent they would actually hit the 2010 result, if they actually come through.</p>
          <p>On the other hand of course, as we go forward some of the current programs are starting to flatten off. That's how much I can give you of a feel at that time, how R&amp;D will develop and will be &#x2013; how many projects we actually can bring forward based on the outcome of them. Bill for the cost development.</p>

          <p>Maybe just to make it in shape terms building on the R&amp;D part here. I've seen &#x2013; if I start it with OROS, I saw many people in modeling, when we said we're at 18, 19%, we want to get to 25 within a three to five year period. It became almost a modeling exercise and then it &#x2013; there was a trajectory and a line of best fit and we went off into the sunrise. And there is a danger that some people do the same when it comes to the R&amp;D expenditures and just trend it and project it forward.</p>
          <p>What we're dealing with is not a percentage of sales that we're wanting to spend. We're talking about financing a rich late stage portfolio. So there is a bump &#x2013; there is a hump here that we have to get through to try and help build value for you folks, for all of us. So I think that's the deal on the shape. I have seen this corporation in the past go through a similar phase where we were at 23, 24% on R&amp;D for a two, three year period, and then it all sort of comes right again.</p>
          <p>So it's not unusual. Our colleagues in South San Francisco were up at 40, 50% for a while and I would remind you that we went through that as their principal shareholder, giving them security that they didn't have to go out and ask the investment community because they had the security of being part of the Roche Group and we even endorsed it and encouraged it. So I think there are times when you have to do what's right for the portfolio.</p>
          <p>On the other elements of the cost structure, marketing and distribution principally, what we've seen and folks modeled it well over the years, as the specialty care products grew in ascendancy, so the marketing and distribution as a percentage of sales comes down.</p>
          <p>Highly targeted field forces, highly targeted educational programs and structurally, when you have that infrastructure in place and then you bring in a Herceptin in early breast cancer, yes, a lot of educational work on top, but it's not a huge drama in terms of incremental invest to unlock the volume.</p>
          <p>So as we look forward here we'll have some &#x2013; we're building on that rich portfolio. We have, essentially I think Genentech has one field force in the States with Avastin. So the addition of the Xeloda field force from the Roche team, we are going to find there's plenty to be done educationally with the field forces here, which is one of the reasons we gave, with the July announcement, we need all the sales teams.</p>
          <p>Then, what are the inflection points that we need to be thoughtful of? Probably, next year, if all the data comes through as we want it on GLP-1, then we have to be thoughtful about, where is our competition? What's the share of voice? And indeed, how much capacity has our sales team in this country that is dealing with Boniva and internationally? We then can state we may need a bit more and it is not a drama, given the potential and the opportunity that's there.</p>
          <p>And the other one that's probably an inflection point is post 2012, when dalcetrapib comes through. And here we're placing a bet on saying, what is it that's going to really change the treatment paradigm? If this jumps the hurdle with the right signal that we're looking for, then we have a major change in medical practice to bring to the market. That will take us on one avenue. If, as I see at the moment, we're in the lead, then much of that educational role will fall on our shoulders. If &#x2013; and there is probably only one competitor that we see on the radar screen that's a bit behind us &#x2013; but if we're coming in first equal or there is one closely behind us, then there can emerge some share of voice war game that gets played. But, we don't need to consider that until probably 2011-12, when we are starting to get ready.</p>
          <p>And I think much beyond that, expect us to keep chipping away at, on informatics, on service centers, on getting more efficient in the handling of all the data in drug safety, in development. There is no stone untouched across the business. And one of the things that I really appreciate about being based in the middle of Europe is that there's this sort of feeling we can always do better and as we don't rest on our laurels, we haven't taken a surging of some sales to say, well, we don't need to do anything around for a while, let's just enjoy it. We've been chipping away at this, manufacturing will be the same. I hope that helps.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I just had a question getting back to DNA. It seems that there is a significant disconnect between what you are saying and what you are doing. You are saying that your focus is on completing the transaction. You are saying that you are focusing on innovation. You are saying that you are &#x2013; you have the financing in place. Your action is a reduction of the tender price &#x2013; a tender offer to 86.50. So I guess the question that I have is, if you are not talking to DNA shareholders, are you willing to allow them to dictate or value what DNA is worth?</p>

          <p>I had a question for Erich, you had mentioned that there was a bit of a surprise based on the strength of the, in the fourth quarter. As it pertains to 2009 guidance, you've guided flat on a constant currency basis, which would suggest that if currencies didn't change versus the average '08 rates, you would come in at 11.04, which was your core earnings in 2008?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the investment community was &#x2013; the investment community was surprised to the tune of 22 billion Swiss francs worth of your value. And so that &#x2013; something like that might be averted in the future, you've given guidance for constant currency EPS, core EPS to be flat. We all know that currency's changed in the fourth quarter. And so, on a reported basis, if nothing changed, can you just clarify and confirm to us that if nothing changed from where we are today, that numerically your guidance would solve for a reported Swiss franc core earnings that's below 11.04?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think the way it works &#x2013; are we good? Try it again. The guidance is calculated using the average 2008 exchange rates on our expected local currency numbers for 2009. But every single foreign currency in the world against the Swiss franc is exactly the same on an average rate during 2009 compared to 2008. And <mark type="audio gap" /> will be the same number that's embedded in the guidance. Is that &#x2013; that's what I think you're asking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's what you &#x2013; I think that's what you've already stated, which is that constant currency earnings will be flat. Additionally stated, that the biggest move was in the fourth quarter. Therefore, for the full year of '09, nothing changed as of February '09. Your local &#x2013; shouldn't say local &#x2013; your Swiss franc reported &#x2013; your reported earnings are not going to be at the same level. They are going to be down. And in the same way that we just experienced a little bit of a surprise &#x2013; the investment community about down earnings reported in Swiss franc, the same currency that your stock is denominated in, isn't it reasonable to believe that you are going to report down earnings in Swiss franc given that there was this dramatic change in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not necessarily because what we have done is &#x2013; the average rate &#x2013; the 2008 results are using the average rate for the whole year. And we've used that same average rate on our local currency estimates for 2009 including the hit of the fourth quarter. Of course that's only on average rate over a whole year, so it's not a sort &#x2013; don't get a 100% hit. So if you take for example today's spot rates and use those, they are not the same as the average rates during 2008. They really did &#x2013; and we can't say where the average rate's going to be for the whole year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of questions on the Genentech transaction &#x2013; no, I'm just kidding. On the &#x2013; can I ask, number one, I am thinking about the way we should be modeling Avastin for adjuvant colon cancer that marked that uptake, is it &#x2013; why does Herceptin in the adjuvant setting have penetration around 75%? And is that a starting point or when we begin to think about market modeling for Avastin colon setting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill you want to take this one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the advice I would give you here is that, it really all depends on the strength of the signal that comes through. So what is it that we are expecting, what is it that it's powered for? Both the C-08 study and the AVANT study, the two principal ones that have been first with colorectal have a hazard ratio I think of 0.77. And that should result in &#x2013; if that has met, of today's standard of care which is about 78% of patients getting a three year disease free survival. But already that's probably higher than some of the patients had in breast cancer at the aggressive end of the spectrum of HER2-positive. So you have a higher standard of care that we're trading off in colorectal than we have in breast cancer. Then if it reads out it should move that needle by five percentage points to about 82, 83. And on that basis, we believe that shifts the needle sufficiently that there would be a significant adoption.</p>
          <p>Now then, what we don't know, none of us know, there is no inside scoop here from anyone, is will it jump that hurdle? And there if you go back to the analogy with Herceptin, Herceptin was stopped early because the hazard ratio was way lower than the predefined endpoint that was in the study. So in other words, the impulse of signal was so much stronger, its hazard ratio was 0.455, something like that. So it was hugely stronger impulse onto a lower benefited baseline. So you saw a rapid adoption. If we're talking about five percentage points increase, then I think it will have its own shape and adoption.</p>
          <p>Now we then still have to be &#x2013; I think it's the other thing by analogy, if we were going to have a stunning outcome isn't it likely that we would have read out earlier? So we're more likely to be seeing the clinical end-point, yes or no. And then, this is true of all studies when you look at the statistics of it &#x2013; there is still a very real chance that the hazard ratio may be 0.8, 0.82, whatever. That could still be statistically significantly important. But it would reduce the inflection from five percentage points for patients back to maybe 4, 3, whatever. And then you've got a different debate about how prepared are people to move their clinical treatment for that small number of people and the costs will factor in. And so you have a greater complexity probably to contend with than we had with the uptake of Herceptin in breast cancer. Hope that's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. And if I may, just a quick follow-up on &#x2013; and this is my last, I promise. The AVANT trial, can you just help us understand &#x2013; that trial's in-house at Roche, is any &#x2013; is there any employee at Roche that knows the ongoing efficacy data from that trial?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is as tightly controlled as any other clinical study. There is an independent drug safety monitoring board and we have no more insight into that study than we have into NSABP C-08. So there is no inside track record here at all. Maybe just to &#x2013; since we're on the subject and to remind everyone in the room &#x2013; the clear difference was that C-08 was to be tracked on a six month calendar basis, which allowed a much greater insight and predictability in the investment community as to, was this a potential inflection point on the announcement?</p>
          <p>The AVANT study is virtually the same design. One extra arm to cover Xeloda. But it's event driven. So there is no chronological clock to follow. We need to wait until a certain number of events happen, then the independent drug safety monitoring group open the box, close the box again and move on. We had a few &#x2013; just for completeness, there was a short period of time when that study was stopped, investigated, more to do with an imbalance within the patient population coming in and then restarted again, fully completed in recruitment. In 2010 that should read out.</p>
          <p>And then maybe a final, final point just so that we're all on the same page. A regulatory authority, if they're interested in a single study, it usually needs to have a very clear appropriate output. So probably has a ratio of 7:7, I think we can certainly talk. If it's a weaker signal, and it may still be statistically significant, it is much more likely that a regulatory authority wants a second confirmatory study.</p>
          <p>So that's &#x2013; and I just want us all to be on the same page, because somehow in recent weeks and months, there's been a shorthand version of reportage that says there's a binary moment coming up Avastin in adjuvant, yes or no. And I think it will be much more complicated than that, because we've only talked about colorectal cancer.</p>
          <p>Then there's the two studies that's started in 2007 and 8, breast cancer HER2 positive, HER2 negative, and then the results of the large collaborative study here in the U.S. in lung, which actually has been slow recruiting and we're really trying to help them to increase the recruitment, but it has been slow.</p>
          <p>That's the complete story, the whole nine yards.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well sadly, in trying to help you with guidance, I need to know what the strength of the signal is to begin with? Because you really &#x2013; if you don't know the strength of the signal and how significant it is in medicine, it's difficult to start to model truly, predictions. So for our own business plan we do some Monte Carlo simulations. We don't just go for single point. Because if it's five percentage points of patients' improvement, I think there'll be a more dramatic uptake than if it's only a two percentage point improvement.</p>
          <p>If it's two percentage points, then doesn't that influence how long you treat for, because it's expensive versus the health economics. Somehow, I think we need to wait and I'm as intrigued as everybody else is. But hopefully in a matter of weeks, we'll at least have some read-out on the first study.</p>
          <p>You heard that, first of all, the study as it was running had more patients in the later stage three, stage four. And since events are more likely to happen more quickly with that group, that brought the entire reportage forward one year.</p>
          <p>Genentech's announced a further refinement in that, in that NSABP would like to see if they can get the result for submission to ASCO. They're not going to alter anything, except check around with the centers to say, are there more recent cases that we haven't got in the central system yet, and try and get an understanding of the read-outs.</p>
          <p>But I think this is the sort of discussion I'd be more happy to go into when we know the strength of the signal, then we can start to speculate a bit more on adoption rates, okay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a question pertaining to slide number 23, the presentation of the penetration of Avastin in colon cancer. As I look at it &#x2013; and I want to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly &#x2013; is the right interpretation that the penetration in colon cancer is the sum of first-line and second-line in Europe? Or is there some elements that are retreated in the second-line so the total penetration would be lower than the sum? And then, as you're looking at it, a couple other thoughts come to mind. First is, it looks like there is an acceleration in both first-line and second-line use. Could you talk about what's driving that? What's the ultimate penetration you think will likely be? And finally on that note, the year-over-year growth, the quarterly growth that Roche reports for Avastin in the world is decelerating in fact, as the product matures. But graphically, on the slide, it looks like there is actually an increase or an acceleration in Avastin penetration and we should also &#x2013; I think there would also be elevating penetration in the rest that are relatively new. If I reconcile the reported year-over-year growth with <mark type="audio gap" />? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the first marker, my understanding is it's in some of the backups for you. That first line metastatic colorectal cancer in the United States, Genentech is taking about 73% penetration. So there you have a certain maker of what one should be targeting towards overall. Then my understanding in the European EU5 out of these two charts is that second line would include those people that are retreated with Avastin. So it's taking the first line, then there's a pause, then there will be the second line. In that pause, we still need to know what is the role for Avastin what's latent and all of that.</p>
          <p>Third point, there is an inflection, which as I mentioned it really &#x2013; it started probably in about quarter one '08 going through the year and yes, it came in about quarter three, four in the second line setting. And the growth rates that we're talking about in Europe, rest of world go 78, 78, 67, 52. We're still talking about a deceleration at a very high rate and arithmetically, I think that's absolutely fine if we try to include the two together. The two are from different data sets, there may even be a time lag in the way they link together.</p>
          <p>So I think that was why I was saying good strong off take, more to go, and an inflection level that came from the expansion of the label.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you, Bill. Next question.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions on Avastin as well. For the C-08 study, when you announce the data, assuming it is positive, do you expect to provide the disease-free survival data with that press release, given the importance of that data to DNA shareholders? And then the second question, just in terms of potential &#x2013; your assumptions for timelines with the adjuvant lung and adjuvant breast studies, and does a positive C-08 study increase your internal probabilities of success for those studies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think to your first question, the study has been run by the NSABP. What would be absolutely typical would be for them to announce, has it met its end point or not? And then the data would be released at an upcoming medical conference. Now in this case, my understanding for ASCO '09, mid April is the drop dead moment for late breaker submission. They've clearly said they'll try, but then if they haven't got the event rate, they're not going to prejudice the study. They will continue until they have the data and then announce accordingly.</p>
          <p>This study, I am afraid to say ladies and gentlemen, is not run for the benefit of the financial community, it's run for the benefit of patients. And the data has to go out in the appropriate time and in the appropriate way. We, neither Roche nor Genentech, is in control of what's in that announcement.</p>
          <p>Secondly, let's work on the assumption that it meets its end point, then I'm encouraged that we just keep going with the program as we have. If you take an assumption that it doesn't fully &#x2013; or it meets the statistical significance but is a weaker signal, then as ever in any clinical trial anywhere, we will deepen our understanding of that and know, was it do with the patients that were in some other issues and try and understand it, to see if there's anything we need to incorporate into any of the other running programs.</p>
          <p>So I don't think that I can say yet whether it increases, decreases. Certainly, we have gone forward with the other programs on the basis that's the powering of first studies, what do we need to do if we want a similar signal in breast and lungs? And for the timing of those studies, they will be event driven. So where we sit today, one of the breast studies started in 2007, one started in 2008. You're a while away, folks, from those studies reading out.</p>

          <p>So again it brings &#x2013; by disposal trial just don't know yet. Do we have other questions? Not another Avastin question. Okay than we go for this one again.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. In the interest of asking one question at least for diagnostics, what are you seeing in terms of purchase of large capital equipment both, and if you can trust in terms of both the Europe and U.S.?</p>

          <p>I think in general we are normally placing instruments, this I would say 90, 95% of our instruments of placed. And so we are not really affected. So far, we have not seen any change, any impact in these things the fourth quarter was for diagnostics excluding diabetes very strong quarter. Of course, diabetes is totally different situation and we have seen already in the third quarter a certain impact.</p>

          <p>For the sake of time, perhaps one more question before we go into the breakout session. Is there one more question? Then we close here the session in the plenum. The pharmaceuticals breakout will be in Plaza suite. There will be signposts. Diagnostics in the Promenade Suite. Accounting in the State Suite. And for the strategy and finance session, Erich and myself will remain in this room.</p>
