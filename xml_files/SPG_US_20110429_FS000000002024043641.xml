      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning, everybody. Welcome, we're glad you took time away from watching the royal wedding and we're pleased to report FFO of $1.61 per share for the quarter, an increase of 14.2% over the first quarter of 2010 and in comparing that that takes into account the loss on extinguishment of debt that we had in the first quarter of 2010. Our quarterly results exceeded the First Call consensus by $0.07 per share. Total sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $500 per square foot, up 8.2% as compared to $462 per square foot as of 3/31/2010. Please note that this $500 per square foot is on more than 52 million square feet of GLA. As of 3/31, occupancy was 92.9%, 70 basis points higher than the year-earlier period.  On the releasing spread for the rolling 12 months was a positive $5.11 per foot.</p>
          <p>Beginning in 2011 we changed our reporting of spreads comparing opening and closing rents on a same space basis. This statistic is now also based on total base rent which is minimum rent plus the common area maintenance charge or CAM and we believe this new methodology will help give investors a better economic picture of certain of our leasing activity. Our releasing spreads always have been and will be under the new methodology will include all in-line space including spaces larger than 10,000 square feet. So it's all in-line space that that's compared to.</p>
          <p>Comparable property NOI growth was 2.3%. We believe just to highlight a few things; first of all, the growth in the quarter was a virtually 100% increase was driven by rents. In addition, to just compare the Q, not to get overly worried too much from one quarter to the next, but when you compare Q1 2010 to Q1 2011, I would just keep in mind that in '11 we had significantly higher snow removal expense in the first quarter of this year as well as you recall last year we had our credit loss was actually a recovery and this year we actually had bad debt expense. When you put the two together and normalize those, our comp NOI growth would be over 100 basis points higher than the 2.3% that was reported.</p>
          <p>Capital markets, we've been busy as always. We closed or locked rate on nine new mortgages totaling $962 million. Our share of that was $543 million. The weighted average rate on the loans is 5.3% and the term, weighted-average term is 9.4 years.  During the quarter we also paid off $282 million of unsecured debt with our cash and we end the quarter with $937 million of cash on hand including our share of JV cash and our credit availability on our facility is $3 billion for a total liquidity position of nearly $4 billion. And as you know, in '11, we expect to generate more than a $1 billion of cash after dividends.</p>
          <p>Development activity, we're pleased with this on a number of fronts. First of all, we opened our second Premium Outlet in South Korea, Paju Premium Outlets, located approximately 50 minutes northwest of downtown Seoul. Early reports of been extremely favorable and the center is 99% leased at opening. And just put it in perspective, our Yeoju Premium Outlets in South Korea continues to perform exceedingly well. It is 100% leased and generates sales of $875 per square foot in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>We also completed the expansion renovation of Las Vegas Outlet Center and in conjunction with that, we've rebranded it Las Vegas Premium Outlets &#x2013; South, and is located on the Las Vegas Strip near the McCarran International Airport. We have two new developments under construction, both Premium Outlets: Johor in Malaysia, which will open in November of this year; and Merrimack in New Hampshire, which will open in the summer of 2012, but I'm really pushing for the spring of 2012. But that's another story.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we started construction on 9 renovation projects and now have a total of 10 under construction and in 2011, we've been obviously very busy. We plan to open 32 new anchors and big boxes including Herberger's, Kohl's, Carson Pirie Scott, Target, Dick's, <mark type="ph" /> Alta (7:31) Marshalls and hhgregg just to name a few, which I did, and we currently have eight anchor or box deals scheduled to open in 2012. Details on cost, returns and timing for these projects are provided in our supplemental reporting package.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to Japan for a moment. Obviously we're very concerned about the people and what's happening there, but to give you some perspective, our portfolio is comprised of eight properties: four in the South, three in the Tokyo market and one in the north. You will recall that we own a 40% interest in these assets with our well known and esteemed colleague and partner, Mitsubishi Estate. Sendai, the smallest of our Japanese assets was damaged by the earthquake and has been closed since the earthquake.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, repairs are currently underway and we expect the reopening in mid-June of this year. Cost to repair the center after the payment of our deductible are covered by insurance.  Since the earthquake, three of our properties outside of Tokyo, Gotemba, Sanyo and Ami have been allowed to operate only eight hours per day due to the rationing of electricity. This ended yesterday and the centers have reverted to their regular 10-hour operating schedule. However, given the environment there this could be subject to change.</p>
          <p>It is too early to gauge the short-term impact of the earthquake, tsunami and damaged nuclear facilities to our business. Sales of the centers near Tokyo have been below year-ago levels since the quake. As things settle down in Japan, we expect these highly productive, high-quality Premium Outlets to revert back to historical trends. However, we anticipate that softness will continue for the remainder of 2011.</p>
          <p>Not to be undone by that earthquake, on the good news I will talk a minute about Opry Mills. As you know, we had a historical flood that ravaged Nashville and submerged Opry Mills and flooded it with several feet of water in the mall. The good news is we've reached an agreement with our lenders to finance the restoration of the mall. Opry Mills and its lenders will continue the litigation to have our insurers comply with their obligation to pay all the amounts they agreed to in the event of a flood loss. Repairs and rebuilding the landmark property have begun and is expected to open in the spring of 2012. Most of the previous anchor tenants have committed to be part of the reopening and many of the previous inline stores have committed to the restored Opry Mills.  In addition, many new tenants have agreed to come to open stores at the property.  We expect, on a stabilized basis, to exceed the NOI that was in place prior to the flood.</p>
          <p>Based upon our results for the quarter and expectations for the balance of the year, today we increased the low end of our 2011 FFO guidance by $0.10 per share and raised the top end by $0.05. This increase is, in guidance, reflects the improving business conditions we are seeing in the U.S., our ability to execute our game plan. However, it is partially offset by the uncertainty in Japan and the continued closure of Opry Mills.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me just mention some management additions. We have recognized that we are very focused in maintaining our leadership position and our desire to execute on many fronts so that we can continue to deliver sector-leading growth. We can and should add to our executive team. So accordingly, we welcome two new additions to the ranks of executives, <mark type="ph" /> David Contis (12:00) Steve Fivel. David will lead our regional mall platform, working with me and Rick, and assisted by John Rulli. His first day on the job is next Monday. I'll be out of town, by the way, just to &#x2013; so. Steve Fivel has been here since March and he's assisting Jim Barkley, our General Counsel, in all the areas he oversees. We've all known <mark type="ph" /> David (12:27) and Steve for many years and we're very happy to add them to our team to continue our contributions that we expect them to do.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we had a very good quarter, another one in our long string of successful quarters. And we're ready for questions and answers.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. A couple things. First of all, looking at the leasing spreads, they picked up considerably from the year-end mark, up from about 4% to 10%. If we're thinking about that, is that more driven by say the fourth quarter of '09, just the dropping out of the mix of low rent openings? Or is it more driven by, you had a good second half of the year 2010 in terms of sales, good 2011 so far, so really the opening rent levels are kind of picking up there more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it's more of that. It's a 12-month period of time, so it's representative of what's going on. But look, demand is better, we're able to generate better rents. It's still a very difficult process in doing that, but we've got a good group of people and a very good portfolio. And when you put the two together, we're able to drive rents.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, okay. Over the last couple of quarters, you put some money to work in terms of mortgage investments. Can you talk a little bit about that? Is that more investments that we should think of as short term, putting capital to work, and you're getting a nice return on it and at some point you get the money back? Or is it more along the lines of, there's a shot of getting to the real estate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, given &#x2013; you know, we did it initially with both in mind, but the odds are, based upon what's happening in the capital markets, that we'll probably just get paid in par.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question, I mean sales growth has obviously been pretty good over the past year or so. I mean, how far away do you think we are from new development on the traditional mall side? You've been active obviously on the outlet side. But is that something that you're thinking about more these days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see it in my &#x2013; I think it was in '07, maybe it was early '08, I'd said a decade away back then, so I may have been a little over dramatic, but we, Rick you can comment on this, we just don't see new full price retail being built anytime in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think that one of the other companion trends to that is that the retailers as their demand for space picks up are being accommodated by redevelopments and expansions of the existing square footage and properties. So the existing properties are getting a lot stronger, and that in turn is going to make it even more problematic to institute new development going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan of Cowen. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. David, one of your peers in this quarter talked about buying anchor boxes, and I'm just curious if that's something, I'm sure you've been doing it all along, but I'm just curious if you've seen more opportunity to do that now? Or if you're being more aggressive if the opportunities arise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know I will tell you, Jim, that it's standard operating procedure here to reclaim the boxes that anchors that some of our tenants might have owned that closed. So the strategy is not all that different. You know, we like to have tenants kind of secured. We like to drive a tough bargain on it. So it's not &#x2013; we don't call it kind of newsworthy events, it's just kind of standard operating procedure that if we have the ability to buy it and re-tenant it, we will if it makes economic sense. Rick, you can add to that, but we've done a lot of it over the years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to that point, if you think about our portfolio in the industry, over the years we've had the May Macy merger. We had Lord &amp; Taylor abandoning substantial stores; we had Montgomery Mall abandoning many stores, Parisian.  Over the years we've redone about 75 department stores, and you can go back in all of our 8-Ks and all of that activity is tracked. And in virtually every instance we have ended up with a replacement that is stronger, but to David's point, we like to know what we're going to do with the box before we acquire the box, and we want to make sure that we're getting an appropriate return on that capital investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of the, you know, Jim, and you can see this in our 8-Ks over the period of time, but we're doing 32 box deals in '11. Some of those were purchased boxes, some were lease expirations, some were lease buyouts. So that's just standard operating procedure here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, kind of a related follow-up question on this point, you've talked on several calls now for a long time about the double-digit returns you get from this kind of box redevelopment activity that you've done, and Rick you've talked about it in detail over the years. And then if I connect that, trying to connect the dots if you will, to the culling of the portfolio issue, this was talked about on the last call and in reference to cap rate movement, I think you, David, indicated that you saw cap rates becoming attractive on potential sales opportunities, and, of course, you're in the market with a couple of assets today. Is there much opportunity? Or do you ever connect the two, i.e. you look at doing a big box renovation with the intention of generating a double-digit yield with the intention of selling that asset when completed to a buyer that likes that type of property?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All the time. Let's just talk an example. If we have a &#x2013; take in theory a mall that you could sell at an eight-cap rate and we redevelop the box at a six, we've lost value. If we redevelop that box at a 10 and we think it's an eight-cap asset, then we've created value. So we always take a difficult economic review of the redevelopment opportunities. So the simple answer is absolutely. And sometimes, you want the ability to redevelop the box to sell the asset, so again that just factors into what we're trying to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of Macquarie. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So lately there's been a lot of talk about big box retailers downsizing their square footage and I think you guys have a great perspective on this because you own both type of retail properties. On the margin, do you see some of that coming into the malls going forward minus Best Buy Mobile retailer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly there are some that are playing around with the size of their store. Old Navy is a good example of that.  They went through a pretty significant period where they started at one size grew to another size and I think they are reverting back to kind of their original roots. I think some of the bigger category killer types, the Best Buy's of the world, are all looking at their footprint. We expect that some of the bigger stores ultimately will try to increase their efficiency, so we're very aware of that. And I'd say, sure, there are a number of retailers that are looking at the size of their box and what it needs to be going forward. Rick, I don't know if you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would just say on the specialty store side there's no consistent pattern. For every one tenant that says well, I was 8,000; I think I want to be 6,500 in my new prototype. We have others that are saying we were at 6,000 we need to be 10,000. It's really a function of the momentum in that particular business, the number of lines that they're introducing that they want to incorporate into their stores, and the way they want to configure their stores. So I don't think that it is a broad-based trend across the retail space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And second question, as you're sitting down with tenants during these  negotiations have tenants started to already start to show some level of concern regarding commodity price increases and not just gas prices from the retail sales standpoint but maybe on a commodity input front like cotton prices which have doubled in the past year. Is that putting pressure on margins and maybe your ability to keep occupancy costs up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look. I think their attitude right now is they believe they can pass that on and I think this year, we'll get a good sense of whether they're capable of doing that. And if that's the case then I think its business as usual.  If they are unable to pass that on, they are going to naturally look at other areas that &#x2013; to reduce their operating expenses and it may come after &#x2013; they may come after the landlord community. But up to this point we have not seen it and you know our defense to that is that we have great assets and good people and we can hold our own in that kind of discussion. But at this point, they seem to think, it's not universal, but they seem to think that they can pass it on and the consumer is willing to pay for the good as long as the consumer sees value in that good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just add that historically, the tenants will bring forth any fact that they can put on the table to try and argue for lower rent and we will as David said, we'll do what we can to argue for what we think is fair rent, and this is nothing new. Today it could be raw materials, three years ago it could have been healthcare, it could have been gas prices, whatever the external circumstances that can broaden the discussion, they will do and I think our results show as David has said we can hold our own in those conversations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and last quick question. Your <mark type="ph" /> lease price did (25:07) increase pretty significantly. I was wondering if you could give just the first quarter 2011 lease spread itself without doing <mark type="ph" /> trailing (25:15) 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we look at it on a yearly basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. Thank you.</p>

          <p>With sales up as much as they are now year-over-year and obviously occupancy trending up 70 basis points, where do you think you are now in terms of your ability to push rent versus retailers? And I guess how are they responding just given your sort of focus on top assets?</p>

          <p>Well, look, I don't like to talk about our negotiations with our clients in the public domain. We're trying to create a fair deal for us and for them. And, as I said earlier, it is still &#x2013; it is still a challenge with the retailers. They're very focused. The impact of the great recession is not that far from their mind, and so we've got a &#x2013; we've got to deal with that fact. And you've got to try and create a win/win.  So the good news is the environment's better, we are able to increase our rents and we're trying to find that right deal. And the good news is our occupancy costs for the outlets and malls together is at a 12.2% for the first quarter, and that's pretty good. So we're in good shape. In a lot of cases, we're under-rented and in those cases, we think we can still be able to increase rents and create profitability for the tenants.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I think we have so much to do that we wanted another aggressive, thoughtful, energetic real estate guy on the team to do what we want to do. So we look at it as another experienced set of hands to get the job done. And beyond that, no. He'll be a great fit. He'll work a lot with Rick. Between &#x2013; the way those two talk I'll hopefully be able to get a word in edgewise. That's why I'm leaving the first couple of days next week. But, no, he'll be great and other than that, I just think we've got a lot to do. The other thing for David, he has had a good experience internationally, so that's like a gift with purchase in terms of him coming on board. Wouldn't surprise me if he or we find an opportunity internationally because of his involvement and he just loves this business, and you want to have guys that love this business on the team.</p>

          <p>Hey.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up on a prior comment. I see what you're saying about expansions, redevelopment, creating more space in better performing malls to accommodate retailer growth, but if you're a retailer like Abercrombie or Ann Taylor and you're already in all the better malls in the country and you're actually closing stores in underperforming malls, how do you grow from here? Is it new concepts? Is it street retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I think for Abercrombie, it's obviously international, but we're doing a lot of business with Ann Taylor, so they obviously feel like there's places for them to go in existing portfolios. A number of these retailers are also looking to get in in the outlet sector to grow. I mean Bloomingdales is a great example of that. I think we have three out of the first seven or eight, right Rick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So some are looking to international. You know it's interesting, when we first invested internationally we did it in '98 and the theory was our U.S. retailers would go abroad. We didn't realize it would take them 12 years to do it, but thankfully even though it took them 12 years to get there, we made a lot of money in our pursuit of international expansion. So they are finding avenues to grow. I still don't think though, Christine, I still don't think the demand is so great that it will foster new full price ground-up redevelopment. And when I say it won't, there is always going to be maybe a deal here or there that get done, but in order to get that done, you're going to have to have economics from our standpoint, those economics probably to motivate the retailers to take a risk would be something for us that would be very hard for us to underwrite vis-&#xE0;-vis the other areas that we can invest our capital. But that could change. And I expect it to change, but I don't think it'll change in the next year or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just in response to that question in terms of how they grow, and David alluded to this, most of our retailers are now very engaged in brand extensions.  So Gymboree is growing with Crazy 8.  J.Crew is growing with Madewell and Crewcuts. We've got American Eagle that is working with us on 77kids, and those are just a couple of examples. And when they are rolling out brand extensions, they are using the metric of their existing stores' performance. So they are going to want to open their new brands where their existing brands are already successful. And that is obviously playing right into our strength.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just to follow-up on your outlet comment, aside from Merrimack, have you guys announced any other projects in the U.S. in the pipeline? And can you just generally comment on sort of the uptick in potential supply growth for outlets in the U.S. as more developers are targeting sites and starting new projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look. We have not announced the construction of any new outlet. I know it's mostly public knowledge, we are looking and working in Galveston, Texas, and we think ultimately there'll probably be &#x2013; the market there can only really support one outlet, and you've got that in process. Will see what happens there, but we're working on other sites, but we really don't have anything at this point. When I say other markets, but we really don't have anything at this point to announce. But we're confident that we'll be able to find some other avenues to build ground-up. And I think in that market, in that sector there is more demand to build some, but there's not going to be a lot of these built, because even with the outlets in mind, the retailers are very disciplined in where they want to go and on what basis they want to go. And you've got competent developers like us and Tanger and others that understand that dynamic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just lastly, can you talk about how you're approaching shorter-term one to three-year leasings versus a couple of years ago? So what percentage of your leasing in the quarter was three years or less excluding temp tenants?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have in the leases that were signed in the first quarter, we had two years or less was 19%, which is the same percentage that we've been reporting historically. We are doing &#x2013; so it hasn't really changed. What we are doing is when we determine our term in our negotiations with our tenants, we're looking at whether we think it's the right use, the right rent, the right tenant in that space. Do we have space that's next to it that's maturing in the next year or so? There are a lot of factors that go into that term discussion and it's something that we're very focused on but there has not been a material increase in our short-term leasing in the last several years and so we're pretty much normalized going into this part of the cycle.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just looking at the Mills portfolio as you look back to that transaction can you give us effectively a report card of how progress has been made? And what would you want to do or what do you want to do with the Mills portfolio going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would tell you that I think the Mills &#x2013; there are 17 Mills. We only show 16 because one is under construction that being Opry and it's exactly -- the underwriting is exactly what we thought it would be. There's a couple that we knew going into that deal that were very difficult but the way as you remember, Cedrik, Mills didn't have much equity if at all in those, a couple that were tough and we're making progress on those couple that are tough but the fact is they contribute very little cash flow to us and they are on our books for essentially nothing. The others have gone very well and we've done a great job of improving them and we're -- we feel</p>
          <p>very good about the concept. We've added full price, we've added outlets, we've added boxes, we're close to announcing a full line department store in one or two or three of them.  Sawgrass Mills, we've done a great job of executing the outdoor high-end outlets there.</p>
          <p>We've also, you'll notice a decrease in the occupancy, that's really associated with getting back the one anchor there, the Wannado in Sawgrass which we've got great development plans that will increase the cash flow. We think of that center by $4 million to $5 million just on redeveloping that box. So aside from the two that we always thought were tough that were not great, great locations, we've actually been pleased with it. <mark type="ph" /> Fairlawn's (38:50) been a very good partner with it and it's gone according, essentially according to plan.</p>
          <p>The good news on the mall side is that we have a big redevelopment that's going to be announced next week, so we can't announce it this week on one of the malls and we've also started major work in Southdale. So we are making really good progress on the malls. And we've been pleased with it and it's gone according to what we thought with the major markets, Potomac, Gurnee, all of those kind of going somewhat better than initially expected. And frankly surviving relatively unscathed a great real estate recession.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then so in terms of the 16 Mills themselves do you want to move even further <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:59) outlets for those properties over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We think we're adding more outlets there. Usually they're in such great, dominant super regional mall locations that we're going to do both full price and outlets in some of them. In others we think we can move even more with outlet concept.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Quentin Velleley is here with me as well. Rick, just a question on the leasing spreads, and I appreciate the new detail, I guess when you look at total leasing, how much of that was in the quarter? Because I guess moving now to same space but increasing to above 10,000 reduces the square footage that's being shown on the page. And so I'm just curious when you look at the totality of it, what sort of the trends were like in opening and closings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, it's Steve. Part of your question is correct, the premise is correct, we did move the same space, but we have always disclosed all GLA, all small shop GLA in our leasing statistics. But to answer your question the $5.8 million that we included on the same space basis is about 75% of our total leasing activity over the trailing 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess when you look at the totality of that 8 million square feet opening and closing would the spread increase or decrease from that up 10, just to get a perspective of same space is very important, but I'm wondering if we can get perhaps both of them so that we can really understand the impact it is to the bottom line on the totality of the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, if we had included a cut at 10,000 feet or 15,000 feet, the smaller spaces -- I thought it was-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is, if you included all retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it still would be substantially higher spreads. It would still be higher spreads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just didn't know if it was higher than 10? Or how much meaningful if you include all the leasing that you had completed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's 75% of the total population, so it's not going to move it a ton, but it would be higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think you see that in where the average base rent is going to, right? So that's why that number is still out there, because we want people to see what's happening with our average base rent. That takes everything into account, our renewals, extensions, new deals, et al. and that's why that number is still out there to be shown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you think about the Mills platform and the benefits that you've been able to do since you bought it, you do have a partner, and any time you have a partner and rather than owning it and a partner who's not going to be a long-term owner of real estate, retail real estate like you are, it does set it up for -- you eventually have to pay for all the improvements that you did. Obviously in a fair and negotiated way I guess. How will that venture eventually be resolved? And sort of the timing of doing that? Do you envision buying it? Do you envision bringing in another partner <mark type="ph" /> for stake (43:26)? And how should we expect that to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, all fair questions, all good questions, but very difficult for me to answer, obviously because of the confidential nature of our partnership. But I will say this, they've been a very good partner. They've been very supportive. They've been very excited about what we've done with the portfolio. They've been more than willing to reinvest in the asset so the partnership couldn't be better. Are they a natural long-term owner like we are? No, clearly.  Will that resolve itself in a win-win at the right time? Very, very highly likely, but beyond that, Michael, it's very tough for me to venture further.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

And how you think that's going to end at the end of the day with so much increased competition in the space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't have a bunny reference today, but I will say this, there is a lot &#x2013; there is a lot that can be spilt between the cup and the lip, right?. So my view is of it is this. Until somebody starts construction on whatever project that is, full price, redevelopment, outlet, all we are is yammering. So we try to keep our yammering. We're not perfect. We yammer with the best of them. We try to have the lower yammering quotient. We try to be leaders in yammering. But in the meantime, until it starts construction, to me it's just a lot of talk.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Quentin here. Just a question in terms of currency, you commented on additional potential offshore expansion and just with the move in the U.S. dollar, I'm just curious how you think about investing offshore and whether you might change the way that you structure some of your potential offshore acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look the interesting thing is, it's two fold. One is, very tough to complicate or consider a major, outside of the U.S. investment right now. If you have to use your currency to buy something, right? So on the other hand, you could argue, well, if we're in a further decline, are we not better off having some of our assets outside the U.S.? Now we have about 5% of our assets outside the U.S. so naturally we get some marginal benefit on it. But for us to do a major thing outside of the U.S. unless there was the ability to use currency dominated financing and in some markets you're able to and in some you're not, it's a tall order right now given how weak the dollar is. So it naturally, I think at the end of the day when you factor it all in, it probably curtails our investment. Our greatest advantage right now should be our cost of capital but if we can't use that, I mean besides all the ability to make assets better and all that stuff, that's true but if we can't export our cost of capital because the dollar is so weak, it's a challenge to do further major international expansions.</p>
          <p>Yeah, we're building in Korea, we're building in Malaysia, we're looking at other Asian markets and actually building stuff and making things happen there, but to do a major deal, and if we can't finance it, and we don't get the benefit of our cost of capital here, and have to convert dollar investment into that currency, you could make a great real estate deal but if the dollar does strengthen down the road you could get whacked and lose your value. So it's a natural constraint that we've got to deal with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess on the flip side with the currency, have you seen more interest from offshore investors into some of your assets maybe some of the weaker assets or potential for joint ventures and does that give you some kind of opportunity to maybe sell more U.S. assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look. I definitely think there is a I wouldn't call them weaker assets, but there is clearly -- the trend from a number of the international institutional investors who have a tendency to gravitate toward the highest quality in the major metropolitan markets is clearly moving away from that, looking to want to be in the U.S. for all sorts of reasons, yield, one, maybe their view of the dollar ultimately, all sorts -- safety, whatever it is that they factor in and they are going down the quality spectrum to find investment opportunities. So I do think that seems to be a trend that will continue at this point.</p>

          <p>I think it's too early to tell what's going to happen out there that will trade and at what pricing. But I think actually you're going to see probably an entrepreneur with equity either from opportunity funds or from other kind of institutional investors that are going to see the yield opportunity, one, maybe the ability to make the property better, two, and when they put it all together compared to where they are on buying A+, they see that risk adjusted return worthy of taking that investment.</p>
          <p>I would say to you though, the market is better, the financing market is better. The fact that we're selling four malls is not a big deal. We have sold 100 assets as we've been public. So this is kind of a normal strategy, Alex. We clearly stopped that effort in '08 and '09 and '10, certainly for a period of time, even though we did sell something in '10 at a huge gain for us in Europe. So we're always looking to recycle capital. It's not a transformal, transformational deal for like some of the others that might be out there, but long story short is we'll have to wait and see. It's going to be a combination of operators, maybe even others some other real estate major real estate companies. We're just going to have to wait and see how it shakes out.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so if I understand what you're saying, it sounds like you're a little less optimistic that there's going to be a lot of trading. There'll be some trading, but it doesn't sound like you're expecting a huge amount. Is that fair?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the market's better, and I think trades will happen, I'm just not going to quote what I think cap rates are going to be.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because I honestly don't know yet, but I do think that there is going to be more velocity in, you used the term the B assets. I do think there'll be more velocity. I think it's too early to speculate from our standpoint where the cap rates will be.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my second question is for Steve. I think it was last call you commented on the pile of pitch books for converts that's in your office. Sort of curious what the latest pile is? And what are your thoughts on doing some more 30-year? Or if you have a view of the <mark type="ph" /> 39 call 5 (53:52) if that's attractive to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The piles are growing, Alex, the convert pile, obviously the capital markets are very robust right now. So unsecured debt markets are very attractive. And one of the things that we need to take into consideration is one of the things David said in his opening comment, we're sitting here with $4 billion of liquidity right now so we certainly don't have the need to go to the capital markets. But having said that, given the attractiveness of the all-in rate now, certainly on the bond side, it is something that we monitor and we will continue to monitor. Right now, I would tell you we are not as enthralled with the convert markets. And I think it's not something that we would look at to put in the capital stack right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just say, to just add what Steve said, one of the bigger decisions we'll have to make this year is whether we want to warehouse capital, given that capital, we don't need it necessarily, but it is relatively cheap. And we do think, I mean I think, I may be completely wrong, but I do think rates are going to go up at some point, and so one of the bigger decisions we'll have to make at some point this year is whether we go ahead and warehouse capital, and not equity capital, but whether we warehouse other forms of capital on the theory that rates are going to go up at some point here? And that's a decision that we think about all the time. But it's tough because we haven't seen it, but usually we don't want to be in the case where we react, real estate guys tend to react while rates are going up as opposed to when rates are low and we'd like to be a little -- at least we don't have to be perfectly smart but we'd like to be less stupid.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I would say to you, Nate, is that what we've been able to do is as the new tenants enter the outlet sphere, we now have an additional portfolio of properties that they can immediately open stores in, and we're getting the benefit of that and we see it with tenants that we've had relationships with or like Coach is opening Coach Men's. Bare Essentials, Vera Bradley. We were just taking these tenants now across a broader portfolio of properties, and that's really providing incremental momentum both in rents but also in sales because we're bringing in higher productivity tenants into the portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And actually I couldn't afford my wife's ambitions around the hat. I think that's really the deciding factor. Hey, listen I was reading your annual review and on the international I know you fielded a couple of questions on this today but you make a reference to, we have proven to be valuable exporters of our know-how. I kind of read that and thought it was sort of a little imbalanced in the sense that I would thought you would have learned a lot or could learn a lot from operating in overseas markets and taking best practices and exporting them around the globe thinking in particular to overseas tenants have really sort of enlivened the U.S. retail scene in the last few years as well. Any comments around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, our know-how if you look at what we've built, the outlets that we build in Asia are essentially our outlets here in the U.S. and they didn't exist prior to that.</p>
          <p>I think if you saw the product that we built in Poland and the product that we built in France, were actually highly U.S. influence. So we certainly learn every day here, abroad and everything else. But I think the fact of the matter is, we've had a profound and positive impact on what we've done. And that's really what my comment was meant to be. If you look at Gotemba in Japan, it's really modeled after what we did in Woodbury If you look at what we did in Yeoju in South Korea, it's very similar to what we did in other parts of the U.S. So I think we've -- in fact if you go to Dubai and you look at what they've built, they've taken the best of the Forum Shops and other malls in the U.S. and replicated that. So again, that's not to denigrate the international marketplace, and we've certainly seen a lot of wow stuff over there, but we certainly contributed to all of the activities we've done overseas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Touching on the other side of your point in terms of the international tenants coming into our domestic portfolios, we've done a very good job of implementing them into our portfolio. We've just opened the flagship H&amp;M store in Forum Shops. We're doing a lot of business with them, have a very close relationship with them, but it's not just them. It's <mark type="ph" /> Pampalina (1:02:47) from Spain, Inglot from Poland and Diva from Australia, Aritzia from Canada. There is a lot of international tenants that we are doing business with across all three of our platforms, the mills, the outlet centers and the malls.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we are anticipating is that <mark type="ph" /> Uniclaw (1:03:21) is going to be a major player here, and they are building their flagship right on 5th Avenue, and then we expect that we're going to have a similar type of expansion that we've seen with H&amp;M. They started in the major cities, and now they are throughout the country and growing very rapidly and doing very well in their stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you know the thing that we understand about the Asians is that they love to come to the U.S. and shop. So one of the great things that we provide them in their travels, in fact, is that we have great places to shop. So marketing to them is really, really important.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on Asia and thinking a bit more on Japan, I know you made your comments there, is that as you sit here today would you be inclined to try and step up your investments in Japan, notwithstanding those comments you had to make about currency?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We're actually expanding Ami right now, which is right now somewhat affected by what's going on with the nuclear facilities. But we have not looked at the full price market there. We've had great success in the outlet market. Cracking the code on full price in Asia has been a struggle for us, values, the cost to develop full price there, the size of the deals, the ability to get the land in the right locations. So that's been the tougher code for us to crack. We do think, though, our Outlet business in Asia can grow, and we're excited about that. Ultimately, can we crack the full price thing in Asia? I don't know yet, David. It's tough, because first of all, it's not devoid of a lot of full price to begin with. And second, where you want the locations, the land cost, the infrastructure cost and the competition are all challenges that we'd have to deal with.</p>

          <p>Hey, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to follow up on the comments about rates going up here sometime. I guess, can you be a little bit more specific on your thoughts when you say sometime?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wish I knew.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At least what you're thinking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, I think our -- I think it's conceivable that -- look, anything that we can refinance today, we're refinancing. We have certain mortgages that are obviously locked out to prepayment penalties, so we don't think it's cost effective -- you're trading dollars essentially and it's not cost effective to do that. But the big issue for us if we do think rates are going go up, is whether or not we would do some kind of bond deal and warehouse the capital, because right now, we don't have -- if you remember what we did in '09 and '10 -- or in '10, I'm sorry -- '10 essentially is we refinanced bonds and we bought them back and it ended up being at least in today's world, an okay trade. So the question is whether we want to do something like that again or we just hold onto the capital and wait for maturing debt to come due.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, this is Steve. Just to kind of amplify on David's comments. If you look at, an example, where the benchmark 10-year treasury is today and you track it back over any length of time whether it's 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, it's clearly at historically low levels and at levels where over a long period of time, they have not been for a very large percentage of that measurement period. So I think any time you're in an environment where rates are at historically low levels, it does give you pause to reflect about, do you want to go get more capital because history would tell you that the probability is those rates aren't going to be at that level forever. And I think David framed it pretty well, we've got a lot of liquidity, we don't have an immediate use for the capital, but if your view is that it may be more expensive down the road, it may make sense to go access that capital now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm not sure if you'll answer this question then, do you think that the market is properly pricing in higher rates when we think about today's current stock prices?  Thoughts on cap rates, the implied cap rate on the group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the market's probably anticipating a recovery and a stable interest rate environment...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lack of yield in the rest of the world and I think there's a lot of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think -- look, I mean, I think the fact of the matter is that's been the reality. So our view is recovery, you're seeing a recovery. We've been at it for a few quarters now. Clearly, interest rate market's been very stable. At some point, that might change. I'm not so much worried about the recovery as opposed to the interest rate environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then turning to leasing, I know you said earlier on a public call, it's tough to answer questions. I guess, can I just ask in general, in your negotiations, are you focusing on sales the next 12 months or are you still negotiating on trailing 12?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we're negotiating with the tenants, it is a very individualized negotiation. We're looking at their growth in the last six months, but we're looking at the use, the space, the size of the space, the quality of the mall, the space in the mall. There's a lot of factors that go into how we price our rents and certainly sales growth is one of them, but it is not the only one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'd just say it's the -- really, the biggest focus is the market value of that space. Right? You could have a retailer in that space that's not performing, and I wouldn't want to tie the rent to that sales performance when in fact the market value is higher and would indicate a higher rent. Leasing is an art like -- certainly we try to make it as scientific as we can. We're leaders in data generation here in terms of all of the tools available to us to assess that. We assign market value for each space, we use it, sometimes we ignore it. Others, at the end of the day, we have relationships to factor into it. So at the end of the day, we kind of all put it together and the best thing going for us is our judgment. It's an art, it's not a science, it's not order taking. It's what does it do for the center, merchandise mix, where do we want to take the center? And all those factor in. Certainly having positive sales history, which is positive traffic, all go into the blender and all make the job somewhat easier than it was a year or two ago, but it's all those things that factor into what we're trying to accomplish and what the right rent is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then turning to international we know David Contis has experience in Brazil. We just did a tour there. Do think that it's too late at this point? Do you think you missed the opportunity on full price in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not necessarily. The research we've done, the biggest constraint that I see in Brazil is that the currency issue as opposed to the real estate issue. And the cost of the financing there. So we wouldn't get much if any advantage on our lower cost of capital here to put money to work. I think the story on the real estate front doesn't seem to have changed at all. The problem is you really do have a dollar-currency issue that makes it a little more challenging to conceptualize a transaction they are.</p>

          <p>Well, '11 leasing is for all intents and purposes on our renewals are done. We're well into 2012. For us frankly ICSC is much less important. In fact, the month of April and the month of May prior to ICSC are our peak periods of tenants coming to Indianapolis to meet with us, because the volume of activity we have they'll come for two days in order to go over all the opportunities in the portfolio. Whereas at ICSC, you're really limited to half an hour or hour sound bites. So we're doing a lot of leasing. We're focusing on our '12 renewals and leasing up the vacant space, and so far we're seeing good momentum.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'd say this just, Jeff, the biggest focus that we'll have is on some of our major redevelopments. So included in that are like Nanuet Mall is -- we are finally at the point now where we're going to start demolishing that center. We have Quaker Bridge, Del Amo, Dadeland, La Plaza, Plaza Carolina, Southdale, Southridge, Copley, and what we're doing on the Island, Laguna Hills, Stamford we hope to push along a potential expansion of that center. And then we've got some things in the outlet side as well, potential new projects that we could start talking about there. So that would be, and Rick's right, I mean '11 is essentially done, '12 lease renewals, but I'd say the focus really for us is going to be on the major re-dos that we've got, we're on the cusp of doing.</p>

          <p>Okay, and then this question is probably for Rick are you seeing any new and exciting retail concepts coming to the malls?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for asking. You know we are and what's interesting is that they are coming from all different places. For example, we're doing deals with Fiat dealers because they're not opening their new dealerships, they're reintroducing the concept to the United States and they want to be where the people are. We're signing leases with Tesla Motors, the new electric car maker because they want to have their demonstrations where the people are. We're doing deals with Microsoft, the biggest Internet based company.  They need to open stores where the people are and that's our malls. I could go on, but David's giving me the hook. I'll stop when David gives me the hook.  But Love Culture is growing very substantially. Francesca's is filed for a public offering, relatively new concept. Charming Charlie's, PANDORA just went public. There is just a lot of activity going on in our portfolio and happily throughout the portfolio, these are not just concepts that want to be in the top 100 malls. These are concepts that have broader price points and want to have 400 to 800 stores in their ultimate build out so it's very exciting.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good morning, thanks just one quick one for me. Maybe David do you have any thoughts on potentially teaming up with a partner to do outlet center development in Canada maybe starting in Toronto, just a few miles away from another potential site? I'm just curious if you've had any discussions with Calloway to potentially start a partnership there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are looking into Canada, Ben, I can't really put any more meat on the bones there. We do think it's a pretty good market for a handful of centers but I can't really say anything more than that but we are looking into that marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean hypothetically if you were to form some type of partnership do you envision yourselves as just maybe like a capital partner or would there be some type of development management leasing that you would share with your hypothetical partner?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we did a venture in the -- this goes for any outlet venture, whether it's U.S., Canada, Mexico, Malaysia, Japan, Singapore, China, we would definitely add operational expertise. It just wouldn't be our capital. So that's kind of -- that clearly would be the case.</p>

          <p>A quick question. When I look closely at results for the quarter, you guys beat consensus roughly by about $0.08.  The midpoint point of your new guidance is up about $0.08 versus your old guidance. But it sounds like operationally things are getting better, leasing spreads are getting better, leasing velocity is getting better, I'm just surprised guidance wasn't up more. Is there anything unique in first quarter in regards to the $0.08 that you expect will not be repeated in the back half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. Look, we're a little cautious on Japan. We have a very robust international outlet business. Some people forget about it but it's not inconsequential. It's a great business. So we're being somewhat conservative on what the outcome of that is. It's sales dependent, and we just don't have enough history yet on what's happening there. The south is actually pretty good in Japan. Sales have bounced back pretty reasonably, but we just don't know, and you know we like to be generally conservative in setting expectations. So you put that together, we still have to execute our game plan. We're good, but we're not infallible. So you put it all together and it's where guidance came out.</p>
