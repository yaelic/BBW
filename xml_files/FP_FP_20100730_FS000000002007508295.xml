      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello, everyone and thank you for calling on a Friday afternoon. First, I will comment on the results and then we will go to the Q&amp;A. I will not take too much time on the first quarter environment. Globally, oil was trading around $75 per barrel, but the price of gas remained low and the refining environment was still difficult, even if margins recovered.</p>
          <p>Looking at the first quarter results compared to the fourth quarter '09, production was 2.43 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, an increase of 2.1%. Adjusted net income was $3.2 billion, an increase of 3% compared to the fourth quarter, and I would remind you that TOTAL was among the most resilient companies in 2009 in term of results.</p>
          <p>Annualized royalty for the business segments was 15%, which compares favorably versus our peers. Net cash flows were $3.6 billion compared to a negative $1 billion in the fourth quarter and our gearing at the end of the first quarter was 21.5%.</p>
          <p>So, now I will comment on each of the segments. In the Upstream, the five major projects that we started in 2009 are performing well and in line with our expectations. The second train at Yemen LNG started up in March in advance of our summer target date.</p>
          <p>First quarter production was 2.43 million barrel of oil equivalent a day, an increase of 4.5% compared to the same quarter last year and more than 2% compared to the previous quarter. Part of the increase is coming from our LNG volumes, which grew by 38% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Also, another point to make... <mark type="audio gap" /> (2:29- 2:34)</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello and thank you for calling. As usual, I will comment on the results and then we'll go to the Q&amp;A. The second quarter environment was not so different from the first quarter. Our realized liquids price was up slightly to about $75 per barrel, natural gas realizations were down by about 5% to just below $5 per million Btu.</p>
          <p>Our European refining margin indicator increased by 6% to $31 per barrel and the average dollar euro exchange rate improved by 9% to 1.27. Upstream production was 2.36 million barrel of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. Due to normal seasonal maintenance, second quarter production fell by about 3% compared to the first quarter. But compared to a year ago, production increased by more than 8% and this is one of the best among the majors. Operationally, we are very satisfied with the way things are going.</p>
          <p>Looking at the second quarter results, adjusted net income was $3.8 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the first quarter and this compared very favorably with the other majors...</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations was $6.3 billion compared to $7.3 billion in the first quarter. Net cash flow was $3 billion compared to $3.6 billion in the first quarter. And now we are getting at the end of the second quarter was 22.7%.</p>
          <p>If you analyze the cash flow from operation for the first half of 2010, you can see that we have been able to fund more than our CapEx and dividends. Our actual cash flow break-evens in terms of the Brent price was about $60 per barrel for the first half of this year. This is before we take into account the sales of the Barnett Shale.</p>
          <p>Looking at the results expressed in euros, the increase are much larger due to the strength of the dollar in the second quarter. Compared to the first quarter, earnings per share increased by 19% in dollars and 29% in euros. As we have said before, TOTAL is like most of the majors essentially a dollar company, and we benefit from a stronger dollar.</p>
          <p>So now I will comment on each of the segments. In the Upstream, in terms of commodity prices the average Brent price increased by 2.4% compared to the first quarter. And our liquid price realization increased by close to 1% to about $75 per barrel. The larger differential between our liquid price realization and Brent was mainly due to the mix effect including the impact of turnaround in the North Sea. The average natural gas price realization in the second quarter decreased to $4.82 per million Btu, down 5% from the first quarter.</p>
          <p>This reflects weakness in the spot market in both the U.S. and the U.K. This price does not include sales of LNG from our equity affiliates, notably the new production from Qatar and Yemen.</p>
          <p>Operationally the segment is performing very well. As I said in my opening remarks, second quarter production was 2.36 million barrel of oil equivalent per day. The major projects that we started up last year, plus a second train at Yemen LNG that started up in April are ramping up as expected. We also benefited from higher production in Nigeria although the situation is not yet back to normal position levels there.</p>
          <p>Turnaround activity in the second quarter was lower than last year and impacted mainly the North Sea. In the third quarter turnaround should be inline or slightly up compared to the second quarter. Adjusted net operating income from Upstream segment was $2.8 billion, an increase of 3% compared to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Production volumes and average idle time prices were slightly lower, but we had a positive mix effect the stronger contribution from gas trading and the lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for Upstream decreased to 58% in the second quarter from 60% in the first quarter. As we said in May, the first quarter was a bit higher than normal due to some adjustments. And the 58 to 59% rate is more reasonable in for this environment. The annualized second quarter Upstream ROACE continues to be very competitive at 21%.</p>
          <p>We will make a complete presentation in September. But for now, let me say that we have good reason to be optimistic about the development of the Upstream segment. We confirm that compared to the 2009 base, we expect to grow position by 2% per year on average over the 2010 to 2014 period. And we confirm that the 2010 growth should be above this 2% average.</p>
          <p>From the 3rd of March of 2010, we had achieved more than 6% production growth compared to the first half of 2009. We expect to show a year-over-year increase for the second half but at a lower level.</p>
          <p>We will give you more color on the 2011 and 2012 position forecast in our September presentation. From the medium to long term, we are continuing to reshape the Upstream portfolio. We announced a deal with UTS that should give us access to 20% of the Fort Hills field in Canada. If we are successful in this deal then we would probably prefer to sell back our interest in the Hudson field. These steps would create a more balanced portfolio in Canada with an earlier start-up date for the first position.</p>
          <p>As you know, we are continuing to work to announce a deal in Uganda with Tullow that will open up a giant new play for us in East Africa. And we have been more active in selling major and non-strategic upstream assets.</p>
          <p>This includes the Virgo and Matterhorn fields in the Gulf of Mexico. So at this point, we are no longer on operator in this area. And we also sold the Valhall and Hod field in the Norwegian North Sea. Altogether these sales represent more than $1 billion of proceeds.</p>
          <p>In terms of new project sanctions, we just launched the Islay development in the North Sea. We are finalizing the last contract on closing Angola. So this project is very close to being officially launched. And in the coming months, we should launch Akpo 2 and Egina in offshore Nigeria.</p>
          <p>The major projects that we are working on for launch in 2011 are the Sulige in China, Ichthys in Australia, Shtokman in Russia, and Arnet in Algeria. Of course, if we are successful in closing the UTS deal and our deal in Uganda we will have close to four more launched as well.</p>
          <p>On the exploration front we continue to be very active. We added new acreage in Indonesia and Yemen and in the deep offshore <mark type="inaudible" /> and in Nigeria Sao Tome and Principe joint venture development zone in some of our existing offshore fields.</p>
          <p>In deep-offshore Angola, on block 15/06 we have announced six commercial discoveries out of seven prospects drilled so far. And we are currently drilling the eighth and final well in this campaign before evaluating development. In offshore Nigeria, we announced a discovery on OML 136.</p>
          <p>Regarding the drilling program in general, we recently created <mark type="inaudible" /> E&amp;P segment to ensure that there were safety and environmental procedures are of the highest standard. These task forces deal respectively with drilling safety, subsea capture and containment and environmental protection.</p>
          <p>For the record, we operate about 40 rigs simultaneously and a little more than 350 wells per year. We have completed a review of our drilling operation and BOPs and they are in line with our procedures.</p>
          <p>We are very confident of our drilling procedures. They are well structured and technically exhaustive and we expect them to be certified ISO 9001 later this year. So we believe <mark type="inaudible" /> is in good shape and we look forward to presenting you with more detail during the strategic update in September.</p>
          <p>Now, some comments on the Downstream and Chemicals. Our European refining margin indicator averaged $31.2 per ton in the second quarter. This reflects continued improvement compared to last year but the environment for refining remains difficult.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net operating income from downstream segment was $640 million, a very big improvement for almost 200% compared to the first quarter. Recall that the first quarter included about $100 million of negative one-off for price and unscheduled maintenance. And the second quarter includes a one-time gain of about $60 million that comes from a decision to permanently reduce inventory level at the Antwerp refinery. Even after we adjust for those items, the downstream results showed good recovery compared to the first quarter. Turnaround in the second quarter was low and our refinery throughput increased to about 80%.</p>
          <p>If we exclude the Dunkirk refinery and the delining distillation unit at Normandy from the calculation, the average throughput was actually about 90% and this is back to the level we had in 2007. The results for marketing also improved. The annualized second quarter of downstream ROACE has recovered to 12%. Our view of the global refining situation is unchanged. There are too many refineries in the world, specifically too many older refineries in major markets.</p>
          <p>In general we have a plan to reduce our footprint in Europe and achieve a 20% reduction in global refining capacity between 2007 and 2011. We have completed the major process to form total debt in Italy and this will allow us to improve our situation there. We will start up a new de-filterization unit next month at our Port Arthur refinery on the Texas Gulf Coast that is part of the modernization program there. And we have secured the financing for Dubai. This is a major step towards the rebalancing our refining system to the East.</p>
          <p>Just a word on the status of the Dunkirk refinery, we are appealing the recent court order to restart the refinery. We have started the declassification process for the plant and this is a compulsory first step for either shutting the refinery down completely or restarting it but our original project remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>Turning to chemicals, second quarter adjusted net operating income was $348 million, an increase of 60% compared to the first quarter. Base Chemicals margins continue to improve in the second quarter in both Europe and the U.S. reflecting the ongoing demand recovery that began in the middle of last year.</p>
          <p>The second quarter results represent the best operating profit we have seen from this sector since the third quarter of 2007. Our operation in Korea and Qatar are making strong contribution to the sector. In the second quarter, we started up the world's largest oil cartel at Ras Laffan in Qatar and this should add significantly to the bottom-line for years to come. This is in line with our strategy to develop base chemicals in the Middle East, based on cheap ethylene feedstock and in Asia.</p>
          <p>Specialties performed very well. Demand has been good across all of the businesses in this sector. Thanks to the restructuring efforts launched last year we have been able to capture the ability to develop stronger sales while keeping the tight cap on costs. The operating profit for specialty chemicals hit an all time high despite the sale of the Mapa Spontex unit that was effective April 1.</p>
          <p>The annualized second quarter chemicals ROACE increased to 15% a level that we have not seen in some time. We are pleased with the performance of this segment in the second quarter which reflects the strong efforts made in adjusting to the new environment.</p>
          <p>And at last the corporate side, cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $6.3 billion. Investments, including acquisition, were $4.4 billion. In terms of full year CapEx, excluding acquisition, we should be in line with our $18 billion budget.</p>
          <p>Divestments were $1.1 billion in the second quarter. This includes the sales of Mapa Spontex unit for the specialty chemicals for about $450 million. Divestments also include the ongoing sale of Sanofi shares that amounted to $370 million in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our participation in Sanofi is now 5.7% versus 9.7% a year ago. As a result of reducing our interest in Sanofi, we will no longer capture it as an equity affiliate starting July 1. At the current market value we have close to $5 billion of Sanofi left to sell and we expect to complete the process by 2012. Our gearing was 22.7% at the end of the second quarter compared to 21.5% at the end of the previous quarter. This is below our announced 25, 30% range.</p>
          <p>Regarding the interim dividend the board has approved an interim 2010 dividend payable on November 17 in the amount of &#x20AC;1.14 per share. This amount is stable compared to the previous payment. Relative to the first half 2010 earnings per share of &#x20AC;2.35, the interim dividend represents a payout of close to 50%. That wraps up the operating segment.</p>
          <p>Before we go to the Q&amp;A I would like to summarize by saying that we are very satisfied with the second quarter results, our production growth, our operational performance, and our ability to capture the benefit of a slightly improved environment.</p>
          <p>And now we can go to the Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Patrick. It's Theepan here. A couple of questions actually, firstly, just on production, could you tell us what the contribution of sort of the five big great projects are, and how much more ramp-up there is?</p>
          <p>And the second question sort of follows-on, it's interesting to see how you have captured a higher net income per barrel. I was just wondering, whether you could maybe split out the impact from the macro, from the underlying improvement, how much perhaps the additional barrels have contributed?</p>
          <p>And going forward, how much potential there is, for the margin expansion. So to put it a different way, do we see in the second half some of the costs from the new projects, the startup costs, that is fall away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Theepan. Thank you for your question. I liked first to apologize for the disruption we had at the beginning of the conference. There were a technical difficulty made by the company organizing this conference, the name of this company, so that everybody is aware is Ascabin.</p>
          <p>Actually the first quarter was so good that we wanted to tell you it again, but the second quarter is even better. So we'll move on to the second quarter. Coming back to your first question about the five project contribution on production, the second quarter 2010 both projects contribute by about 180,000 barrel per day. This is a contribution of the five project we launched in 2009. As far as, in margin improvement is concerned what I can tell you is that all five project contributed by a net operating income per barrel of  about $7 per barrel in comparison &#x2013; 17 sorry &#x2013; in comparison to a 13 average net operating income per barrel for all of our production. That's basically what I can tell you.</p>
          <p>We can anticipate some additional ramp up from Yemen which will improve again the net operating income because currently, we just started a second plant in Yemen LNG. But I remind you this Yemen LNG is still ramping currently and this will &#x2013; we would benefit of the ramp up in the third and fourth quarter and later on also. This is my answer, Theepan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Ms. Lydia Rainforth from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good afternoon. Patrick. When you talk of reshaping the upstream portfolio and looking through the transactions from this first half of the year, you have added long life projects as well as exploration acreage. I'm just wondering what areas of the portfolio, you still feel need further reshaping? And then secondly, on the CLOV project, relative to the height of the cycle, are you able to give an indication of how was the level of cost savings that you are seeing coming through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Reshaping, the upstream portfolio, basically what you have to note is that we have been able and we started to sell assets which is new for TOTAL. We didn't choose to sell assets in the past, we are selling assets currently. We sell Matterhorn and Virgo. We also sell Valhall and this is part of this new strategy to basically sell assets when we have opportunity to sell them. And in order to redevelop ourself in more profitable areas.</p>
          <p>In respect of the CLOV [Cravo, Lirio, Orquidea and Violeta] project, I am referring to the February presentation we made, and basically on CLOV the saving we made was about 15 to 20% depending on the quality and the type of equipment we were using.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Alexander Lumicales from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon gentleman. Alexander Lumicales from Merrill Lynch. Three questions, if I may. The first one is just to confirm on the Ichthys LNG project, you said sanctioning into next year. The second question is you have been adding inorganically to your portfolio, maybe you can tell us how you are thinking about this process? Are you done there or you still need to do a bit more additions? And the third question is, given these additions how should we be thinking about CapEx medium term beyond this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Ichthys I confirm that the FID is scheduled to be taken end of 2011, nothing has changed in that respect. The first LNG production is planned towards the end of 2016, basically.</p>
          <p>Your second question Alexander was about, are we open to new inorganic operation? Basically, we don't want to spell the name of acquisition, but I am using it. Obviously, we are open to any opportunities, and there is no reason for us to say that we would never make any acquisition. But we are extremely cautious, and we do made acquisition, where they made sense economically speaking. We recently mentioned to you that we were ready to move in Uganda. And we are just waiting for Tullow to be finally ready. I think everything has been settled between Tullow and its counterpart, so it will be okay to move ahead pretty soon. It's the same, we move on UTS, recently. So you know that we were moving and as you know there is no reason for us not to continue, if there is good opportunities.</p>
          <p>About CapEx guidance, as you know we don't give CapEx budget for 2011, 2013. You have to wait for the February presentation, because we haven't yet made our budget. Having said that, if you look to our pipeline of project, you can expect that we should increase our CapEx, of course this is excluding acquisition, this means this may also increase because of acquisitions, but I cannot forecast them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very clear. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question is from Mr. Mark Gilman from Benchmark Company.  Please, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrick, good afternoon. I had a couple of question, if I could please. It looks to us at least based on preliminary review that the equity LNG earnings in the quarter were weak. Could you either confirm or alter our thoughts in that regard and explain the LNG earnings performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark for your question. If you are &#x2013; I am assuming that you're comparing first quarter this year and second quarter of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In first quarter of this year we had a one-off effect of the devaluation of the bolivar in Venezuela, which mechanically increased the contribution of Peco Sedano. If you exclude this mechanical effect due to the dispensation of the bolivar in first quarter of this year actually the net income coming from equity affiliates from first quarter to second quarter is improving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you quantify that Patrick, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I will remember, the one-off effect was between 50 and $100 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, did you encounter any production sharing contract tranche effects in the second quarter and are there any that you would anticipate in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yes, we had some threshold effect in Angola in the second quarter of this year, we reach the last profitable tranche on Dalia at 20%. So this will remain at this level. On the first quarter, I remind you that we also had first threshold on ROACE where the profit were down to 60% coming from 80% and depending of course on the oil price, we could have additional threshold effect in the second half of 2010 on ROACE itself.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Patrick. I had a question regarding the Gulf of Mexico and the BP situation, do you have any thoughts regarding your JV with Cobalt in light of the accident which does indicate that it's going to very tough and expensive and probably impossible for smaller E&amp;Ps to operate in the deep-offshore? And then, just a question of clarification, when you talk about cash flow breakeven in the first half excluding Sanofi, does that number include or exclude working capital? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Irene. First question about the Gulf of Mexico and our joint venture with Cobalt. Cobalt drilled already three wells: Liberal, Criolle and Firefox. Firefox was not operated. They encountered structural complexities. 2010 drilling program is currently stopped due to the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico. We don't know what would be the outcome for the Gulf of Mexico. What I can tell you is that, by releasing the drilling rigs we have to pay between 10 to $25 million that is the bottom-line effect of that. Unfortunately Irene I can't forecast what would be the new regulation in the Gulf of Mexico. I can't say if Cobalt would be permitted in the future to continue Irene, I have no idea. So I am like you, I just have to wait and that's it. For the cash flow breakeven at 60, this is a non-adjusted cash flow, this is excluding Sanofi and this is including working capital movement. If we include Sanofi's cash flow, it is below $40 a barrel.</p>

          <p>Two questions one on Nigeria, I wonder if your production capacity is still closed there you mentioned the quality impact of 1% on your production in the second quarter. If everything were to come back in good order, what could be the impact on your production? My second question is on the asset sales you made in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea, would you put reserves year-on-year on the assets you sold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Henri On the first question about the capacity in Nigeria, currently the capacity itself in 2005, if you have a look in the back, let's assume we recover the production, we had in the past. In 2005, the capacity of the HPDC joint venture was for oil &#x2013; close to 800,000 barrel per day, where today we are slightly above 400,000 barrel per day.</p>
          <p>So there is a difference of let's say 500,000 barrel per day between what was the position in 2005 and what is the position today. Nigeria, you had also about &#x2013; you had a question about Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea on sales?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Patrick. I was tempted to ask my question from the first quarter just to be traditional. But &#x2013; can I just ask two things, the first is on a couple of your sort of forthcoming mega projects Fort Hills and Ichthys. It seems to me, is you have fairly small stakes in both. Is that a satisfactory situation for you going forward? I think probably everybody would agree the last couple of years would say that, it's better to have bigger stakes and a bit more control and a bit more value for your participation.</p>
          <p>And the second is, is you talked a couple of times about $60 and of course you are being financed to some degree by the sell down of Sanofi. Going forward is $60 a good number to think about in terms of the way you as the CFO would like to see cash balancing also on a go forward basis? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Coming back to the mega project, it is a, just a general comment first. It is important for us to have a large stake in the field that we operate. When we are not operating it, we can cope with a 20% stake in one particular field.</p>
          <p>And I repeat, it is important to have a large stake when we are the operator, because we dedicate human resources for that and we are not paid usually for that. So we have to enjoy the return of this field by adding the large stake. That will be my comment on Canada.</p>
          <p>About the $60 breakeven, it is a good idea to think of this level going forward. I would say yes, but I don't think this is realistic. Honestly the costs are going up and I wouldn't think that we might be in the range of more close to $70 per barrel than 60 in future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Patrick and thanks for taking the question. Can you just give us a bit more insight on the Brazil acquisition, I think you are farming into Shell acreage across there and let us know the kind of commitment you have for the farm-in for that license and maybe if you have any more ambitions on Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, on Brazil ,Jason it is not easy to step in and we farm-in on this block operated by Shell, into a concession, It's a pre-sold carbonate play. We have a 20% stake.</p>
          <p>There are two project identified currently on this block. It's still exploration, so honestly the potential estimate is that one prospect could be in the range of 500 million barrel, but this is exploration and we haven't drilled the well. The deal is a traditional exploration deal. This means that we will carry Shell on those two wells basically.</p>

          <p>Hi Patrick. I have one question about Nigeria, it seems like Nigeria is getting kind of traction in terms of final investment decision on project. You talked about Arafura and Egina can you confirm that you could be able to launch those projects before the end of the year or at the very beginning of 2011? And can you also give us an update on the status of Brass LNG, is there any movement around any new field or possible FID in the coming year?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>FIDs on Nigeria, Egina could be beginning of 2011, but I confirm on field 2.. On Brass honestly, this is not for tomorrow morning. This will come in the coming year, but when exactly I have no idea.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. Good afternoon Patrick. Two questions, both brief. The first one is, how long did you spend or did the board spend discussing the interim dividend and the decision to hold and how long would you expect to spend discussing the dividend come the end of the year?</p>
          <p>And the second is, just what your thoughts are around Nigeria Train 6 now that Shell's brought <mark type="inaudible" /> field on, how you see production volumes from that facility moving as we progress through the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, on the dividend as you know this is a decision of the board. I can tell you that because we make clear to everyone that our payout objective was a 50% payout. And that we are at 50% today there were no land fee discussion in that respect because we were on what we have said to the market for many years, that's for the interim dividend.</p>
          <p>On Nigeria LNG Train 6, currently to the six train are available for an overall capacity of something like 22 million. Nigeria LNG is currently operating at 80% during the second quarter. And it was at 90% in July. So I think in Nigeria the situation is improving with a very good trend. I'll remind you is that last year we had a capacity use of about 60% so we are back to 90s, which is quite well, quite good. And that will be my comment on Nigeria, Lucas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon gentlemen. Just two questions, please. Firstly, there are now, I think five refineries for sale in the U.K. Just wondering if you could give us an update on the sale of your Lindsey refinery and also if you are unable to sell the refinery, just how long would we have to wait until you make a decision to close it down?</p>
          <p>My second question is on Canada. It seems like you are high grading your portfolio by reducing your interest in Joslyn and buying a stake in Fort Hills. Can you just talk about, how you see the quality of acreage between these two projects and the time lines to FID? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The process to sell our Lindsey refinery is ongoing, it's an ongoing process. We have received several non-binding offers and discussions are currently underway. Basically, honestly, I can't tell you so much -- too much on our discussion, because I like to be in the best position I can in face of the potential buyers. We will see how it evolves. But honestly our target is to reach a deal and I have no other thoughts today than to reach a deal.</p>
          <p>In Canada, when we -- let's assume the UTS production go ahead and that we own 20% of the Fort Hills project, one can imagine that the Fort Hills project FID can be earlier than the Joslyn project I think. So we can expect Fort Hills position by 2015, 2016 something like this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. I'd like to summarize by saying again that we are very satisfied with our second quarter performance. This is both in term of comparing to our recent past that you have a good record at the beginning of the conference and comparing to our peers. We have a strong balance sheet and it is important currently in the current environment to counter the concern that we can sell our net investment and dividend with cash flow from operations.</p>
          <p>As you know, we are active in term of seeking new opportunities. I can assure you that we are also active in term of reviewing our existing operations to make sure that they are safe, reliable, and cost efficient.</p>
          <p>I'm looking forward to meeting most of you &#x2013; many of you when we make our media presentation in September. So thank you to everyone. Bye-bye and good vacation. Bye-bye.</p>
