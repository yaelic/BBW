          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, hello. My name is Dmitry Zhdanovich, Head of Investor Relations. We're glad to host the conference call in the case of Sberbank's Group IFRS Results for Nine Months.</p>
          <p>The conference call will be hosted by Anton Karamzin, Deputy CEO and CFO of the company. The conference call will be accompanied by the PowerPoint slides, which was sent to you or you can find them on our Web site.</p>
          <p>So, in the presentation, we can see some straightforward introduction done by Mr. Karamzin and then a Q&amp;A session. So with that, let me pass the words to Mr. Karamzin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. We're happy to start our traditional quarterly call. Given that the data we have been reported &#x2013; we have released yesterday, we're hoping that you have had a chance to have a first look at the numbers and at the investor presentation, so I will not reread the basic numbers out. We'll just make a few introductory comments with that.</p>
          <p>We're pretty happy with the quality of the numbers we reported for the third quarter. Our outlook for the fourth quarter is also quite positive. We have now entered into the closing stage of our business planning for the year 2011 and for the three-year period of 2011, '12 and '13, and therefore, have been able to calibrate our outlook for the coming quarter and the next year a bit better, and therefore, would be able to make some comments on that throughout the call.</p>
          <p>We basically are going to be turning around the provisioning and the loan growth forecast. And in the loan growth forecast, we have been more recently saying that we see that the corporate and retail loans are going to be growing at a somewhat different pace, with corporate loans just above inflation. And for 2010 and 2011 and retail at the pace of about 10%, 15%.</p>
          <p>What we can say now is that on the corporate sector, we'll probably see the growth of loans in 2011 around about 9%, 10%, which is still somewhat &#x2013; a percentage point or two percentage point above the inflation, but we can be a bit more specific on that. We haven't done our full calculation for the year, so that may change a little bit, but currently the sense is around that number.</p>
          <p>In terms of retail, we sense that it is going to be around 15%, maybe above. But we're actually more comfortable to set ourselves even more aggressive business plans on that than just above 15%. We should be aiming to above 18%, although that is much less dependent on what we do than on the appetite and the demand driven by the macro situation.</p>
          <p>This is provisioning. We have been optimistically saying that it would be likely that 2011 would see a net release of provisions back to P&amp;L, the positive impact on P&amp;L. We, however, having looked deeper into our portfolio and the quarter for specific situations, we can make this message a little bit more granular.</p>
          <p>We're seeing that we will be &#x2013; on the existing portfolio, we will be releasing tens of billions of rubles of provisions. And we're quite comfortable with how this recovery effort goes. And the quarter three and quarter four in 2010 are actually being a testament to that. In quarter three, you can see already in the results that we have released over &#x2013; several billion rubles back into the P&amp;L on a number of specific situations, which has contributed to the overall profit.</p>
          <p>We are seeing a number of situations similarly playing positively out in the fourth quarter. And we're seeing that in 2011, our release for the existing situations is going to be quite positive, so there's no negative surprises on that.</p>
          <p>But the overall situation with provisioning and releasing of provisions is obviously a bit more complex. Once we're pretty positive on the portfolio that we have started recovering in the past couple of years.</p>
          <p>We're also sensing that because the macro pick up in the Russian economy has been not as fast as we were all hoping for, some of the existing loans that are in the normal zone in &#x2013; are not problem loans &#x2013; may still as an effect of after wave, aftershock from the crisis, may still go into problem loans. And I am not &#x2013; I would like to underscore that I'm not talking about any big one-offs. I am talking about the statistics of a large number of small transactions, so that we would see some of the new provisions on the older books.</p>
          <p>And also, what will impact provisions &#x2013; a third component is how much it would provide against the new good loans that we issue. We're somewhat, as I have just mentioned, somewhat a bit more positive on how the loan growth is going to be. It carries with it some provisioning on a regular basis, whatever the cost of the &#x2013; the regular cost of normal <mark type="ph" /> preparatory skills (07:08) percentage point of view. They will be creating new provisions.</p>
          <p>So the arithmetical balance of these three components, recovery &#x2013; some deterioration, marginal deterioration in the old portfolio &#x2013; and provisioning on the new portfolio &#x2013; are likely to mean that the net result for the 2011 P&amp;L is going to be not a release but a provision charge. We don't think it is going to be of any dramatical scale. And, again, in neither of the three components, there is a &#x2013; specific, big one-offs. It is all about the smaller numbers and overall stats and trends. But that is likely to be the result for 2011.</p>
          <p>So, with that introduction, I probably should open it up for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Andrew Keeley from Troika Dialog. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, gentlemen. I've a couple of questions. I'll take them one at a time.</p>
          <p>First of all, on costs, can you maybe give us some of your thoughts about what your expectations are for the fourth quarter this year? If we look at last year, there was quite strong seasonality in the fourth quarter. I think you've also said previously that you're trying to accrue costs more evenly through the year, but with the likes of bonuses, I guess, the second half of the year has perhaps been quite a lot stronger than you'd expected and much stronger than the first half of the year. So can we expect a kind of similar seasonality dynamic in the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And then kind of following on from that. If we look into 2011, given renewed investments in your business, the effect of pay rises through this year and higher unified social tax expenses, what are your expectations on cost growth next year? And I'm just wondering whether you would kind of agree that it seems like it would be a good effort to keep cost growth under 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Andrew. Yes, there is two types of seasonality in it. One is driven by the business activity and the other is &#x2013; and you normally kind of are able to smooth that one out and accrue it a bit more evenly. The other one is just the pace of how the organization breathes and works. For example, when you make out your plan to do something, specific project that last a year or two year and you get your resources agreed and approved and you get up to speed and pace of utilizing those resources, not immediately from day one you tend to kind of get up to the fastest speed of progress on your project close to the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>So that one is just normal breathing rhythm of the organization, and one would aim to smooth it and properly accrue it. But because the degree of the transformation, the depth of the transformation that this bank  is going through and the fact that it is unprecedented and the fact that we have so many huge projects touching every aspects of the bank's life makes it virtually impossible to smooth this one out. We will be much less seasonal on the project work and cost and investment accrual say two years, three years from now when it gets into more kind of bland and then less radical transformation efforts. But for the nearest couple of years, it is going to be still some seasonality, although you're right to point out that we're kind of having a good &#x2013; overall good picture there.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the cost components this year and for the personnel cost, a significant part of mark-to-market adjustments of our pay indexation have been overly gone through. And it shows on slide 15 of our presentation that we've been showing like overall 21% &#x2013; 20%, 21% year-on-year growth in the cost. We expect that it is going to be around that on the full year basis like full year 2011 compared to full year 2010.</p>
          <p>In terms of the 2011, we will be continuing on that two-year period that we have announced at the end of last year when we said 2010 and '11 would be a couple of years of catch-up of the investment that we held back on through the end of 2008 and 2009, during the crisis years from purely at a conservative position. So, we would be comfortable if we manage our cost-to-income ratio in the low to middle 40s for 2010 and 2011. So we stand by that. We were looking at around 43% to 45% cost/income ratio for next year. There's no change in that.</p>
          <p>What &#x2013; one of your questions was, does this include the impact of the raise in the social security taxation in Russia? For 2011 how big it is going to be? Our assessment is showing that it is likely to cost us next year about RUB15 billion. Our CEO has been mentioning previously in the press that it would cost Sberbank around &#x2013; between RUB15 billion and RUB20 billion. We are &#x2013; again, this is probably not a conservative but rather optimistic forecast, which is not really difficult for us. But we still hope that we would be able to keep it closer to RUB15 billion rather than to RUB20 billion.</p>
          <p>Right. And what we are on operating expenses, yeah, and it is on the same slide, that we have a second graph about the head count <mark type="ph" /> which you can see. Yeah, it is one of (14:42) the biggest part of the cost base. We are looking to see full year numbers for 2010 in terms of staff head count reduction at around &#x2013; between 4.5% and 5%. Now, the slide shows that in comparison between 30 of September last year and 30 of September this year, we've shown 5.1%, but there were quite a sizable reduction in 2009. So in a full year to full year comparison, 2010 to 2009, it is going to be between 4.5% and 5%, somewhere there.</p>
          <p>The overall attitude to staff reductions, we are still on track for our strategic goals that we've announced in terms of the head count target numbers for 2013, '14 which is 200,000, 220,000. But from now on, for '11, '12 and '13, they are not going to be linear, because, again they are now a function of less administrative but more sophisticated efforts, where we aim productivity releases and improvements through completing various rather complicated projects, including IT, including process for use, including centralization of certain support functions, et cetera. The low-hanging fruits have been picked throughout 2008, '09 and '10. And when you pick low-hanging fruits, you show more linear head count reductions as we have been able to do, in 2009 was just under 10% reduction.</p>
          <p>2010, we've said, yeah, 5% and we're more or less doing it. From then on, it may be 3% one year, 6% another year and we don't yet know which one of the years it is going to be out of these coming three. But that's just the nature of the work that we're doing. We are comfortable that we can manage that pretty confidently. We have tried our hand at radical and systemic improvements in efficiency in the past two years, three years. So there's not going to be surprises there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thank you for that answer. My second question is on your net interest margin dynamics. We saw your comments that you expect the fourth quarter to have a broadly similar decline in net interest margin to the third quarter. I'm wondering whether you think that the fourth quarter really will mark the bottom in terms of your net interest margin and the contraction that we've seen. And I suppose, looking at the deposit cost and the loan yields, if you look at your blended deposit cost, they're already pretty much at historic lows. I mean do you think that they can go much lower from this point? And in terms of your loan yields, do you see &#x2013; I guess, where do you see the kind of bottom coming in terms of corporate loan rates? You've already seem to have turn the corner a little bit on the retail loan yields but do you think that there's much further to go in terms of declining yields on corporate lending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a good question. You see, the way it works, in terms of the deposits, I think we are at the bottom. The inflation is kind of kicking back a little bit and our outlook for inflation is definitely supporting &#x2013; our outlook for inflation for next year is definitely supporting. We're seeing these strategies really at bottom. But what is important to keep in mind, in terms of &#x2013; when you switch &#x2013; flip the switch on the rates in  the deposits, it actually takes up to two quarters, three quarters to actually filter through to our P&amp;L numbers and to get reflected in the margin numbers. So we've done &#x2013; as we mentioned in the last call and then before, we've done two big cuts in the retail deposit rate this year in April and August.</p>
          <p>The cumulative effect of those cuts on the liability side is going to be fully realized based on the results of the first quarter next year. So we're still going to be seeing some positive effect from that, not dramatic but some positive effect of that reduction all the way towards the fourth quarter and the quarter one next year. So that's the way it works and then it will stabilize there, on the liability side.</p>
          <p>On the asset side, you mentioned that there is a bit of a pick up to the yields on the loans to retail. It has to be understood though that we haven't &#x2013; this is not really due to the rate themselves. In fact this is due to the fact that &#x2013; due to the effort to change the structure of the portfolio. We are selling much more higher yielding products than before, whilst we're pretty happy that actually the risk profile that they carry are quite conservative and in fact compared to where we were a couple years ago it actually is much better. We are getting much, much better at managing the risk and therefore this is a very positive effect.</p>
          <p>In terms of the corporate yield outlook, we sense that we'll probably have stabilized the rate situation. There's still an odd number of blue-chip companies that are enjoying very cheap assets to funding in the public market and then from abroad with whom we want for relationship purposes to keep the rate of market level and they're kind of low. But we don't sense that they will not go much lower.</p>
          <p>On the other side, the process &#x2013; even if inflation bites back really hard, the process to transform this into the margin improvement through to P&amp;L of such a big machine as their bank, also takes about two quarters, three quarters. So, what we're talking out now in terms of &#x2013; about now in terms of the outlook for 2011 for corporate loan pricing is rather more stabilization of the rates rather than oh yeah, it will react to the inflation kind of somewhat increasing terms very quickly. And we have a very recent experience on how this works back in 2008, 2009 where our effort to <mark type="ph" /> brush out (22:03) was pretty intensive but it's still a manual negotiation process. The vast majority of our loan portfolio is at fixed rate, so you have to renegotiate that.</p>
          <p>So what does that mean for the margin? Now we would sense that it is going to probably sense the compressing effect from the pricing moves that we've seen in &#x2013; throughout this past year and may compress a little bit. But then most of the 2011 is likely to be under the flag of stabilization and then the last probably quarter we would see a bit of a recovery in the inflation &#x2013; in the scenario where inflation actually &#x2013; in the rate where the inflation is pretty noticeable and in maybe somewhat above the currently outstanding public consensus. So that's the response.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, please do not forget to introduce yourself before you're posting question. Our next question comes from Alex Kantarovich [JPMorgan]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello, everyone. I have really two questions. We are all clear on your expectations on risks. Do you expect any effect on net interest margin from the asset mix? This is my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do to the extent that I have already mentioned. That the change in the mix of the retail book is going to be having a bit of a positive effect. And this is regardless of the fact that yesterday we have announced that we've notched down the rate on mortgage &#x2013; on retail mortgages a little bit. That is still going to be seen to be compensating us for &#x2013; with the volume for this decrease in the rates. So we're confident that the structure of the portfolio will be &#x2013; the change in the structure in the retail portfolio will be having a positive effect.</p>
          <p>Also, it is probably time to &#x2013; for us to start rationalize what we see as an effect of canceling the retail loan commissions back in April this year. The data flowing in is now saying that whilst we obviously see reduced commission flow, that is more than compensated by the fact that we will get a bigger share of insurance fees that our insurance company partners charge our clients on the loan associated insurance. So we net, net in terms of fees and commissions income associated with the lending activities and retail are sensing that we have not suffered. We've compensated in full, in fact probably slightly positive. So which turns out to be that we can after a couple of quarters of operating under this new pricing structure that the move was commercially right and has started yielding us financial results. So we're quite positive about this.</p>
          <p>Other changes in the structure of the loan book, I don't think they should be dramatic. We are pretty well understanding the way we take risk in corporate lending. And we have already announced to the market that that allowed us to give much better terms &#x2013; that makes us more comfortable to give much better terms on long-term infrastructural and investment type project. And we're also continuing our push into SME lending, which is higher margin but then again we want to be wise and smart about this.</p>
          <p>We have done a couple of pilots and understanding that if you venture into SME with high rates but no pure, proper understanding of the risks, you may as well suffer losses. So far we feel very comfortable with what we're doing in SME, doing their &#x2013; going their kind of with a modest pace. So we don't want any surprises and are not actually anticipating any of that. So that's pretty much all about the structure and how I think it impacts the margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And after the composition of your security portfolio versus loans, any expected changes on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have started picking up the volume of lending a little bit in the quarter three, quarter four, and therefore, it is on the right trend. We still stick to the target that the securities to loans, securities to &#x2013; securities <mark type="ph" /> of the share of that &#x2013; sorry, leaving melody (27:51). Loans-to-assets ratio should be around 75%. I don't think we're far from it now and we should &#x2013; yeah, it is now 64%, but it used to have been a bit less. We sense that we should be not very far from 74%, and yes, there'll be tactical volatility around that, given the market spend and the loan demands are where they are. But we are sort of comfortable that there will be enough demand for us to continue on the right trend of increasing that ratio rather than reducing it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Now, may I ask you about these changes of expectations about provision releases? Theoretically, this could be due to watching expectations of effort quality or higher target to NPL coverage ratio or higher loan growth. If you can give us some color which of the three reasons could be the culprit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not planning to go on increasing the provision coverage. As I have mentioned, we sense that our recovery efforts are going to give us pretty good results in this year and next year. Therefore, it is more a factor of changing our outlook for loan growth and recognizing the fact that of the existing loan book, there is still going to be some provisioning needed on things that aren't bad now. They are good now. But they may still suffer from the fact &#x2013; the mere fact that the length of this crisis and the pickup pace is unusually long. And we have done, again, a bottom up calculation. This is not some smoothing of macro portfolio calculation formula. This is purely sitting through transaction-by-transaction and looking at industry expertise and sectoral expertise and sensing that some of the existing portfolio may still suffer. But again, no nasty surprises. It is just the trend that we see and we sense it.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Tatiana Boroditskaya from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the presentation. Tatiana Boroditskaya from UBS. Couple of questions, if I may. Can you please comment on your expected borrowing plans for 2011? Can you comment on the key acquisition plans? And lastly, with regards to seeing quite a bit of growth <mark type="ph" /> in nine months to a year (31:11), can you comment on this present situation <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:14)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Tatiana, I can't quite hear you. I heard the first two questions about the borrowing plan and the other about the <mark type="ph" /> BTA (31:23). Could you maybe speak close to the microphone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I will repeat the last question. In nine months 2010, liquid assets have shown quite a bit of growth. What is that in relation to liquid assets in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, your last question was just the one that Alex just asked. We aim that liquid assets should be around 25%. The rest should be &#x2013; of the assets &#x2013; the rest should be about 75%. They now get bigger but we see and use &#x2013; on nine months results that are in front of you, you see that they have been growing but what has been going on after the quarter three, what we see now is the trend has reversed and we started lending a bit more. So, there should be &#x2013; the liquid assets should be shrinking back to more normal questions.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of borrowing plans, again, they're fully and completely linked to the fact of our first priority being the pricing. So as and when the windows are opening new markets that offer us to set benchmarks in terms of constructing our yields curve, we will be accessing the markets with smallish amounts of borrowings and &#x2013; but that also is linked to the demand for, let's say, foreign currency loans that may come from our corporate and retail borrowers, because, per se, we don't need liquidity. We're exceptionally liquid and therefore, it is only for liquidity management for the particular currencies such as dollars that we might be doing that.</p>
          <p>Again, it has to be seen in the context of the two big facts. We don't have any pricing maturities in the coming years of repayments of existing debt outstanding and secondly proportionally to the size of our balance sheet, the wholesale market funding has never really been above just a few percentage points, two percentage points, three percentage points, four percentage points, whatever percentage points of our total funding structure.</p>
          <p>So, for us it is all about $1 billion or $2 billion here and there, it is just a rounding error. So we therefore are pretty conservative and the only target is to build the benchmark yield curve to be a reference for everybody and for ourselves in the market. Therefore, plans for next year are, again, very modest, maybe as Bella Zlatkis was mentioning earlier publicly, maybe $2 billion, $4 billion overall, but that's maximum.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Bob Kommers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Bob Kommers, Deutsche Bank. Hi, I have two questions. First of all, regarding the lending rates, corporate lending rates, the blended average <mark type="ph" /> of them, Anton, (36:19) could you break it down into what the average rates are on ruble loans versus ForEx loans and what the trends has been in ForEx loans and in ruble loan rates? And secondly, could you shed some light on the interest spread on ForEx loans as opposed to ruble loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the trends, I'd say both have been on a nine month basis, the three quarters of this year. Both have been driven down. However, third quarter and fourth quarter this year we sense that the demand for dollars was somewhat more than the supply in the local market. So, we have been adjusting our pricing for individual transactions slightly upwards. But this is again talking in basis points and percentage decimals rather than anything dramatic.</p>
          <p>In terms of margin levels for foreign currency assets and liabilities, I'd say we have been somewhat compressing but into a much smaller degree and then again, one has to remember that the proportion of foreign currency loans and deposits on our balance sheet is so small, so we &#x2013; it doesn't really make material sense of &#x2013; to be watching it that closely.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 shows you the currency split on amounts due to customers and it shows that it's, one has to had it, it's almost 12% in dollars, about just 6.1% liabilities in euros and 79.9% in rubles. Similarly, on loans, it is 78% of assets in rubles. The rest is in another currency. So that's just a small part of our balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in absolute levels, what is the &#x2013; what are the lending rates on ForEx loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's &#x2013; it makes sense to &#x2013; don't keep them in mind, but because they are not very oftenly happening and averaging them out doesn't really make a lot of sense because <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:37) and they correspond much more to the risk profile of a particular borrower than to the fact how different they are from the ruble.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. My last question is about the fee income. I'm just wondering, what you are budgeting for fee income growth in the next three years? So what kind of annual growth are you targeting? And what are the key drivers of that fee income growth and which are initiatives that you've already taken to achieve those targets and which are still initiatives that you planned to take over the next <mark type="ph" /> few (40:19) years to achieve your growth targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We clearly have been showing growth based on fees and commissions sort of about three years of at least 15%, 20% year-on-year. As you can see on slide 12, we're showing 22%, 23% growth for the comparable period. Full year, we sense it is going to be around about 20%. And we are setting ourselves very aggressive targets for fees and commissions growth for next year, definitely above 15% growth for next year.</p>
          <p>What composition is going to be there, as I've mentioned, pretty good inflow from insurance fees. Well, we don't do insurance product ourselves. We allow our insurance company partners to sell along the lines with our products and share with us some of their fees, so that flow is going to be positively impacting that because we've done the first big portion. I think we've done not from the very beginning of this year, but sometime &#x2013; somewhere into the year, so the full 12 months effect of that is going to be purely visible in 2011.</p>
          <p>We also sense that the currency volatility may not necessarily be contributing that much because the population and the companies aren't that fascinated about the currency changes as they were in 2009, for example.</p>
          <p>So that would be <mark type="ph" /> confronting (42:10) a little bit, but, overall, we're pushing out our effort in credit cards, which is largely a fees and commissions driven business in Russia, so that will contribute more. We are offering new products in terms of remote channels. We're proudly saying that the millions and millions of customers that have joined us on Internet banking and mobile banking, both retail and corporate, and that is going to be showing quite a bit commission inflow next year and many, many others actually.</p>
          <p>I can go for quite a long time actually. So I suggest we can hear more details about this on our Analyst Meeting in close to the middle of this month because we will invite the experts from the front office.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Samuel Goodacre from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="audio gap" /> (43:32) Morgan Stanley. Just two questions, really. One, if we could sort of go back to the discussion of the P&amp;L provisioning charges into 2011, you sort of told us that, in general, we're likely to see a sort of negative charge into 2011, but, of course, there's three underlying components. So, of course, we're going to have the additions, big provision releases and recoveries.</p>
          <p>Now, in the third quarter, would you be able to tell us how much of your provisioning charge could be associated to each of those so that we can have sort of a better handle on what's the actual underlying trends in your provisioning charge? Answer this one, so that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And second question, if we could have an update on sort of thoughts, timing and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:26) of the depository receipt program? And also, sort of your thoughts on the likelihood and the methods of the privatization of the 7.6% that the state is likely to sell over the next three years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good question. The structure of the provisioning charge for the quarter is actually not going to be very symptomatic. And for the same very reason that I've always mentioned before, because our provisioning exercise is totally and only in bottom-up exercise. <mark type="ph" /> We don't do it per bank (45:08). We just do it transaction by transaction.</p>
          <p>Therefore, there is timing differences in how various recovery procedures come to fruition in terms of impacting the reserves. Now, there's also different and unpredictable nature of some of the provisions generation associated with particular transaction. So a mix could be one in one quarter, totally different in another quarter. And therefore, so generalizing it out would only make sense on a full-year basis, at least, four quarters will provide you meaningful stats.</p>
          <p>Now, if we were to look at the four quarters that have preceded today's date or the date that we're reporting on now, that mix is going to be totally different because the last quarter of 2009 and the first three quarters of 2010 were totally different. We were still very much in the mode of providing against situations, which we're feeling worse. And accumulating a little bit of an overhang in the situations that are getting much better, but you actually have to &#x2013; you've researched something, but you have to see at least two quarters of the new restructured loans to be serviced properly, A, and B, at least two quarters of financials that you borrower shows that you had your believe. And after that &#x2013; and only after that you're comfortable to make a decision, okay, that means really improved quality; that means good servicing history. I can really supervision.</p>
          <p>So we've done a lot of good efforts on restructuring this stuff. And in many of the situations, we're sitting and waiting for those couple of quarters to pass by functioning as normal for a particular borrower before we start releasing.</p>
          <p>That is why I think we are pretty confident that the provision releases and then the recovery of the problem loans is going to be pretty positive for the coming two, three quarters. Most of the releases in 2011 that are associated with the recovery efforts that we've been doing in the past 18, 20 months is going to be seen in quarters two and three in 2011, so around mid-year.</p>
          <p>So, that's the granulars I can give you. I don't think we would be able and really should be to give a bit more granularity. Although feel free to contact Dmitry, and we may, on the full year results, give you a bit of a more detailed pictures as we prepare them later on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, I'm anticipating a question, the one that we've answered on the previous results call and the one that we first started highlighting on full-year results for 2009. This is the &#x2013; how successful is our restructuring effort for corporate loans? And how many of restructured loans go back to non-performing?</p>
          <p>You remember when we first mentioned that, we probably said that the number of &#x2013; the percentage of loan amounts that has gone to &#x2013; back to NPLs also being restructured at year-end was 1%.</p>
          <p>Now, the methodology to calculate that that we use was based on the percentage to net loans. And that means mostly net loans after the provisions. If we calculate it on the basis of gross loans, that number at year-end of 2009 would have been 10.4%. Now, we're saying that as at quarter three, this year that we've just reported, the percentage of NPLs in restructured loans has gone up to 17.5%.</p>
          <p>Now, we sense that this is a very good result. Reason being that the recovery in the economy was still pretty slow, much slower than all of us were hoping for back in 2009. And that dynamic has actually showed us a bit of a trend when we say that "yes, 2011, the provisioning charge is going to be net charge rather than net release because of the fact that some of the restructuring efforts still goes back into NPL. And because the &#x2013; some of the good situations may still worse, but there's more granularity in there actually.</p>
          <p>When we look at our NPL 90s and NPLs shorter than 90 days, we still see a positive trend. Here the numbers is in front of me. At the beginning of the year, the number of &#x2013; let me tell you, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:15) &#x2013; at the beginning of the year, the NPLs between one day and 90 days were 3.3% of the overall portfolio. They at quarter end one have grown up to 6.3%, but after that, we're saying they have started coming back to 5.1% at mid-year. And now three quarters, it's 3.4%.</p>
          <p>So there is some positive overall trend in what is going on in terms of new NPLs creation and how that impacts provisioning. But there is still some of that new flow coming in. So we sense that is the stat that makes us come out to the conclusion that the overall charge is going to be a charge rather than a release.</p>
          <p>So that's probably as much granularity as I can give on this call with respect to that. We will, as all banks do, give you a little bit more granularity on full-year results simply because they disclose <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:37) have a bit more time to dig in, together with the auditors, and they look at it much closer.</p>
          <p>Now, your second and third questions. Second was about the DRs. Again, for some of you it's not going to be anything new.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; and because I've made those comments already. I have &#x2013; we have almost made a decision back in September, October to announce the date for the launch of ADR program. Because if you remember, throughout the summer, the stock price was pretty stagnant. It was volatile, but in a side trend. So we thought, yeah, probably now is the time. There's not really much risk of a bubble being blown up, particularly in our stock. So that could be tactically a good time for us to announce ADR program.</p>
          <p>But right about that time in October, the government representatives has started coming out pretty loud with the comments about the coming privatization &#x2013; that they want to make a <mark type="ph" /> pretty good (53:47) decision about what is going to be done in 2010, '11, '12 and '13. And we said, well, okay, we &#x2013; because they're talking about such a big stake in Sberbank to be privatized, reducing them back to controlling stake, 50 plus 1. We have to be tactically very careful that we coordinate our timing for the DR program with the tactics of delivering that stock, that big stake to the market.</p>
          <p>And there's various comments that we hear from the market professionals. Some of them are saying, oh yeah, you better be launching ADR program before you the state sells its stake, so you let the stock to trade, and for a little bit of time, get some liquidity into it. And get the broader circle of investors comfortable with it.</p>
          <p>Some other investment banks in its formal conversation saying, well, the size of the stake that is being privatized is actually digestible by the market, and you actually should be aiming to synchronize. And whenever you do the stake sale, you launch the program big enough to accommodate that. And it's going to be fine. You're not going to be suffering on price because of that.</p>
          <p>So we have to complete the <mark type="ph" /> segmental (55:20) analysis, what is going to be better, to be done separately or simultaneously.</p>
          <p>Now, therefore, we have been pretty much up until now waiting for the inputs from the government and the Central Bank, how much are they going to sell and when. And the first initial input has been publicly given like last month, I think. And they're saying, it's bringing their controlling stake to 50 plus 1.</p>
          <p>And the &#x2013; to not suffer on price, they want to spread it out through 2011, '12 and '13. And also &#x2013; but they haven't yet said to us what kind of a timetable we will see. How much in 2010, how much in 2011, et cetera. And there is not only going to be their call. We're obviously have a voice at the table, and there will be a more tactical discussion.</p>
          <p>Also, what is important for us to get an input on is how is it going to be done. And we also want to look at how much demand is there on different parts of the market, domestic and international, and calibrate it accordingly. Because we all know about this existing rule by the Securities Commission of Russia, that when you do launch ADR, a placement of stock, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:02) you have to offer at least half of that in the local market.</p>
          <p>But then, again, there may be some fine tuning to that, simply because the degree of demand in different markets could be disproportional. We already showed record stock volumes for quite a number of months, being number one in terms of the trading volume in the market, showing that there's probably some limitations to how much the domestic market can absorb of our stock.</p>
          <p>So this is a technical discussion that takes place now, and would probably take us into the early months of next year on how we coordinate our plans with the state, and then how do we offer it, and how do we do the DR launch in relation with the state's stake sale.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of what is the strategy of selling a stake that big, firstly, I would make a comment for clarity. You &#x2013; all of you have heard various numbers being mentioned in the press. Some press mentioning 9% stake being sold, some press mentioning 7.58%. Now they're actually all talking about one and the same number. And the difference between the two means that this is the percentages in different things. Because the Central Bank has somewhat different percentage as the share of the charter capital, and a different percentage in terms of the voting shares. But essentially, what the state is saying, we are going to be selling down to 50 plus 1. So we are talking about exactly the same number of shares that the state seeks to place.</p>
          <p>The other clarification is always &#x2013; is also, for the risk of being obvious, but I'd still say that &#x2013; is that there's no new money coming in to the company. This is purely existing shares that aren't kind of technically in circulation and are just held by the largest shareholder, being sold out as a secondary sale.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of the investor universe that we're going to be seeking to target, ideally, we don't want to have an overhang of our stock suppressing the price of the market. So we are absolutely certain that a good, reasonable part of the stake should go to the open market to broaden the circle of investors, to broaden it out of local market into international markets, but just the right size not to be detrimental to the stock price.</p>
          <p>The rest should go to maybe some strategic holders, maybe some big institutional funds that would be happy to &#x2013; or investors that would be happy to take some of the big stakes. But then again there, as Vice Premier Shuvalov has mentioned, the quality of the investor and intentions are important.</p>
          <p>And there's another question we're getting asked what's &#x2013; even when we seek, for such investors whether they will be taken for particular synergies in the banking sector with anyone else. I don't think at this stage strategically we are in a situation where any such crossholding with any partner from the financial industry is going to be synergistic in the grand scheme of things. So we're not going to be putting any conditions on that. We'll be pretty open in terms of who'd that be.</p>
          <p>So the quality of the investor doesn't mean necessarily the synergy in business terms. It's rather investment horizon <mark type="indiscernible" /> (61:29) and depth of understanding of how the Russian economy works, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So that hopefully answers all of your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think definitely. A lot of details. Can I just confirm, and I understand there's a lot of nuances underlying your sort of DR program, and of course the privatization of the Central Bank stake. Would you say that you would sort of hope to have it finalized by sort of midyear next year? Or do you think there's a probability that it actually may get sort of drawn further into 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We probably will have clarity in terms of the timing of the DR program launch in the first quarter of 2011. But then also, one has to remember that, as I mentioned, some of the input we're going to be getting from the state. Because look, they are the owners of the stake that is being sold. So it's pretty much their business. We're just assisting in how this is being done because we have a good sense in what's going on with our stock and how it is perceived by the investors and analysts.</p>
          <p>But one has to remember that the state has clearly announced its priority that it is going to be first going with privatizing the VTB. And there has been some comments in the press &#x2013; again, I'm operating purely with publicly available information &#x2013; that the target date for what they are going to be doing first is around first quarter.</p>
          <p>So they are probably preoccupied with that task first, and then it comes to thinking about more specifically about ourselves. But we ourselves want to be quite proactive and not drag it beyond the first quarter next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Anton, just to follow-up a little bit on the first question. I know you've spent a huge amount of time sort of explaining various moving parts. But the bottom line for us is that you can see your portfolio bottom up. We see your portfolio unfortunately only from a portfolio perspective as such.</p>
          <p>And it would be sort of very, very useful to actually get a little bit more of a clarity on the underlying trend, be it year-end or so forth. So that we have &#x2013; so that we can work off something in 2011 to actually assess your two to three-year asset quality cycle in a more normalized environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course. And I'm principally not against that.</p>
          <p>The thing is that, again, in the current context of what is going on with the Russian economy, and still pretty hazy picture of how this is going to be panning out, we're much closer linked to the macro part of it than to the individual portfolio. And that makes managing that a bit more difficult than any smaller bank.</p>
          <p>So to the extent that when we actually enter a somewhat more normalized situation in the economy, hopefully a year or two from now on, we should be &#x2013; us and you, the analyst and investor community, should be interacting at a totally different degree of granularity and transparency.</p>
          <p>But the thing is that &#x2013; but we do see the picture in great detail. When we try to rationalize it in somewhat clear messages that would make some logic in your models &#x2013; when you put it on a paper, it doesn't really make much sense. Or it makes sense, but doesn't give us with the comfort that if we publish our views, they're actually going to be holding true, because of so many moving parts. So that explains some of the cautiousness.</p>
          <p>Look, the macro picture is hazy pretty much for everyone. And you, as a professional analyst, see how much amplitude is there in forecasts that are on the streets on everything from inflation, to rates, to oil prices, to anything.</p>
          <p>So that's just the attitude. It is not that we're kind of looking to be secretive, et cetera, although again, I must say, that we'll probably disclose much, much more than anyone else in Russia, at least on par with most of the global competitors. It is just that we don't see &#x2013; we're not comfortable to be putting something out that may not necessarily hold true.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Olga Veselova from Troika Investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. It's Olga Veselova from Troika Dialog. Could you please update us, at what stage the launch of options program is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is moving through the political corridors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, what I would like to say is that it is &#x2013; again, it is purely a political process at this stage, as I've mentioned many times.</p>
          <p>But I keep hearing every once in a while that people say that the bank's management team have hold back on provision releases and are not showing strong financial results because they're waiting for the stock options program. I'm hoping that what we're showing now in terms of the financial results on the reporting that we're discussing now on this call and what we are going to show on a full-year basis will be positive enough to silence any criticism.</p>
          <p>We are professionally not finding it appropriate to be manipulating the results. Also, the process of getting a proper long-term incentive plan in place have been so long since the new team has come up on the board like three years ago, that delaying it for so long wouldn't make any sense.</p>
          <p>Look, a bank management team can massage the results for a quarter or two, but it doesn't &#x2013; it is not possible with a machine of this size and scale for longer than that time. And we are clearly seeing this from the very beginning.</p>
          <p>So we said to ourselves, look, we're just doing our job professionally, and we are being prudent and conservative, as our professional duty requires us. Stock options come or not doesn't have much to do with it.</p>
          <p>Besides, it would have been making sense in 2009 when the stock has skyrocketed 300%. It would have made sense this year, but we're showing good, strong financial results. We clearly would expect our net profits to be RUB150 billion and above for this year. And this is the record that Sberbank has never shown.</p>
          <p>Also, again, the situation in the country remains difficult. The work-out efforts are quite lengthy. So if it goes as it goes, and our numbers are reflecting the objective picture. So it is &#x2013; we feel that we're treated pretty unfairly <mark type="indiscernible" /> (70:19) in situations like this. And we hope that the results of our work that are showing in the numbers are going to prove that we're not engaged in anything like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. May I ask if you could say would you expect launching early next year or unlikely?</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have an answer for that.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I honestly don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, all right, thank you. My second question is, again if possible, with liquidity issues. The bank owns over RUB600 million of the Central Bank bonds, and do you have any plans to reallocate this funds in higher-yielding <mark type="indiscernible" /> (71:06) bonds or leave them for liquidity purposes, or this the banks &#x2013; or this is the volume you plan to channel into lending next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Due to the structure of the portfolio, that's too specific a comment to make. I'm not going to make that one publicly.</p>
          <p>What I can comment is that our approach to building our securities portfolio remains the same strategically. It is purely for liquidity and defensive purposes.</p>
          <p>Also, we are hoping, as I mentioned a little bit earlier on this call, we are hoping to direct as much as possible of that through to the lending. And the target ratio liquid assets to total assets should be about 25. Or if you use a different ratio, loan to assets should be 75 and the rest is securities.</p>
          <p>We're at 54 now, so there's a bit work to do for us on the lending front. We're putting a lot of effort into this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, and 75 loans to assets &#x2013; is this the target for next year or a longer-term target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is just the target which we're going to be driving. We're not setting ourselves a specific timeframe for that, because again, it is dependent on many moving parts, and depends more on the macro situation in the country than on anything that it is actually under our own control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay, perfect thank you. And my last question, my third question is about fee income. In recent interview, the CEO had mentioned that the bank is going to receive RUB10 billion of net income from insurance, from retail insurance. And you also mentioned this retail insurance in your answer.</p>
          <p>Could you please just shed some light on this product? Has it been launched recently? And do the third quarter numbers include any gains from this retail insurance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again it is a recent product. We are not charging and providing any insurance &#x2013; we're not charging any fees and providing any insurance services per se. It is just a share of the fee, insurance fees and commissions that the insurance companies are paying us for the access to our distribution network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The insurance product that are associated with our loans where they insure the collateral, insure the life of the borrower in case of retail, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>We didn't &#x2013; and that was unfair on Sberbank, we didn't tap to this simple and very high-yielding product before. So we've rectified that. Started our efforts last year. The first are coming to fruition this year, and the first material flow of fees and commission into the P&amp;L is being seen this year. And yes, clearly you see that in our fees and commission P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And on slide 12 of our investment presentation, we actually mentioned that for nine months, we've earned RUB6.4 billion of agent commissions from that particular product.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Rustam Botashev from UniCredit. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Rustam Botashev. First of all, could you please clarify on your statement of NPL level in restructured loans? You said its 17.5%. So, it's 17.5% of all restructured loans which are already in the NPLs or they would have been <mark type="ph" /> impaired (75:25) if they had not been restructured?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that is already an NPL. This is a matter of us having restructured our non-performing loan or potentially problem loan and it is still after that going back into non-performing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, out of &#x2013; I think it's 8.9% of non-performing loans at the end of the third quarter, 17.5% is included into the NPL, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's different. It's different measure. We have 8.5% of NPLs overall as related to the portfolio that, <mark type="ph" /> partly yes, (76:19) the answer to your question is positive. The 17% of the loans that are NPL but have been previously restructured are included in that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>NPL is an NPL. It's an official definition under the IFRS. So, regardless of whether this is the NPL for the first time or for the second time after restructuring, it has to be reported in the same way. So, it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You said that there was expectation for the provisioning for the next year, little bit changed from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (77:04) to the provision charges saying that the economy is not recovering that fast. I remember you guys seem quite conservative on the economy even back in summer. Would it be fair to say that the level of restructured loans which you expect to become non-performing is increasing due to the economy not developing that fast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so. I don't think so. What I was actually trying to say is that it is still some tail end of good loans that have never been <mark type="ph" /> researched (77:53) before and have been performing so far. It may still go south. It may still lose quality.</p>
          <p>And again, this statistics, this is based on some of the central outlook that we have. This is based on the slower pace of recovery in the economy. The reason why we're talking mid terms is that we're saying, look, a lot of the smaller businesses have had funding medium-sized and even large-ish, not large and largest but large-ish businesses have experienced severe funding issues during the crisis.</p>
          <p>And because of that, only being able to find solutions to these for the year or two or so, in anticipation that the economy after year two would be recovering much faster, we, therefore, were counting on that recovery in their financial models. And were saying, okay, the funding solutions that I have found with my banker is a bit expensive because it reflects the higher risk in the crisis environment. But I can push through this on the anticipation that after the <mark type="ph" /> crisis year (79:13) two, my revenues are going to be coming back to normal much faster.</p>
          <p>Now that year or two have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (79:23) conclusion and some of the businesses are saying, oops, I'm not really seeing a pickup in my sales, the end demand, given the consumer and industrial, it's still pretty low. Therefore the solutions are becoming lengthier for me, but I cannot really afford that price for much longer. And then he's back to the negotiation table with the bankers and saying, look guys, I'm back into trouble, I didn't think it's going to last that long. So that is the type of the conversation that some of the boards are having with the bankers, not only with Sberbank. This is a macro trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, terrific. Given what you've said, 2011 the economy outlook is like GDP will be lower than 4%. But looking beyond that, I would say 2012, 2013, they also do not look better.</p>
          <p>And so, first of all, would you expect this situation <mark type="indiscernible" /> (80:40) given that this like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (80:43) or maybe not <mark type="indiscernible" /> (80:45) but more and more companies will come up to the same conclusion, just show that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is much less clear picture obviously beyond 2011 into 2012 and '13. Some of them &#x2013; for 2011, some of the companies will come to those issues and that's the logic. But what is going to be the trend? How is it going to be impacting us beyond 2012?</p>
          <p>So, we have some hypothesis, but we are not yet ready to share them publicly. There's still a little bit of analysis and observation on to rationalize the trends. As you all know, the last couple of months of the year are a bit more symptomatic seasonally on various parameters on how the next six months of the new year are going to be working out. Also the business activity of second half of the first quarter and second quarter in its entirety are also quite symptomatic on how potentially what the summer is going to look like and whether there's going to be strong or weak periods of activity in &#x2013; closer to the end of 2011. So, we have to be passing through those critical observation points to rationalize the trends for beyond 2011. And again, the situation is such that we have to be planning on shorter horizons than usually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does concern the loan growth expectations as well, because...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, loan growth is having somewhat more clarity, simply because some of the parameters that we actually control. Because of course there is not very intensive economic activity and the slower recovery on one side, but on the other side, this is all happening on the backdrop of banking services being heavily underpenetrated into the economy.</p>
          <p>So in relative sense of the economy, the banking sector is still going to be showing some positive dynamics overall. And also within that banking sector, the competitive situation we're hoping is going to a bit more in our favor than in favor of the rest of the competition simply because we're putting a lot of effort into and this is something that we're trying to control and influence.</p>
          <p>So therefore, for our ability to sell a product, sell a loan, retail and corporate and to offer solutions to our clients which are competitive because we understand the risk better than the current competitors and because we can price it more accurately. That is where we are sourcing some of the hope for our own business volumes and loan volume growth being somewhat better than the overall trend for the economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you just can put it in there some number, for example, what's your expectation for the 2012, 2013 lending growth to be a little bit above than for 2011, at the same level? That's the right question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In retail, it should be continuing to improve into 2012 and '13. In corporate, I would say, it should at least be not worse than 2011. But then again, corporate is much more dependent on the macro. It's too difficult. It's a bit more difficult to forecast in retail.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from David Nangle from Renaissance Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. Anton, Dmitry, Dave Nangle from Renaissance. Just a couple of quick ones from my side. One is just on the asset quality write-back story. I know you've been pretty detailed about 2011, but just to get some clarity on what your internal assumptions are, I guess, are you still assuming that this is a multi-year write-back story? And assuming the economy behaves at GDP growth of 4%, 5% and as opposed to 2011 story, just get some clarity on that. And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It is &#x2013; Dave, can I take it one by one because...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be easier. That's a good question. It is a multi-year recovery story. Again, the logic that I've mentioned in the previous calls still stands. In a normal &#x2013; I'll put it in inverted commas &#x2013; yeah, that the normal definition of a cyclical crisis that the western banking sectors have been going through in the past 100 years, the recovery &#x2013; and under normal western-type legal system &#x2013; recovery after a crisis takes at least between two and four years.</p>
          <p>Now this is Russia with its legal environment that is still in the early stages of its development post-Soviet era. And after a crisis that is much bigger than anyone has seen, on the living memory, so obviously the recovery effort takes between three and seven years, I'd say, on average.</p>
          <p>So therefore, balance sheet cash recovery is long &#x2013; is a multi-year story. And associated provision releases and write-backs is a multi-year story.</p>
          <p>Now, to give you some flavor, again, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, the provision releases this year due to the results of our work on the recovery in the existing portfolio are going to be scoring tens of billions of rubles. Also, when we talk about &#x2013; and it is a story that is skewed closer to <mark type="ph" /> the first year of three. (87:33).</p>
          <p>So if we imagine the total number of provisions that we're planning to get released into &#x2013; back into P&amp;L over the next three years it's probably much bigger chunk in year one than in year two and three. Reason being is that if something has recovered and is reclassified back into normal loan, then this takes shorter time than other recovery strategies that doesn't involve &#x2013; that don't involve restructuring. Whether that's foreclosure or the collateral, bankruptcy, court procedures, M&amp;A, decomposing the business into components and selling it if need be. So all these types of procedures, they take longer.</p>
          <p>And until we actually recover the cash, you don't release the provision. So &#x2013; but out of all the portfolio, obviously, much bigger proportion of what we have goes into credit restructuring; and therefore, it has positive provision effect we think, in the first couple of years. So we've seen the first releases in the third quarter, hopefully we're going to see some in the fourth quarter this year and the bigger part is going to be in 2011 and then it is smaller part in '12 and '13.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of &#x2013; so therefore you track it separately. The balance sheet recovery per se is consisting of cash and reclassifications. Reclassifications happen sooner than cash recoveries. So the dynamics in the balance sheet recovery is also going to get somewhat skewed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I got that.

And there's a debate in the market about &#x2013; I'm sure there's debate in Sberbank about what the best route is. But how is your thinking evolving on that front at this stage, if I can ask?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Anton, hi, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (91:24). Just a few things that I want to ask you. First, you said that you have pretty much completed the business planning for 2011. So, do you now feel comfortable showing result, the results of this business planning and do you feel comfortable providing the net profit guidance for next year or the ROE guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I would say <mark type="indiscernible" /> (91:46) final stages of our business planning. Our normal target is to complete the business plans for the next one year, three-year period, by end of December. So, we normally complete it by the end of December, but then formalize it with official decisions of the executive board, et cetera, sometime after the New Year holidays by mid January.</p>
          <p>So, we're not yet fully done. Whatever flavor that comes or that can come out already from these final stages of planning, I probably have already shared all the way throughout the call, our outlook again just to repeat, our outlook for this year net profit is above RUB150 billion and somewhat sensibly above, not just a rounding error. And we for next year we clearly would want to see more than that. So, how much more, we would probably be able to give a bit of a sense in January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's going to come out of the blue, like on the news wires or that there will be kind of structured process for how we can get the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which way would you prefer it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, structured way. Yes, anyway. Yeah, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, just to be clear on this actually. We normally make our best that effort to be structured about it and not offer some of the surprises but they sometimes happen because of the fact that our in-house process is actually moving very fine. And because our CEO is so kind of heavily-watched by the public and the press, he is essentially being interviewed almost every day and across the number of topics that are very broad, given the systemic significance of our bank.</p>
          <p>At some point in time, it is difficult between even and couple of other members of the team to just calibrate it on a plus minus two, three day basis to what has been already said, what has not yet already been said. So the &#x2013; we apologize for some of the glitches within the space of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (94:48) we first fire out a number or a comment and then are able to provide some more detailed comments rather than preparing the ground and then releasing the number or a comment into a context not understood by everyone. But hopefully again, the market expectations becomes a bit calm again, it all gets into more <mark type="indiscernible" /> (95:17). But we're putting a lot of effort to make sure the indication is having a bit more &#x2013; more in flavor of regularity into it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And again just to finish up with this topic, the last time I was asking on the second quarter conference call, whether it's reasonable to assume you guys going to report over 20% ROE next year, and you said yes. I guess that's obviously still a very reasonable assumption if anything changed there from this time, it only changed for the better, I guess, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not really. We still are saying that the target of 20%, maybe above, ROE performance strategically for us is something that we're aiming for. But what we're saying is, just the sense, just to give you a bit more color on this, it is good that we're showing kind of now results very, very close to that. But over the next year or two, it is going to be pretty tough for us to stick to that. But we are still saying that it is doable. Hopefully, close to 2013 and '14, it is going to be somewhat easier for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But why will you say that, because one would assume that if you managed to deliver 20% ROE in the third quarter, when you still provisioned like, what, RUB40 billion, it will be much easier for you to deliver the same or better target, if you're not provisioning at the same level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It also relates to a number of other factors; the competitive situation, the margins overall, the structure of the P&amp;L, how much of the fees and commission, i.e. not margin-related products we will be able to push out through the door. What is &#x2013; how much intensity is going to be released out of our efficiency drives, because the more radical changes are going to be done through &#x2013; as far as strategic execution-wise, more radical changes are being done in years one, two and three, and then more difficult ones, but still yielding substantial results in each years, four and five. So, it's a number of factors that are impacting us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But still, Anton, you're saying you're going to grow like, say, 10% corporate, 15% retail, margins going to stabilize, costs of risk is going to go down, costs will remain under control as we found. So &#x2013; and you report 20% ROE already in this quarter. So, if &#x2013; I mean I understand that, say, you'll <mark type="ph" /> now (98:12) have provision releases, but net-net situation should be much better in 2011 than it used to be in 2010, or I'm missing something here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (98:20) to you that the &#x2013; while the provisions &#x2013; new provisioning increases in next year are going to be associated more with the growth of the loan book and going to be kind of compensated with the volume going through the books, the provision releases for next year, as a result of recovery, was going to be quite sizable and, therefore, not really that much sustainable for &#x2013; yeah, not much sustainable on a horizon like of 2013 and '14.</p>
          <p>So, it is going to be difficult for us still be showing very good returns, because the overhang of provisions is, as you can see, pretty big. And, yes, I was &#x2013; I hope &#x2013; actually I was quite surprised not to hear that question today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is about the NPL level per se, and the provisioning level per se. <mark type="ph" /> Is it deeper or is it not? (99:33). I think we're clearly confirming just for the record that the NPLs have probably gone to have peak in terms of the relative size of the portfolio. In absolute numbers, there maybe up and down, but &#x2013; month after month, but in terms of the relative size of the portfolio, I think we've stabilized them. Hopefully, it will be something <mark type="ph" /> this &#x2013; (99:56) the later part of 2011.</p>
          <p>And provisioning, I'd like to remind that in 2009, we were expecting that provisions as a part &#x2013; as a proportion to the size of the overall portfolio should be peaking out somewhere between 12% and 14%. We sense that where they are now, 12.2%, that this &#x2013; they'll be &#x2013; in relative terms, they shouldn't be going any higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah. I was actually talking more about 2011. So, I thought &#x2013; I mean, my comment was &#x2013; yeah, anyway.</p>
          <p>One, I think, I want to ask you, I mean, that your corporate loan growth is &#x2013; the number you gave us, 9%, 10%, is substantially below your key competitor, VTB, which is now &#x2013; which pretty recently targeted around 15% of corporate loan growth next year and pretty similar retail loan growth to yours. So, do you &#x2013; why &#x2013; could you explain the difference, why would you be growing at a much lower pace than your key competitor? So, are they doing something differently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to answer that question, one has to understand pretty deep what the appetite risk is, which I don't have access to. And anyway, it is probably not in my position to directly compare us to the competitors. Again, I would say that these numbers that I have given out is somewhat between the base and conservative case, rather than just the base, or &#x2013; rather than just the base, or between base and optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Understood. And then, finally, I think on &#x2013; again, I mean, just in provisions, because, I mean, it's obviously becoming the trickiest point of your earnings for next year. Do you have any &#x2013; previously, you were saying net releases, so it was, I mean, relatively easy to put something in. I mean, do you have any sense on how much your cost of risk will go down next year versus this year? I mean, this year I think you have around, what, 3% right now. So, that should still be a very, very substantial decline, right? Can you quantify this in any way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably not as of yet. We made you some clear guidance in January. But, yes, I can confirm that cost of risk should be visibly reducing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We now have a question from Mikhail Shlemov from VTB Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening. A couple of questions from my side. Just like going on with the provisions, given that the change in your loan book or when the retail is expected to grow faster and the corporate side is somewhat slower, what would be expected cost of risk in terms of new issuance <mark type="ph" /> not (103:14) blended with the recoveries? That's the first one. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in retail, it should be pretty low, definitely less than 1%. In corporate, I probably wouldn't give you any guidance, because we have been working across all the segments. From micro corporate, to small corporate, to medium corporate, to large and largest, it is all very different. The differences between them are measured in full percentage points in quite a number of them. So, I don't think there's sense in aggregating them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it correct to assume that in terms of corporate lending, the cost of risk should be somewhat above 1% versus retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, corporate risk is &#x2013; risk cost is higher than retail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Excellent. And -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty dramatically higher, given what's going on, and given the risk appetite that we're formulating for ourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my second question is what you think would be the main challenge for Sberbank next year or what you would think you would be most troubled coping with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In financial terms or overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hopefully both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, I think our target is to &#x2013; what we are going to be, as an executive board, focusing most of all is continuing our focus to change this organization from a product-driven to client relationship-driven one. That means, both in retail and corporate, calibrate our product line to suit the client need much better, focus on providing the quality of service on a level that is at least up to compare to the best representatives of the competition. And that actually requires doing a bit of a cultural revolution in-house, among our employees to totally change the attribute towards the client, towards the perception of what mean the quality work and what is expected, how do you meet the requirements of the client.</p>
          <p>So, this is what we're putting most of the effort into, want to change the face of our organization in front of client. And then, the commercial success is pretty much guaranteed to come on the back of that. If you can do that, we'll be successful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, in terms of financial, again, given that you've said basically the guidance on all the loans, what do you think would be the most challenging one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is our efforts into sales of loan product, both in retail and corporate, on the backdrop of still pretty weak demand for loans. The aftereffect of the crisis on the economy is the fact that reduced confidence amongst the consumers and amongst the company owners and management is that there isn't enough confidence to plan financials for horizons of three, five years. And that suppresses the demand for investment-type and infrastructure-type products for the corporate sector, and that suppresses the loan growth.</p>
          <p>So, overcoming that, making sure that we can deliver the service to our clients that brings the confidence back into them is a very important task. Our success, financially, is going to be dependent on our ability to achieve that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (108:21) from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for the presentation. Of course, some of my questions have already been answered. I have two small questions remaining, will be &#x2013; you talked about loan growth a lot, but a lot of economists are expecting an acceleration in GDP growth in Russia in 2011. Do you think that this will lead to acceleration in deposit growth? And if you see another year of deposit growth much higher than loan growth, are you taking some strategic initiatives to reduce the impact of this on your margins? And the second one, are you at any point in the future planning any NPL sales? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We do see strong supply of liquidity from retail deposit base continuing for a little while. I wouldn't put it as the growth pace for deposit is much &#x2013; going to be as dramatically bigger than in loans, but still probably going to be visible. Our effort is &#x2013; as I mentioned in my answer to the previous question, is going to be to sell more and better product in loans to overcome the weakness of the demand for loans. That's the biggest effort to overcome that. And in terms of pricing, we've already brought the retail deposit rates down to the psychological threshold, beyond which no bank would venture. Some of the retail deposits in rubles that we have, we pay around 3% per annum. One cannot go much beyond &#x2013; below that.</p>
          <p>NPL sales, we are working on some of the kind of small debt portfolios to check the financial attractiveness of this, because the credit so far has been that our own ability to recover due to the positioning of Sberbank <mark type="ph" /> all across maybe (111:19) country and its branch network penetration is actually a bit more effective than selling things down. But on the other side, we want to test this product and to maybe sell some of the test portfolios in small corporates and retails and we've had some conversations with market players there. But then, again, at this stage, we're talking about amounts that are like &#x2013; or even the percentage points, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (111:55) for me on &#x2013; as related to our asset side. So, it's too early to talk about anything meaningful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. One final follow-up question, and excuse me if you talked about it and I missed it. Are you planning at any time in 2011 to swap credit shares into ordinary shares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is not being practically considered in the near future. We kind of just advanced towards that amongst the members of our supervisory board. It was mutual to negative so far, so we aren't proactively pushing this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much to everyone for good conversation and good questions. We've been working pretty much full two hours. I would probably ask for a last question to be asked and I'll answer that and then we will wrap it up. But don't worry, if you have some of the questions that haven't been answered, Dmitry and I are always accessible through the usual channels. We'll be happy to provide the answers to you.</p>

          <p>Our last question comes from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (113:29) from Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for the call. I just had a quick clarification question. In terms of the provisioning, did you say that they are only released when cash is actually received or are there some releases when there is reclassification to restructured loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. When you restructure a loan and your recovery strategy is based on just replacing one credit product with another, then of course, if this new restructured loan is performing well for six months at least and you see good financials coming in from your borrower, of course, you reclass it into &#x2013; back into performing loan and you release significant part of the provision, if not all. But what I was talking about is when your recovery strategy is different from restructuring and you're essentially not talking about any other new credit product, then of course, there's no reclassification and when you &#x2013; you only release the provisions as and when you get the cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But in terms of recovery strategies, of course, the biggest part of recovery strategies on all our problem loan book is restructuring. In most of the cases, you can resort with that. It's the minority that goes into bankruptcies and other foreclosures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
