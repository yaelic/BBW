        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. My name is Ben Spincer, Director of Investor Relations here at Telstra. I'd like to welcome you to the Results for the Fiscal Year 2008. I'd like to welcome those joining us at our new Executive Briefing Center in Melbourne, on the webcast, and also on conference.</p>
          <p>In a moment, I'll hand over to Sol Trujillo to run you through our results for the year. When Sol and John have spoken to you, we'll then be able to take questions both there in Sydney and in Melbourne. We'll do that from these fixed microphones. So at that point, I'll ask you to come up and ask your questions. Please limit your questions to one only, if possible, so we can get through as many different questioners as possible.</p>
          <p>Without further ado, I'll hand over to Telstra's Chief Executive, Mr. Sol Trujillo. Sol?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, Ben. I'd like to welcome all of you here in Sydney, and I'd also like to welcome those that are joining us for the first time from our new Executive Briefing Center in Melbourne.</p>
          <p>Now, today is about our results for the 2008 financial year and basically, I'm pleased to report another strong set of results on or ahead of guidance. We've continued to execute on our strategy set back in November of 2005, as the transformation continues to redefine the entire business.</p>
          <p>All the way from mobiles to IP, from Consumer to Business, results are flowing now through our financial performance. And I'm also pleased to report that we've maintained the final ordinary dividend at $0.14 per share.</p>
          <p>Now, this management team has established a reputation of delivering on their commitments, and clearly, this year is no exception. Our value differentiation strategy is clearly working. We have grown both our top and bottom line, with our retail sales revenue growing 5.9%, and we beat the important earnings guidance metric with EBIT growing 9.1% on a guidance basis.</p>
          <p>And if you need further proof, our transformation execution is delivering on our promises, we generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $1 billion over last year, and we're confident of achieving our 6 to $7 billion target in 2010. We are now generating more free cash flow than we're paying out as a dividend, which, again, was an important metric for us.</p>
          <p>This is the second consecutive year that we have grown our sales revenue by over $1 billion, with sales revenue up 4.2%. We have enormous scale in this business, and we have leverage, and this management team knows how to leverage it.</p>
          <p>We continue to win in the marketplace. Our value differentiation approach, along with our customer focus, helped deliver another strong set of business unit performances, with retail sales revenue up 5.9%, driven by 3.6% growth in Enterprise and Government, their best performance since competition began; so, David, congratulations.</p>
          <p>In Consumer, PSTN revenue grew by 0.5%, and overall, they grew revenues at 6.1%; David, congratulations.</p>
          <p>In Business, mobile services revenue was up 19.5%, and overall revenues in our Telstra Business were up 8.8%; Deena, congratulations.</p>
          <p>Sensis grew their sales revenue by 8.1% and again, world-leading performance; Bruce, congratulations.</p>
          <p>On our broadband business, you'll hear a little bit later. Obviously, we continue to lead the market here in Australia, but we also continue to lead the world in terms of both broadband growth, as well as ARPU associated with the growth; Justin, congratulations.</p>
          <p>And as we look at, again, our Telstra Country Wide business and how we compete not only in the cities, but in the regions as well and stellar growth that is very strong single-digit growth at the upper end here; Geoff Booth, congratulations.</p>
          <p>And on our wholesale side of the business, as we've been migrating our business across from what we would call the old regulatory model to a new regulatory model where our customers are migrating from resold services and now are moving some other services on to a unbundled platform, we continue to manage that well and I would congratulate Kate McKenzie on her results as well in the wholesale portion of our business.</p>
          <p>And clearly on the operating side, what can I say? What Greg Winn and the whole team have done is terrific. The cost take out; since we've launched our initiatives in 2005 our field force productivity is up 40%. And I'll cover some of the service metrics as well, but again, Greg, Mick, the whole team, congratulations. Terrific year.</p>
          <p>So the transformation benefits are now driving earnings growth with operating expenses growing at just 3.5%, the lowest yearly expense growth in four years as we focus on reducing our costs across the business and the benefits of our transformation continue to emerge.</p>
          <p>Back at Investor Day in 2005, I talked about the fact that Australia was going to be our first priority, our second priority, our third priority. Well, I'm pleased to report that we grew our domestic revenue by 4.8% in the year which is well ahead of our global peers. And so remember, as we think about our operations here in Australia, it's not just about beating those that we compete with here but it's also about being best in class in the whole category globally and the numbers that you'll see today continue to reflect how we rank at the top of our class around the world.</p>
          <p>At the present time, we're seeing minimal impact from the prevailing macroeconomic environment on our domestic business. Yes, the cost of fuel and power has risen and the cost of debt has gone up but overall our customer-centric and value-differentiated approach is so far combating these factors in our business.</p>
          <p>In retail broadband, we continue to defy our global peers by growing both our market share and ARPU and actual volumes simultaneously. Our 3G penetration has now reached 47% of our mobile customer base. We have left most of our global peers behind, a ringing endorsement of our early and significant investment in 3G at our 850 megahertz spectrum range.</p>
          <p>Our strategy in investment in mobiles is redefining the market both here in Australia and around the world, we are resetting global expectations. John will discuss our new guidance in more detail. But I just want to highlight a couple of the most important points with all of you now.</p>
          <p>For 2009, we expect continued robust growth at the top line coupled with further EBITDA margin expansion. In 2010, we have again raised our long-term targets for revenue growth, whilst maintaining our 46 to 48% EBITDA margin target in 2010. Driven by variable CapEx, associated with our revenue growth, we are raising our 2010 target for CapEx to sales to around 14%. But our 6 to $7 billion free cash flow target in that year remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>Central to our transformation and central to delivering an excellent customer experience is the IT transformation. For our migrated consumer customers, we have moved from managing their data across 74 billing products and ordering systems to now just three.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to tell you today of the outstanding progress made by our IT transformation team. We've now migrated 3.3 million customers, and 4.3 million services, and to be quite frank, we did not achieve our ambitious target of five million customer migrations before the end of June. But more importantly, I now am probably more confident than ever about the cost take out targets that we have associated with our business, because we have migrated over three million customers. We'll have our five million, probably by the end of September, and when we do that we now know that the code is absolutely right.</p>
          <p>So the experiences that you have seen with other companies that have had to backtrack; that have had to, in effect, step back from what they'd launched in terms of billing systems changes, OSS and other platforms we don't have that is an issue. That is now essentially out of the way, as we've migrated over three million customers and would be moving to the five and to the seven before the end of the year, which is the good news as part of our story here. And again, we will continue the migration, not only of our consumer, but later this month we will begin the migration of our business customers.</p>
          <p>So, let me be clear, the code is deployed, and running at scale. And this has all been achieved without breaking what I would call our central commitment that there should be no interruption to either customers or the wider business. We've seen no increase in complaint volumes and all billing accuracy and revenue assurance metrics are equal between the new and the legacy systems that we have in our business.</p>
          <p>And to some of the naysayers out there, let me again remind you of the scale of what we're looking at. Because again, we've emphasized this all along, we're going to do what's right in the process, as we go forward. The breadth and speed of the transformation are unparalleled. We are the only what I would call quad-play across the four pillars of PSTN, broadband, wireless and FOXTEL, we've simultaneously built or refurbished all data center infrastructure and we have 100% new applications in place in addition to what we have I guess previously talked about.</p>
          <p>Half of our employee base is involved in all internal and external channels as well. We have processed hundreds of thousands of orders and millions of bills to date and processed more than four million call records per day on this new set of capabilities.</p>
          <p>We have more than 15 million lines of code in the new environment, including five million in customized software for migration and mediation purposes only. This supports old to new and new to old integration and, essentially, will disappear &#x2013; it goes away &#x2013; when we finish TR2 so that we will have completed the mass market portion of our transformation.</p>
          <p>1,016 OSS and BSS systems have now been decommissioned since 2005, including 365 IT systems. We've now trained more than 12,600 of our staff on the new systems. And in case anyone could be in any doubt, let me, again, remind you of all the complexity of what we're undertaking in the legacy systems and why we are being so meticulous about what we do, as we migrate our customers.</p>
          <p>We had 2,200 products. We had 236,000 product codes. We had 421,000 pricing charge codes or packages, as you might call them in external context. We had 10,000 discount plans.</p>
          <p>And so when you think about that in a context of permutations that we have to manage, as we think about ultimately getting a customer migrated and being able to see the services actually work as we migrate them and to see the charging for the services that we provide actually show up on a bill and to make sure that we can actually collect it and then to make sure that we can monitor and serve it. That is what this work is all about as we think about the meticulousness by which Greg Winn and Tom Lamming and John McInerney the whole team have been working.</p>
          <p>So we have run 90,000 test cases to cover a vast majority of the kinds of permutations that might be of issue as you've seen with other companies that have had failed conversions happened.</p>
          <p>Now, this has ensured us to the point that we're at today where we now have as I mentioned before the live customers, the migration having gone very smooth so far. The time and care taken ensure that the new systems would work and then we could go both bill, collect as I said a minute ago.</p>
          <p>As any informed observer would expect, we are doing it carefully, prudently and successfully because the pay off to our customers and to the business will be huge and that's why when some of you will ask the question, does any of this affect our cost take out? The answer is no. So, our free cash flow stays the way it stays as part of our target, while EBITDA margins as we've said at 46 to 48%, do not change.</p>
          <p>Our transformation is re-architecting the business essentially for what I would call the broadband world and today and over the last few weeks you have clearly seen the difference between a Telstra, who has architected their business for the broadband world and those that we compete with who have an architecture for the old narrow band world and are trying to be broadband in what they do.</p>
          <p>We said, we would build next generation networks and IT systems and we have. Since the launch of the Next G network mobile services revenue growth has accelerated from mid single-digit to double-digit levels. Since the launch of the Next IP network IP and data revenues now exceed legacy data services revenue. And we have invested in transmission and backhaul, which again for those of us that know how to run the business we understand an end-to-end experience not just component pieces.</p>
          <p>We said that we would be broadband focused and we have in the case of our retail broadband, our retail broadband market share and ARPU have both increased, which has defined the trends around the world.</p>
          <p>Now, let me be clear. At Telstra, we don't just talk about SIOs. We really focus on margin share and revenue share because those are the ultimate metrics that show up for a shareholder and so we focus on all the above.</p>
          <p>Once again, we've outgrown our nearest fixed broadband competitor by four X nothing has changed. We said we would integrate and we have. Sensis, BigPond and FOXTEL content is now available on mobiles and more is coming. We said we would focus on the customer and we have. We created a dedicated small medium enterprise unit that's now called Telstra Business and segmented our business around customer needs.</p>
          <p>You can see in the results that I mentioned a little bit ago we have outgrown the market and we have created dramatic growth in his part of our business. We said, we would focus on delivering value to customers and we are. Our multi-product holdings have increased and consumer PSTN over the last couple of years has halved as we look at the churn rate on consumer PSTN. You won't find that anywhere else in the world.</p>
          <p>We said we would revitalize our retail experience for the customers and we're. We opened recently five new world-class T[life] stores this year and a further 88 new or refreshed stores are planned to open in fiscal 2009 and the ARPU per customer that are now traveling through those stores is about 40 plus percent higher than in our traditional store. So the strategy of Telstra is working at all levels.</p>
          <p>And while there is a fascination at present from some quarters on the IT transformation, it is important to remember the overall transformation is much more than just IT. It is more than just building new networks. It's about building what I have called a media-comms company of the future. The transformation is a bold strategy and we are delivering results. We are resetting and redefining global expectations as to what is possible.</p>
          <p>We've already made significant progress over the past three years and all this has been the objective associated with being a global leader. It's a journey and let me just say, we're not even done yet, we're not even close to where I think we can be as a company in terms of this whole media-comms space. Our investments in the transformation have allowed us to redefine the service experience of our customers across a wide range of metrics. And this is very important, because as we track our customers every year, starting back in the '05 timeframe to today, all of our customer value attributes metrics have gone up. And they've gone up relative to our competitors in a big time way.</p>
          <p>And as we look at those reports that we file with the regulators and the government agencies, but also as we look at it in terms of how we think about managing volumes in the business, our network trouble reports have fallen 35% since 2005. And that is counting in some of the flooding and some of the natural disasters that we've had here in Australia, including the flooding up in Queensland and Northern Territories earlier this year.</p>
          <p>ADSL held orders are now down from more than 5,000 in 2006 to around 100 today, even though our broadband volumes have increased. We continue to meet 95% of our customer commitments. To put this in context, we fulfill more than 2 million customer commitments per month, and we're now meeting our wideband customer delivery dates 95% of the time, a 14-percentage-point improvement since November of 2005.</p>
          <p>So while all this has been going on in terms of refining, rebuilding, changing out platforms, etcetera, etcetera, and introducing new products and services, service delivered to our customers has gone up. Reliability of networks has gone up. And the customers are giving us that feedback, both in terms of when we survey them but, more importantly, when they buy, which is to me the ultimate metric. Unlike perhaps one of our competitors and others of our competitors, who have been plagued with some of the problems, on availability and other issues, we are meeting all of our standards and our availabilities run at very high levels.</p>
          <p>Our Next G network is running at near 100% availability, our broadband networks at 49 PSTN at 59, and our transmission essential at a 100%. We have invested in our networks, as we think about over the last three years. Our mobile's performance continues to lead the world with mobile services revenue growing 12.3% and total mobile revenues grew 12.7%. So again, I'm just a businessperson, but as I look at it relative to our largest competitor, we only outgrew them four to one in terms of services revenue.</p>
          <p>So I think that our team is doing relatively well. The catalyst for this growth has been the superior speed, superior coverage, superior quality, superior capacity offered by our Next G network. True differentiation exists and the numbers absolutely support our 3G strategy. During the year 3G revenue overtook 2G revenue and now accounts for more than half of mobile services revenue.</p>
          <p>We had 4.4 million 3G subscribers at the end of June, up 117% year-on-year. 3G mobile penetration has more than doubled since June 2007 to 47% and 3G postpaid ARPU was up 5.3% at $77.51. Mobile data revenue as a percentage of mobile services revenue has almost doubled since June of '05, to more than 30% this financial year. And during the year, non-SMS data revenue overtook SMS. The main driver of mobile data growth has been the ongoing strength in wireless broadband and this is despite the skeptics who said, we could not maintain our wireless broadband momentum, we continue to add 20,000 subscribers per month, again value does matter. We've built $0.5 billion business in just two years and we now have 588,000 subscribers generating ARPU of around $90 a month, still.</p>
          <p>But mobile data is more than just wireless broadband. Other data revenue grew 60% in the second half from higher email, content, MMS, browsing revenues. Our wireless email penetration continues to increase and this will be boosted further by the 3G BlackBerry Bold and other new smart phones, such as the HTC Diamond, Samsung 617, Sony Ericsson X1 and Palm Treo Pro. We are continuing to lead the market and by the end of the year we will have broken the speed barrier again by offering peak network downlink speeds of 21 Megabits per second and uplink speed of 5.76 Megabits per second, the first operator in the world to do so. So the pressure continues. The innovation continues and the differentiation will continue where every Australian in this country will understand, when they think about networks when they think about services in the mobile space along with everything else, Next G is the best, will be the best and will continue to be as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Our IP access revenues continue to grow, highlighting the success of our Next IP network. Our IP and data revenues exceeded legacy data revenues for the first time in the second half fiscal 2008. This is a significant milestone which illustrates how we have redefined the business to focus again on IP. Contrary to conventional thinking, we've grown the portfolio through the migration of existing customers, driving higher ARPUs by providing a value proposition, again across bandwidth, speed, scalability, security, applications, reliability and services and did I say reliability. In case I didn't say it loud enough, reliability and security are very important to our customers.</p>
          <p>Our government business is growing strongly on the back of our differentiation, particularly with integration of the Next IP and Next G networks. Lower IP revenues continue to grow strongly and our PSTN revenue decline continue to slow, decreasing 3.2% in the year compared with the 4.4% decline in 2007 as we win at the retail access line level. Retail PSTN access lines grew for the 14 consecutive month in June, our consumer PSTN revenue grew by 0.5% as the strategy of segmentation and subscription pricing plans continue to deliver results that we were looking for. Again, our PSTN performance in unmatched by our global peer group.</p>
          <p>We expect PSTN revenue to continue to decline, as mobiles and broadband continue to grow. This was highlighted in July, when total mobile revenue exceeded PSTN revenue for the first time in the history of this company.</p>
          <p>We are also proud of our broadband business. We grew our market share by a further 2 percentage points, to 49%, and ARPU increased 2.9% to $53. And I can't say this frequently enough, for those of you that pay attention to other companies around the world, there are no other companies that are growing market share, that are growing ARPU in this space. It doesn't happen, but it's happening here, at Telstra.</p>
          <p>In contrast to 2005, our broadband growth is now significantly greater than the decline in PSTN in absolute dollar terms. Our strategy of simple value-based offers is working as the number of customers signing up to higher value Liberty plans grows. Our Liberty plans give our customers high data allowances with bill certainty, and as a result, churn has reduced to world's best practice at under 15%. At the end of June 2008, more than two-thirds of our fixed broadband base were on a Liberty plan, and in quarter four, 75% of fixed broadband sales were on Liberty plans.</p>
          <p>Our emerging domestic content revenues, which include Sensis, internet and mobile value added services, are expected to exceed $500 million in five years. Yearly trends are encouraging. Mobile video streams grew a 137% year-on-year. Online search revenues more than doubled. BigPond 'Web' tab unique view is growing 6% month-on-month.</p>
          <p>FOXTEL completes our suite of media-comms assets and the business has strong momentum with revenues up 17%, EBITDA up 48% and free cash flow up 43%. During the year, FOXTEL subscribers passed the 1.5 million mark, ARPU increased to almost $85 and churn reduced to 13.3% in the second half. Also in June, FOXTEL introduced high-def, and almost 40,000 subscribers have already signed up to the service.</p>
          <p>Today, I'm pleased to announce the launch of our new BigPond music service. BigPond is changing the game in music just as we did in other categories. We will offer tracks from all major record labels in a format that can be transferred between most music players including the iPod, Sony Walkman, Xbox, PS3 and some home medias and &#x2013; home media centers. From today, Australians have a real choice between our competitors' world, where consumers have to juggle devices and formats and often find their music locked on to one device versus BigPond's open world of convenience and simplicity. BigPond's music will be easier to find, simpler to download and cheaper to buy; and for BigPond customers it will be free of bandwidth customers. I would just say to all of you as you leave today. Just go through the store on the way out and you'll see how it works because it's pretty cool.</p>
          <p>Our leadership and innovation extends to the competitive advantage we have built around speed, coverage, content, reliability and services as we continue to consolidate our position. The combined reach of our sites gives Telstra one of the largest online audiences in Australia with the highest share of the online advertising market. As a cornerstone of our media-comms strategy, we're also outgrowing the market in the five major categories of sports, news, games, music, and movies.</p>
          <p>Sensis is another one of our key drivers of our media-comms strategy. The top line grew by more than 8% as the print business defied global trends and digital media revenues continue to grow at strong double-digit levels.</p>
          <p>I do have to say with a big smile the print business where many people had given up a few years ago and had relegated it to a no growth, and actually as you look around the world and virtually every company, it has been a negative growth category. We have a special team here led by Carol Johnson and some other folks working for Bruce that have done something that have defied the laws of gravity around the world. And that is, again, our print directories' revenue grew 5.4% for the year with Yellow print revenues returning to growth and White Pages print revenue growing at double digits. And Yellow and White Pages Online directories grew by over 20% to exceed $200 million for the first time.</p>
          <p>But Sensis is more than just print. Our digital businesses had strong double-digit growth. MediaSmart display advertising grew 41%, Whereis satellite navigation 52%, and our SouFun business in terms of unaudited U.S. dollars grew 67%. If you combine all of our digital revenues including Online directories, you see that digital media grew 32% to $426 million. In fact, digital media has grown from 7% to 20% of total revenue in three years. The result has been achieved through the Sensis transformation of improving usage, advertising ROI, systems and processes. For example, Yellow network usage grew 4.3% to over 10 million a month. And in July, yellow.com.au usage grew 19% in one month after we opened up listings to various search engines. We expect Sensis to achieve mid-single-digit revenue growth and to continue to further improve the revenue trends in the metro print canvasses.</p>
          <p>Our presence in China continues to expand. It is the largest online market in the world, now, in terms of eyeballs, and our combined sites in China attract more than 2 billion page views a month. SouFun surfs 50% more pages each month than all traffic to ninemsn, Fairfax and News Digital combined. SouFun's expansion is on track.</p>
          <p>When we acquired SouFun, they had a presence in 45 cities. In two years, this has grown to 85 cities, and we plan to expand by the end of this calendar year to a 100 cities, each city having a minimum population of 1 million people.</p>
          <p>Our recent investments in the online auto and digital device markets place Telstra in a strong position to build growth in the Chinese advertising sector. We are now number one in real estate and auto. And to understand the scale of the China auto market, for instance, they sell more cars in two weeks than Australia sells in a year.</p>
          <p>With the continued growth in China, we expect our China portfolio to deliver revenue growth in excess of 50% this year on a pro forma basis. And in five years, we expect our China businesses to grow at almost $1 billion a year in revenue and earn EBITDA margins between 30 and 40%. And for a moment, can I just compare Telstra's Chinese businesses to another one that has gotten a lot of publicity Alibaba, a Chinese online company with a market cap today of about $5 billion in today's market and revenues forecasted around 500 million in 2008. This is a business forecast to have 20% EBITDA growth, which is a fraction of what Telstra's Chinese assets are achieving. To me this suggest that the market has not yet understood, where we're going and what we have in our portfolio in terms of the investments in that region.</p>
          <p>Finally, our transformation success is driving our strong financial performance and is redefining all aspects of the business. We are at or near the top of our global peer group across many of the key financial and operational measures. We are getting on with the job of removing the complexity, deciles, the duplication in infrastructure products, hundreds of platforms, IT billing systems et cetera. We have confidence in the future and confidence in our strategy and this is reflected in our fiscal 2009 guidance and the raising of our long-term targets for revenue growth, while maintaining our 46 to 48% EBITDA margin target in 2010 and while we remain on track for our 6 to $7 billion of free cash flow in 2010 as we continue to focus on creating shareholder value. Looks like we're getting dancing music with these numbers.</p>
          <p>We are transforming into a media-comms company. We have built the next generation networks and we are truly an integrated operator. And the IT transformation will bring the media-comms vision to life.</p>
          <p>And I'll just make one last comment. In November, when we meet and we talk on what we have established as our tradition of investor day, you'll get a chance to see the full impacts of the value of what's happening in our channels, in our stores and everywhere that will be the full product and a full play out of much of this tier 1 work that thousands of people in Telstra have been working on and it is going to be exciting because we really take the game to another level.</p>
          <p>So, I'm going to hand it over to John now to take you through the numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Sol and good morning to everybody here in Sidney and Melbourne and elsewhere on various medium that we are joined out live with today. I'm very pleased to report another set of strong financial results. Again, we have met or we've exceeded guidance on all measures.</p>
          <p>Sales revenue grew 4.2% or nearly $1 billion to $24.7 billion. Total revenues grew 4.7% or $1.1 billion to $24.8 billion. EBITDA was up 5.6% or $550 million to $10.4 billion with margins expanding to 42.2%. Reported EBIT increased 7.7% or $447 million to $6.2 billion. EBIT was up 9.1% on a guidance basis after you adjust for CSL New World's accelerated depreciation of $77 million. And profit after tax in minorities rose 13.5% to $3.7 billion. The higher profit relative to EBIT resulted from relatively flat finance cost after the marked-to-market adjustments that are required by IFRS and a slightly lower effective tax rate due to some one-off items like refunds. While revenue growth appears to have slowed in the second half, there're a few factors that are driving this including the profile of low-margin handset revenues across the year, the sale of businesses in the exceptional first half of '08 PSTN performance which we said could not be sustained in the second half. None of these are impacted by economic activity levels, and we expect revenue growth continuing around 3 to 4% level as per our guidance that Sol stated earlier. We have maintained our final fully franked ordinary dividend at $0.14.</p>
          <p>Let me add a little bit of flavor to the guidance given earlier by Sol. After our strong performance in fiscal year '08 and in spite of the slowing economic conditions, we are expecting to maintain our revenue and EBIT growth in fiscal year '09.</p>
          <p>So for fiscal year '09, we expect revenue growth of between 3 to 4%, EBITDA growth of between 6 and 7%, EBIT growth of between 6 and 8%. Accrued CapEx, we are guiding today that it will be between 4.3 billion and 4.6 billion, obviously a reduction on the prior year. With respect to the fiscal year '09 guidance, it is important to note the following. We expect total depreciation, amortization of around $4.5 billion as we begin the amortization of our new IT platforms and we have a similar level of accelerated depreciation for CSL's networking, as we have this year. $50 million is included in here for FOXTEL distribution and in fact we've already reserved that distribution in the month of July. In addition, in the light of the continued revenue growth, there might be a small increase in the total operating cost in 2009, in order to support the revenue.</p>
          <p>As we promised in February, we are also updating our long-term objectives, as we cross the transformation halfway point. It is important to note that these objectives do exclude any potential NBN investments. Our revenue growth CAGR for the fiscal year '05 to fiscal year 2010 increases from 2.5 to 3% to 3 to 4% as the benefits of our transformation continue to have a positive impact on our top line. EBITDA growth CAGR for again the five years to fiscal year 2010 increases from 2.5 to 3% to 3 to 3.5%, while our OpEx growth guidance increases from 2 to 3 to 4 to 5%. Importantly, we are maintaining as Sol has said, our 46 to 48% EBITDA margin objective on the higher revenue objective.</p>
          <p>The workforce reduction objective is now the original target reduction of 10 to 12,000 FTEs by fiscal year 2010 and this will give us maximum flexibility on how we structure the future business as we grow key areas, such as mobiles and broadband. We are also increasing our CapEx/sales guidance today to around 14%.</p>
          <p>Let me just explain why. This is driven by the customer demand variable CapEx, as you grow revenues you get cost of goods sold that falls, you also have a variable element of CapEx and that is what is occurring in our business. It's driven by around about 300 million in customer demand driven CapEx and about 200 million in additional transformation CapEx. When you think about that the size of our transformation CapEx program is very large.</p>
          <p>The 14% guidance is in line &#x2013; I noticed with consensus but let me tell you know, growth is a good thing, so that we are growing our CapEx in order to grow our business is a good thing.</p>
          <p>The IT transformation remains on track with more than 3.3 million customers and 4.3 million services already migrated, and I want to conform that our appropriately cautious approach as outlined by Sol, just before to customer migration has not had a material impact on financial performance and will not have an impact on our guidance as you can see from our updated long-term guidance that we bring to you today.</p>
          <p>Finally, I want to highlight that we are reaffirming our fiscal year '10 free cash flow objective of between 6 billion and $7 billion. This is a critical target, it's one which we watch very carefully, and it is the overall objective of our transformation.</p>
          <p>So let me just look at free cash flow for a minute. Today's results show, we continue to deliver and are on target for our free cash flow objective that I've just mentioned. We generated an additional 956 million in free cash flow over the year. Over the next two years, we will extract further operating leverage as cost savings are achieved in cash CapEx does continue to decline. So this does give us the confidence of hitting that 6 to $7 billion target in fiscal year 2010.</p>
          <p>I just want to bring to your attention the changing product mix that's occurred since we started on this transformation journey back in November 2005. So I'll just give you a quick sense of this as it already has fundamentally changed our business. This management team has taken a company from a slow, incumbent dominated by legacy networks and technology to a fully integrated media-comms business where the Next G and the Next IP networks drive growth in new product revenues.</p>
          <p>New revenues already constitute 27.3% of domestic sales revenues compared to our previous guidance of our target of 30% of domestic sales revenue by the fiscal year 2010. The legacy fixed revenues now only make up 36% of total sales, a full of nine percentage points over three years. The combination of mobiles and internet also make up 36% of total sales, an increase of 11 percentage points over three years and during a period when the base has grown $2.5 billion I think that's incredible &#x2013; just think about a business growing $2.5 billion over three years on the top line.</p>
          <p>So let me talk a little bit about the fiscal year '08 product growth. So just returning to fiscal year '08 performance domestic sales revenue growth was driven by solid results across a whole product group and the highlights include mobiles growth, with mobile services revenue growth of 12.3%, 3G postpaid ARPU up 5.3% to $78, and mobile data revenues were up 44% to more than $1.5 billion and when you exclude wireless broadband for mobile services revenue, the mobile service revenue still grew an impressive 7% and internet was equally as impressive where we increased broadband market share by two percentage points to now 49% and grew ARPUs 2.9% to $53. Fixed broadband growth remain strong at 30% with services and operations up over 330,000.</p>
          <p>In PSTN declines were contained with our market based management strategy driving customer win-backs and growth in customers on subscription pricing plans from 364,000 to just under 600,000 in the last 12 months. However, as I put on this graphic slide here, the ACCC's below cost ULL pricing negatively impacted PSTN performance. And as this chart shows, there was a significant gap between the revenue we earn from unbundled local loop and what it costs us. And this has resulted in a cumulative shortfall of at least $130 million and this gap is getting wider.</p>
          <p>In IP access and internet direct revenues exceeded legacy data as Sol mentioned for the first time in the second half of fiscal 2008.</p>
          <p>Let me talk a little bit about the mobile growth. I want to comment further because some persist to judge performance solely on SIO terms and as Sol pointed we believe it's very important to look at revenue growth because there are multiple SIMs these days and people walk around with many devices for various reasons. The important point is that we had mobile services revenue growth of 12.3% for the year, a great performance whichever way you count it and we believe we grew mobile services revenue market share again from 43.6% at the end of fiscal '07 to 44.2% in fiscal '08, an increase of 60 basis points.</p>
          <p>Mobile services revenue growth for postpaid was even stronger at 15.9% which is a world leading achievement. It shows that our strategy of winning revenue market share rather than capturing SIOs in low value segments is delivering value to our shareholders. The trend in prepaid services and operations has been volatile, as we periodically disconnect inactive SIOs particularly through the year we've just had given the CDMA network closure. And the growth is coming through value differentiation not costly price competition. Our mobile EBITDA margins increased 2.3% to around 36%.</p>
          <p>Let me just emphasize now a bit more than Sol had on retail performance. Since we manage our business on a segment basis and not a product basis so I will discuss the performance in context of our retail segments. Overall, we had strong retail sales revenue growth of 5.9%. So let me take you through the segments one by one.</p>
          <p>So first Consumer; our Consumer business has thrived since needs-based segmentation was introduced. Leveraging market-based management, we are transforming our culture, products service offerings and channels to produce a better experience for the customer. In the face of strong headwinds from ULL and mobile substitution, we grew in this segment PSTN revenue by 0.5% and added 56,000 services and operations and had more than 580,000 customers on subscription pricing plans and PSTN churn was under 5%. This is a strong vindication of market-based management.</p>
          <p>Mobile services revenue grew 7% with 72% of postpaid customers on 3G as we expanded the Next G handset range to more than 50. This was achieved with subscriber acquisition and re-contract costs being reduced by 24% in the Consumer segment. While second half growth has slowed, it came after a bumper second half '07 and we are expecting around double-digit revenue growth in consumer mobile services in the fiscal year '09, which we have begun despite increasing competitive intensity and the uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Total internet revenues grew 38% in the segment to 1.5 billion driven by services and operations and ARPU growth. DSL ARPU was up 6.9% as we migrated customers to the faster speed Liberty plans, which is a terrific achievement in the face of fairly fierce broadband competition.</p>
          <p>So maybe I'll turn to the Business segment. Telstra Business grew sales revenue 8.6%, a very strong result across the whole product range in key products in Telstra Business and we expect the margins will expand as we drove scale in this newly formed business unit. Telstra Business delivered another great mobiles results with services revenue up 19.5% &#x2013; can you hear that 19.5%.</p>
          <p>Mobile data revenue now accounts for 23% of services revenue, an increase of 6%. 3G now represents 65% of the business postpaid customer base, up 36 percentage points during the year and 3G ARPU has grown 15% in the year to $97 in this segment.</p>
          <p>Broadband revenue grew 51% and customers on business-grade. Fixed broadband products grew by 62%. We also achieved strong revenue growth of 134% in business-grade wireless data plans as more businesses realize the productivity benefits of fast and reliable mobile broadband.</p>
          <p>IP and data access revenues were up 26% in this segment with strong growth in internet direct and IP access portfolios for high-end business customers.</p>
          <p>And in fixed, in this segment we grew 1% despite the market declining 2%. And we added 30,000 PSTN SIOs and believe we are winning these customers in both competitive on-net and off-net areas where the competition is strongest.</p>
          <p>Sol also mentioned very strong performance in Enterprise and Government. It had a very strong year. It grew revenues 3.6% their best performance since competition began and they also reduced costs. Revenue growth came from winning new contracts and driving value for customers in an integrated IP world. We recently signed over 960 million of new business including major deals with Medibank Private, the Department of Defence and Techcorp . Customer satisfaction also remains at all time highs. Strong core carriage growth continued and IP access growth of 26% more than offset the decline in the old legacy data networks. This demonstrates that the transformation is delivering tangible benefits for customers and value for the shareholder. The launch of next dimension working and the application of value-based management provides us the momentum in this segment going forward.</p>
          <p>Mobile revenue growth in this segment was strong at 26%. Non-SMS data revenue was up 74% and represented 29% of mobile revenues.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have decided to keep CAS as a key offering in the enterprise market.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to expenses. On the cost side, OpEx grew 3.5% to $14.6 billion, and total expenses were up 3.3% to $18.8 billion. This is in line with the comments that I made at the half year results and Investor Day back in November last year.</p>
          <p>So, let's just have a look &#x2013; let's take the costs &#x2013; labor expense rose 3.5%, and this was driven by a redundancy expense increase of $89 million to $238 million as we reduced absolute FTE numbers ahead of plan. Excluding redundancy costs, the growth in labor was up 1.3% reflecting increases in wages and sales commissions and additional costs of some special staff in the growth areas and where we have the need for skills with new technologies. These higher costs were mostly offset by an overall full-time equivalent staff reduction in the year of nearly 2,700 which excludes the acquisitions and divestments such as SouFun and our recent China acquisitions.</p>
          <p>So let's lay it out &#x2013; let's just look at now the directly variable costs. The directly variable costs increased at a modest rise of 0.6%. While DVCs, as they are known, as may again increase closer to revenue growth levels, it demonstrates our success in getting key parts of our cost base under our control. Other directly variable costs growth of 4.9% of sale in the slide was driven by service fees associated with the sale of FOXTEL through Telstra, so the Pay TV revenue growth in Telstra.</p>
          <p>The key drivers of the directly variable costs to sales ratio of just 0.1 were a declining subscriber acquisition and recontracting cost and flat network payments which were assisted by the mobile termination right decreases.</p>
          <p>I just want to touch on service subscriber acquisition and recontracting costs, because those have been managed very well when we have a decline here of 19% year-on-year to around $149 per customer. You might recall this was up sort of $184 at the end of last year. This has been driven by two factors; firstly, falling handset costs due to greater scale with the 850 megahertz band handsets, and secondly through market-based management, we are better able to target incentives to customer life time value.</p>
          <p>The total subscriber acquisition of recontracting cost expense as a percentage of mobile services revenue has fallen from 17% to 14% over the year, and this is helping drive mobile margin improvement, that I mentioned earlier and we believe a further small decline is possible again in 2009.</p>
          <p>If you look at the, what's called the other expense area, it did increase by 6.5%. A significant was driver was IT professional services costs; they increased $147 million or 35% as we continue to work on our consumer IT platform migrations and as you saw the 3.3 million customer migrations and so on. For 2009, this expense line will remain significant as the second phase of the IT transformation is completed and then as we've said on numerous occasions will start to decline through the 2010 fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Data and inventory impairment expenses or bad debt if you like and inventory write-offs, they increased though total impairments fell because you might recall last year we had a Trading Post write-down. The data impairment were driven by various factors including higher dealer provisions and higher mobile bad debts due to higher postpaid volumes and higher inventory impairment was mainly due to obsolescence's a result of the CDMA disclosure and writing off some of the older CDMA handsets.</p>
          <p>So let me talk about CapEx. CapEx has passed the peak, we talked about the peak here being last in '06, '07. Accrued CapEx was 4.9 billion a reduction of nearly 1 billion on the fiscal year '07's historical high, and in line with our '08 guidance of between 4.6 and 4.9. CapEx declined across most categories as we passed the peak transformation spend and trend more towards what I would call a normal program. Transmission spend increased slightly as we invested in the Sydney to Hawaii cable and we also contributed to the Asian American Gateway cable project and IT CapEx remained high near $1.25 billion as we continue to work on tier one build started to invest in tier two. However, some items of CapEx such as soft switches are on hold as we announced previously pending the outcome of the NBN process. Depreciation and amortization of 4.2 billion included 77 million accelerated depreciation in CSL New World as a result of the new network built.</p>
          <p>If there is just one thing that I want to live with you today it is our focus on achieving this 6 to $7 billion free cash flow objective in fiscal year 2010. It's what the program is about, what the strategy is about; it's about developing strong free cash flow for our shareholders. And today's result shows we are on target to achieve. Of course the work doesn't stop at the end of fiscal year 2010, because there are more cost to take out in fiscal year '11 and fiscal year '12, but the transformation is allowing us to do that. It's building a new world-leading sustainable business that will create continued long-term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>So, thank you and we will now take some questions from various locations. Sol?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Sol. Congratulations on strong results. Sameer Chopra from Deutsche Bank. I had two questions. One on network decommissioning. Network decommissioning started last year and I was wondering why we are not seeing this starting to impact your cost lines at present? My second question, again relates to CapEx, and I wanted to try and understand the extent to which inflation is impacting CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll let John go ahead and take both of those right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When we talk about network decommissioning and there are quite a number of platforms that have been exited and platforms that have been captivating, we are not spending any more money on them. But it takes time to get the customers off platforms. It takes quite some time to actually to be able to close them down. So whilst we've stopped work on them, there is still some small running costs as we work through the process of migrating customers off.</p>
          <p>We shouldn't &#x2013; nobody should underestimate, and we don't underestimate how much work is in getting the customers to migrate and so there is a lag and we've said all along that there will be a lag and that's why the cost there takes some time. But you also see that the CapEx is going down because we had kept spending on those platforms as well and you can see the cost of mix of the CapEx, less than fixed assets, less spend in the CapEx core and sub core network. Inflation on the &#x2013; sorry, your question was on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Inflations impact on CapEx. I know your CapEx came in at the upper end of your guidance, and we are suggesting that perhaps there is another 200 million in the '10 number on CapEx. I am &#x2013; is this wage inflation, is it equipment cost, is it scope issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, CapEx doesn't have &#x2013; isn't impacted a lot by inflation, although many of the contracts will have escalated costs in them. Usually, and most of the time, in most technologies, you will find a cost curve that's going down as technology improves and innovation takes place. So it's not a huge impact, but there is some cost escalated certainly in the contracts with respect to technology delivery. But the CapEx is on its pathway down as we said it would be and you've heard me say today that, we've got a little more CapEx in the last or our fiscal year 2010. Good news is it is related to growth primarily.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You have most of your CapEx contracts locked in for '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to emphasize the last point of it, that when I think about CapEX, we had talked back in November of '05 about where we would be progressing on CapEx given growth rates and we were talking about much less growth rates than where we're at today. So when you look at 12 plus percent services revenue growth on mobiles, obviously we're spending more on mobile infrastructure than we built into the plan which is a good thing. Because we want more growth and it is driving a lot of bottom line benefit. As we look at broadband and the growth rates that we have of achieving nearly 50% broadband growth rates and you look at all the DSL, the DSLAMS and all the things that are associated with it as we've deployed additional capital to reach more places in Australia and to increase our market share, all of that is part of capital plan but that's good capital spend.</p>
          <p>So when I think about capital and CapEx, that's why we gave the guidance that we did in terms of the range because we set a lot of stretch in this business on about everything that we do and the good news is that our team is meeting their stretch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I suppose, as an absolute level, I expected CapEx to be steady but as a percentage &#x2013; sorry, as an absolute level, you would expect CapEx to increase but as a percentage and we thought it stayed about 12. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Laurent Horrut, JPMorgan. I just had a couple of accounting type questions. On the D&amp;A, there is reasonably a material step up from '08 and John, is that the level you are expecting it will stay at for, sort of, beyond 2009 and 2010, and would you give us a bit more color on what's driven the increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said in my speech, we are starting to bring on ready for use, is when you start to depreciate or amortize some of the software. And when you have got customers on, I guess what, it's working, it's in use, and we are starting the amortization. So the amortization starts to kick-up on the software and the lift to 4.5 as of &#x2013; given some guidance on in the '08 or '09 year, it's due to that but also it's got again some accelerated depreciation but they are at the same level in CSL, but primarily, it is driven by the software now coming into service.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And second question on the tax rate. You mentioned the effective tax rate of 28% to be below, same question into '09, do you expect the sort of one-off and credits to play the same way so what should we be look at in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not going to try and guess the effective tax rate in the '08-'09 year, but as you would know in any year, you have large objections and you get some refunds, depends on the R&amp;D climb, and there will be again R&amp;D climbs in this fiscal year, so the effective tax rate can fluctuate about 1% from where it is today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations to you and your team on strong results. It seems everything is working pretty smoothly now, and more confident of the targets over the next year or two. I'm just wondering when shareholders might benefit from that in terms of an uplift in dividends, is that possible in '09 or are we waiting for 2010 for that uplift in dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ian, the answer is the same as we always give. Each year the Board will assess our relative position, but like you said, obviously there is each day that passes each year, each quarter, there is more and more confidence as we hit the numbers that we've been hitting. And the Board will assess at the end of the next fiscal year, what we want to do from a capital policy, whether it's dividends or share buybacks, or if we have more growth opportunities in terms of how we use the capital. But rest assured, the Board is very mindful of treating our shareholders well, whether it'd be through share price appreciation or dividends.</p>

          <p>In previous presentations, there's always been a highlight that the number one priority for the Company is fully franked dividends, but I haven't seen that in the presentation today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ian, the $0.14 final dividend will be fully franked. If you look through the material that's been distributed, you will find that our franking account is &#x2013; as at the end of June '08 &#x2013; 30, June '08, is about $74 million. And so our expectation is that we go &#x2013; going forward, we will still be able to 100% fully franked dividends.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I am Mark McDonnell from BBY. Couple of questions around the minutiae and then a bigger picture one if I may. I'm a Telstra customer, a consumer and every month I get two bills one from BigPond, and one from my home fixed service. Just in terms of your IT transformation, I'm wondering what the milestone is as to when I might get one bill in that scenario? And more generally, what sort of cost savings apart from postage and printing Telstra might realize by sending me one bill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, do you want to talk about the cost one, and then we'll comment on the timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Obviously, with &#x2013; there's a couple of things happening, well, moving to single bill, and of course summarized bills as distinct from itemized bills. So obviously, there is a cost saving that flows through in printing and paper, as you suggest, and of course we are encouraging customers to also go online for &#x2013; if they want the itemized bill. So still available, but it's online.</p>
          <p>The other cost savings will come through in terms of billing is just reducing the number of billing systems that front-of-house people have to deal with. Today, they have got various billing systems that they have to deal and you heard how much we are reducing the number of billing systems that we deal with. So those cost savings will flow through, but just think about this, and we've said this quite a few times that today, now, we've got those 3.3 million customers on a new billing system. We've still got some customers to go. So we're running the old. We've got something in the middle called mediator that talks from the new to the old and old to the new, and so until we get to that point where all the customers are over there, we're still running fairly high cost as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, in terms of you personally &#x2013; you are in queue. So it will happen within the next, who knows, next week or next month, month-and-a-half in terms of where you are in the queue of migration because we've got 3.3 going ultimately to 7 million customers and somewhere along the way, you are going to be one of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's fairly soon. Thanks. The second minutiae question on your change in accounting standards, I noticed with your service life for depreciation purposes, you've reduced out some pipes down from 40 years to 32 years and distribution from 30 years down to 27 years. It's not intuitively obvious as to why you would do that, why duct or pipes, service life would suddenly reduce so dramatically? And the transmission equipment, I see has gone the other way. I am just curious about why you are shifting relatively passive components of your network in this manner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean what we're doing is, we do an annual service life reviews, we go to the technical guys who make an assessment of how long ducts and pipes are going to last, what sort of conditions they are in for example, because we actually do have ducts and pipes out there that are damaged and so there will be a replacement program, so all that is taken into account when we do it. I think we lessen the life for fiber cable for example, and we have proven that it's going to last longer. From the accountant's point of view, I'll take the advice from the technology guys and we do it every year. I mean the net impact of those movements by the way, of course, fall in terms of the depreciation outcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And my last question which is the bigger picture one. You have made some strong reaffirmations around the target of 6 to 7 billion free cash flow, two aspects to this. Firstly, with the revised guidance around CapEx increasing, but the free cash position remaining within the same band, the EBITDA guidance and the revenue guidance has remained constant. Interested analytically in how you arrived at the same outcome with one of the negative components to free cash flow actually increasing, and the second element to the question is in the event of success in the NBN tender, what's the best estimate from Telstra as to the probable alternate outcome on the free cash 6 to 7 billion vision given the potentiality of high CapEx to fund further broadband rollout?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just. I will take the first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There was just a couple of things that you said that was a incorrect and, of course, it will help solve or answer the question. The CapEx does go up but you said ours didn't move, the revenue goes up, I said 2.5, it was 2.5 to 3, it's gone up to 3 to 4 and the EBITDA growth has gone from 2.5 to 3 up to 3 to 3.5. So there is extra cash coming from an increased EBITDA there as well. So they do increase and the math works, believe me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it's a revenue uplift. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's both revenue and EBITDA. But in terms of the issue about how we think about an NBN kind of scenario, obviously we've said all along that if we were to build five cities, it would take 3, 4.5 to $5 billion as we have done our calculations, if you include the Gold Coast as part of that. So over a five-year build period, that'd be plus or minus $1 billion. I mean $1 billion plus or minus a few hundred million depending upon start points, et cetera, et cetera. So that's how we would think about an adjustment or how anybody should think about an adjustment to free cash as we think about free cash flow.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Sol. Good morning, John. Tim Smeallie from Citi. I guess a couple of questions. Firstly, if we look at the second half performance of PSTN, it was at the &#x2013; the rate of decline doubled to around 4%. John mentioned that he wasn't seeing any indicators around economic weakness, I was just wondering, do you expect that rate of decline will continue and what factors, as a management team, will you be focusing on to identify whether there's any economic flow through from a slowdown in the economy is the first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, last year, John, you gave us some insights into first half performance relative to second half '08. Just wondering are we going to get &#x2013; can we get any guidance for this time around? Do you expect the margin expansion will be second half loaded rather than first half? And then following on from Mark's question, just looking at the regulatory challenges. How do you &#x2013; how would you assess an option of a regulated last mile return or say from the node to the home, if you are facing say a set price for that return, as opposed to vending that last mile into the FTTN project and realizing replacement value for that &#x2013; for that network upfront rather then the historic cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the last one, I'll go to the first one and then John will take the middle. In terms of the last question as you asked, we don't think that way, it's kind of a dumb idea, so we don't even think that way. In terms of the first one, the issue for us, Tim, as we think about our business is that we are going to grow, we are going to invest wisely as we operate and as we think about margins and how we manage, it's going to be on the same path that we've being managing before. So in terms of &#x2013; if there's something specific you are looking at in the question, try it again because I want to make sure that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the last mile is kind of a &#x2013; we don't think that way.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question was just looking at the PSTN decline, it doubled in terms of the rate of decline down to almost 4.5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John, mentioned that he hadn't seen any economic indicators in the results saying that there had been a slowdown. I guess, I'm interested do you believe that the 4.4% decline will continue or what do you think drove that decline? And also looking at what are the key economic indicators you will look at as a management team. Do you, is it going to be a reduction in prepaid recharges, is it going to be people spending less or trading down on their alignmental plans? What factors will you look at as a management team to identify any economic impacts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's what I was saying. We're going to manage this year, and we're staring the year basically on the same plan, same way of doing business that we have over the last few years, and that is adding value, doing the things that matter most to customers, and we will continue that. In terms of what happens second half versus first half, is that we continue to see the one thing that consumer behavior is consumer behavior, which means, if I'm going to make more calls on my mobile, the conversion from fixed to mobile, I'm going to continue to do that. And that's not something we're going to change, until we introduce some newer capabilities on a fixed line side, and that's coming, but that's another story for another day.</p>
          <p>The point is, is that at retail, we're still gaining access lines. We're still taking market share in terms of what we're doing, whether it be in the business, whether it be on the consumer side, all of that is still working, so that hasn't changed, first half-second half in a significant way. It's more about the calling patterns and the fixed to mobile continued migration is consumer behavior. That says, if that continues, we'll be looking at the kind of rates in the &#x2013; this year like we had in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of economic indicators, we're going to continue to monitor right now how we think about our business. It's so far it's pretty economy downturn resistant in the sense that we've all seen the surveys. What are the three things you take with in the morning when you leave your house, it's your keys, you wallet, and your mobile. And when you think about fixed line and you think about the importance of broadband. You think the importance of the services that we provide, it's part of your daily life, it's part of your kids education if you have children, it's part of a lot of things that are more integral to people's daily lives than other variable costs that people have. So, so far that will be part of the story, perhaps I will watch one movie less, but actually I think it will be even more so because I won't go to the theater and pay those kinds of ticket prices. I'll order a BigPond movie and download it and sit at home with my family. So that's the upside on what we are doing. But we will watch it closely, and that's why we are being prudent again with our guidance. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just add a bit of color to your PSTN half-half question as well. When you get a chance to look through the results, you will see that the PSTN overall revenue decline is driven strongly by wholesale. And that's &#x2013; there is now nearly 600,000 ULL lines out there. And so that has taken away some of the wholesale access from revenues. And you know well and we all know well there is a competitive strategy going on here to take people off-net to on-net. Maybe they will slowdown and that will impact the result. But when you have a look at our strong performance in retail PSTN versus wholesale PSTN, and understand what's happening, the half that's just gone with respect to the wholesale part, you will be able to analyze the outcome a bit more. To your other question about the half, we did give some guidance last year about what it's likely to be. Your assumption is correct that the first half will not be as strong in terms of the EBITDA and EBIT growth as the second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow-up on that wholesale question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And mainly because of &#x2013; there is a whole variety of factors like sale businesses in the first half, second half and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to follow-up on that wholesale issue, is that why we're seeing type launch ADSL 2 plus as a wholesale service because the softness in the wholesale business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's because we think that there is value to be captured out of the market, Kate has seen some demand from customers that would like to have an alternative and a choice that is priced right for them and for us and that's why we do things, Tim, I think you've probably heard this at least 20 times from me. We value-compete, so we are going to add value and offer a service, whether it be a retail customer or a wholesale customer, we will. And that's how we operate. Thanks. Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Christian Guerra here from Goldman Sachs JBWere. Sol, congratulations to you and John and your management team for what you've done over the last three years of the Company. Just to add three questions for you this morning. First on the CapEx, we are seeing base rev. loss sort of one to two years through your huge investment in capital, you've driven deep competitive lines for Telstra in the marketplace. Just wondering, if you could talk about the revenue opportunity over the next sort of two to three years given you have increased your CapEx to sales, are you looking to increase your market share or revenue share, or do you, in fact, think the other pie is going to grow for the industry?</p>
          <p>Secondly, John, a question for you on interest that was why &#x2013; what I was looking for. Just wondering if you could talk about your borrowings costs in the context of what's happening with global markets and fairly just on Sensis, I know you typically start selling the other products just sort of I guess six to 12 months before you recognize the revenue, just wondering what's &#x2013; the Yellow Pages print is looking like in terms of forward orders? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Christian, in terms of the going forward leveraging the competitive advantage that we have in the market given the investments that we've made, I think that's a really important question that you have asked, because I said it last year. I think that what we are doing with our wireless Next G play is we're educating the whole market in Australia and around the world that there is a rising tide here and it is an opportunity for everybody. So we have plowed the way, we've shown the way, we've done a lot of things here and now people around the world are starting to understand, including our competitors locally. The only difference is, is that we do things based on value, so instead of adding what I would call "empty calories," we take on significant high value consumable products here, in the sense, that when we grow our revenues, to me, the most important thing and I've always said this, I have said this when I was running Orange back in Europe is that the services revenue share and margin share is really what any responsible business person that's shareholder focused should think about. And so that's what we're doing.</p>
          <p>Our growth of 12 plus percent in a market that's 100% essentially penetrated is way beyond anything around the world and as I said earlier, it's about four times our nearest competitor. So our focus is, yes, kind of raising the tide, which I think we've done. And then secondly, taking out more disproportionate share of what is going to be happening in the market as we do that. You've seen that on the broadband side where again everybody has the opportunity to put DSLAMs in, everybody has the opportunities to interconnect on equal terms, but we are taking disproportionate share, why? Because we add more value for our customers. And the good news is, it's not a regulator that makes the decision, Tim, it's the customer that makes the decision, and that's where we always want to make sure that customers are the ones that make those choices, not regulators, because you make money, the ones that pay the bills are the customers.</p>
          <p>So, Christian, I guess, that's a &#x2013; that's my answer to your fist question, and relative to Sensis and print product, I would say again as we have built or rebuilt the business here where it's value-based, it's metro sizing about everything that we have in there, the sales leadership, the operating leadership, the relationship with customers, I would just say that the momentum will continue as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Christian, your question about interest, you'll see in my presentation, there is an appendix that tries to help with the finance cost outcome, but let me just quickly address it. The actual borrowing costs increased $185 million. So, in other words, the additional interest, if you like, was $185 million to $1.2 billion. So that's what borrowing cost us last year in absolute, and the growth. And it's because we had all our higher average debt and there were higher interest rates. Let me just &#x2013; you can pick it up from the accounts. Let me just tell you as at 30 June last year, so that was 7 &#x2013; cost-to-debt was 7.2%, and as at 30 June, '08 cost-to-debt was 7.7%. So cost-to-debt at those two points in time has gone up 50 basis points. But our average debt, so average cost-to-debt has gone from 7% to 7.3. And what that tells you is that throughout the year as we increased debt, we got very good terms.</p>

          <p>Hi Sol, hi John. It's Richie Eary from UBS.</p>

          <p>Hi, Richie.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions actually. Just looking at the revenue guidance for this year, it's 3 to 4%. You did 3% in the second half. I'm just trying to get a gauge in terms of the guidance is now at the top end of obviously what you delivered in the second half. Is there anything there that we should expect in terms of traction within the corporate space given the demise of Commander or basically AIPT pulling out of the big market? That would be the first question. The second question is just on CapEx, there has always been a lot of questions in terms of the long-term numbers, the 14% that you put out there for '10, if we exclude the 200 million that you said was related to transformation, should we now be assuming 13% is a long-term comfortable number that you are happy with for the business?</p>
          <p>And lastly, just in terms of China, you obviously talked of SouFun today, there has been comments in terms of an IPO of the asset, there's also been talk historically about what you're going to do with CSL, to appreciate markets, so probably not what they are today, but if you can give us a bit more clarity in terms of what you're going to do with those assets longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start first with the revenue. Again our guidance is always reflective of what we think the opportunities are and also being mindful of what the challenges are. And clearly, we are entering an economic period that may be a challenge. We think that we can withstand the headwinds that are there, but at the same time, we're not going be overly optimistic about what might be there as an opportunity. If it's there as we progress through the year, we'll take it; if it isn't, you've got our guidance. In terms of the numbers themselves, you have to be mindful of last year first half, on a revenue growth side, had very strong revenue growth, so we're cycling on a very strong delta from last year and that's the same for the second half. So you will see the guidance that we have which is up-guidance, but we're going to be prudent as we look at it. In terms of the next question, I guess John, you will take that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was about the CapEx. Yeah, look, we are really not giving guidance beyond fiscal year 2010, Richard, but just to say that there is a variability in CapEx due to customer demand, and we haven't given any guidance for revenue beyond '09, '10, either so I am not going to comment on whether your 13% is right or not but you can see what's happened, top lines working hard and we are supporting the growth with the CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on that John, just I mean if you go back before the original guidance was 10 to 12 and it got lifted to 12 and that's got lifted to 14. Clearly, there is an anticipation that you are putting more CapEx on the normal numbers to draw this top line, but as somebody mentioned earlier about the percentage rate &#x2013; the percentage rate shouldn't necessarily change unless there is things in there that we're not aware of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. But you have got to understand the mix change, and one of the things that I was pointing out very clearly here is the mix change and you have got to build up scale, we all know the margins in PSTN and obviously the margin is lower in broadband pipe improving and increasing. So you got to take a &#x2013; so we are supporting the broadband growth, we are supporting the mobiles growth, and we are expecting scale, economics in terms of those products to get to those margins backup. So you are going through this period of supporting slightly lower margin products. Having said that, we are still below 46 to 48% EBITDA margin, and that will primarily come from costing out from all the things related to the translation that we've mentioned before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is not fair to say that the actual growth is coming through a less capital intensive in the traditional PSTN business, so as you make changes -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we are not spending money on the PSTN. We are spending money on IT platforms that support content and applications that are in broadband, I mean, DSLs, leased lines cost you money. So we are spending money on those sort of things, and by the way as you also &#x2013; this is sort of common sense, as you start to introduce more applications and speed, guess what, you use more bandwidth. And then you have to support more transmission to take the applications and the content and services across the backhaul. A lot of people forget that you have to build backhaul to provide all our services. That's why we have got Sydney to Hawaii, that's why we've had to do those sort of things because as you know also 70% of the internet traffic goes across to the U.S. from Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I would say that the big difference from three years ago, when we were setting targets at 10 to 12% and today. Number one is what I said earlier, our growth rates are much higher than what we had in the plan. But number two and this is a fundamental belief I have. And that is that in today's world, much as John said, the issues of not just building infrastructure for the service, whether it'd be a DSLAM or whether it'd be a wireless base station, but now you have the contingent investments associated with things like backhaul and other services that come with it that are part of a new dimension of a high speed world versus a lower speed world.</p>
          <p>The good news is we've architected for that and we will continue to grow as we grow our broadband in strong double-digits, as we grow our mobiles services revenue in double-digits, and that's a good thing from a shareholder and a capital management kind of perspective. What I would say is if you're in the low single-digits or negative, there is no way you should be spending that kind of capital, and have that kind of CapEx to sales kind of ratio. And so if you want to know what my parameters are as I look at the business, the CapEx of probably that 12 to 14 is good if you have growth that's double-digits. It's bad if you have single-digits or negative growth. You shouldn't be spending the money or you're wasting it somehow because you're not pricing right. You are not doing whatever it is to make it worthwhile for an investor. What we are doing is we are raising returns, we are raising margins, so as we're managing our capital, it's all with that endpoint in mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the third question, John, on China &#x2013; Sol, on China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On China, obviously, in terms of China, I have a view there that's says there is a lot of opportunity in the ways that we're going there consistent with the business model that we have in Sensis. You won't see us get into businesses in the online space sort of just easy to enter and anybody can do it and just, we can go buy an asset that's already there. These are about strategic competitive advantage based businesses, look at Soufun, 100 cities, sales force out there just like Yellow Page kinds of people that go deal with advertisers directly, build content, digitize their content, put it on a platform, and actually pay. These are real revenues, real earnings, positive cash flow, positive businesses.</p>
          <p>So we're going to stay focused on that. We will look for other opportunities and if we can find other ones, we'll look at and seriously. In terms of CSL, I have said all along, CSL I think is a strategic asset. We'll continue to monitor it and see how we can extend the value of it and again you'll see over the next year or two whether we can or we can't. If we can't, then we'll have a different kind of conversation but right now I think it's a strategic asset.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let's go back to Melbourne. Okay. No questions in Melbourne, so we will continue here in Sydney.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andrew Levy from Macquarie. I just have a question on the billing systems. I just wanted to, I guess, talk from the context of &#x2013; they are very short-lived three months or so to the cut over at the front end. Just at the back end, I had the time lines moved and what are the time lines for closing down some of the larger Legacy billing and CRM systems. And also whether you can reaffirm, I am not sure if it is in the pack, the targets you had for network and systems reduction by FY '10, if you are still on track with those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the plan that we've had all along, and we said all along is second half of '09 fiscal year and the '10 year is kind of the big year is when we start retiring systems and '11 and '12, those will be the years; that hasn't changed. The issue in every migration, if any of you have ever been involved with the migration, and you've seen companies that do well, which are very few and companies that don't do it well which are a lot, is that you've got to get the code right. And that's where we are at. I am sitting here today very happy about where we're at, and yes, we might be off a month or two, but in terms of our core numbers, EBITDA margins which is reflective of OpEx and our free cash, which is reflective of capital and other issues there, we're not changing anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just the systems and network cluster types '10, those original numbers given by far, you are still standing by that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean they are going to be close whether we are off by 5 or 10 or 20 here or there, I don't know whether that's going to be the case, because as you remember we've &#x2013; some of us were brand new to the company. And in October, we did an inventory with people that had been here 20 or 30 years in Telstra. We identified that we had 1,250 systems. And as we got into it about six, nine, twelve months later, we found out we had 1,500 systems. So, there is a lot of complexity to this and so the variability of plus or minus 10 or 20, that could be part of the story. But the punch line is the essence of the delivery, the essence of the margins, the essence of the free cash flow, which is what a shareholder cares about, those will be hit.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sol, Tim Smeallie, Citi. Obviously, the FOXTEL distributions this year are nice earnings kicker. I guess the status changed around those distributions about three times from November last year. I guess could you give us some color in terms of why that was suspended, and then also, what would be the catalyst to see those capital distributions reinstated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start first, Tim, with the whole notion of FOXTEL. And I've had this conversation with John, and I've had the conversation with our whole team here. FOXTEL is part of our Company. It's part of our ongoing business. And everybody in this room should understand that, so that when we think about FOXTEL now, we should think about it as a revenue stream, a cash stream, a part of our Company that we also took the hits on for a number of years in terms of the CapEx and the negative cash flows that occurred for several years. So, part of a &#x2013; as a policy, we, the News Corp folks and the Packer folks &#x2013; I'll just shorthand it &#x2013; we've all agreed on a distribution dividend cash distribution policy, and that will be implemented. During the past year, there was a time, let's say, effect given what the financial markets are in terms of how we go about leveraging the balance sheet of that business to enable the payout. And we're going to not do stupid things just because we want to get something on a certain date. And I think John and his team along with the other members or partners we have, we are very mindful of that. John, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you've covered it well. I mean it's about, there's nothing changed in FOXTEL's policy, and it's just about timing given the financial markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, can we assume then that if we saw a reduction in rates in the Aussie market and it was more attractive to take on the funding, because it wasn't aggressive, it was only three times what net debt to EBITDA for the business. The business is delivering right numbers we've seen today, it's on a great trajectory, I guess, does a reduction in rates provide scope that that type of a distribution program will be put back in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I said in a different way.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Okay. That's correct. Thank you.</p>
