        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. We are starting 2012 as we had expected with an excellent first quarter performance that builds on last year's significant accomplishments. Once again, we have grown the number of customers we serve, effectively managed risk and expenses and returned value to our shareholders. We saw a strong revenue growth this quarter as a direct result of our strategy to grow customers and loans. Net interest income was up, as were several client fee categories.</p>
          <p>Let me share some highlights. We earned $811 million in net income or $1.44 per diluted common share. That includes first quarter integration costs of $145 million or $0.18 per share. In early March, we closed on RBC Bank (USA) and successfully converted nearly 1 million customers. This acquisition was accretive to our first quarter earnings, excluding the integration costs.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month, we announced a 14% increase in our quarterly common dividend to $0.40 a share along with plans to repurchase up to $250 million of common stock in 2012.</p>
          <p>We continued to have remarkable customer growth in the first quarter and I'll say more about that in a minute. We saw $8 billion in average loan growth in the first quarter, a 5% increase, following strong results in the fourth quarter. And due to customer growth, loan growth and our expanded footprint, we saw a 5% increase in revenue in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, credit quality remained stable and expenses remained well managed. Our balance sheet remained highly liquid and core funded with an 85% loan to deposit ratio and our Tier 1 common capital ratio remains strong and is estimated to be 9.3% as of March 31. The impact to our capital ratio of purchasing RBC Bank was approximately 1.2 percentage points.</p>
          <p>With regards to RBC Bank, we estimated an internal rate of return that we gave you at the acquisition time to be 19%. In terms of generating long-term shareholder value, we see that as a more valuable use of capital than share buybacks. At this point, with the conversion behind us, we feel even better about this transaction now.</p>
          <p>And lastly, we continue to believe we're well positioned with Basel III capital requirements and we expect our capital ratios to grow from here.</p>
          <p>Now moving to RBC's acquisition, the acquisition of RBC Bank significantly expanded our footprint, adding approximately $15 billion in loans and $18 billion in deposits to our balance sheet. More importantly, it gives us access to very attractive markets in the Southeast. With more than 400 branches, this was our largest single branch conversion in our history and the process was nearly flawless and that's what makes us so optimistic.</p>
          <p>Frankly, when we learned that the &#x2013; when we identified that the gap between the RBC Bank product offerings and our product set was larger than even we had anticipated. For example, even online statements were not available. Beginning on the first day of business as our products became available as a result of the conversion, we saw customers coming into the branches to open accounts with our new service capabilities.</p>
          <p>In less than two months since conversion, we already have a substantial pipeline of treasury management business and have plans in place to grow our corporate and institutional business, much in the same way as we did following our acquisition of Riggs. Our asset management group has developed a solid list of referrals from our business partners in our new markets already. And our new management teams are in place and are comprised of a combination of RBC Bank employees and legacy PNC employees, who act as culture carriers, bringing both product and corporate knowledge to these new markets.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we have more people to hire this year in the Southeast. We'll be acquiring approximately 200 additional personnel for the Corporate and Institutional Bank and Asset Management over the next nine months. We've got tremendous applications for these jobs. Overall, this acquisition is off to a great start and we see tremendous opportunities to grow in these markets. And as we mentioned, it was accretive immediately ex the integration costs.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to our business segments, we see the current environment as a great time to add customers, as there is ongoing disruption in the marketplace and the cost of client acquisition has never been lower. And we continue to see strong client growth in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Now let me begin with Retail Banking, where we believe our products and our business strategy are driving significant customer growth. We launched a new suite of checking and credit card products about a year ago and the acceptance continued to be strong. In fact, 61% of new checking accounts opened in the first quarter were relationship accounts. Our goal is to reach 70% by year-end. Our Virtual Wallet product is helping to driving these gains. In the first quarter, we added an average of more than 7,000 new Virtual Wallet customers per week.</p>
          <p>Altogether, this strategy helped to add 57,000 new organic checking accounts in the first quarter, which is consistent with the excellent growth we saw last year. And of course, we want to deepen these relationships and we continue to do so. We saw active online bill payment customers increase 5% linked quarter; that's at a 20% annualized rate.</p>
          <p>Our Corporate and Institutional Bank had a good first quarter. Average loans increased by nearly $6 billion, driven by new client growth, new and existing client activity and the RBC Bank acquisition. As you'll recall, for the last two years, we announced a goal of adding 1,000 new primary clients and we beat it both years. In the first quarter, we added 243 new names and we're looking to add more throughout the year. However, we are seeing greater pricing pressure in some markets, which will influence our client growth.</p>
          <p>Of course, we plan to remain focused on writing business that generates the appropriate risk adjusted returns. And we continue to see strong deposit inflows into our non-interest bearing demand deposits as our safety and soundness is attracting customers' liquidity in the current low interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Asset Management Group, they delivered a very good first quarter. Referral sales grew nearly 40% in the first quarter compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting strong activity from Retail and Corporate and Institutional banking &#x2013; referral activity. The sales growth, along with higher equity markets and successful customer retention efforts, helped to drive Asset Management inflows. Discretionary assets under management were up nearly 5% on a linked-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>In addition to building out capabilities in the Southeast, we're continuing to increase our client-facing staff, especially at our highest potential markets such as Chicago, Florida, Milwaukee, and DC. In the first quarter, the Asset Management group added 64 employees and has a full year goal of 250 new hires.</p>
          <p>Residential Mortgage had a strong loan production in the first quarter; originations were up 11% linked quarter to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by refinancing volumes. We continue to expect these volumes to grow from here throughout the year. And BlackRock reported earnings this quarter and had another very good quarter and Larry will be speaking to you shortly I believe.</p>
          <p>Overall, this was an excellent quarter for PNC. We're off to a very good start for the year. And now Rick will provide you with more detail about our first quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter net income was $811 million, or $1.44 per diluted common share. Keep in mind that these results included $145 million or $0.18 per share of integration costs.</p>
          <p>In my remarks today, I will focus on the following: the growth of our high quality balance sheet, the strong increase in revenue and our disciplined expense management resulting in positive operating leverage, our stable credit costs, our strong capital position and our improved outlook for the full year 2012 versus 2011.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about our balance sheet on slide seven. Overall, loans increased by approximately $17.2 billion of which approximately $14.5 billion is attributable to the RBC Bank acquisition and $3.4 billion or 5% is due to organic growth in commercial lending. Average loans increased by $8.4 billion linked quarter with gains in every loan category. We saw the highest linked quarter increases in commercial and consumer lending driven by the RBC Bank acquisition of $4.7 billion and organic growth in commercial lending of $3.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Average commercial loans increased by $5.8 billion on a linked quarter basis due to the impact of RBC Bank along with new and existing client production in corporate banking, real estate finance and business credit.</p>
          <p>Average consumer loans were up by $1.6 billion due to continued growth in auto loans and the impact of the RBC Bank. Overall credit quality continued to improve in the first quarter when compared to last year. On a linked quarter basis, while we continued to see modest improvements in legacy PNC credit quality, we will keep our guidance meaning relatively stable linked quarter due to the additional credit risk assumed with the RBC loans.</p>
          <p>Net charge-offs stayed relatively stable. Overall delinquencies were lower linked quarter, while non-performing assets increased related to the acquisition of RBC Bank and a policy change related to home equity loans. As a result, our provision remained relatively stable.</p>
          <p>Turning to liabilities, transaction deposits were up by approximately $17 billion linked quarter reflecting the RBC Bank acquisition and organic growth. Higher cost retail CDs at legacy PNC were lower by $4.2 billion as we continue to reposition this book to lower our cost of funds. The acquisition of RBC Bank also added $4 billion in CDs.</p>
          <p>Borrowed funds increased by $5.8 billion linked quarter to fund loan growth. We have been tapping short-term markets and federal home loan borrowings to meet our growth in loan balances. As we will essentially complete our CD re-pricing and runoff in the second quarter, I expect there will be better alignment between our loan and deposit growth in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Shareholders' equity increased by $1 billion in the quarter primarily due to retained earnings.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our improving net interest income on slide nine. Let me start with our average earning assets, which grew by $9 billion or 4% linked quarter. Yield on interest earning assets declined modestly compared to the fourth quarter, while the cost of funds continued to decline. Loan spreads, especially in corporate banking, have narrowed as we would expect as low rates and the competition for assets continue to put pressure on market pricing. However, interest bearing liabilities were down 10 basis points linked-quarter due to our effort to re-price CDs at much lower rates and reduce our overall funding costs. As a result, our net interest margin at 3.9% increased modestly from our fourth quarter results.</p>
          <p>Now first quarter net interest income was $2.3 billion, an increase of $92 million or 4% linked quarter. Loan growth, including the acquisition of RBC, and reduced funding cost enhanced our performance. Looking ahead, we have about $5 billion in higher cost CDs scheduled to mature in the second quarter. And this book has a weighted average rate of about 2.2%. Given the non-relationship nature of many of these accounts, we only expect to retain about half of the maturing CDs and we expect those to re-price on average to approximately 30 basis points.</p>
          <p>While interest costs on deposits will level out in the second half of the year, we see future benefits for our funding cost related to calling trust-preferred securities. We announced in March that we were calling $306 million at a weighted average rate of 6.2% and last week that we are calling another $500 million at 6.6%. We have an additional $1 billion at an average rate of 10% with par call dates later this year to consider. This gives us the opportunity to replace these securities with lower cost funding, providing us with substantial benefits in the future.</p>
          <p>As an example, the $750 million in trust preferred securities redeemed in the fourth quarter of 2011 had a rate of 6.6%. They were refinanced at a ten-year rate of 3.3% and immediately swapped into three month LIBOR funding at 1.7%. As with the trust-preferred redemption in the fourth quarter of last year, we will incur non-cash charges related to these future redemptions. I will provide you details on these charges in our expense discussion.</p>
          <p>Now for those who follow the purchase accounting game, here's the latest for your scorecard. With the addition of RBC Bank, our purchase account accretion was stable linked quarter at $263 million. We have provided this information on page five of our financial supplement. As I have said before, our balance sheet is positioned for rising interest rates and we plan to remain patient in the current environment.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the slide nine, we've reported approximately $1.4 billion of non-interest income, which was up $91 million or 7% linked quarter primarily due to higher residential mortgage and asset management revenues, partially offset by the seasonality of consumer related fees and lower corporate service fees.</p>
          <p>Asset management fees increased by $34 million to the fourth quarter due to improved equity markets and our share in BlackRock. Corporate service fees decreased $34 million, primarily due to the impact of lower commercial mortgage banking revenue and lower M&amp;A fees. Residential mortgage fees were up $73 million, primarily driven by gains on hedging mortgage servicing rates and higher loan origination volumes. Consumer service fees and service charges on deposits were down a total of $18 million primarily due to seasonality &#x2013; lower &#x2013; seasonally lower customer activity. Other increased $35 million, primarily due to higher revenue, primarily from private and other equity investments.</p>
          <p>Growth in our diverse revenue streams is an important component of driving positive operating leverage. We see further opportunities for growth as a result of our large size, our excellent progress in adding new clients and our ability to cross-sell our products and services across our expanded franchise.</p>
          <p>Now turning to slide 10, as we expected, first quarter expenses were down $264 million or 10% from the fourth quarter. This was a result of much lower charges for residential mortgage foreclosure-related matters in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter and the non-cash charge for trust preferred securities redemptions in the fourth quarter, which were partially offset by higher integration costs in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>To give a better view of our expense trend, on the slide, we stripped out the impact of integration costs and the non-cash trust preferred charge from the various expense categories to arrive at core expenses. Our core expenses for the first quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011 were elevated by mortgage foreclosure-related matters and additions to legal reserves. These expenses are rather unpredictable and therefore difficult to forecast, but we expect to see more of these expenses throughout 2012. In addition, the first quarter included $40 million for one month of operating expenses for RBC Bank. I would estimate quarterly spending of $170 million over time as we continue to invest in client facing personnel to grow in this region.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we expect integration costs will be lower in future quarters. We estimate there will be $115 million in the second quarter and $49 million and $25 million in the third and fourth quarters respectively. In the second quarter, we expect a non-cash charge of $130 million or $0.16 per share associated with calling approximately $800 million of our trust-preferred securities. We have $1 billion of securities with call dates in the third and fourth quarters and if we call them, we expect the non-cash charges to be significantly less, $83 million in the third quarter and $67 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding our continuous improvement targets, we are looking to achieve $400 million in cost savings at legacy PNC and $150 million in integration savings with RBC Bank. Collectively, we have identified more than 600 initiatives to deliver savings and have completed more than 50 &#x2013; more than 40% to date, capturing nearly $250 million in savings on an annualized run rate basis. This gives us confidence that we will achieve our cost savings goals.</p>
          <p>Overall, strong balance sheet and revenue growth with disciplined expense management drove positive operating leverage on a linked quarter basis, while credit costs remain stable. This resulted in strong earnings for the quarter that enhanced our shareholders' equity.</p>
          <p>Now as shown on slide 11, our Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the first quarter is estimated to be 9.3%, that's down 100 basis points from year-end, primarily due to the acquisition of RBC Bank. We believe we are well positioned to reach our Basel III Tier 1 common target of 8% to 8.5% by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>In looking at our capital priorities for 2012, our number one priority is to support client growth. In addition, we will return $1.1 billion in capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and potentially in share buybacks. When you add the capital we return to our shareholders to the $2.8 billion of capital deployed for the RBC Bank acquisition, we will deploy total capital of almost $4 billion. We see this as an effective way to grow our franchise and deliver long-term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to slide 12 for our outlook for 2012 versus 2011, which assumes the economic outlook for the year will be a continuation of the current environment. Given our strong first quarter performance, improving economic conditions and the addition of the RBC Bank, we're improving our outlook for full year 2012 versus 2011. We expect full year loans to increase by mid to high teens. We now see net interest income increasing by high single digits and non-interest income expected to increase by mid single digits, despite further regulatory impacts on debit card interchange fees. As a result, we are raising the outlook for our full year revenue growth to high single digits.</p>
          <p>We now expect expenses to increase in the mid to high single digits over 2011, primarily due to increases in mortgage expenses as a result of higher volumes in the low rate environment and further mortgage foreclosure related matters. This guidance excludes noncash charges from the TPS redemptions and integration costs. And of course, legal and regulatory related contingencies.</p>
          <p>Finally, due to continued stability in our credit metrics, we are updating our guidance on credit costs. Full year 2012 provisions should improve compared to 2011. We believe 2012 represents an opportunity for us to deliver full year positive operating leverage. This forecast gives us confidence that 2012 will be a strong year for PNC earnings growth.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rick. This was a very strong quarter for PNC. With our expanded territory and an improving economy, we see tremendous opportunities to continue to grow customers and revenue. We will continue to work to effectively manage our expenses and reduce credit risk.</p>
          <p>Our management team and our 57,000 employees are focused on meeting customer needs and leveraging a broad array of innovative products and services and the strength of our brand. As Rick just indicated, subject to the assumptions he provided, we believe we're right on target to deliver a strong full year 2012.</p>
          <p>And with that, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, could you give our participants the instructions, please.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Hey, guys. Rick, couple of questions on net interest income, which look like it came in better than expected. What was the contribution from RBC and did that come in a little better than you guys had thought and what drove that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it definitely did, John. What we picked up was primarily the incremental interest income on the non-impaired loans. Overall, the total contribution of purchase accounting in the quarter for RBC was about $50 million. In addition, we had about $50 million of regular net interest income, so it totaled about $100 million. So that was a strong driver because as you recall, John, we had said that PNC standalone would be relatively flat as the core would grow and we'd have further runoff on purchase accounting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, that $50 million is part of the total purchase accounting accretion of the $263 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's your outlook on that $263 million for the total purchase accounting accretion, Rick? How do you see that trending over the next couple quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John, the piece related to the impaired loans is pretty easy to figure out because that will either stay where it is or go up as the portfolios improve and that's about $80 million to $90 million for the full year. The piece that's maybe a little more difficult is on the non-impaired loans. Right now that's estimated between, say, $250 million and $300 million, somewhere in that range. But on those loans, John, to the extent that those potential credit events could occur on that book, the amount of accretion when you go non-performing could be less. So you shouldn't assume the total difference in the fair value mark will all come back into net interest income over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So when you put those together your &#x2013; this $263 million, you feel like &#x2013; is that what you're kind of embedding into your guidance and your guidance slide, that kind of level for this year at least each quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That &#x2013; well, for the full year, John, we're embedding about $350 million for the full year and that is embedded in our guidance, that's correct. And that includes both impaired and non-impaired loans. If you put it all together and look at the yield on the portfolio, it's about a 7% yield on the loans we acquired from RBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to be clear, you're embedding $350 million for the year versus $263 million this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No -</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On purchase accounting accretion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, $263 million is PNC combined. This quarter, only $50 million of accretable yield related to RBC. The RBC accretable yield for the full year is about $350 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, okay. And did you tell us what the &#x2013; what you're thinking for PNC total accretable yield for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still on the same guidance we had before, John, which is that that would be down $500 million 2011 to 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, okay. And one more thing on NII, Rick. Does your outlook include the expected benefits of the TruPS redemptions that you're planning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, absolutely, John. I think we'll have &#x2013; as I mentioned, we'll have further benefits related to the CDs that re-priced in the second quarter, which we've been forecasting for some time, but we also incorporated the benefit of the re-pricing of the trust preferred. In all likelihood, given the rates on those securities, unless there's something dramatic in terms of a rise in rates, we'll be calling those securities. And if there is a rise in rates, we'll be okay with that, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a little color on the improving guidance around credit costs. Is that driven more by charge-off &#x2013; a change in your charge-off outlook or just that you have more flexibility on reserve release? You're still holding a lot of reserves, is that what's driving the change in provision guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the performance of the first quarter, John. We clearly have beaten the previous guidance we'd given you in the first quarter with it being down from an average of last year's numbers as well as we feel good about what we're seeing, modestly improving credit quality statistics on PNC, and we think we've done a very good job of marking the portfolio of RBC and have considered the risks in that book and don't expect to have significant credit deterioration in that portfolio as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the numbers in the supplement, John, when you get a chance, you'll see the nonperforming loan categories with the exception of the home equity where we had the policy change. Virtually all the nonperforming categories went down a little bit, which is a continuation of the improvement that we've seen. And when you go over, say, 60 days and over, we've had a similar experience in delinquencies. So we're &#x2013; it's not a massive improvement in credit quality, but the trends &#x2013; the positive trends continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last thing from me was just a question on Basel III. With the improving outlook that you've given, it seems like you might be able to get to that 8%, 8.5% target earlier than you said previously, the end of next year. So just wondering why? Are you just being conservative about that or why can't you get there a little bit earlier with a better outlook? Are there other puts and takes there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well John, we do expect to continue in that forecast to have loan growth and so the more loan growth we had, the more that's going to use up capital. And so, therefore, we'll continue to have that. We did spend a bit of capital, as you know, on RBC, so that had an impact on where we're going. And we feel it will hit the 8% to 8.5% range in that timeframe and we see really no reason to get there any sooner.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to follow up on John's line of questioning on the margin and take a step back. So it looks like if we're doing a year-over-year comparison, the accretable contribution is really going to be down just $150 million in 2012. And Rick, tell me if you're still reaffirming this, you had told us in the past that you could probably extract about $800 million from the right hand side of your balance sheet in terms of deposit and TruPS savings. And so I guess what I'm trying to get at is if you blend that all together plus assume some sort of continued pressure on the yield side, it seems like the margin guidance embedded in these numbers is for a fairly stable number. Am I putting the pieces together in the correct way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I do expect that you will see pressure on the margin because we do expect to continue to grow the balance sheet, we continue to grow loans. Yes, we will get benefit and, yes, we will have good net interest income, but I think the growth of loans will cause some modest pressure is the way I would put it on the overall margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just is that &#x2013; do you still think that you could extract about $800 million in liability savings for the year or is that number a little high?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I think that was pretty good in terms of where we're going to go. We basically &#x2013; we're going to get &#x2013; no, we're still on that number. We're $800 million improvement on the liability side, a $300 million detriment on the asset side and a decline of about $500 million in purchase accounting and that relates to PNC stand-alone. Incremental to that, we expect to have RBC interest probably between $800 million and $900 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. And just to switch topics, on the home equity front, you noted that the change in classification in terms of more aggressively classifying delinquent loans as NPLs, how much of that $156 million linked quarter increase was attributed to that? And I guess the second part of that question is I understand that you don't have a servicing portfolio or first mortgage exposure that's as large as some of your peers. I'm just wondering if that change in internal classification was sort of in anticipation of some of the accounting change that your larger peers had to go through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the $160 million was because we've moved the non-performing category from 180-day delinquency down to 90. And we'll continue to look at in the second quarter as to whether we should consider further movement into the non-performing category given whether we see delinquencies on the first. We don't have that &#x2013; we're going to probably be implementing similar policies to what you saw at the other institutions in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the implementation of that policy, is that already embedded in your provision guidance for improvement year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is. What we'll probably take another look at is the classification of what's non-performing, determine whether that has an impact on charge-offs, but we feel that the reserves we have today have adequately considered those risks and therefore &#x2013; we'll learn from the information, but we don't expect a significant change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. It's actually Ian for Ken. Quick question on the expense ramp, I know you've given some pretty good guidance on merger integration and some of the TruPS stuff, but could you speak to kind of the step-up related to RBC in 2Q and the overall pace of cost saves going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think in terms of cost saves, we've given the $400 million as it relates to the stand-alone legacy PNC and $150 million on RBC, which will grow to $230 million next year, by the way, when we have the full year impact of that. And as I mentioned, we're well on our way to achieving all of those goals, so very comfortable there.</p>
          <p>RBC for the quarter and the month we reported it was at about $40 million. But as Jim mentioned, we have some pretty significant plans to invest in frontline personnel in order to grow the Asset Management and the Corporate Institutional Bank activity in that region. And so therefore, we expect over time the quarterly number there to grow to about $170 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's already in our expense guidance, however, though. We built it into our budget for RBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And real quick on just cross sell, could you speak to the longer-term opportunities? I know you said &#x2013; spoke to the fact that they don't even have online statements, but can you speak to the overall revenue opportunity and how long it would take to get there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't quantified it. The RBC franchise was primarily a retail franchise with some small business and commercial. And the product set that they had was very narrow and to some extent antiquated, and I think they would use that term themselves. The cross sell initiatives are already underway as I mentioned with the leadership that's involved, leadership is already in place and Treasury Management's had a tremendous success right off the bat. So we're very, very pleased about that. We've only been there for two months. And I think the cross-selling opportunity there is as great as it is anywhere else in the company.</p>
          <p>So I would guess over the next two to three years, as we look at our National City experience, we had some of the National City markets take off last year. We're looking at some of those National City markets as having 40% to 50% increases in sales this year. And so some of the ones that did not perform quite as well last year. So depending on how we're able to execute, I would think that this is a two to three year conversion to be able to ramp up all of our business lines and execute on our model.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of questions here. First, just in terms of credit, you mentioned, Rick, in terms of the provision improving over the course of the year, I just &#x2013; if you'd give a little bit more color in terms of what you're saying in terms of non-performing assets. Specifically, I think you mentioned $160 million on the regulatory impact in the quarter, but then you see the $1.243 billion in terms of inflows into NPL this quarter. I'm just kind of curious, we've seen kind of a stabilization in non-performers over the last several quarters. I'm just trying to get a gauge in how you're kind of seeing the outlook for nonperformers in particular and what we should expect in terms of the RBC reload effect on a go-forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me clarify your first comment, which is that we are not expecting credit to improve from where we are today in terms of the credit costs through the rest of the year. What we are saying is that we expect 2012 credit costs to be better than 2011 credit costs in total. So I wouldn't take what we booked as far as provision this quarter and start to see improvements through the rest of the year. I think it'll stay stable, I'm not expecting significant change in it, but not suggesting it's going to go down quarter to quarter, okay, so just to clarify that.</p>
          <p>I think on the non-performing assets, I think you have to remember that, one, you're right, we did have the change in the policy, which is about $160 million. We also added about $250 million of OREO assets in the acquisition of RBC. So that's why you see the inflow is elevated. That represents almost the entire increase in the inflow into the non-performing category. Now I don't know if I missed your third question, but -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and then just the last part was just on what is characterized as kind of like the reload effect in terms of with the purchase accounting on RBC on a go-forward basis, how you might expect the trend in terms of just the incremental additions to nonperformers from RBC, in terms of how we should think about that and the aggregate non-performing number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see a huge impact on that from the RBC. I think we did a really good job of taking a look at what they consider to be impaired. We went deeper in the book to identify other loans that we felt had elements of impairment where they may not have called them non-performing and so we impaired those as well. On the other side, I think the marks we took on the regular portfolio of the performing loans, about $1.1 billion that we think is adequate such that you have to &#x2013; the accounting on that book &#x2013; just I hate to go into the accounting too much, but remember we'll be accreting that to future value, right, on the fair value to the NPV.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We won't recognize net interest income if they go non-performing, but we also won't recognize credit costs any time soon, unless you have the specific credit event, so as you compare the FAS 5 reserve against the unamortized discount, it's unlikely to exceed the unamortized discount. So I'm not expecting a lot of credit cost this year related to the RBC acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally, again on the home equity and what you added this quarter, could you give us a sense &#x2013; I think you mentioned in your remarks that it could possibly change next quarter depending on delinquencies and so forth. Could you give us an idea of the first position problem set of home equity kind of order of magnitude, what we potentially could be looking at in the next couple of quarters just as we think about delinquencies and the impaired first position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wouldn't necessarily say this is going to be the answer to what the ultimate schedule is going to be, but if you look at some of the percentages other firms have put out, they're about 1.5% to 2% of their seconds.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have about $25 billion of seconds. So we don't have the specific number, but I think there's no reason why we would expect our issues to be greater than that given the quality of the underwriting that we did in our portfolio and the types of &#x2013; we do a lot of our equity home equity portfolios in footprint. We know the customer, we know that we have the checking account. There's a lot of high quality to that portfolio.</p>

          <p>The other thing is that we've been focused on the high risk portion of the home equity book for a long period of time and that's what's been our primary focus and so that's driven our reserving over time on our home equity book, and that's why we're not certain that there would be any meaningful impact on our provisioning in spite of what accounting change might take place.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Just a couple of quick questions, sort of I guess more on the core part of the portfolio away from RBC. I guess, Rick, you mentioned some loan growth statistics on an organic basis. I just want to get a little more color in terms of where you're seeing growth, I presume it's more on the commercial side than the consumer side. Are there any markets that you're seeing that are doing particularly well or are not doing particularly well within the traditional PNC and Nat City franchise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a great question. When you look at page six of the supplement when you get a chance, you'll be able to see the trends in loan growth and a lot of it's tied to customer growth from March 2011 through to March 2012 quarterly. And those kinds &#x2013; it starts in March of 2011 at $56.6 billion on the commercial side to confirm what you were saying. And I'd expect that the commercial has grown quite nicely, $56 billion to $75 billion, over the course of that 12-month period. So we've seen a lot of loan growth in the commercial space and we continue to see that.</p>
          <p>And I think the real thing that might mitigate it is the pricing, as I mentioned in my comments. Some of the pricing, particularly in Ohio, seems to have gotten to a place where you're not getting the right &#x2013; the appropriate risk adjusted return. And we would not want to participate in that. But I think we've added customers, as we mentioned, 1,000 customers each year for the last two years and another 243 customers in the first quarter in terms of commercial customers who pay us over $50,000 a year. And so these are meaningful players and that shows up in the loan growth numbers, 5% organic in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Jim, to that point, I think we had growth in 24 out of our 32 markets in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think that's good diversification on that growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow up on the C&amp;I side, the net unfunded commitments were up about $8 billion quarter-over-quarter. How much of that was RBC and how much of that was core PNC?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then just a final question. Rick, you mentioned mortgage originations you felt were going to remain relatively healthy over the course of the year. Most of the banks that have reported already this quarter seem to suggest that they expect pretty good origination volume in the second quarter, but are bit more cautious about the second half. What makes you so confident about the stability of the strength of the mortgage market into the second half of the year and what's the percentage of HARP refinancings that have been included in your first quarter originations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About 30% of the first quarter originations were HARP. We expect the rates to stay low, which drives the volumes. I think the HARP impact, you don't have to re-qualify as you had to in HARP 1.0, which was really the flaw in HARP 1.0. So I think the HARP 1.0 volumes will continue, and actually, when you see the housing business actually getting better. And last but not least seasonally, the first quarter is a weak quarter. So moving forward, the third quarter should be a strong quarter for housing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the other thing I'd mention to you is the revenue guidance we have given you, which is high-single digits growth, it's not dependent on the volume in the mortgage company, but if we don't have that volume, I would say that I think our expense guidance probably could be better than what we've given you so far.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine. Just in terms of taking $72 million of legal reserve costs and talking about how you expect more over the balance of the year, can you give us any more color around what that's for and what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; we don't discuss our losses in public, I don't think. What we do each quarter is we set up a reserve for what we believe is the existing liability. So that's what we did in the quarter and we're hopeful in settling the number of losses in the future and that's what you reserve for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ed, on your previous question, it's about $166 million in the RBC impact on a 30 day to 59 day, and you're seeing most of that in the commercial space as well as in the residential real estate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. So then on the litigation side, it's fair to say that something happened in terms of this quarter, in terms of your outlook to think that you'll need more litigation reserves relative to where you were at the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what happened in the first quarter is we increased our estimates based upon what we thought various losses might cost us and that's an estimate of course. I think our guidance is that obviously we reserve for what we believe is probable and estimable according to the rules. The guidance going forward I think has to be more of an industry guidance. If we were aware of more estimable and probable items, we would have reserved for it already, but if you look at what's going on in the industry, I think you would be hard-pressed to make any other comment besides litigation will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we've fairly reserved for what was probable and estimable for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then, quickly, you outlined a private equity gain or amount of private &#x2013; or private equity gains helped the revenue this quarter and net MSR hedge gains. Could we get those numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Ed. The private equity is about $62 million, the hedge gains on the MSRs was about $70 million to $71 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thanks. And then, I guess just two more quick ones hopefully. You did again this quarter recapture a pretty good amount of reserves, yet obviously the loan portfolio growing pretty rapidly and then the impact of the deal as well. You're now down to a 2.4% reserve to loan ratio. Should we probably expect the amount of reserve recapture to start to trend down pretty quickly here or how much further do you think you can take the reserve to loan ratio down? I know those are sort of hard answers, but maybe you can just give us a little bit of sense of that from an order magnitude standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ed, I think the 2.4% you quote is, as you would imagine, a bit misleading given all the impaired marks we have on the acquired loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So therefore, the reserve on loans would actually be much higher than that, so it's hard to compare that to other industry stats that people haven't had acquisitions. So I think there's further room to reduce that over time in terms of that particular ratio, while still being adequately reserved for the acquired loans through the purchase accounting marks we've taken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. That's helpful, thanks. And then last one, one of the big things that looked like it positively impacted the margin was the rate paid on CDs dropping from 116 basis points last quarter to 80 basis points this quarter. And I know that's been discussed a lot previously, but that still seemed like a giant move. Any more color on that and then any more sort of thoughts on how quickly that 80 basis point number might decline in future quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the past we've talked quite openly about the very high priced CDs that National City had. And they've been rolling off for the last 18 months and we had a big roll off as we have forecasted in the second half of last year, which impacted our interest costs in the first quarter. I think Rick had a number of comments about the $5 billion that's rolling off in the second quarter of this year so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and at 2.2%, I could see that &#x2013; overall, Ed, you see we've got a deposit rate of about 31 basis points overall. I can see that going further down to probably between 20 basis points and 25 basis points, something like that, based on more re-pricing that'll continue to occur in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But not that &#x2013; you're not saying that that's going to go all the way down to &#x2013; you're saying that's going to go all the way down to 20 basis points to 25 basis points in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's all-in on deposits when you consider some of the re-pricing of the broader book as well as the impact of the CDs maturing and so on. I think it's &#x2013; I believe that overall cost of deposits of 31 basis points will continue to go lower. I'd be surprised if it goes below 20 basis points, but I could see it going lower, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that &#x2013; but getting to that 20 basis points is a number of quarters out, once you have a lot more of the CD re-pricing and some of the other things we've discussed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, almost all the major re-pricing we have that will be finished in the second quarter. After that, almost the entire book of CDs we have is pretty consistent with what PNC would consider a relationship account and we would price &#x2013; that's already been priced accordingly. And the CDs we bought on from RBC, the $4 billion, they're at about 1.5%. They weren't &#x2013; they didn't have the large marks that you saw at National City.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay. So a big jump down in deposit re-pricing again in 2Q in your mind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have a $5 billion maturing at a 2.2% rate, we'll keep about half of those and I expect the others to re-price down to around 30 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, how are you? I guess just following up on the expenses, last quarter you said looking ahead the first quarter would look a lot like the third quarter when you backed out all the noise and that all seems to be true. But in the first quarter you had some pretty good revenue trends, especially some things like asset management and mortgage. So I mean if the implication of that that some of the revenue overage this quarter was extremely high incremental margin and didn't really affect the expenses? Or is the implication that even with the expenses associated with the better revenue trends, you still hit your expense target, which actually means the underlying expense trends were better than you had laid out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The expense trends for the revenues we're generating today in the asset management side are already baked into the number. To the extent we continue to invest in more people, I presume we'll see more revenue beyond where we are today. On the mortgage side, it's a little bit more direct. As the mortgage volume goes up, the expenses go up with it. And we saw a little bit of that in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons why we have projected full year expenses to go to mid to high single digits is because of that volume and the fact that we'll see further mortgage related expenses on that volume as well as the mortgage closure related pieces. So I think mortgage expenses could go up as the revenues and volume goes up, where I think asset management, we're pretty much at the right running rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just a follow-up question on the potential for mortgage volume, specifically through the HARP program. I mean, I guess one thing that's notable is you have the $120 billion servicing book, it has a 5.3% average coupon. That coupon hasn't come down a whole lot, a little, but not a whole lot this cycle. And so it would seem to imply there's a lot of &#x2013; maybe a disproportionate amount of HARP eligible borrowers in your servicing portfolio. Is that conceptually the right way to think about it and is there any work you've done to maybe quantify how much opportunity there is to kind of HARP your own borrowers, if that's the right term to use?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've done a fair amount of work in that and that's why we're particularly comfortable with the forecast that we gave a little earlier, that we expect these mortgage origination volumes to continue and actually grow through the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And that would be a fairly &#x2013; while you expect rates to stay low, that wouldn't be very interest rate sensitive in the sense that the people in the HARP program will benefit really as long as mortgage rates are below 4.75% or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're exactly right on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just &#x2013; I don't think we want to be too particular, but the &#x2013; it does seem now that we have relatively large footprint, and as Rick said, we've grown loans in 24 of our markets last year. All of our markets exceeded plans. Right now, we're just seeing that the pricing side, not so much the structure, but the pricing side is starting to become so competitive that you're not getting the right risk adjusted return. So I think we'll probably slow our growth there if we're not able to get that kind of return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I may have missed this as I jumped off the call for a minute. In the commercial loan growth that you reported, I know a portion of that was due to the RBC deal, how much of the commercial loan growth was organic versus purchased from RBC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was 5% in the quarter. I think the most interesting thing to do is, when you get a chance, on page six of the supplement, we've been driving and we've talked about how we grew 1,000 primary customers each of the last two years in the corporate banking side. You can see it resulting in the loan growth that you see starting in March 31 of 2011, where we had $56.6 billion and then it grew to $75.5 billion in the first quarter. Those &#x2013; obviously that was a year with a $10 billion lift in the first quarter, but we've been growing $3 billion or so a quarter right along for some period of time now in organic growth.</p>

          <p>Right, right. Could you remind me again, speaking of residential mortgage loans, the increase in the non-performing assets that went to $741 million on the resi mortgages from $685 million? Was that &#x2013; where did that come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The residential mortgages on the non-performing list?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, correct. That was the only category that really increased.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll look it up for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the same kind of subject, you give us the &#x2013; on page ten, the inflows and outflows of your non-accruals and it jumped up to $1.2 billion versus $854 million in the prior quarter. Is there any color behind the sequential increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Gerard. We had &#x2013; with the change in the non-performing policy for home equity loans where we moved delinquency from 180 days to 90 days, we moved it to non-performing. That's about $160 million of the increase. The other piece of the increase is we acquired OREO assets from RBC of around $250 million. The two of those together make up for the inflow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. And then finally, Jim, when you look out, obviously the RBC deal is fresh and when you look out on potential acquisitions in the future, is there anything that you're focused on, whether it's more depositories or asset management type assets or what are you guys looking at from that standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're &#x2013; what we're looking at right now is really building out the RBC franchise. We've done a good job, I think, of building out the National City franchise, but we're not complete yet. We've got some more hires in order to fully implement our business model in the National City markets and we're brand new at the RBC markets, where RBC really didn't have a full complex of products and services to compete in the marketplace like we do. So I think those are the &#x2013; executing on those two acquisitions really is by far our biggest opportunity and it's looking better than we'd ever expected and on both acquisitions, I might add.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question relates to deals past, present, and future. So thanks for the numbers from the legacy CDs from National City. What are &#x2013; what's the total amount of these high price CDs that still remain and where do you think they ultimately go? I know you gave the numbers for the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's pretty much it, Mike, on the National City acquisition, which is where all the high price CDs came from. Those &#x2013; like we said, we got about $5 billion re-pricing in the second quarter, average rate 2.2%. That's about it. After that, I would say the &#x2013; we picked up $4 billion from RBC at about 1.5%, that's &#x2013; some of those will re-price over time, but I'm not looking for a big drop in yield related to those or a big drop in costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So the big driver then will be RBC from an acquisition standpoint. How much accretion was there for the one month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had about $50 million of accretion related to purchase accounting RBC, which was a combination of accretion on the impaired loans as well as accretion on the non-impaired loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how about EPS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>EPS accretion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>EPS accretion for RBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Around $0.05 to $0.07, Mike. Somewhere in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That much for one month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. I think if you think about the fact that we had &#x2013; we didn't issue any equity. You look at the costs we had for the month, it was $40 million. So as we had previously described, the ability to take costs out quickly was something that we were very excited about with this deal. And then when you add in the accretion related to the impaired loans and the unimpaired loans, you get to that much in the first month. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so next quarter...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, that's the integration cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's the integration cost, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So next quarter just how much accretion do you expect when you get the full quarter impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for the full year, Mike, we'll get on this transaction, excluding integration cost, we should get close to $0.40 accretion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then is that pretty much where you were before or is that better? I know ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, excluding the impact of capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mike, it's better for two reasons. It's better because of the fact that we didn't have to issue equity and we got clarity around that, so obviously that's improved it, that's about $0.12. As well as the fact that we have higher accretion on the unimpaired loans than was originally anticipated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then deals future, you're kind of hanging out down there in the Southeast now. What about future acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the future acquisitions, for what we see right now is building some new branches in a few places. I don't think &#x2013; I think really it's about people for us right now in the Southeast. So we'll be acquiring people at a pretty good pace, we've got lots and lots &#x2013; we have thousands of applications. So that's the execution for us and the opportunity for us right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a link and leverage strategy, how many branches do you think you'll open down in the south?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a lot. In the 10s, 20, 30 over time. We said, for example, and I think we've talked about it in Atlanta. We thought we would need maybe 100 branches in Atlanta in the right places in order to compete. So we acquired 55 with RBC and 27 with Flagstar, which puts us pretty close to where we need to be. So we could build a few branches and be done without having to do any meaningful acquisition at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hey, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Hey, on the loan growth, I know you were talking about last quarter that you're starting to see some really middle market guys starting to expand, get a lot more confidence out there. Has that trend continued, improved, or gone down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's continued. I think the economy is, I think, continuing to do a little better each time we look. We're seeing unemployment has come down, employment has gone up. We're seeing capital expenditures grow. We're seeing a bit more &#x2013; we're seeing capital expenditures grow, we've seen loans grow. So I think the economy continues to do a little better and even housing is doing a little better in certain pockets. So I think the customers we have and we just finished a new survey and, again, 40% of our new small business in middle market customers are talking about raising prices. So I think obviously their businesses are doing better. What we don't see is anybody stepping up saying I'm going to build a giant plant and add lots of people because I think that's the confidence level that's missing in this economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then what about loan competition? There's a lot of anecdotal evidence out there or commentary I say from banks about how people are doing loans at yields that don't make any sense and getting rid of personal guarantees on the underwriting side, but through the earnings cycle, no banks &#x2013; all the banks are saying, no, it's not us. I'm just wondering what do you see on the competition side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not us. We're &#x2013; obviously we're being &#x2013; it's a competitive marketplace, it always is, the best of loans are made in the worst of times and vice versa. So I think we're entering into better times and banks are becoming more aggressive in their pricing and in their policies. We haven't seen a big change in structure, seen some, but not a big change in structure as yet, especially in the commercial and middle market size. But the pricing, especially on the larger credits, is clearly being impacted by competition and we see it particularly in Ohio where when we look at &#x2013; take a look at our entire footprint &#x2013; and by the way, we compete, we're not going to lose any big customers in Ohio for price, but &#x2013; unless it's really crazy. But when we're looking at new customers, I think we have to really make sure that we're getting the right risk adjusted return on the relationship.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one last question is, as &#x2013; I know you'd mentioned that HARP was a &#x2013; in the middle of the quarter the HARP was &#x2013; that HARP applications are very strong. Is that continuing, increasing and how much of your pipeline is related to HARP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About 30%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's continuing and it's increasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one other question, and you might not know the answer, if not, you can get it to me. Is it mainly the 105%s, 105% meaning LTV's and below, have you guys started doing the 125%s yet for HARP?</p>

      </speaker>
