          <p>Thank you, Lexi.  Good morning and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners and Duncan Energy Partners Conference Call to discuss second quarter earnings.  Mike Creel, President and CEO of Enterprise's General Partner, will begin the call.  He'll be followed by Randy Fowler, Executive Vice President and CFO, and Hank Bachmann, President and CEO of Duncan Energy Partners' General Partner who will discuss second quarter results for Duncan Energy Partners.  Also in attendance for the call today are Jim Teague, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, and other members of our senior management team.  Afterward, we will open the call up for your questions.</p>
          <p>During this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as the assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management.  Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, they can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.  Please refer to our latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.  We're pleased to report another quarter of strong results supported by record natural gas pipeline throughput of 9.7 trillion Btus per day and near record pipeline volumes of 2.2 million barrels per day of NGLs, crude oil and petrochemicals.</p>
          <p>In addition to the record pipeline volumes, some of the highlights of the second quarter 2009 include a $44 million increase in gross operating margins from the Independence Hub and Trail which averaged throughput of approximately 891 billion Btus per day in the second quarter and an 11%, or $36 million, increase in gross operating margin from our NGL Pipelines and Services segment on record NGL fractionation volumes and equity NGL production.</p>
          <p>We generated distributable cash flow of $328 million in the second quarter of 2009, which provided 1.1 times coverage of the distributions declared with respect to the second quarter and enabled us to retain $34 million of excess distributable cash flow.  This quarterly distributable cash flow was negatively impacted by approximately $12 million for estimated loss of business as a result of hurricanes Gustav and Ike, and $4 million of merger-related expenses from the pending Enterprise/TEPPCO combination.</p>
          <p>Year to date, we've retained approximately $90 million or 13% of our distributable cash flow while providing an impressive 1.2 times coverage of the distributions paid with respect to the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>The Board declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.545 per unit for the second quarter, which is 6% higher than the second quarter 2008 and is our 20th consecutive quarterly distribution increase.  We're pleased to be able to continue our record of increasing the quarterly cash distributions in these difficult economic times and challenging business environment.</p>
          <p>We reported net income of 187 million or $0.32 per unit on a fully diluted basis for the second quarter 2009 compared to our record high 263 million or $0.52 per unit in the second quarter of 2008.  Net income for the quarter was impacted by an estimated $38 million or $0.08 per unit for non-recurring charges from the forfeiture of our investment in the offshore oil port and merger-related expenses.  Estimated lost business due to the hurricanes reduced income by another $12 million or $0.03 per unit.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin, which was reduced by 34 million for the non-cash charge related to the forfeiture of our investment in the oil port and 12 million for hurricane effects, was 509 million for the second quarter compared to 534 million for the second quarter of least year, which was the second highest in our partnership's history.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA, which was reduced by four million for the merger-related G&amp;A expenses in addition to the $46 million of non-recurring items that affected gross operating margin, was 505 million this quarter versus 514 million for the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to take a few minutes to review the performance of our business segments for the second quarter.  As I mentioned earlier, our NGL Pipelines and Services segment performed very well this quarter, reporting gross operating margins of $354 million compared to $318 million reported in the second quarter of last year.  All three businesses in this segment reported higher gross operating margin with the largest increase coming from our natural gas processing business.  Gross operating margin from this business increased 12% to $219 million compared with $196 million in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>The majority of the improvement was from our NGL marketing activities and the Meeker and Pioneer natural gas processing plants.  Higher sales margins provided in part by our hedging activities, together with increased equity NGL production from these plants and our Louisiana gas processing plants were the primary reasons for the increase in gross operating margin.</p>
          <p>We currently have approximately 70% of our Rockies Equity NGL production for the remainder of 2009 hedged at a margin of approximately $0.63 per gallon.  The margin is the difference between the prices at which we sold our NGL stored less the natural gas cost of the shrink.  We've also hedged approximately 55% of our Equity NGL production from percent of proceeds contracts, mainly propane and the heavier NGLs, at a price of approximately $1.60 per gallon.  We've not executed any natural gas processing hedges for 2010, but continue to evaluate opportunities to do.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile current ethane processing margins in the Rockies remained attractive at over $0.20 per gallon supported by strong demand for ethane by the petrochemicals industry as an alternative to more expensive crude oil derivatives.</p>
          <p>U.S. ethylene production for the second quarter of 2009 rebounded to an annualized rate of 50.5 billion pounds and consumed an average of 834,000 barrels per day of ethane per data published by The Hodson Report.  This compares to an annualized ethylene production rate of 54.8 billion pounds and ethane consumption of 812,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2008.  Currently, the ethylene industry is expected to operate at an annual rate of about 49 billion pounds and consume approximately 820,000 barrels per day of ethane.  This is a marked improvement over the 34 billion pound annual operating rate in December of last year.</p>
          <p>Industry ethylene cracking will be reduced by two billion pounds per year as two ethylene facilities are slated for permanent closure.  Despite these closures, we continue to see good demand from ethylene crackers for NGL feed stocks as opposed to costly crude oil derivatives.  Ethane and propane remain the preferred ethylene feed stocks.</p>
          <p>A number of traditional heavy crackers are considering making modifications or are in the process of modifying their facilities to enable them to have the flexibility to consume natural gas liquid feedstocks.  With our integrated NGL fractionation storage and distribution system, we believe this will lead to new business opportunities for us.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from our NGL Pipelines and Storage business increased by 4% to $98 million this quarter, primarily due to higher storage fees and volumes at Mont Belvieu, increased export volumes and lower fuel costs.  Partially offsetting this quarter to quarter increase in gross operating margin were higher pipeline integrity expenses on our Dixie pipeline and lower transportation margins on our Mid-America pipeline.</p>
          <p>In what is normally not a seasonally strong quarter for NGL exports, we had a significant increase in the volumes that NGL is exporting and we can expect to continue to see this for the remainder of this year and for most of 2010.  Gross operating margin from our NGL Fractionation business increased to $37 million in the second quarter of 2009 from $27 million in the second quarter of last year due to record fractionation volumes this quarter.  As evidence of strong demand for fractionation in the industry, our Hobbs facility, which was put into service just two years ago, and our fractionators at Mont Belvieu are running at full capacity.  With this trend expected to continue, there is a strong possibility that we could announce new projects to expand our fractionation capacity along the Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>Our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines and Services segment reported gross operating margin of $74 million for the quarter compared to $123 million for the second quarter of 2008.  This decrease was due to a $37 million decline from the San Juan Gathering System, which had lower transportation fees, index and natural gas prices.  San Juan natural gas prices averaged $2.59 per MMBtu this quarter compared with $9.19 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2008.  Of course, these lower natural gas prices resulted in lower fuel and shrink costs in some of our other businesses.</p>
          <p>Also contributing to the decrease was lower revenues from condensate sales from San Juan and Texas Intrastate Systems and higher expenses from pipeline integrity and repair costs on the Texas Intrastate System.  We realized a $5 million increase in gross operating margin from increased storage fees from our Petal and Wilson gas storage facilities.  A new storage cavern with 4.2 Bcf of subscribed capacity began service at our Petal, Mississippi facility in the third quarter of 2008.  We also had a $3 million increase in gross operating margin this quarter from the Piceance and Jonah pipelines in the White River Hub in the Rockies.  Total onshore natural gas transportation volumes increased 12% to a record 8.3 trillion Btus per day this quarter.  The capital markets improver significantly during the quarter, which lowered our incremental cost of capital substantially from the first quarter of this year. Since March 31, 2009, we have raised $725 million of capital consisting of $500 million of 4.6% three year notes issued in June and $225 million of equity.</p>
          <p>The equity transactions included $137 million from the sale of 8.9 million Duncan Energy Partner units and $88 million through our distribution reinvestment program last quarter. EPCO accounted for $75 million of the proceeds raised through the May distribution reinvestment. Affiliates of EPCO and Enterprise GP Holdings have committed to reinvest $82.5 million of their upcoming EPD distributions in August.</p>
          <p>Our liquidity at the end of the second quarter was approximately $970 million. We invested $274 million in growth capital projects in the second quarter and Randy will give more details later in the call about these capital expenditures.  During the first half of 2009, we commenced operations at new facilities representing $1.2 billion of total investment.</p>
          <p>We announced the completion of our Sherman Extension natural gas pipeline in March of this year, and while that pipeline has been ready for service, we have not yet begun commercial transportation on the pipeline due to integrity issues with Gulf Crossing Pipeline that's connecting take-away pipeline. Based on notices from Boardwalk, the owner and operator of the Gulf Crossing Pipeline, we expect to put Sherman Extension into full service this Saturday. Once in service, we expect the Sherman Extension to begin increasing volumes to near capacity based on long-term agreements with shippers for one Bcf a day of capacity.</p>
          <p>Our Sherman crude oil pipeline is currently flowing 129,000 barrels per day &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; our Shenzi Crude Oil Pipeline is flowing 129,000 barrels per day from the BHP-operated Shenzi field in the Green Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This 20-inch pipeline, which has 230,000 barrels per day of capacity, provides producers access to both our Cameron Highway and the Poseidon pipelines.</p>
          <p>Our other major growth capital projects under construction are the Trinity River Basin lateral in the Barnett Shale and the Marathon and Valley natural gas pipeline systems in Colorado that will feed our Piceance Basin pipeline system and our Meeker natural gas processing plant.</p>
          <p>The Sherman Extension lays the foundation for the separate but complementary Trinity River Basin lateral, a new one Bcf a day 30 and 36 inch pipeline to facilitate production from new areas of the Barnett Shale that are not adequately served by pipelines today. Phase One is expected to be completed at the end of this quarter and will allow initial deliveries from this area into the Sherman Extension pipeline. Phase Two, consisting of additional pipeline and compression, is scheduled to be complete in mid-2010.</p>
          <p>We estimate current production from the Barnett Shale to be about 4.9 Bcf a day from 11,500 wells.  Like most natural gas stations, the rig count at the Barnett is down substantially from the third quarter of last year due to producers conserving their capital during the current cyclical lows for natural gas prices. There are currently 73 rigs active in the region.  And based on our analysis, we believe the rig count will remain at 70 to 73 for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>We like the Barnett Shale with its low finding and development costs over the long term. Six of the top operators in the Barnett have reported a drilling inventory of almost 20,000 locations.</p>
          <p>The Eagleford is a developing shale play in south Texas and potentially along the entire Texas Gulf Coast and we are very interested in providing midstream services to producers developing the Eagleford Shale given the proximity of our integrated systems, natural gas and NGL pipelines, storage, processing, and fractionation facilities in that region.</p>
          <p>Over two million acres with Eagleford potential have been leased and more than 20 producers are in various stages of exploration and development, with a number of test wells drilled in south Texas. Limited public data indicates that successful wells will produce similar or better than the Barnett Shale wells with most of the natural gas fairly rich in natural gas liquids which, of course, will need to be processed before it can be marketed.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Rockies; the inlet volumes continued to increase at our Meeker and Pioneer processing plants with approximately one Bcf a day currently flowing into the Meeker complex and approximately 700 million a day flowing into Pioneer. Currently, we're extracting about 50,000 barrels a day of natural gas liquids at the Meeker plants and 30,000 barrels per day at the Pioneer facility.</p>
          <p>Our Piceance Basin and Jonah gas gathering systems are currently averaging one Bcf a day and more than 2.1 Bcf a day, respectively. The Piceance Basin's central treating facility that began receiving natural gas volumes in March is treating about 65 million a day of Exxon gas production.  And Exxon has 30 or more wells drilled and waiting to start production plus seven rigs currently drilling in that region.</p>
          <p>The rig count has declined significantly in the Piceance Basin and the Jonah/Pinedale regions also.  The good news is a majority of the new wells completed in the Piceance region will likely feed into our natural gas pipelines and into the Meeker complex. We have gathering and processing agreements with 10 of the top 12 producers in the Piceance Basin.  With the current rig count, we expect the average volume on our Piceance and Jonah Gathering Systems to remain at current levels, at least through the second half of 2009. We're also evaluating opportunities to provide midstream services in the Haynesville Shale area. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Randy Fowler to discuss other financial items.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. I'd like to briefly discuss the income statement items below gross operating margin. Depreciation and amortization expense and operating costs and expenses for the second quarter of 2009 increased to $153 million from $136 million for the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to increased property plant and equipment from additions of the Petal natural gas storage cavern in August of 2008 and the Meeker II processing plant, Exxon treating facility and Sherman Extension pipeline in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expense increased to $28 million this quarter from $24 million in the second quarter of last year, primarily due to $4 million of merger related expenses incurred this quarter. We reported $126 million of interest expense this quarter compared to $96 million for the second quarter last year. Average debt outstanding increased to 9.4 billion this quarter from 7.6 billion in the second quarter of 2008, primarily to debt incurred to fund growth capital investments. $12 million of the interest expense increase is attributable to a lower amount of capitalized interest in the second quarter of 2009 versus the second quarter of last year due to a decline in the amount of construction work in progress.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital expenditures, we invested approximately $240 million in growth capital projects and 33 million in sustaining capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2009. There were no large single project expenditures, just a number of smaller accounts, including capital spent on the Trinity River Basin lateral, the Marathon gathering pipeline, the Sherman Extension pipeline and the rail rack and terminal at Mont Belvieu that we acquired from Martin Midstream in the quarter.</p>
          <p>At June 30, 2009, we had 9.4 billion of debt outstanding, including 100% of our $1.23 billion of hybrid securities and 467 million of DEP debt. As Mike mentioned, EPD had liquidity of approximately $970 million at June 30, 2009, which includes availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash. We normally have a seasonal increase in working capital during the second and third quarters as we build NGL inventories that are forward sold for deliveries during the winter months. This year, our working capital levels are a bit higher than normal because of current business opportunities.</p>
          <p>At June 30, we had approximately $620 million of total working capital deployed in NGL inventories that had been forward sold and in restricted cash, which principally supports our natural gas processing hedging activities. We expect this level of working capital to tick up during the third quarter, but expect by year-end 2009 the amount deployed will decrease by approximately $340 million from current levels as inventories are delivered and receivables are collected.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated floating interest rate exposure was approximately 21% at the end of the quarter. The weighted average term to maturity of our debt, which uses the first call date for the hybrids, is approximately 7.5 years and our effective average cost of debt is currently about 5.6%. Our consolidated debt at the end of the quarter totaled 9.36 billion, adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended June 30, 2009, which is EBITDA less equity earnings plus actual cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates, was $2 billion.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated leverage ratio of debt adjusted for the 50% equity content in the hybrids to the last 12 months of adjusted EBITDA was 4.3 times at June 30. EBITDA was negatively affected by approximately $156 million of hurricane effects in 2008 and the first half of 2009. Excluding these impacts, the debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA would have been 3.9 times. Our leverage ratio is also elevated due to debt balances reflecting a significant amount of capital costs for the Sherman Extension and Shenzi pipelines which were completed during the first quarter of 2009, but are not yet contributing meaningful EBITDA as of June 30.</p>
          <p>Leverage is also elevated due to the higher level of working capital. We expect leverage to decrease to less than four times at year-end. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hank Bachmann to discuss Duncan Energy Partners.</p>
          <p>&lt;&lt;</p>
          <p>Richard H. Bachmann, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer&gt;&gt;</p>
          <p>Thank you, Randy. We are pleased to report another strong quarter for Duncan Energy Partners,  with a 74% increase in net income and almost a 200% increase in distributable cash flow. Both net income and distributable cash flow are higher, due primarily to the midstream businesses that we acquired from Enterprise in December 2008 and supporting our third consecutive quarterly increase in the cash distributions paid to our partners.</p>
          <p>In June, we completed our first follow-on equity offering and issued 8.9 million common units that generated net proceeds of approximately $137 million to our partnership. We used those net proceeds to purchase from Enterprise an equal number of DEP units and cancelled those purchased units. While the partnership did not retain any of the net proceeds of the offering, there was no dilution or increase in the number of DEP's outstanding units.</p>
          <p>What the partnership was able to accomplish as a result of these transactions was to effectively increase the amount of units owned by the public by 60% to approximately 24 million common units, thereby providing our investors with substantially more daily liquidity.  In fact, average daily liquidity has increased from 92,000 units per day for the first five months of this year to over 330,000 units per day thusfar in July.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter of 2009, we reported net income attributable to Duncan Energy of $23.2 million or $0.40 cents per common unit on a fully diluted basis compared to $13.3 million or $0.32 cents per common unit on a fully diluted basis for the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Distributable cash flow increased to $32.3 million for the second quarter of 2009 compared to $10.8 million in the second quarter of last year, primarily as a result of the $21.6 million of cash distributions received from the midstream businesses acquired from Enterprise in December of 2008.  On July 15, 2009, the Board of Directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution rate of $0.435 cents per common unit, which represents a 3.6% increase from the $0.42 cents per common unit paid in respect to the second quarter of 2008 and as I mentioned before, is our third consecutive quarterly increase in the cash distributions paid to our partners.  Distributable cash flow for the quarter provided 1.3 times coverage of the increased cash distributions to be paid on August 7, 2009.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to briefly discuss the performance of our business segments for the second quarter of 2009.  This quarter, our Onshore Natural Gas Pipeline business segment reported gross operating margin of $30.2 million compared to 43.9 million for the second quarter of 2008. This quarter-to-quarter decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross operating margin from the Texas Intrastate System due to lower condensate sales and higher pipeline integrity expenses and lower sales margins and sales volumes on the Acadian pipeline system.  This decline was offset in part by our Wilson natural gas storage facility, which had increased gross operating margin of approximately $2.2 million this quarter due to higher storage reservation fees.</p>
          <p>Natural gas pipeline volumes increased slightly to 4.74 trillion Btus per day compared to 4.73 trillion Btus per day in the second quarter of 2008. Our NGL pipeline for the Services businesses segment had gross operating margin of $25.5 million for the second quarter of 2009 after adjusting for a measurement loss associated with the partnership's Mont Belvieu storage facility.  This was a 24% increase over the gross operating margin of $20.5 million for the second quarter last year also adjusted for a measurement loss in that quarter.  The increase is attributable primarily to higher storage feed and volume at our Mont Belvieu storage facilities, a decrease in fuel costs at our facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas and South Texas and lower maintenance expenses at the partnership's South Texas fractionators.  A reminder that operational measurement gains and losses at our Mont Belvieu, Texas storage facility are allocated to Enterprise and reflected on our financial statements as an adjustment to non-controlling parent interest.</p>
          <p>NGL transportation volumes decreased to 106,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2009 from 127,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2008.  And NGL fractionation volumes were 77,000 barrels per day this quarter versus 80,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year.  Our Petrochemical Pipeline Services business segment had a gross operating margin of $2.6 million for the second quarter of 2009 compared to a gross operating margin of $3.4 million for the second quarter of 2008, primarily as a result of lower transportation volumes on our Lou-Tex Propylene pipeline.</p>
          <p>Sustaining capital expenditures were $12.7 million in the second quarter of 2009, a $3.1 million reduction from the $15.8 million recorded in the second quarter of 2008.  Of the $12.7 million spent this quarter, approximately $8 million was spent in respect of the midstream businesses acquired from Enterprise in December 2008 and the remaining amount related to the businesses that we acquired from Enterprise in connection with our IPO.  For the year, we estimate that we will spend approximately $55 million on sustaining capital expenditures, which compares to $54 million spent in 2008.</p>
          <p>Interest expense increased to $3.4 million for the second quarter of 2009 from $2.7 million reported in the second quarter of 2008 due to higher average debt outstanding as a result of our borrowing of $282 million to fund the cash portion of our December 2008 acquisition.  Total debt principal outstanding at the end of June 30, 2009 increased $467 million from $208 million at the end of June last year as a result of the December borrowing.  We had total liquidity of approximately $131 million at June 30, 2009, which includes availability under our 300 million revolving credit facility as well as unrestricted cash.</p>
          <p>In closing, we are pleased to report another quarter of solid results and coverage of our cash distributions.  Randy, we are now ready to take questions on Enterprise or Duncan Energy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Pretty good.  Hey Mike, I was hoping that we could get your thoughts on your ability or what you're looking at to hedge your equity NGL production for 2010?  I mean, it seems that if the petrochem demand has stabilized like you've indicated and you've got ethylene production that's forecast to be running ahead of five-year averages, in addition to a couple facilities that are slated to be closed, it would indicate that you're waiting for obviously ethane and propane margins to improve before you started to lock some of that production in.  I was just curious, is there an inflection point either on the ethane or the propane side where you'd start to hedge?  Or what exactly you guys looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Darren, I'm going to let Jim answer.  But we've been pretty opportunistic about the timing on this, and frankly we've not been real great at picking the absolute highs, but we've been very good at locking in very attractive margins.  Jim, you want to talk a little bit about kind of what you look for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there an inflection point, Darren?  Yes.  Are we absolutely certain what it is?  Probably not.  If you look forward and you look at the contango in natural gas, the margins that you see forward that you can lock in, we just think once we get there, the margins will be a lot better than what we could lock in today.</p>
          <p>So if we ever see that reverse and we're anywhere close to what current margins are, let me give you an example, if I look at the Rockies composite today, it's in the neighborhood of 0.415 to $0.425 per gallon.  If I go out into 2010, I'm down around that $0.30 per gallon.  I think we expect with the run rates we see on petrochemicals, we think that comes back as you get closer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Jim, just as a follow up, how does the Gulf Coast ethane market play into this?  I mean we've obviously seen exports picking back up.  Are exports where they sit today, does it lend more confidence to your ability that the market in the Gulf Coast, particularly around Belvieu, is going to be tighter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking ethane or propane?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just ethane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  It appears that ethane is tighter than &#x2013; well, ethane is tighter than it was in January and February.  We sense that inventories have been pulled quite dramatically as you've had a pretty robust demand for ethane from petrochemicals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just one big picture question, if I could.  As you look forward to 2010, can you outline for us the Eagleford opportunity?  Jim, I know that you want more incremental dollars for CapEx allocated to the NGL side of the business.  So can you just give us a sense for any potential synergistic overlap and what you see unfolding there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We want more capital dollars for all aspects of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're all over South Texas.  How many processing plants we've got have down there, seven or eight?  All the gathering that we have down there, this is one of those deals &#x2013; I think we told Dan if we fumble this one, we probably ought to all be fired.  We have a vision as to exactly what we want to look like in the Eagleford.  We understand what we need to do, and we are pitching that vision to every producer that's down there and getting extremely good responses.  And that's about the extent of what I want to say right now, Darren. But we know where we want to be and the producers down there know where we want to go and are supportive of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Darren, I'd add, too, that the NGL business is very important to us, but I think our focus with respect to CapEx in 2010 and '11 is going to be heavily weighted on the natural gas side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  First question is the 12 million in hurricane impact.  Any thought on when that may come back?  Or is some of that going to be shut in for extended periods of time?  And the second question is related to the drip, how long can we count on that?  How many more quarters if any after this?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's take them in inverse order.  On the drip you can count on the next distribution and that's probably about it.  And not to say that there won't be more, but it's not something that anybody is committing to right now.</p>
          <p>I'll let Jim go ahead and talk a little bit about the offshore production, but the plants and the facilities, the pipelines are coming back on.  Frankly, the amount that we had from business interruption in the second quarter was less than the first and things are improving every month.  We do expect to get some recoveries on that as early as this quarter.  So things are looking better.  Jim, you want to talk a little bit about platforms in the Gulf?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, real briefly we've got a couple of systems, our pipeline systems that are still shut in.  Anaconda is one. We're relying on A&amp;R to repair their downstream pipe.  And as of this morning, they're anticipating that, that should be back on and producing either today or tomorrow.  Beyond that point, we've got our Viasconal system still has some work and we're working with MMS on a repair procedure or abandonment procedure on those pipe.  But other than that, most of our pipes are back flowing. And our platforms are dependent on the Anaconda.  Once it gets back on, we should be up and flowing full force.</p>

          <p>Yeah.  And, Ross, to put dollars on that, like you said, estimated loss of business in the second quarter was 12 million.  What we've estimated lost business for in the third quarter is five million, which principally is the down time in July.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I'll pass that to Chris.  But again, do appreciate the fact that we had this hedge in place that does affect us somewhat.  Chris is doing a lot of work trying to optimize all of our pipelines, particularly the Texas Intrastate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The pipeline is sold out for the rest of the year, so our volumes is not where we're getting hurt right now.  It's the flow rates of some of our firm customers with the spreads collapsing in the Gulf from west-east across the pipeline.  We're experiencing some lower takes in the commodity side of the component, but the vast majority of revenues are locked in from a firm point of view. And we've had an abnormal amount of integrity work during the summertime.  We typically do that in the second and third quarter while flows are down, so we're prepared to flow for the first and fourth quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's kind of hard to tell, probably a fair amount.  What we had so far was legal costs related to negotiations and fairness opinions and that kind of thing. But we do have, as Randy indicated in his opening comments, that we have SEC filings to make and proxy solicitation process to go through, so there's other things that we need to accomplish.</p>

          <p>Couple questions, one, I think, Mike, you threw in there that you're looking at some opportunities in the Haynesville.  Could you elaborate a little bit?  Do you think there's more pipeline opportunities?  Is that more midstream NGL?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Michael, kind of all of the above, but clearly with the Haynesville there's an opportunity for pipeline infrastructure.  We think we have some solutions that should be very attractive to the industry players.  Chris or Jim, you want to say any more on that?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you getting a sense you're not going to get a full answer on this, Michael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I'm feeling, just a vibe I'm getting.  All right, I'll try another one.  Mike, I think you made a comment also that you think the NGL export market will remain strong for the remainder of '09 and into 2010.  Maybe you or Jim, could you talk about what dynamics you think are going to drive that in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael.  I've been around a long time, and I've not seen this kind of a volume being exported this time of the year.  Usually this is an import season for us.  We are literally sold out across our export terminal in August, and virtually sold out in September, and if the transactions we're working on fall into place, we'll be sold out through the end of the year and well into 2010.</p>
          <p>I think a lot of what's driving this is just as ethylene plants in the U.S. are tweaking everything they can to be able to use more NGLs, so are ethylene plants in other parts of the world.  So I think a lot of this is being driven by LPG substituting for naphtha in places like northwest Europe.  That doesn't mean our cargos are going into Dow's facility in Terneuzen in the Netherlands.  It means our cargos are taking the place of cargos that would have otherwise gone to the locations our cargos are going to allow for those out of Sonatrach or wherever to go into the crackers.  I think that's a lot of what it is.</p>
          <p>I think if you look at what we're doing here on the Gulf Coast in terms of providing ethane to traditional naphtha crackers as well as what we're doing on our export volume, we're moving a heck of a lot of U.S. natural gas Btus into new markets made up of primarily traditional naphtha crackers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, just a follow-up to that, is there a physical limit or limitation to how much the crackers can take the light feed stocks versus the heavies?  Obviously we're seeing a shift, but is there some sort of physical limitation where they just can't take any more light, and are we getting near that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know.  I'm going to go back 12 years.  You know where I came from and our cracker in Europe at the time could use about 50,000 barrels a day of LPG.  They produced I think two billion pounds a year of ethylene, so that was probably about 50%.  I may be wrong.  So that's a million and a half barrels a month.  If anything they have probably improved on that.  I think &#x2013; and I'm going to look at Terry Hurlburt &#x2013;  in large part it could be back-end constrained rather than furnace constrained.  It's probably an off-line question.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then I was curious on the way you were representing the adjusted EBITDA.  I think on the press release you had 16 million was backed out, but you didn't back out the 34 million for Topps, so I was just curious why that was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John, this is Randy. On adjusted EBITDA, if you'll recall our definition of adjusted EBITDA, we subtract equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, and then add back actual cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates.  When you go through that step of subtracting equity earnings you've in essence excluded that forfeiture right off on top on the oil port.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It goes through equity earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It goes through equity earnings.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Okay.  And then on your maintenance CapEx, are you expecting to catch up later in the year, because it looked like at 33 million it was a little bit light?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's hard to tell.  We may, but there's a good possibility that we may come in a little short of what we expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So I guess what's a good run rate then for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd still look for about $180 million for the whole year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's probably off 10 million if you'd asked us this six months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's going to be a little bit lower than what you were expecting before?  Okay.  All right. And then I was curious, going through your GCF numbers, the equity and income adjustment has typically been negative, but reversed to positive this quarter.  And what was behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be when we subtracted the equity earnings, again, that's the charge-off on the Texas oil port.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So that's the charge-off there.  Okay.  Great.  All right.  And let's see.  And the cash distribution from the unconsolidated affiliates, it looked like that came down quite a bit year-over-year.  What was behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, probably two things.  Two of the larger unconsolidated affiliates are the Marco Polo platform and then also the Cameron Highway oil pipeline.  And just as a result of that estimated loss of business, you're seeing some of that flow through those joint ventures.</p>

          <p>Okay.  All right.  And then in terms of your balance sheet, where would you like your leverage ratio to be?  You mentioned you came in at 4.3 times.  You'll hit 3.9 times by the end of this year.  Would you prefer to be somewhere more in the 3.5 times range?  Or what's -</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Okay.  And then on the Eagleford, you were talking about as an opportunity, are you looking at &#x2013; in terms of how you would contract for that, are you looking at similar to what was done with Meeker with mostly keep whole?  Are you looking at a different type of structure there?  If you can give a little bit of color on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Hi, guys, just got two quick questions on the NGL pipeline segment.  One, the fee based processing volumes came down first quarter to second quarter.  Is that a good run rate going forward?  I think it's about 2.7 Bcf per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, it's Jim.  I'm absolutely clueless right now.  I've got this deer caught in headlights look on my face.  Could this be because we saw declines in South Texas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's because we saw some declines in South Texas and probably some elections down there that were network conditioning elections, Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that 2.7 is probably a good run rate for the next quarter or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the second question on that is you mentioned or highlighted a marketing business as a good contributor to that segment.  Roughly how much in gross margins did the marketing segment contribute?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, we didn't break that out separately.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Mark, one of the reasons that we don't do that is because we're optimizing the assets and really it's kind of hard to say this is really marketing or this is just the marketing group utilizing an asset that we own and kind of where do you draw that line.  So in our mind, it's really just extracting all of the value out of the assets that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then is there a particular geographic area where the marketing business really aided the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think along the Gulf Coast.  Well, I think it's the whole system in reality.  I started to say the Gulf Coast, Mark, but the more I think of it, we're one of the largest customers Mapple has off of the Mid-America system up there and our ability to take advantage of the options between the Midwest and the Gulf Coast out of Hobbs is directly related to that. So no, it's not one geographical area. It's all of the above.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys.  Good quarter.  Just a couple quick questions on fractionation.  Looking at the fractionation margins it appears that these margins on a per barrel basis have been increasing over the last couple quarters.  Can you give us just little bit more color on that market in Mont Belvieu and also in Hobbs and what you have been seeing in terms of tightness and utilization rates on those assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're full.  Hi, John.  We are chock or block full, and in terms of the fees, it's really an issue of supply demand.  And a few years ago, you couldn't give those services away.  Now it's in a high level of demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it Mont Belvieu, or is it really all over?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's primarily Mont Belvieu but we're using every drop of fractionation capacity we have to make sure that producers' volumes flow and that includes what we have in other regions to take care of these guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are the margins there, is that something &#x2013; are the margins that you're seeing in that business at a rate where you are worried about competitors coming in?  Or do you think you still have a pretty big advantage of just expanding your capacity?  And if so, where would you look at expanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Mike may have given you a hint in his comments in the opening remarks.  We would probably look at Mont Belvieu given that we have a fractionator that we have recently built at Hobbs, I'll bet you we might have the engineering all but done.  So it's not &#x2013; we don't have a lot of lead-time.  It takes a couple of years, Terry, to build one of these things.  We think these margins have staying power.  If we had one on today it'd be full.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, John, I'd say that we're always concerned about competition.  We never take it for granted.  We want to make sure that we have cost effective services for our customers.</p>

          <p>A lot of it depends on how we size it and it's not just off the shelf one size fits all.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on what other supporting infrastructure you have to put in around that, meaning pipelines and such, Yves.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Do you have opportunities in terms of contract renewals?  Given that you're full, does that give you some leverage, and how much &#x2013; what percentage of capacity will roll in any given year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a &#x2013; it varies depending on the year, Yves, but we're structuring our deal so that both the producer and Enterprise win on these things.  We'll give the producer a level of flexibility, but probably not as much flexibility as we would have five or six years ago.  So we're in the process of addressing all of our contracts regardless of their term and trying to lock up these volumes longer term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Not to be Clintonesque but is longer term more than three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Just to wrap up too, on the NGL marketing side, I recognize that you don't disclose it, but when you think about the inventory that has moved up and the fact that you have entered into forward contracts, two-part question.  Number one, have you booked any of that revenue?  What's the timing of when you will realize the gains from that arbitrage opportunity?  And is it fair to say that the magnitude of that opportunity is greater than it has been in past years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yves, we have booked the revenues when we actually delivered the product, sell it and deliver it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, yeah, we have got a lot of working capital, as Randy indicated, tied up in inventory that we sold forward. And so you could conclude from that, that the gains from that are going to be bigger than what we have seen historically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that will probably be fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe some in the third, maybe some in the fourth.  Maybe some in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then final couple of thoughts.  When you think about the Haynesville opportunity, and you think about the Eagleford opportunity, what's the potential in terms of dollars that you might spend there?  And the other way, I think Michael asked the question about timing on the Haynesville/ I would think that if you wanted to move on that, you'd have to move relatively quickly because of competitive pressures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's a lot of factors that play here, Yves, one is that this isn't something that we have total control of.  We actually need the customers, and so it depends on what they want.  We constantly look at all of our opportunities to deploy capital and look for where it makes the most sense for the partnership, and certainly as we're focusing on the gas pipeline side, those are two areas that are very appealing to us, but they're not the only areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Magnitude of capital that you might have to employ?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Couldn't tell you, Yves, but it's probably bigger than a breadbox.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Quick question.  On the increase in demand for the NGLs input for the use as the feed stock, I was wondering if you guys are noticing is the increase in demand purely from the switch over from leaving that over to the NGLs?  Or are you actually seeing a real pickup in demand for the feedstock and the operations by the different petrochemical companies and facilities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start and let Jim pick it up.  I think the answer is yes.  Certainly demand has picked up from the end of last year and the beginning of this year.  We have seen some of the heavier plants consuming more of the lighter ends trying to cheapen their feed stock cost and certainly the light end plants are probably running about as hard as they can.  Jim, have you got anything to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You nailed it.  Light ends are running as hard as they can, heavy crackers are trying to move harder to NGLs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you guys read anything into this pickup in demand from an overall economic and just starting in the cycle that maybe you're starting to see an improvement in the economy because of the demand for these feed stocks by the petrochemical industry, and that will feed on itself and create more demand as the economy kicks in?  Or do you think it's too early to say it's having an impact to be able to read into the economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I personally think it's too early.  I don't think you're starting to see the pull from an economic recovery yet.  You've got car companies that have been in bankruptcy that are trying to run down their inventory.  Once that production starts up, once the economy starts to recover and people actually start to consume more, then you'll start to see that pull.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  I guess my other question is on the San Juan gathering where the revenue went down so dramatically because it's tied to the price of the natural gas. Just curious, it seems then I'm reading into that that you guys do not hedge any part of those volumes, and if so, I'm just curious why you don't?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've talked about in the past that we have a natural hedge, if you will, between those gas index contracts and other of our facilities where we have plants that consume natural gas or where we have keep whole contracts where we have PPR so you have that natural hedge.  And so as I kind of alluded to in the comments, while gross operating margin declined in San Juan, other parts of our business benefited from that and tended to offset it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We use about 35, 40 million a day at Mont Belvieu, so to the extent the price goes down, we benefit on our fuel costs at Mont Belvieu relative to what we lose on San Juan.  We feel like there's a balance there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great.  And then is it safe to presume that the $45 million that's mentioned in the press release to recover from the business interruption insurance, that's all going to fall to DCF, so that's akin to more additional cushion or excess cash flow to be retained possibly by the partnership above and beyond what's been reported since last year's hurricanes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd kind of term it a different way.  Even with the business interruption and without recoveries from business interruption insurance, we're able to increase our distribution and have a healthy coverage. When we get the recoveries from the business interruption, we would not expect to pay that out in distributions.  We look at kind of what our normalized cash flow run rate is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So then it hasn't been factored in anywhere so it is additional future DCF just probably retained</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is additional distributable cash flow, and we would not expect to pay out one-time cash receipts.</p>

          <p>I think in different parts of the country, it's probably more standard than it is in the Gulf Coast. If you remember, San Juan's been around quite some time, so those contracts were put together well over 20 years ago, and we inherited it when we acquired Gulfterra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So at the moment or going forward, do you plan on seeing, or do you expect to see more of these kind of contracts in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I doubt it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The other question I have is, given the changing winds and sentiment of the capital markets, have you guys changed or modified your stance on what is the proper amount of leverage, the treatment of unit holders, et cetera, on a going-forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that we have changed our view. We've consistently said over the last probably four or five years at 3.5 to 4 times debt to EBITDA is probably the right place to be. What we have done, and you've probably noticed as we were going into 2009, is that we've moderated our CapEx. We took advantage of some windows of opportunity in the fourth quarter last year. We issued equity and equity content this year. We raised fixed income when it was opportunistic to do so, and we've continued to be very opportunistic about when we access the markets, always mindful that we want to maintain that investment grade credit rating.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks very much for your time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And our last question is from John Edwards with Morgan Keegan. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, just a follow-up. I missed your answer on how much marketing contributed to natural gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't mention it. We just didn't give it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, my thing was blocked out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, similarly on natural gas liquids and on the natural gas side, we view the marketing functions as part of the business as opposed to a separate business apart from the assets, and so it really is in both cases a way for us to fully optimize the assets that we own.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just another kind of housekeeping, again on the TOPS write-down, in the natural gas segment, in the segment margin you reported, does that include that write-down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's in our Offshore Pipelines and Services segment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean offshore, sorry. Okay. And so you did include writing that down in that segment, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
