          <p>Okay, well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending by webcast or in person Glencore's interim results 2012. This morning we have, from the left, Telis, Tor. We have Clinton- Clinton runs our South African operations, if you haven't met him before, Clinton Ephron. Mr. Mahoney I think you met before, the grain business. And obviously Steve and Ivan.</p>
          <p>The format will be as usual. Brief presentation on the results, but also looking at ag, the ags business specifically, and South African coal. And then we'll cut to Q&amp;A. Okay? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Morning. So we got our first-half results, and I'll take you through the results, and then the guys will talk about their various divisions and how they performed and going forward.</p>
          <p>So the good thing, as you can see the results. We're 24% down, EBIT $2.5 billion which is down 24% on the first half of 2012. But if you look sequentially, on the second half of 2011 to the first half of 2012, which is a good sign, we're 20% up. So annualized for, if you take the first half 2012, they're closely tracking. And you extrapolate that 2011, they're closely tracking the 2011 results.</p>
          <p>The marketing business, like we always said at the time of the IPO, is more resilient to the fall of the commodity prices, and I think we displayed that now with the results in the first half of 2012 where the marketing had an EBIT of $1.12 billion, which is 11% down on the first half of 2011, and in fact substantially up if you take the second half of 2011 to the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>Industrial EBIT, like all the other mining companies, is down 32% to $1.4 billion on the first half of 2011, and as expected that's due to the lower commodity prices, average metal prices, which were down during the first half of 2012 to 2011.</p>
          <p>Sequentially we have a flat EBIT if you compare it against the second half of 2011, first half 2012, and including associates, it's a flat EBIT. But consolidated EBIT, the first half of 2012, second half 2011 is up 30% due to the strong volume growth which is occurring at our various sites around the world.</p>
          <p>Strong cash flow generation with funds from operation $1.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA interest come in excess of 7%. We have abundant liquidity. We have in excess of $9 billion of committed headroom, and no material refinancing will have to take place in the coming next 12 months.</p>
          <p>We have a sector-leading growth pipeline, and if you look at our pipeline of projects, as you know they're brownfield projects; they're not massive greenfield projects with high risks. They're not massive large capital expenditure programs. And these projects are very much on line, on time, and on budget. One or two a little bit behind, but other ones ahead, which we'll talk to in more detail.</p>
          <p>Interim dividend of $0.054 per share, which is an increase of 8% over the first half of 2011. So, once again, this reflects the confidence in our commodity diversification, the robustness of our marketing business, the visibility on our brownfield projects, as I said before, which are not high risk, easy ramp-up projects, and once again, we have a strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So going forward, I spoke about those numbers. There it gives you an idea, where you've got the -looking at the marketing part of the business just once again, which we really try to emphasize to you at the time of the IPO, and I think we've now proved it. The resilience of the marketing business as against falling commodity prices is not linear like you have the assets.</p>
          <p>On the asset part of the business, commodity prices fall. It's totally linear. You have profits in that area, whilst the marketing can be robust against commodity price falls. And as you see, we've got 11% drop in our earnings for the first half to first half 2011 to 2012. But if you look at the second half of 2011 to first half 2012, you have around a 70% increase.</p>
          <p>Metals and minerals was a good performer. If you look at the breakdown over there, you have an increase in that area, which shows the growth in that area. They increase in the volumes, improved profitability, 9% year-on-year and 13% sequentially. The energy is &#x2013; if you look first half 2011 to 2012, it's down. But as you can recall, during first half of 2011, you had a lot of arbitrage opportunities; you had the WTI Brent opportunity, which does not exist &#x2013; did not exist in first half of 2012; and you had a very good performance at 2011. But as you can see, if you compare the energy side of the business, the second half of 2011 to first half of 2012 is a substantial increase.</p>
          <p>The ag business has performed well in the first half of the year; and as you will recall, it had a difficult year during 2011, especially during the second half of 2011 due to the cotton losses, and you can see the substantial increase there. We don't have that loss. And the cotton situation is well behind us, and that department is looking &#x2013; as you know, the commodity price in that area has increased substantially since May this year and is looking very good boding for the future; strong arbitrages, and as we've said with higher commodity prices, tightness in the supply system that bodes well for the company going forward, especially on the marketing side of that business.</p>
          <p>Industrial assets, as we said, reduction between the first half to the second half. If you look at metals and minerals, mainly moved on the negative impact of the sovereign and the macroeconomic concerns on metal prices, production performance; but, however, if you look at the second half of 2011, 2012, a slight decrease on adjusted EBIT.</p>
          <p>If you look at the ramp-up of the various assets, Mutanda is ahead of schedule, but this has been slightly offset by the delays at Katanga and Kazzinc. But the important feature, we are still online on budget on the costs, with just a slight delay due to the energy situation at Katanga, and Telis can answer any questions later on on that.</p>
          <p>Energy substantially on the industrial side is substantially up as you can imagine, because we have the Aseng oil field, which kicked in during 2011, and that was ahead of budget. As you know, that is producing 60,000 barrels of oil a day. We get 24% from that. And on the <mark type="ph" /> grassfield (0:03:41) products was mainly just effect on the sugar side of the business.</p>
          <p>So I think that gives you an idea of the various assets which we got. I spoke about most of them. If you look at metals and minerals, we spoke about that; energy products, the important issues there. If you look at the energy products, the ramp-up at Prodeco is fully online and on schedule, on budget, once again, on time. These are brownfield expansions, not difficult expansions, with limited risk.</p>
          <p>We had additional contribution from our new acquisitions in South Africa from Optimum, Umcebo and our Shanduka transaction, which Clinton would talk about further later on. On the ag production side, as I think you know, we got the new crushing facilities in the Czech Republic and Poland that is coming on stream; and the results were, on the sugar side as I said, little impacted by the sugarcane production during the year.</p>
          <p>Looking at our growth projects, looking at compound annual growth; as you'll see, between 2012 to 2015, we have a 18.4% CAGR growth rate. Important feature, if you look at the capital expenditure, you see the growth on our various major operations there. But important feature is whilst the other mining companies have this massive increase in capital expenditures and these big cost outflows, we are reducing considerably.</p>
          <p>We are reaching most of the operation with Prodeco will be concluded early next year. Mutanda, Katanga, we are starting &#x2013; a lot of the money has been spent and it starts reducing. Kazzinc, it has all been spent and now it's just a matter of getting those production schedules up to speed, but very little big capital expansions taking place and very little capital outlays over there. So that's a good sign of the business.</p>
          <p>Kazzinc, we &#x2013; as you know, the gold and silver equivalents is growing and production is ramping up there. We have now, I think, sorted out the situation that was occurring at the Altyntau gold projects, and now that is up to speed; and the copper smelter which is ramping up at Kazzinc is now up to 80% design capacity, so performing fairly well.</p>
          <p>On Katanga, that is the one the results were announced recently. The situation at Katanga, we are still on line on budget on capital expenditure. However, we do have delays and Telis can take you through later on in more detail on those delays; and the large amount of the delays and why we didn't have the increase in production that we're expecting during the first half; and for the year, we will be below our budgeted expectation, I think which was announced by the company, so we cannot say much more than what the company announced. But a lot of those delays is due to the power situation in the Congo, and that is a situation which we've worked on and I believe we've resolved. So we will &#x2013; Katanga will get up to speed and we have now processed with the Phase IV expansion to eventually get Katanga to its design capacity around about 300,000 tons.</p>
          <p>Mutanda, the good thing about Mutanda, Mutanda is ahead of schedule and Mutanda will reach its capacity this year of around 100,000 tons production and growing. We are expanding Mutanda and it will hit its annualized ramp-up of 200,000 tons by the end of next year. So just giving you a profile of Mutanda, as I said, we will get there. We are now looking at areas <mark type="ph" /> of sulfides (0:07:23) expansion over there at Mutanda. But you can see it has had a 48% expansion during first half 2011 to 2012. And as I said earlier, we will merge Mutanda and Kansuki, and eventually those two projects by the end of 2013 will be annualized at around 200,000 tons.</p>
          <p>The goods part on the E&amp;P portfolio in the oil division, as you can see, we had a very successful development of the Aseng field in Equatorial Guinea, which started up in November 2011. And that is, as I said earlier, a 60,000 barrels of oil a day. We get 23% of that, so a very successful operation. The other field in Equatorial Guinea, the Alen field, where we should have production around about 40,000 barrels per day, will be up around quarter-three 2013, we believe, early around about July there and that we will get 24% of the 40,000 barrels a day. So those will be cash generators of income into the company.</p>
          <p>We also successfully did our first 100% owned exploration in the Cameroon. That's the Oak-1x Times project. It's been a successful project for Cameroon, and there's a 13.7 meter oil column was discovered in the main prospect with a total net oil pay of 6.2 meters, which has significantly de-risked the adjacent lying areas at similar depths there.</p>
          <p>So we will have further appraisals of that during 2013, and we believe this is a substantial field with recoverable oil potentially between 38 and 90 million barrels of recoverable oil, if the adjacent untested structures are included over there. And note very important, this is 100% owned by Glencore.</p>
          <p>Prodeco, as I said earlier, moves ahead. We will have the port operating, the new port, in the first half of 2013; once again, on time and on budget. And we are ramping up that Prodeco; as you can see an increase of 12% first half to second half, and by 2013 when the new port is in play, it will be producing around about 19 to 21 million tons of coal.</p>
          <p>So then that gives you a full sum up of our various assets, and as I said earlier, the trading &#x2013; the assets are brownfield expansions; easy, low cost expansions; very little likelihood of cost overruns; on time, on budget, which is lot easier than some of the other mining companies with large greenfield projects. And just &#x2013; we keep emphasizing, as we said at the IPO, the trading is resilient to falling commodity prices, and I'm pleased to say I think we've proved it during the first half of this year with the resilient trading results even though commodity prices have come off.</p>
          <p>So I think with that, I'll let Steve takeover.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Ivan, and good morning to everyone that's here in the room. Just a few slides on Glencore's financial performance and balance sheet metrics during the course of 2012, the first half. Some of the more detailed operational aspects, Ivan has covered. But maybe at 25,000 feet, you can see some of the comparisons both first half 2012 against first half 2011 as well as the second half 2011 as well.</p>
          <p>So you can see some of the sequential developments, and also some of the remarks around where we may end up annualized for 2012 against when we closed the books for the full-year 2011, where we're tracking for full-year 2011. And in a relative terms and a sequential terms that would be a performance year-on-year, as we look forward that would place us in an enviable position within the industrial space.</p>
          <p>And that's very much buffeted by the most stable and resilient marketing part of the business and lot of strong growth that we're getting also out of the industrial part of the business; some of which, from both an operating as well as financial perspective, is going to be second half weighted and we'll talk a little bit about that.</p>
          <p>So you can see the EBITDA and EBIT variances 17% and 24%. It is a higher variance at the EBIT level, because that's where you get depreciation, we include our share of income from associates comes through that level. But Ivan showed the charts looking at what's the EBITDA split between industrial.</p>
          <p>Net income, 26% down at the statutory level contrary to, again, may be many negative movements that's where you often see the differences between underlying earnings and statutory tends to be down. In our case, it's often up through the realizations of value that's been historically going in through historical investments, changes in the investment structures, tax structures that we do as well.</p>
          <p>If you look at 2012, we've gone from an underlying $1.8 billion; our statutory return is actually $2.3 billion, which although is not &#x2013; tends not to be commented too much, only still another facet of the business through value preservation and long-term value that we expect to be going in through the business. There was $466 million, if you look through the details of our financial statements that we've tagged as exceptional to get to the $2.3 billion, which is only a small reduction against first half 2011.</p>
          <p>Some of the bigger components in that was a gain on moving our status in the Mutanda investment. Previously, it was an associate where we owned 40%. During May, we did increase a -we bought 20%, moving us to 60%. There's a further option which could potentially move us to 80%. From an accounting classification, that moved us from just equity accounting. So, it's just our proportionate share up to the full consolidation, and the accounting standards does require you to effectively revalue the historical 40% stake up to fair value as it was at May 2012. And there was an accounting gain of $517 million that was booked on the previously held interest in Mutanda.</p>
          <p>Also in that line items, you'll see some further tax credits that we've generated what we were able to do as we look towards the potential Xstrata merger. We did some internal structuring around the entities that hold the Xstrata stake within the Glencore Group and it did get moved around and that triggered some gains that will be revenue gains. It will be able to be utilized, particularly in our Swiss tax pays; and it was a tax credit to deferred tax asset, which you will see of $282 million that we book there.</p>
          <p>That is real value. That's not a fictitious asset of any sort. It's something that is carried forward we expect to generate Swiss taxable income that allow that asset to be realized in &#x2013; obviously, in future years. The cumulative effect of the deferred tax asset, in fact that we're carrying on our balance sheet today is well in excess of $1 billion, which is the tax-effected balance, which is going to shelter future tax that may otherwise being payable, which is going to result in stronger FFO and cash generation and an ability to de-lever in the short-term as well.</p>
          <p>There were few smaller impairments that we booked; the gross effect was around $100 million. We've commented on the biggest component of that being an impairment we've had against one of the plants in the European biodiesel. It's something that's within our agricultural, a very over-supplied, over-capacity market, tough margins. We had a few plants and we've shut down, we've mothballed one of the plants and that's an impairment against the carrying value there; and some various other smaller pluses and minuses which aggregate to the $466 million as well.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; if we look at the balance sheet metrics around equity and debts and the overall shape of the capital structure, our equity base in fact increased $2.5 billion, up 8% from $32.3 billion up to $35 billion. So, there was a slight headline increase also in net debt, which we'll explain in future slides around $1.5 billion. That's been more than compensated by an increase in equity accumulation through transactions that realized value through the profits that we paid, which at least from a balance sheet statics perspective, the gearing ratio if you calculate that. I don't like the balance sheet gearing. It's very much should be cash flow driven. But I know a lot of companies report the balance sheet gearing. We're actually fairly stable at about 28%, 29%, given there is a slight increase in debt, but equally there has been an increase in the equity balance of around $2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>If we then move to some of those headline metrics in the balance sheet; Ivan has focused on some of them. We've very much a robust balance sheet, $9 billion of committed liquidity. We've been very active in the different financial markets. The financial statements make reference to those transactions. We've done three or four large bank financings. We've been active in the bond markets in Europe, sterling as well Swiss franc. All of which has resulted us being in a very comfortable position around $9 billion of committed liquidity, and as Ivan said, no material refinancings in the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>When you do have a look at our current borrowings, it's essentially made up of some of the shorter term asset-backed structures, the borrowing bases that we do have, the most efficient way of organizing those funding strategies in a 364 day facility. That's backed by a tends to consortium of banks in some cases. Some other investors that tend to be very straightforward to go through an annual renewal process, that's backed by the underlying collateral of oil in tanks, metals in warehouses, receivables to major utilities, to major mining companies et cetera.</p>
          <p>And what you really effectively negotiating each year is not the size of the facilities, but what's the pricing for that liquidity, which has its underlying strong collateral value as well. So that's essentially the major things that sit in our current. We do like to keep. And you'll see a slide later on that says even our working capital, which is turning over of 36 days, is backed by two-year average maturity on the funding side of it as well.</p>
          <p>Strong cash flow coverage ratios as well. On headline FFO to net debt, you would have seen a drop from 27.2% down to 22.9%. That 22.9% is calculated on the last 12 months and picked up the weaker second half of 2011. So as we roll forward, that I think a better way of looking at pointing and signaling some trend in that is more annualizing first half 2012 against the debt levels and then you back up to the 26.7%, which is effectively a static position of where we were at the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>There's still some working capital release to come. We spoke about &#x2013; six months ago about some build up in working capital, particularly around the end of the year last year, December 2012, we did expect some full release of that working capital. We're still expecting release of working capital to materially arise for the full 2012; around $750 million of that occurred in the first half. We're expecting some further working capital release.</p>
          <p>It is something which we've also stressed on numerous occasions; working capital doesn't control you, you control working capital. So for as long as we felt there was a need or it was appropriate to release that working capital, we can do it in a manner of sort of 35 days or so. There is that cycle. But as long as there's good risk-adjusted opportunities, there's plenty of liquidity available for companies like Glencore, we feel, at least from an equity perspective; and certainly managing the credit side of our balance sheet nuts to not seize some of those opportunities that are generating healthy returns in the marketing business on return on equity, whilst still being very mindful1 to manage the balance sheet to make sure that we're delivering on our statements.</p>
          <p>S&amp;P and Moody's, certainly investment grade ratings, as we've reiterated are both targeted, and currently BBB watch positive on S&amp;P; Moody's, Baa2, review and direction uncertain. I'm sure you've read their various reports. S&amp;P was quite recent and Moody's the last comprehensive one was more around the March-April time; if you go back, they've given a few updates. So we'll move on, but still very comfortable EBITDA, net interest coverage 8%.</p>
          <p>The movement in our net debt $1.5 billion, we're still finalizing some of our historical investment and CapEx profile. But we are peaking in that particular area and should have already peaked now at least in terms of acquisitions. You will have seen the $1.1 billion that we'd purchased in subsidiaries for the first six months. Those were transactions which have been well shadowed for 12 months. That was the finalization of the Optimum transaction, which Clinton will be talking about, moving to control that within various stages.</p>
          <p>And also Mutanda moving up to 60%, that's also been something that's foreshadowed the cash flow effects, so those both occurred materially in first half 2012. Property, plant and equipment was also $1.4 billion of CapEx. You annualize that to around $3 billion; again, you're looking at a peak here for us in CapEx. And you saw a slide of Ivan earlier on where we showed the growth in our various main assets going from 12 to 14, but very much a tapering off in CapEx to a sustaining level in two or three years' time.</p>
          <p>If we just show this graph, quite a busy profile in terms of credit ratings. What we tried to do is just many in this room would be primarily focused and following the main mining companies, that you'd see in industrials. What we put is a smattering here of both you can see Glencore, which is the hybrid of both the mining industrial side as well as the trading side. So we show the credit profiles of the history of Xstrata, Anglo and Rio on that particular.</p>
          <p>We've also got Noble, Cargill and ADM for those that may not have been close enough with them and their historical credit spectrum. Because there is differences in the way that these companies can still have the As or the BBBs while not having exactly the same headline credit metrics. The rating agencies do look at them differently. They do look at marketing aspect and how that's funded. They also look and would allow for certain differences in net debt to EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Particularly in Glencore's business and many of the other trading companies, if you go to EBITDA, a normal industrial company needs a stronger ratio there, because it's got high levels of CapEx, generally higher tax rates, which it needs to service from which to pay the debt and be comfortable. We obviously don't have high levels of capital in its traditional sense, its working capital, but it's not capital intensive. The tax rates, of course, in our business are much lower as well. So EBITDA what we do have tends to follow through much quicker through to bottom line and cash flow generation than would be the case for a traditional mining company.</p>
          <p>If we look at Viterra, which is one of the big acquisitions that we're looking at now for second half which Chris will talk about, that's also very different to a mining company from a credit perspective. You're buying a utility-like operation that's sitting with the different ports and facilities and grain-handling facilities for which they charge a fee. So they generate that service-like fee. The infrastructure is been built there. It's not particularly complex; technically very low ongoing maintenance. So it's a very different profile to then buying a big mining or an oil operation that you continually need to invest to, to sustain those operations and it's very expensive.</p>
          <p>So in the comments on the right hand side, you can see &#x2013; which I think are important around a business model that has proven to be highly cash flow generative ever since our public ratings across many cycles since 1997. The marketing debt is obviously fundamentally different than the industrial. It's funding short-term, working capital turning over of 36 days and all-in funding costs have less than 5%, which again reflects the different funding markets and underlying collateral for those particular transactions. We've taken an even more conservative angle there, having funded that working capital with on average two-year committed funding facility, which would be more conservative than many others, but of course preserves our own financial strength and liquidity and our targets within the investment grade. So I think it's a useful snapshot.</p>
          <p>Similarly, if you look at the next slide, you can see the history of stable credit ratios and just where we are on debt levels today, 2012, first half 2012 against the last five years or so. So you can see debt levels are not &#x2013; are quite comparable in fact to previous periods. You can see some of the levels we were in 2010, 2012 not too dissimilar notwithstanding the tremendous upgrading and additions that Glencore's made to its asset and earnings base over the years. We are a different company today, first half 2012, than we were with the same debt levels back in 2010.</p>
          <p>If you think of all the potential which now exists and that's largely been funded, we've got the oil E&amp;P portfolio; the whole entire African copper base that we have, which has been heavily invested; the South African coal assets; Kazzinc gold; Colombian coal; many ag processing assets. These are all parts of Glencore's earnings stream and asset cover that didn't exist in 2010, yet with still the same debt levels at we are today against those periods.</p>
          <p>We're yet to see some of the fruits of many of those investments, which we expect to see. Even that 22.9% FFO to debt, we said annualized that was back to about 27.2%, very strong FFO. And at the time that we do cease to aggressively invest in this business, which we have done in last two or three years, it is a business that could de-lever quite quickly, including the ability to consciously manage the working capital as appropriate. We have invested quite heavily in working capital of course as well.</p>
          <p>Just some variances and bridges on the industrial side of our business both sequentially, so this is first half 2012 against second half 2011; in fact on Glencore's consolidated assets, you can see at the EBITDA level, we were in fact up 30% sequentially; and it's more the associate side of our business, which is where we've been flatter period-on-period. But we had $93 million negative variances in price. About half of that was in metals and about half in energy. And on the metal side, nickel and zinc were the two big contributors. On the energy side, coal was lower in price.</p>
          <p>Strong volume growth in the sequentially six months, $307 million. The biggest, part about $280 million of that was on the oil &#x2013; was in energy, and most of that was the oil E&amp;P. There was of course some coal expansion both in Colombia as well as South Africa. On the cost side, there was savings; you can see $28 million positive on savings, that's in nominal terms. In real terms, in fact, it is better because that includes some inflationary elements as well. FX year-on-year &#x2013; or period-on-period was largely immaterial. Extra depreciation on the back of the volume growth that we spoke about.</p>
          <p>The other positive of $83 million, in fact a big component of that really should be in cost benefit, because of the insurance proceeds on PASAR. As you would have read, there was a fire at that plant back in January and was shut down until July. There was a claim for business interruption. It was a fairly straightforward up and down case, for which we've got insurance cover. And the accrual of that, a lot of cash has already been received, is in fact sitting in that which really should be in the cost, because the increase cost would be part of that number.</p>
          <p>And the associate income, which includes the Xstrata side, that's where there's some sequential $253 million down to keep a flat structure. The next variance you can see is the period-on-period to the first half of the last year, which is quite a different period &#x2013; quite a different pricing period; as you can see, $571 million reduction in prices; $475 million of that was in fact metals. We've commented about the metals pricing environment being the main driver of the industrial lower earnings. That's with nickel, you would have seen prices on average down 28%, is higher zinc 15%, copper 14%. So, $475 million, metals affecting those operations. $90 million in energy. Coal, it was a 20% reduction.</p>
          <p>On volume growth, $575 million fully covering the drop in prices. Strong volume growth at Kazzinc, which was on the gold side. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:28:17) as much as nickel is a tough commodity that had a very good operational production performance, record performance in fact in Q2. And on the energy side, volume very strong, there was no oil production on the comparable first half 2011. So there's about $300 million E&amp;P; volume growth in coal was about <mark type="ph" /> $115 million (0:28:35).</p>
          <p>On the cost side, there is an increase, and again, this is a full nominal cost. So if we strip out inflation, it would be much low. The comparable period was a period still when there was quite intense inflationary pressure. And I would highlight in particular that the mining side was <mark type="ph" /> $200 million (0:29:00) of that Kazakhstan over in our Kazzinc operation.</p>
          <p>You would similarly have seen some CPIs in Kazakhstan at the ENRCs in Kazakhmys running about 15% at least in that period, but talk about inflation moderating, which we do see as well, but Kazzinc was a big one for that. Peru also a little bit of contribution; we've spoken about some lower grades there. And again, the PASAR insurance is in that $45 million. So really that should be offsetting these. So that provides the industrial bridge.</p>
          <p>Just to close on a slide, before we bring Clinton up, we thought we'd put some marketing profitability over the last five years, just to show you some averages where there's a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:29:37) 2012 appear in the context of history as well. You can see &#x2013; this is before the corporate little bit of overhead that we had as well.</p>
          <p>So just looking at the sector performance, $1.15 billion pre a little bit of overhead, corporate overhead; and in the history where we have split out the segments at least publicly we of course have the data back in our prospectuses in 2008 or 2009. We just gave marketing in aggregate terms, we didn't break it up into those segments. And you can see the sort of run rates and which are good years and which are poor years.</p>
          <p>I think when we have been on sort of road shows and the like, we've tried to pitch the marketing business in a EBIT of sort of $2 billion to $3 billion type range when market conditions are more vibrant and more arbitrage opportunities, inventories tighter. You would tend to be on an annualized basis close to the $3 billion. When markets are poorer, you tend to be around the $2 billion level.</p>
          <p>So we are at around the $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion annualized, which would be starting to get into the mid-range. And the averages that we achieved in the first half across metals, energy and agri not too dissimilar to what we've achieved in the four, five years before that. So I think a good bit of history there and trying to think about what the future may hold there.</p>
          <p>So with that, we have done a lot on South African coal in the last 12, 15 months. We've brought Clinton up from Johannesburg. I think it's an area which is from a modeling and an understanding is quite narrow. So, we'll try and see if we can upgrade all that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. A quick run-down of South African coal; it's one of the newest areas in Glencore, one of the newest growth areas in Glencore, which we've been building up for the last few years. Basically, the next few slides from our perspective is just to try and give you a run-down of our vision of South Africa, what we've been doing for the last few years down there and to give you some sort of perspective of what we see for the future.</p>
          <p>So back in 2005, we teamed up with a prominent businessman, previously politician Cyril Ramaphosa to create a Black Economic Empowerment Company, where previously Glencore owned 70%; we owned &#x2013; Shanduka owned 30%, which is Cyril's company. And we decided we're going to try and as best we could consolidate some of the industry in South Africa, where there were still some reasonable sized independent coal companies.</p>
          <p>And we set out on a task and we initially bought Shanduka Coal back in &#x2013; we created Shanduka Coal, which bought a number of smaller collieries back in 2005. That company produces approximately 6 million tons of coal at the moment. And then over the years, we've managed to, let's say, opportunistically build up this company to today which is approximately 27 million tons, as you can see I've got little pointer over there.</p>
          <p>So we started off with Shanduka Coal back in 2005. By 2009, we started negotiating with a company called Umcebo Mining and we subsequently bought into that company, which gave us 43%. Cyril Ramaphosa also owns approximately 35% of company Shanduka and there's one other outside shareholder in that company. And we've split it up into two segments part of this &#x2013; part of our South African coal assets being the Glencore controlled assets and being the non- Glencore controlled assets, where we have a large minority stake in this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:33:19) and I'll talk about it now.</p>
          <p>So let's start at the top. Optimum Coal, which is our recent acquisition, you may have obviously read quite a lot about it. It's a &#x2013; it was the fourth largest exporter in the country. We set about acquiring this asset in 2011, and through a complex mechanism of various structures, it allowed us to make inroads into this company, buying out a lot of the BEE companies together with Cyril Ramaphosa's company.</p>
          <p>And we managed to obtain a substantial amount of this company before the market even realized that we had actually bought into the company. Ultimately, it's now resulted in us as Glencore earning an effective 64% of this company. This company produces 14.2 million tons. 6.8 million tons this year we will export, and as you can see over there, 7.4 million tons we've sold into the domestic market.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, just to give a quick run-down, the market is pretty simple. You've got an export market, which is basically out of RBCT, which is Richards Bay Coal Terminal. You've got a big local market for the power utility called Eskom. They burn approximately 125 million tons. And then you have a residual domestic market, which is the metals market, the paper markets, the sugar industry where they use coal from a domestic perspective, from a heating perspective.</p>
          <p>So over these last seven years, we've accumulated this business, which has approximately 2.5 billion tons of resources at the moment. All these resources are in the main coalfields. I've got a map and we will just give you a little bit of an understanding of that. So today, at 27 million tons, and I'm just talking about the Glencore controlled entities at the moment; at 27 million tons, we are the fifth biggest coal company excluding Xstrata in South Africa. So it's quite a good footprint from where we stand, and it's &#x2013; like I say, we've accumulated the three companies that have various operations, cash-producing operations and resources to develop.</p>
          <p>The third &#x2013; the second part of the slide talks about a company called, Kangra Coal. It's a company we've been involved with for many, many years, but never had an equity interest. And we recently purchased 30% of this company into Shanduka Coal, which gives Glencore an effective 15%. This company produces approximately 3.3 million tons; 1.7 million export and 1.6 million domestic. I can't see from this angle. So, it's pretty much the run-down of our assets at the moment in South Africa.</p>
          <p>What we like about South Africa really is the projects and what the growth is and what our potential is for South Africa. The important thing about the coal industry &#x2013; and when we get to the map, I'll explain to you, is that the existing coalfields, which lie to the east of Johannesburg, about approximately 100 kilometers east of Johannesburg, they are your main existing coalfields, which have been mined for the past 120 years. Those resources are coming to the end of their useful life, a lot of them.</p>
          <p>The main resources in the country are up in the Waterberg, which is approximately 500 kilometers away. We, through our acquisitions, have managed to still secure some strategic resources in the main coalfields very close to our existing operations. In many instances, brownfields; in some instances, you could call them greenfields, but they're 30 kilometers away, which means that our infrastructure that we have in South Africa can be easily used as a base to develop these resources. And the reason why we wanted to develop the resources is the opportunities that exist in South Africa, which the next three slides will explain to you.</p>
          <p>So this short slide gives you &#x2013; it's a little bit long and it's got a lot of detail for you, but it just basically gives you our development project and our long-lead projects. Long-lead projects are obviously the optionality we have to bring on in the future, which we like to believe we have a long-lead of projects and we'll be able to sustain the kind of levels that we produce for the next hopefully 25 to 30 years in an environment where a lot of the resources are depleting and many companies are going north to try and find resources.</p>
          <p>Obviously, going north, you're going further away from the markets. So going north towards Zimbabwe, towards the north of South Africa, you actually extending the distances to the to the likes of RBCT, you're doubling the distances. You're also doubling the distances to the power stations and the domestic market. So by securing resources in the key strategic area of the Witbank coalfield, we believe we're well placed for the future.</p>
          <p>The long-lead items, we don't actually have to go in, but you can actually see that there is some substantial resources that we hope to develop sometime in the future in, like I said, the Witbank coalfields. That will give you a little graph &#x2013; a little understanding of South Africa. So, you see how this is Johannesburg and it's just obviously a snapshot of the coalfields. The South African coalfields lie in this area, approximately 150 kilometers east of Johannesburg.</p>
          <p>All these colored items are all Glencore resources that we have in the area; some of them developed, some of them undeveloped. And as you can see, the distances are not that great. While you're looking at the map, if you look somewhere down to the south, 600 kilometer south would be RBCT and 500 kilometers to the north would be the Waterberg. And this is where we secure our resources. We have a central office located here in Middelburg, and this is office that operates most of our coal mines.</p>
          <p>One other thing, obviously because of the acquisitions that have been happening haphazardly is that we're now in the process of consolidating all the businesses as one in order to ensure that we gain as much synergies as we can out of all the businesses, having now the necessary size to be able to negotiate with the likes of the explosives guys, the likes of diesel, the likes of contractors, et cetera, et cetera; and we're right now busy consolidating all these businesses into one. So this will just give you a little bit of a feel of where our resources are.</p>
          <p>Okay. So now you're probably going to be asking why South Africa and why coal in South Africa, we see two main fundamental opportunities in the country and we like to believe we are one of the first considering that some of the other mining companies are not interested in expanding their operations in the country. We are interested in expanding and I think we're going to hopefully be able to capitalize on this graph.</p>
          <p>This graph was presented in 2012 by Dan Marokane, who is the Head of Primary Energy of Eskom. It's a very interesting graph, and we base a lot of our strategy on this graph, and I'll explain to you right now why. This graph shows obviously the timeframe and the amount of tonnage that Eskom uses per annum. So currently, we're sitting in 2012, Eskom is burning 125 million tons of normally low grade unwashed material, where you can actually upgrade this material and export it; but for the main part, Eskom burn it on a raw basis.</p>
          <p>So what we show in here is the graph of what Eskom is going be required to burn over the next, say &#x2013; well, it goes all the away to 2040, but up to 2023 their burn ratio is going up. They've obviously got two new builds, Medupi and Kusile, with massive cost overruns. But as a result, they will be coming online within the next five to seven years. So we see Eskom be burning close to 160 million tons in order to sustain very close to 50,000 megawatts in the country and obviously to sustain growth of the country.</p>
          <p>The problem comes in, in that the committed and contracted coal is falling approximately 40 million tons short by 2018. Now, to start-up any mine in South Africa, you need at least five years lead time. And any companies wanting to start to take advantage of this gap would have had to have started now if they have the resources.</p>
          <p>But considering some of the companies not willing to invest in further projects in the country, a gap has now developed between what is required by Eskom up there and what is actually committed from a contractual perspective with Eskom. 40 million tons, ladies and gentlemen, is a substantial amount of tonnage, which we don't believe will be that readily available for Eskom. So we, as a result, believe that Eskom will have to pay higher prices in order to, firstly, attract further investment, and secondly, being able to secure the supply potentially from the export market.</p>
          <p>So this is quite an interesting graph which Eskom is pretty open about to say, you know, we've got a shortfall, we need to cover it, you know, who is going to make up these tons. Going back to our little graph here, hopefully, some of these tons will come from there. We've allocated export and Eskom, as you can see, in all the projects. But in fact, ultimately, if Eskom pay us the price, we have no problem in selling directly to them and we've made that very clear to Eskom as well.</p>
          <p>The second part of the opportunity that we see is that the government has allocated ZAR300 billion to infrastructure development in the country and that is through Transnet. Transnet operates the ports and the rail, and they've allocated a substantial amount to upgrading the rail of all the various commodities in the countries. So you will see that iron ore is getting a certain amount of money, coal is getting a certain amount of money, the ports are being upgraded, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So as a result, we do believe that the Richards Bay Coal Line will go from approximately 70 million tons to over 100 million tons in a matter of 10 years. And as you can imagine, you have Eskom competing for the same coal that's potentially being exported. So we have quite an interesting scenario developing in South Africa. We like to believe that we're at the forefront of taking advantage of that, and that's basically the strategy behind what we have done in South Africa in a nutshell.</p>
          <p>Steve, there's not really much that I can add, and I think that's pretty much the story from our side. But obviously happy to take any questions you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to talk just briefly about the acquisition of Viterra, and a little bit about the grain supply-demand outlook for the balance of this year, which is particularly interesting at the moment. Okay. The acquisition of Viterra was announced on the 20 of March of this year; and in the agreement &#x2013; upfront, it included component sales to both Agrium and to Richardson. These sales will fetch a total of approximately CAD2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>To Agrium, we sold the retail ag input business; and to Richardson, some of the handling assets, but only in Canada. That resulted in a Glencore net outflow of approximately CAD3.5 billion, and that outflow will be further reduced by the sale of various non-core Viterra assets, which we have identified for likely disposal over the course of the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>On May 29 of this year, the Viterra shareholders approved the acquisition, and we have by now almost all regulatory approvals, including Canadian and Australian competition and foreign investment clearance. And the only outstanding approval is that from MOFCOM of China. That's the only one still pending. We have post-merger integration teams fully prepared for closing, and we are fully ready to go once MOFCOM approval is received. That, by the way, is the &#x2013; that I think is the port elevator, Viterra's port elevator at Adelaide in Australia.</p>
          <p>The Canadian and Australian markets are very key markets; both Canada and Australia are big producers, big exporters of grains and canola. Obviously, they both have a land &#x2013; a large land area, better suited generally for grain and oil seed production with the exception of canola, and limited populations. Canada exports approximately 13% of global wheat trades; 6% of global barley trade; 69% of global canola trade, canola being the same as rapeseed. Australia exports 15% of global wheat trade, 20% of total barley trade and 17% of canola trade.</p>
          <p>One cannot procure market or trade grain or oilseeds today without a logistics infrastructure to support it. And Viterra is a particularly asset-rich company with a first-class portfolio of both logistics and to a lesser extent processing facilities. This acquisition will bring 63 silos and seven port terminals in Canada; 103 silos and eight port terminals in Australia. And this is an infrastructure, particularly the port infrastructure, which is extremely difficult to replace.</p>
          <p>The asset base, Viterra's asset base is highly complementary to Glencore's existing asset base. Glencore currently is strong in Europe, Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union supported by assets; also in South America. In Australia, we did have an existing trading business, but it was not supported by infrastructure and was therefore vulnerable. Viterra of course is North American and Australian, and it will turn our grain and oilseed business into a truly global business. And particularly on the grain side, we would be a very large player right up there with Cargill and ADM and Bunge.</p>
          <p>Just a few words now about the outlook for the second half of the year, because you probably read a bit about this in the FT and various newspapers, but it is a very unique 	 and I think it deserves mention. The U.S. weather staring in mid-May through June, through most of July and certainly through the first five or six days of August has been amongst the worst years, the worst three or four years this century comparable to the dust-bowl years of the mid-1930s.</p>
          <p>As a result of that, the U.S. corn crop, which in May was estimated to be around about 380 million tons, is now estimated &#x2013; and this is the USDA, United States Department of Agriculture, is now estimated to be only 270 million tons. That estimate may still be high, it might be as low as 260 million, 265 million. Some months ago, U.S. domestic consumption was estimated to be 300 million tons. With the crop of 376 million tons, these are the estimates of May, the U.S. was expected to export about 50 million tons of corn and that would &#x2013; since the production exceeded consumption by 70 million tons odd, that would lead to a stock-build in the US.</p>
          <p>That 50 million tons of corn compares to a total global seaborne trade in corn of about 85 million tons. So the U.S. would supply 55% of all the corn traded seaborne wise in the world market. With the new production estimate of 270 million tons, that production estimate would not even cover the original domestic consumption estimate.</p>
          <p>And you can see here that the United States Department of Agriculture, they have slashed the estimate &#x2013; the U.S. estimate of domestic consumption from 302 million down to 252 million. But that's a process that is yet to take place. They've also cut exports from 48 million to 33 million. The rest of the world will have to make up the 50 million, that's assuming the U.S. can, in fact, export 33 million, which I think is debated.</p>
          <p>This is a very unusual situation. We've had crop problems in the past. Notably in 2008, there was a wheat problem. But I think we've seen nothing of the scale of this. One also has to remember that within this 300 million, domestic consumption of 300 million, 126 million of that goes to the ethanol industry in the U.S. So that's currently mandated. And so when the USDA calls for domestic consumption to drop from 300 million to 250 million, at least for the moment the 126 million can't drop, because it's mandated.</p>
          <p>A similar situation in the soybean market; the crop estimate was 87 million and it's dropped to 73 million. It's not quite as extreme, but there is very good demand for soybeans worldwide, particularly from China. The total global soybean trade is about 90 million, of which China buys 60 million tons. So this will lead the second half of the year to, I think, a somewhat unprecedented situation. I think, unfortunately, in a way quite a bit tighter than 2008.</p>
          <p>The trade flows will switch and change around. There will be considerable dislocation. A company like ours will be required to think out of the box a bit to move stuff quickly and imaginatively to areas of deficit. And it is an unprecedented situation, which I think will make the second half of the year rather interesting and give rise to arbitrage opportunities. And so the outlook is fairly constructive in that regard.</p>
          <p>That's all I have Steve, Ivan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Chris. Okay. Just wrapping up before we have questions, you've heard the situation of the company. Steve gave a good rundown of the results. And once again, to reemphasize, it proves we believe that the model works and the model makes a lot of sense. And at the time of the IPO, we tried to convince the market why the trading should trade at a higher multiple than the mining companies, because mainly the resilience of the trading business, and even with falling commodity prices, it can still generate strong results.</p>
          <p>This was now the proof is in the pudding that first half of 2012 commodity prices came off. We've seen the rest of the mining industry, how their results were affected round about 40% downswing. We only 24% downswing; basically affected with a small downswing in the trading results of 11% half-on-half. So, therefore, the model clearly makes sense. What does the model also do? Naturally, the industrial assets have come off, but not as extensively as the rest of the mining industry.</p>
          <p>A big reason, we believe, we have positive growth on high assets. We have easy assets to develop, not difficult. We do try to stay away from those large greenfield projects and emphasize on added opportunities to existing assets, brownfield projects. You just heard Clinton, how we developed the coal business in South Africa. We saw opportunities. Now, those aren't opportunities where we go out and we say, we want to get big the coal business.</p>
          <p>Clinton trades down in South Africa. He deals with all the producers. He knows every producer. He talks to them. He saw an opportunity to buy shares while no one else saw the opportunity that existed, because he was talking to the owners, the existing owners of the Optimum Collieries and he realized some of them wanted to sell. He needed a Black Empowerment partner. He devised a scheme and he grew on that basis, the same as you know we developed our Colombian coal operations, expanded them; the same in the Congo, Mutanda, Katanga.</p>
          <p>You know we developed Katanga and that has all worked out relatively well and there we have positive delivery growth on those projects. In the Congo, in Prodeco, and you can see as I said earlier, most of our projects are on time, on budget. Katanga, we have the problem with the power issues. Those are being resolved. Telis can talk in more detail later, if you ask questions on that. But, as I said, the rest of the projects, Mutanda, this other stuff in the Congo is performing very well.</p>
          <p>Our oil fields, the Aseng oil field is strong and performing with 60,000 barrels. The Alen oil field comes on in second half 2013. We expect that to be very strong with its 40,000 tons and very good growth projects in the rest of West Africa, which we will concentrate on the oil side, well proven by development in Cameroon, where we own a 100% of that project. So we're very confident on our projects. We're very confident on the idea of the model. Our marketing skill, our relationships with these hundreds of producers around the world will continue bringing new opportunities to the company, and that's how we will expand our operations.</p>
          <p>So overall, as you can see with the economic headwinds across Europe, United States, China, we delivered a good result; net income of $1.8 billion. We have not stopped now in 2012. We moved ahead with other ideas, other investment opportunities; naturally the Xstrata merger, which we'll talk about later in questions. But we have also grown Viterra. You heard about Viterra, and if you look at it, I believe the way we structured it, selling of pieces which Chris explained earlier; selling of pieces to Agrium that allowed us to compete aggressively for the project.</p>
          <p>We were competing with the other grain trading houses, who were competing aggressively with us for that asset. But because we are tied up, we didn't do it as a pure purchase, the way other people were competing with us. Chris spent a lot of time working with Agrium. We always come with a different angle and we don't go in straight to do something. We always want to have an angle. He had tied up Agrium that when we bid on Viterra, we had a place where we could dispose of the fertilizer part of the business, the retail part of the business we did not want.</p>
          <p>We also tied up with Richardson, so we wouldn't have the problems, we believe, that some of the other mining companies, BHP had when they were dealing with Saskatchewan, where they didn't have a local partner, who could ensure you do not have a problems with the regulators in that country. So really when we attacked and went off with Viterra in competition with the other grain companies, we had a strategy; we had a way we could do it; we had no problems with the regulators. As you can see, we've got approvals throughout <mark type="ph" /> the line (0:57:20) but there was a clear strategy.</p>
          <p>So we will &#x2013; then that's how &#x2013; and if you look at Viterra, if you look across the commodity cycles, since we bought Viterra, which is another interesting thing, anything, anyone bought in the last six to eight months has not been a good investment. You see the other mining companies, some of the investments they've been hit hard with the shale gas or the areas in certain &#x2013; iron ore, whatever it is, has come off, so people are being hurt. But the one commodity which in fact gone the other way is Viterra worth more today than it was six months ago.</p>
          <p>Definitely, I believe you have the situation in the United States where the grain price is going up; Canada has not been affected in the same basis as United States, I think hardly affected. Am I correct, Chris? A very little effect. So, therefore, Viterra is a great asset and it's just the asset you will want in this type of cycle in the grain sector. So that is one asset which we did buy, we spent a lot of money on it, but it has in fact improved in value since the acquisition; once again, proves our skill in acquiring assets.</p>
          <p>The other asset which we expanded in was our Mutanda asset in the Congo, where we own 40%. We have the opportunity &#x2013; we've now bought an extra 20%. It gives us control because we had a partner there, where we had joint control of Mutanda. It was important that we got total control of Mutanda, so we could expand it the way we wanted. So we will increase &#x2013; we did increase our shareholding to 60% and we have the option to take our shareholding up to 80% at the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>Another expansion to show how Glencore operates the manganese business, we're fairly strong on the manganese side of the business. But because a lot of the producers don't like always sell to traders the manganese ore, they like to sell it to the end consumers, we devised a way and we were dealing with Vale about their manganese assets and purchasing the assets in France and Norway, getting those smelters that allows us to purchase manganese ore from all the producers around the world, now that we are a producer of ferro-manganese.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we expanded in that area. We bought those two assets, not a big investment, but it gives us a lot. This is the difference of us. We won't just buy an asset for the pure return we can get on that asset. Of course, we want that asset to make us money, give us the right returns. But we want to see what type of trading opportunities it can give us and allow us to grow our trading book.</p>
          <p>Now, that asset is a good example. We bought &#x2013; both these two smelters, as I say, in Norway and France, what does it give us? It gives us the opportunity to increase our manganese ore book to allow us to deal with every producer around the world who now will sell to us because we are able to take it into our own smelters. Plus, in the process, we get an off-take agreement from Vale at a price &#x2013; top price agreement, whereby we get the follow of the manganese ore from their operations to supply into these two smelters; plus on top of that, we get entire marketing of their manganese ore book.</p>
          <p>So once again just buying asset, not spending a large amount of money, grows our trading business and allows our trading business to continue to grow. So that is what's been proven. Commodity price is coming off, but trading business continues to grow, and therefore, gives us the resilience on the trading part of the business. So I think the model has been well proven now by these first half results in a declining commodity market. So the diversified model works, and hopefully, now we will start trading at a higher multiple then the pure mining companies.</p>
          <p>So I think that gives a full synopsis and we're ready for any questions. Paul?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jason Fairclough, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Two questions, if I may. First one is just for Steve, and I guess the second one probably for Tor and Ivan. On the balance sheet, Steve, I think one of the ratings agencies has gone on record of saying they would downgrade you if the Xstrata deal doesn't go ahead. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that.</p>
          <p>And then, second just on the seaborne coal market, we've seen some big changes, low prices. Tor, Ivan, maybe you have some comments on whether you think this is a cyclical downturn or a structural change that we're seeing in the seaborne coal market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Jason. I'll take that first question. They certainly haven't been as categoric as you portrayed it out. They've said they would need to see ratios and metrics to meet certain thresholds. So based on them running a whole range of scenarios, they've just position themselves with a direction uncertain at the moment. But there is nothing even remotely concrete around what they may or may not do. They've said because of some of the acquisitions obviously that we've done, we need to obviously deliver on where we think the balance sheet is going to deliver, where we think some of the de-leveraging is going to trend out.</p>
          <p>How we manage our balance sheet is also something that &#x2013; it doesn't manage you. I think we can be very productive around how we structure deals, how we manage working capital. We know what their targets are. We've always stated that we'd like to be in the stronger area of investment grade, which implies sort of the BBB plus as opposed to being at the lower level. So they just have taken a slightly different approach, probably a little bit more innocent until proven guilty compared to the other agency, which is the other way around and have said if it &#x2013; if for whatever reason the deal does not happen, they expect to affirm the rating at current level.</p>

          <p>Just to be clear, the S&amp;P report was, what, two weeks ago or a week this Thursday, the S&amp;P report?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the coal market, we see in fact a continued growth in the coal market, in addressable seaborne market. We're predicting about a 7% to 8% increase in fact. You still ironically have strong demand in China. You could have increased tonnage from &#x2013; last year's tonnage imports of about 175 million tons, this year annualizing above 200 million tons. However, with the lower shale gas prices in the United States, we've seen increased exports from the United States, increased exports from Indonesia ironically, and hence, a lower price worldwide in 2002 &#x2013; in 2012; excuse me.</p>
          <p>What you do have is a segmentation in the market of different qualities. So I don't think you're going to see a fundamental change in overall seaborne demand. In fact, we projected it's going to continue to grow going forward. You currently have about 280 million tons that's being produced above the current market price. So we don't believe that's sustainable. We believe the higher cost producers, normally the United States, maybe in some of the Russian producers &#x2013; and with increased cost in Australia -- are going to ultimately have to take a decision whether to reduce that export production. We think we're placed with respect to Colombia and South Africa being the lower cost producers for the respective Atlantic and Pacific markets to continue to grow and in fact to continue to increase exports competitively.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning. It's Heath Jansen here from Citigroup. Just a couple of questions, maybe starting with Telis on the end. A couple things that strike out, obviously, copper concentrate volumes were up strongly sort of 20%. Just wondering whether you can give us any sort of insight in terms of what was driving that. And also on Katanga, you've still <mark type="ph" /> gone into (1:05:12) 300,000 tons. I'm just wondering whether you can give us a timeframe on that.</p>
          <p>And just following up on the question on coal with Tor, just your thermal coal volumes were actually down 14% year-on-year. Was that a reflection of more tons coming out of Indonesia and the U.S. you're getting hold of or do you expect marketing volumes to actually pick up in the second half?</p>
          <p>And then I'll be just keep going along; Chris, just with Viterra, obviously one of the big issues you had last year was cotton trading. And I think Ivan said at the time the was part of the issue was brining external people into your business. I'm just wondering who is actually going to control risk with Viterra and how is that integration going to happen and the merger of cultures. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean our volumes of copper concentrates in metal, I think <mark type="ph" /> it was (1:05:47) about 30% this year, and most of that is due to China. And I think what happened, if you remember, towards the fourth quarter of last year, there was a fall-off in pricing just about across the whole commodity sector, but to do with European &#x2013; euro crisis. And the Chinese stepped in and bought heavily for first quarter and also unpriced contracts for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Basically they had to restock a little bit a very, very de-stocked situation, which was a much bigger growth than normal. If you take the Chinese growth at 7% in terms of their consumption, there was a jump up. And that was &#x2013; part of that was due to the fact that they had really de-stocked throughout 2011, and then they came in and they bought towards the end of last year for shipment this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Katanga?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Katanga, Katanga situation is not the case that we're behind, if you will, in terms of our development. Katanga, actually we announced I think last time we made a presentation that we actually brought forward our expansion plans, which we have. The expansion plan has come forward. We will complete the Phase IV expansion, which will take it to 300,000 tons by the end of 2013. So we will be up and running at 300,000 tons there.</p>
          <p>The problems that we've had at Katanga have been twofold in the first half. One, we had &#x2013; which was specific to Katanga, we had a failure in one of the large mills in the concentrator, which basically lost us almost half the tonnage. We lost about 24,000 tons of copper contained in saleable form in the first half. Approximately almost half of that was to do with the failure of that mill and the other half was to do with the lack of power.</p>
          <p>Now, the power situation is kind of twofold. One is the amount of power available in the country has been &#x2013; has not been sufficient to fulfill all the needs. But more than anything what we've been affected by is by transmission problems. We've had &#x2013; we had the northernmost operation in Katanga in Kolwezi and there has been big problem in the substation at the Kolwezi in terms of the converter and in terms of the condensers, which basically give you the kind of power that you need. They basically modulate the frequencies, so that you can use the power.</p>
          <p>And those &#x2013; both those two assets, if you will, are being refurbished. One, which is part of the World Bank Program, where they're fixing the converter; and that should be up and running by September. And the second one where we're fixing this thing. It's called a synchronous condenser that basically modulates the frequency. We're fixing that as part of our overall global project. So we think that specific &#x2013; quite critical power issues that we've had should be over by next month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to coal, obviously, as I've always said, to a certain extent, critical mass as we've always said is key, but we are not volume driven from the marketing side in that respect. And what we've seen in the market, I'd say, over the last year or so with respect to where we work our business, the arbitrage of the origins, the blending capabilities, with a lack of price volatility and a conscious decision on our part to &#x2013; we've reduced some volumes in certain areas based on quality, be that as it may differentials between a variety of sources. America's become a larger exporter significantly with the low shale gas prices in the United States. Some of those qualities, we don't &#x2013; it's not a case of over-trading or wanting to be so focused on volume that we've made a decision to stay away from some of those things at the time.</p>
          <p>Our volumes may change going into the second half. Coal's a largely seasonal commodity in that sense. But again, that will depend on the arbitrage possibilities we see between the various origins and particularly with respect to the qualities. We have seen a large segmentation on qualities, in fact massive over the last seven to nine months of higher sulfur material coming out of the United States, which is a very difficult sell particularly in the European market and to a certain extent in the Pacific market, vis-&#xE0;-vis the qualities where I think, you're going to see prices with respect to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:11) type in our mines in Prodeco or sort of a higher quality South African material which will be, in our view, the higher valued coal qualities and prices are going to be achieved on that basis. So we are conscious of the volumes in that respect, but it's not a question of just being driven by volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the question on Viterra. Viterra is not a trading company. It is an asset-rich handling company, grain-handling company, logistics company, effectively a giant stevedoring company. And in fact, that's what &#x2013; that's precisely what attracted us to Viterra. The company will be broken up of course. The Australian bit will be run separately from the Canadian and New Zealand bits, and the risk will be fully controlled by and centralized in Rotterdam, and of course, through limits and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:11:8) reporting to <mark type="ph" /> Bah (1:11:10). So it will not be run as a separate trading business. It will be fully integrated, run as a stevedoring company and handled in the same way that we handle Russia and Argentina and Central Europe today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The actual traders who are handling the business, the existing traders and no new people brought in.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only people brought in are the people who are just running it as stevedoring company, the pure operators of the silos. No trading risk is being handled by the new people being brought in. The only trading risk is being handled, which will be expand the operation by the existing people in Rotterdam, so very different to the cotton situation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question. I think it was you, Liam, slightly. Just beat Myles by about a nanosecond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Liam Fitzpatrick from Credit Suisse. Two questions. Firstly, just on the ag side, two parts of it. Firstly, Chris, can you give us a bit of guidance on the Viterra assets in terms of the bundle of assets that you're going to keep and what that sort of steady-state EBIT contribution will be? Maybe you can't, judging by that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, do you now feel that you've got the scale within ag to not have to make any other sizable transactions? And then just secondly more broadly on marketing, you've obviously talked positively about ag, could you maybe expand a bit on what your expectations are for H2 on the metals and the energy side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I fear I can't answer many of your questions. But does it give us the scale, yes. It's &#x2013; as I mentioned, Viterra is &#x2013; Canada is a big canola exporter, Australia to a lesser extent; but both Canada and Australia big wheat and barley exporters. We're already big in those two commodities in the E.U. and the FSU, to a lesser extent South America. It obviously gives us a North American presence. It beds down our presence in Australia, because it's now supported by assets. And I think it does turn us, particularly on the grain side, into a truly global company. I think when you look at the combined volumes of wheat, barley, canola, we will rank right up there amongst the biggest. So it will turn us into a global company.</p>
          <p>Do we stop there? I don't think so, no. We don't have anything in the U.S. Viterra has a bit, but not too much. I think there is perhaps more that can be done in Brazil. I think there's still room for growth. It's a business that is underpinned by strong demand, 2% or 3% a year. So there's room to grow even if you're not necessarily taking from somebody else. I think it's a business, maybe in contrast to some other Glencore businesses, where you can &#x2013; and these are not small amounts of money, but for relatively small amounts of money for Glencore, you can achieve real growth and real scale. So no, we won't stop there. But is it transformational? Yes, definitely, it will increase our volumes by approximately 60%, 65%, we think.</p>
          <p>In terms of the outlook for the balance of the year, the environment is a good one; high prices, a lot of volatility, a lot of dislocation, tightness, a lot of arbitrage opportunities. The United States market for the moment is sort of outperforming the other markets. And I think we will both be able to provide the world with solutions, getting stuff to where it's needed, quickly, timely. And that should also be good for Glencore, yes. I don't think I can give guidance any more specific than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Liam, maybe just on &#x2013; I think we put up a presentation back in about March, April after announcing the transaction, the six or seven slides, where we did show the historical EBITDAs and cash flows of their three different segments; you can get a good sense of what we're keeping, what we're not keeping, that's within the existing business. And I think it is something we'll have to wait for the transaction to close. We'll be back here of course in February next year and can present much more the plans and the pro-formas and how that business looks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But also if you do look at Viterra and you just look at their profits which they generated utilizing the assets as a stevedoring business, that is one part of their business, which if you extrapolate those earnings into Glencore's, sure, those are the obvious ones. But on top of that, Chris will have the ability of being able to buy from the farmer, being able to operate in Canada in a bigger way by having these units, which then that's another part of his trading ability and gives him these arbitrages he talks about, which suddenly he will have a whole new game to play with.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Myles Allsop, UBS. Maybe a few quick questions, first of all, obviously the elephant in the room, kind of the Xstrata merger. If you give us a quick update on that as much as you can do at this situation. Obviously, you've been saying kind of generous terms, that's what everyone is kind of thinking about over the next couple of weeks at least. And then maybe if you give us a quick update on your employee ownership, obviously the lock-up ended in June, where we are today in terms of sort of ownership by employees? And just on the Viterra thing, how material a risk is kind of export bans to kind of spoil the fun in second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's talk about the big elephant. Look, we said at the time of doing the deal, which everyone seems to forget, this &#x2013; the transaction which was done, the 2.8, we even said at the time we believe was generous. We believe there was a premium, a significant premium in that 2.8 already. What one should not forget that this was a highly negotiated deal by Xstrata. The CEO of Xstrata, Mick Davis, negotiated this deal over a lengthy period of time.</p>
          <p>It was a deal, we believed, added value to all shareholders because of the synergies. He understood the synergies involved. He spoke about at the time of $500 million of synergies. They've subsequently spoken about capturing a further $300 million of synergies. So that's even increased the figure. And Mick Davis, the CEO, his full management team were fully supportive of the deal. His Board, all the Independent Directors voted unanimously in favor of the deal. So they fully support the deal at the 2.8 ratio and they believe they've done a very good deal for their shareholders, and that's why they did it.</p>
          <p>So I believe the Xstrata management, and Mr. Davis, who is an astute negotiator, believes he negotiated a great deal with Glencore. We at Glencore were prepared to do the deal and paid us premium even though it's a merger of equals, and they do have a fairly substantial amount of control on the asset. We believe it's a deal worthwhile doing, because we believe the synergies are so vast. We believe having the flow of their commodities into the Glencore system would add a lot of value, et cetera, to the shareholders.</p>
          <p>So this is a deal that they wanted. It is a not a hostile deal. It is not a deal where we're trying to encourage shareholders over the line, because we think we need them over the line because management is not supporting us. So management supported to the hilt. So &#x2013; and look at the deal subsequent. At the time the deal was announced, I think the ratio was 2.59. November-December, it was round about 2.3, the ratio.</p>
          <p>And what has happened subsequently &#x2013; subsequent to that announcement, Xstrata results have decreased 44% and Glencore results, as you've seen in the first half, have decreased 24%. So that clearly shows that 2.8 is a pretty good ratio, and getting at a higher premium if you just look at first half results. Now, if you extrapolate those results further, you look some of the analysts, you look at Bloomberg, you look at the different reports for 2013, 2014 and 2015, it also displays that 2.8 is a very substantial premium.</p>
          <p>So we really believe it's a good number. Xstrata management believes it's a good number. They believe they've negotiated a great deal. So I don't know what some of the shareholders &#x2013; and most of the shareholders &#x2013; I have not met a shareholder who's managed to prove to us otherwise, who've shown us something we haven't seen. I don't think any shareholders have shown Xstrata anything that they haven't seen. Xstrata know their assets very well. They know our assets very well. So, no shareholder has really displayed something different.</p>
          <p>Now, it's clear that Qataris who have built up a substantial stake, about 12% as you know, the question is what are the Qataris really trying to do? This is not a company who held a big stake of Xstrata before and saying, I don't like this deal and therefore I want to build up enough stake to block this deal, because I don't like it; I'm a major Xstrata shareholder; I don't like the deal with Glencore, because I don't understand the trading business. That I can maybe get to grips if someone's sitting there and saying that.</p>
          <p>We've had none of the existing or the long-term Xstrata shareholders against the deal. We've had very few of them even against the ratio. Yes, a few have came out, a smaller &#x2013; some of them have come out and said they would like more, but that's obviously expected. Today, I don't think there are very negative people out there. Now, the Qataris are against the deal and they're trying to force operation and they've come up with a ratio of 3.25. I have no idea where that number comes from or how you justify that number.</p>
          <p>But the question is, they did only own before this deal, if you look at the ratio before the announcement of the deal, what did they own of this company, of Xstrata. They held I think 2%, 2.5% before the announcement of the merger. So when the merger came, they increased their stake to 12%. What does that tell you? Do they like Xstrata? So why weren't you buying Xstrata before? What's happened with Xstrata since the announcement of the deal? That must tell you, you like the deal and that's why you're buying Xstrata. And you try and squeeze us to a better ratio to make more money on it. We cannot overpay on this asset.</p>
          <p>You've got to remember we have shareholders within Glencore, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:22:11) comes to your next question, I think 83% of the shareholders are employee shareholders within Glencore, and we don't want to dilute value. Now, if we were a company, and maybe that's what the Qataris may have contemplated, that CEOs or companies like doing deals, because it allows them to get bigger and it's great that you could be the CEO of a bigger company, or it's a bigger company, it's a great deal, let's do it. And sometimes you know when the bidding wars happen, people start over-paying.</p>
          <p>You've got remember we own this company, a big chunk of the Glencore is owned by its employees, and none of my fellow colleagues here will allow me to over-pay. No &#x2013; none of our shareholders, existing shareholders within Glencore want us to over-pay. So we're going to be very careful that we just don't over-pay on this asset, and we think 2.8 is a substantial premium. The numbers have proven it since the year with the results have occurred. You've seen it. So what the angle is &#x2013; is confusing.</p>

          <p>And to the question of export ban, shall I?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Viterra's existing business would not be impacted by export bans, because it's obviously production and exports from Canada and Australia, and I think it's the &#x2013; neither of those two countries would possibly contemplate an export ban. They don't have very large domestic markets and they certainly won't ban exports. In a way then that proves the point that the Viterra business makes our business more global and where you might have some issues from time-to-time in Russia or the Ukraine. In Canada and Australia, we're not going to have such issues.</p>
          <p>Actually for the moment, it seems that an export ban out of Russia, which would be the most likely candidate, is not very likely for the moment. And the Russian Government is being quite outspoken about saying that they're not going to ban exports. I think if the current export pace continues and if they start to eat through their exportable surplus and they get most of the way through their exportable surplus by November or December, they could possibly have to rethink. But people can see that coming and we can see that coming, and our hedge strategy &#x2013; we have taken out a heading strategy in accordance with that, and I don't anticipate a ban if it comes will have any impact on our second half results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lastly, I just had a quick question, I think, on the shareholding. At the time of the IPO, it was 83%. There was 17%, that's pre-convertible bond, which actually at current share price is back in the money. That represented sort of about 4% or 5% or so, which would take it below the 80% and even back to leverage and gearing, assuming that that convertible bond was to convert at some point. And certainly people's target pricing and expectations will assume that that does convert and that does $2.3 billion going from equity to &#x2013; from debt to equity actually makes a meaningful difference in terms of leverage ratios as well. So it's not a sensitivity out there, since the lock-up expiry in May other than the shareholders, anyone over 1% that has to disclose movements, which generally has been people buying topping up rather than selling. To the extent that smaller shareholders below that level have sold a bit due to lock-up expiry, that's not a 100% transparent. I'm sure there has been a little bit of that for tax and other reasons, but it's been fairly...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Grant Sporre from Deutsche Bank. Just could you give us an update firstly on how the Kazzinc transaction will unfold and you're increasing your stake, I see you haven't mentioned it in your presentation? And in your answer, could you just expand is it contingent upon the Xstrata deal happening and just how the dynamics around that work? And then secondly, just a small specific question, if I remember correctly, your long wet freight that has impacted your marketing on your oil division. How does that unwind? I believe it's slowly unwinding. Could you just give us an update on how that unwinds? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question on the Kazzinc transaction, it is nothing to do with Xstrata, but that transaction is being reworked. As you can imagine, the parties there needed government approval, it's number one. Number two is it was also priced at &#x2013; the shares are price at the IPO price of $5.30, not fully favorable part was cash, et cetera. So that whole transaction is being worked and re-looked at between us and the Kazakh Government, and I don't know exactly when we'll come out &#x2013; we'll come out with the statement in the near future, exactly what the final conclusion of it is, but it will be different. It will not be as much cash out, if any. So we're just restructuring that deal. Anything else we can say, Steve?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's about it. There's still &#x2013; obviously, it's still in the sort of confidential stage and there is work, but that is an area where that cash element could be significantly materially different from what the <mark type="ph" /> $2.2 billion (1:28:08) which again feeds into leverage and ratios and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:28:11) and all that sort of stuff.</p>

          <p>Yeah. And in respect to the wet freight, I don't know the exact figures. But as we said, these are winding down that position, which we had, the long position. The wet freight market hasn't got any better, but the good point is that it is winding down. I'm not exactly sure what their long tonnage is on that, but substantially reducing every month.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David Butler from Barclays. A couple of questions. You referred to major greenfield projects in your talk earlier and the risk attached to that and developing them, i.e., has your attitude to the risk of building a big greenfield project changed over the course of this year at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at all. I'd say we even got strong &#x2013; I've got stronger against greenfield projects. You don't need to be a genius here to look at every greenfield of all the major mining companies, even the newer ones, I don't want to name them. But you guys analyze us, you look at it and tell me one which has been good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I's assume you've got more invested rather than hardened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hardened, yeah. I got hardened. You don't need to be a genius. Look at every one of them. Every one of the mining companies is having problems on the existing greenfields. They're having problems with the governments in those areas. They're getting problems to getting their rights, land rights. They're getting problems getting port authorization. They're getting massive cost overruns, et cetera. The brownfield, they're just so much easier. So, as I've always said, I know some people have said to us, Glencore, you guys don't know how to <mark type="ph" /> build there. (1:30:35) I always said that's great, let someone else build them and we'll buy them a damn lot cheaper than they've spent to build them.</p>
          <p>So maybe one day when there's just no more brownfields and none of these guys can come up with a brownfield opportunity and we just looked at every brownfield, but they never go. We got that field &#x2013; as you know, look what Clinton did in the coal business. One of those we didn't have to build anything. We've got the best mines in South Africa. The Optimum Koornfontein Mines, these are mines built at &#x2013; by Billiton during the heyday, no loss of expenditure. I think you've got about three brand new drag lanes just sitting on site there where they just over-spent. We love that kind of stuff.</p>
          <p>So as long as that stuff is available, who needs to bother with greenfields? Now, maybe in 10 years' time, someone who tell me we just can't find anymore brownfields, and you got remember we have a bunch of guys who deal with how many suppliers, 1,200 suppliers. We see so many opportunities of someone wanting to sell or someone we know that that field &#x2013; that brownfield is next to one of our existing mines. There's just tons of opportunities. There is no reason to bother with a greenfield.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then the second one is you talked about attracting a higher rating. What we've seen particularly at the moment is that paying out a high dividend does exactly that, and your business seems ideally set up for that sort of approach. As your CapEx falls off aggressively next year, can we look forward to perhaps more on that side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll have to obviously look at it at that point in time, taking into account the ratings and CapEx and other opportunities of course as well. But it's certainly something that we absolutely believe in. So the conviction of the cash generating potential and recycling is certainly there. So it's obviously an option which some other sector peers don't have, so it's something we would also look at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you've also got to remember when you look at that, remember, the investors are investing alongside us, the management. Now, we are not sitting there like a lot of the other mining companies or other companies where the management and the guys running the companies just want to grow it for the sake of growing or just get bigger for the sake of managing a bigger company. I don't think any one of us around this table or all major shareholders in this company have any dream to just grow the company for the sake of growing the company. As we've always said, it's based on return on equity, et cetera. We are not going to leave cash lying around in this company where we're not getting a decent return on our equity. And if it's better to kick it out for us to put the money elsewhere, we would do it, if we really just don't see opportunities. But if there are trading opportunities to keep utilizing the funds for your working capital because you can make more money in the oil sector trading, et cetera, et cetera, then we'd leave it in. But if it's not generating right returns that we want on our equity, for sure we'll kick it out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The gain resulting from the reorganization of Xstrata at the net income level, and if that needs to be reversed if the transaction does not proceed.

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take those two questions. Thank you very much for the questions there. The tax gain on the reorganization is &#x2013; will not reverse whether the merger happens or not. So, it is an absolute, there is no contingency attached to that. It was around different holding companies and the like, in preparation potentially, but that's a permanent and largely in our Swiss entities. So there is no reversal there under any scenarios.</p>
          <p>In terms of leverage, I would say consistent. We would look to the sort of cash flow, debt, net debt, FFO type net debt targets, which although it's not exclusively the domain of how both major agencies looking at things, that is the one that tends to get the highest weighting reading through their reports. They've got slightly different calculations of what they put in and out and pre and post FFO and dividends and the like. But we know the targets and we've even historically &#x2013; for those that have followed us on the credit side, we would look to target ratios FFO, net debt certainly in excess of 20% and hopefully more around the mid-20%s or so, and which in turn should hopefully preserve our status in the mid-BBB space.</p>

          <p>And with respect to coal &#x2013; the met coal side, there has been no performance issues. With respect to the thermal-coal side, we do have some delays from the Chinese price majeure, if you wanted to call it that, in view of the weaker domestic price. There is still performance. It's not the same as what we saw during the global financial crisis. As I mentioned earlier to the first question, we do see an increase of Chinese imports. But as I said, they are price sensitive; there has been push-back or delays. It's one of the reasons I think you'll see a weaker sport market. We expect a slight improvement going forward particularly in the winter build up. Traditionally, you have that &#x2013; the weaker months of June, July, August, but yes there has been &#x2013; with the Indians and the Chinese in particular.</p>

          <p>Just one for Clinton. Based on the current developments in South Africa and your presentation, how do you see sort of the whole sort of union process down there, I guess the viability of South Africa as a mining investment option? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Obviously, what happened in South Africa is very tragic and unfortunate, and we obviously are monitoring it very closely. We are in constant communication with both the unions and government and our employees. I think to a lesser extent coal is more mechanized. To a greater extent, it's more mechanized and less, let's say, employees per ton ratio. And in lot of our mines, our employees are shareholders through various share incentive schemes. A lot of them are fully funded. So while we can't sit here and say we're completely protected, we do believe that it was an isolated incident and hopefully it does not occur in the coal sector. So obviously saying that we watch very closely, but as long as we're maintaining good communications with our employees and our unions, we hope that something like that does not reoccur in the other mining &#x2013; in other areas of the mining sector.</p>
