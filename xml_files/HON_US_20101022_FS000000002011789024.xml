          <p>Thank you, Lori. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson. This call and web cast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Results can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light.</p>
          <p>This morning we will review our financial results for the third quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, as well as share with you a preliminary framework for 2011 and of course we will allow time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Elena, and good morning, everyone. It's great to report another terrific quarter for Honeywell with revenues, earnings, and cash ahead of expectations and great execution across our businesses. Sales were $8.4 billion, up 9% reported and organic, great sales growth with continued growth in new products, geographic expansion and continued momentum across our</p>
          <p>businesses. We generated EPS of $0.64 including covering $0.06 of higher tax rate year-over-year, $0.03 of Sperian dilution, and $0.18 pension expense in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, that is excluding those items, our operating earnings were $0.91, up about 10% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our segment margin rate was 14.2%, up 40 basis points from prior year, reinforcing the quality of our earnings performance and continued cost discipline, more than offsetting the labor-related</p>
          <p>headwinds we had. Further reflecting earnings quality, we generated exceptional free cash flow of $1.2 billion representing over 200% free cash flow conversion. Having generated 2.8 billion free cash flow year-to-date, we are very confident in our cash performance and are raising our free</p>
          <p>cash flow guidance to approximately 3.5 billion for the full year, which includes a planned $600 million voluntary cash pre-funding to our U.S. pension plan in the fourth quarter. You'll recall we contributed approximately 400 million of stock to the plan year-to-date. Given our strong cash flow and the decline in interest rates we've seen throughout the year, we think doing more pre-funding is smart, and we would expect to fund the plan as needed with cash going forward.</p>
          <p>So given the strength of our year-to-date financial performance and continued strong momentum, we are raising our full-year guidance. We now expect sales above the high end of our previous range, or 33 billion, and earnings of approximately 2.52 a share, above the previous high end of 2.50. So despite the temperate economic landscape, we see a continued upward trend in our orders rates across all segments, demonstrating our robust focus on new products and services, our great positions in good industries, and investments in global expansion.</p>
          <p>While we've seen the biggest improvement in our early cycle businesses, namely Turbo and Industrial businesses, we're not seeing an uptick in aerospace's commercial aftermarket. What's also impressive are the long cycle orders growth rates, which we think of as the ACS Solutions businesses UOP and Commercial Aero OE. Book-to-bill rates are above 1 and strengthening, with strong double digit increases across the group. Seed planting is something we talk a lot about and the growth we've seen in our ends market is being complemented by the benefits of our seed planting initiatives. We're excited about the acquisitions we closed in the quarter: Sperian Protection, a leader in personal protection equipment design and manufacturing; and E-Mon, the market leader in electric submetering, an important component in commercial energy efficiency programs and the smart grid.</p>
          <p>We continue to make traction with our latest innovation that improve aircraft safety with our Smart Path precision landing system and Smart View synthetic vision system. Honeywell has been selected by Brazil's Air Traffic Control to install the Smart Path system, which is the first and only system to receive the FAA's design approval. We're also merging our Smart View synthetic vision system with enhanced infrared imaging, bringing unprecedented situational awareness at night and in low visibility conditions. The integration of this blended technology is new, and we are ahead of our competition here with lots of upgrade opportunities to vastly improve take-off and landing minimums and increase safety of operations.</p>
          <p>Our investments and focus in emerging regions are also really paying off. Sales in Asia-Pacific were up strongly, up 21%, reflecting good growth across the portfolio in China, up 28, and also growth in India, 34%, Japan and Korea. We continue to build on our platforms for growth, as evidenced by the number of wins in Aerospace and Process Solutions in the quarter. There were a number of important emerging region wins in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Honeywell Building Solutions signed an energy savings performance contract, or ESPC, with Dongguan Crystal Textiles to help reduce energy consumption in its manufacturing processes, as well as reduce a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions over the next five years. This marks both an important win for Honeywell in the region and supports China's focus on both energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030. Additionally, Process Solutions, with orders up strongly this year, continues to win exciting new projects in the emerging regions. One in Qatar, where the business was selected by Dolphin Energy to upgrade its interesting Sperian system in its largest gas processing plant. HPS also entered into Phase 2 of the impressive Shah gas development project valued at an additional 78 million. HPS is leveraging its full technology portfolio to help these sites operate safely, reliably, and efficiently.</p>
          <p>And we continue to invest in our big process initiatives as well as other seed planting across the organization. Our Velocity Product Development initiative helps to bring new products that customers want to market faster and the organization is delivering over 450 new products this year so far.</p>
          <p>The company is delivering better than expected P&amp;L and cash flow benefits from our accelerated deployment of the Honeywell Operating System, as reflected by the impressive working capital turns and margin expansion we're experiencing this year. Across the company, we are expecting an acceleration of Bronze sites, adding approximately 50 new sites next year.</p>
          <p>So in summary, another better than expected quarter and strong year-to-date performance, demonstrating Honeywell's ability to execute both commercially and operationally and invest in future growth.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn it over to Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks, Dave. Let's turn to slide 4. Let me start by taking you through the summary financial results for the quarter and just add some more color to the highlights that Dave provided to you.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 4, we're seeing continued momentum in our businesses, reflected in better than anticipated performance. Recorded sales were up 9% to 8.4 billion, reflecting continued double digit growth in emerging regions with sales up nearly 20% in those markets. We also saw greater than expected organic growth in the U.S. and Europe, which were up 10% and 6%, respectively. And as you can see, net foreign exchange and M&amp;A really didn't impact the sales this quarter.</p>
          <p>The company had strong operating leverage growing segment profit by 12% and segment margins 40 basis points to 14.2%, overcoming the absorption of approximately 200 million of labor-related cost headwinds resulting from actions taken last year that did not repeat this year. And it's important for you to recall that we had significant structural cost takeout in 2009, but we also had policy items, including foregoing pay increases, reduced incentive compensation, and also work schedule reductions and furloughs. Most of those do not repeat or come back in the form of expense this year.</p>
          <p>Net income for the quarter declined 18%. However, up 1% when you exclude the impact of pension expense from both '09 and 0'10. EPS was down on a reported basis 20% but, as Dave said, includes the absorption of $0.03 of Sperian dilution in the quarter and also $0.06 of higher year-over-year tax rate. And you'll recall that we guided to that higher tax rate. Therefore, operational earnings were up 10% when you exclude these items.</p>
          <p>Couple other items which are probably worth pointing out in the quarter, free cash flow very strong. We generated 1.2 billion of free cash flow, bringing year to date to 2.8 billion. This stronger than anticipated cash performance reflects higher cash earnings, record working capital turns, which are helping to offset the impact of higher sales, and the benefit of also of increased customer advances, which is reflective of the growth that we're experiencing in our long cycle businesses. While not reported in external working capital, these increasing advances are clearly a positive in terms of our cash flow. And in summary, a very high quality earnings story for the quarter and a high quality cash story as well.</p>
          <p>With that, let's go to slide number 5 and give you some perspective on the quarter and some of the items that were, if you will, one-time in the quarter. If you start at the top of the page, you can see operating earnings were better than anticipated, as the company benefited from higher sales and strong sales conversion. And as you can see, by the way, we're walking from our 2Q 2010, or second quarter 2010 earnings, of $0.60 actual on both sides of the slide. On the left side, we've laid out the guidance we gave to you in July, and on the right side, we've mirrored our actual performance relative to that guidance.</p>
          <p>So again, starting at the top of the page, you can see operating earnings were better than anticipated, as the company benefited from higher sales as well as strong sales conversion. The higher operating earnings were partially offset by the higher 29.5% tax rate that I mentioned earlier and that we guided to in the quarter. With the closing of the Sperian transaction on September 15th, we had $0.03 of dilution related to M&amp;A fees, as well as Sperian repositioning expense in the quarter, both of which are recorded both below the line. Now, the ACS segment performance also included a minimal amount of purchase accounting impact net of operational results for Sperian.</p>
          <p>Moving down the page, we had a $62 million gain triggered by the consolidation of the Specialty Materials joint venture. We offset that gain by funding new repositioning projects that will benefit 2011. We are able to take an additional 54 million of net repositioning. When you include Sperian's 18 million, that takes total repositioning in the quarter to 72 million. Therefore, when you take into account all the pluses and minuses, we absorbed $0.03 below the line headwinds quarter-over-quarter which are really represented by the Sperian dilution. So the $0.64 of EPS recorded reflects a clear beat in a much stronger quarter than we anticipated, again driven by stronger operating performance.</p>
          <p>With that perspective, let's go to slide 6 on the HON update. Given the strong performance in the quarter in spite of continued economic uncertainty that characterizes the global economy, we thought it'd be helpful just to spend a few minutes updating you on our view of all of our key markets. On Aerospace, our assumptions for 2010 remain largely intact, reflecting a strong uptick in global flying hours. Flight hours were up 6.7% in the quarter, and we're seeing that effect on higher utilization rates, and that translates into an uptick in commercial spares activity.</p>
          <p>R&amp;O for ATR is also starting to rebound for the Air Transport business, gaining momentum as we end the year. Now, Business Aviation is benefiting from improved flight hours as well as successful upgrades and modifications of the existing fleet. Given the strong third quarter improvement, we're now anticipating global flying hours to be up 5% for the full year 2010, and we expect growth in the commercial aftermarket Aerospace to outpace flying hours in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Defense &amp; Space, just a couple points there. The starting point is one of course we've been saying for some time, which is the outlook for the overall market for Defense obviously remains uncertain. Now, despite that, our business has performed well. It's stable, and it's somewhat cushioned by its broad customer base, and its broad product platform and diversity. We anticipate the usual uptick in D&amp;S in the fourth quarter, and so we anticipate for Defense to be up sequentially as well as year-over-year positive in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In ACS, we're highly encouraged by the early cycle nature of the portfolio and the performance demonstrated by the industrial businesses of ACS. We saw above market organic growth in nearly all segments, which we believe is largely attributable to the strength of Honeywell's franchises and obviously the investment we've made in new products through the downturn. We expect the short cycle products growth rates to begin to moderate, due to tougher comps, while the stronger order rates we've seen in the long cycle businesses, ACS Solutions as well as the UOP portion of Specialty Materials, to be reflected in higher sales growth in 2011.</p>
          <p>So looking across ACS and Specialty Materials, while the macro indicators for residential and commercial end markets remain weak, both of those businesses are performing very well. Specifically, our new products penetration rate and the expansion in new markets is contributing to the growth that we're seeing in ACS and SM, and we expect that to continue. Now, clearly, as Dave cited, and as I've referenced, the emerging region investments and expansion are paying off handsomely for Honeywell. They're an important driver of growth. China and India, in particular, of course, have been less impacted by the economic challenges, and we're seeing strong double digit growth in those markets.</p>
          <p>Global energy demand continues to rise with the most rapid growth expected to occur in UOP and Process Solutions where we've won a number of new projects. Honeywell is clearly at the forefront of new infrastructure and capacity additions in both the refining and natural gas industries globally. Looking at Turbo, the first half macro environment was great. We continued to see strong orders in the third quarter, better than expected diesel penetration, a condensed summer shutdown schedule in Europe, which created production rates higher than we anticipated. Turbo will continue to benefit from its leading industry position and market share wins and is projected to continue to outpace European light vehicle production again in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, let's now turn to our business results for the third quarter starting with Aerospace on slide 7. Aerospace sales up 3% in the quarter, reflecting much anticipated recovery in the long cycle business of Aero with higher commercial sales volumes, as well as Defense services volume. Segment profit for Aero grew 1% with margins down 40 basis points to 17%. If you exclude the impact of payments in the quarter to business aviation manufacturers to offset preproduction costs, these are due to obviously the significant contract wins we've had, Aerospace sales would have been up 4%, segment profit up 5%. Organic profit, segment profit growth, reflects the execution of growth as well as pricing initiatives in Aero, the benefits from prior period restructuring and productivity actions, which are offsetting the material inflation and again the absence of labor cost actions taken last year that were not repeated this year.</p>
          <p>Overall, the Aero team has done a terrific job forecasting and calling this year's inflection points with things playing out as expected in the quarter. Now, total commercial sales, that is the sum of Air Transport and Business Aviation, were up 5% in the quarter. Commercial OE sales were up 5% driven by increased Air Transport and Business Aviation OE deliveries. The commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%, up 7% sequentially, reflecting higher aircraft utilization rates that I referenced earlier.</p>
          <p>So a couple of the details on Aerospace, first, ATR's OE sales were up 2% in line with delivery schedules at Boeing and Airbus and improved demand at Embraer. The Business Aviation OE sales were up 11%, recovering off a very low base in 2009, and growth in the quarter was partially offset by the impact of Business Aviation OE payments.</p>
          <p>Turning to the commercial aftermarket, the 6% growth we saw in the quarter was driven by a significant uptick in spares activity, up 20% year-over-year off the depressed 2009 levels. Looking at the again, at ATR, the aftermarket was up 4% compared to flight hour growth of 7%. Spares were up strongly, up 13%, outpacing the blended R&amp;O growth across Mechanical and our Electronics portfolio. Now spares and R&amp;O activity combined are expected to be higher in the fourth quarter, driven by continued flight hour improvements as evidenced by the strong receipts we're seeing into our R&amp;O centers, as well as the continuation of relatively robust spares orders. I'll take you through some more color on the ATR aftermarket on the next slide, but overall we're encouraged by performance we saw in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The Business Aviation market also benefited from improved flying hours with sales up 10% reflecting a strong uptick in spares and higher repairs and upgrades. Defense &amp; Space sales, as I said, were up 1% in the quarter. We had good growth in international and government, which partially offset &#x2013; which was partially offset by the continued ramp down in the TIGER program. And again, we've seen the impact of project delays moderately affect revenues in 2010, but the business is stable given its diverse customer base and platform exposure.</p>
          <p>So in summary for Aero, things are performing as expected across the portfolio, with commercial aftermarket up for the first time since the downturn began. OE is on track to grow with increased air production rates. E&amp;S is stable preparing the budgetary pressures &#x2013; preparing for budgetary pressures and also realigning their resources on growth-oriented programs.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 8, just a couple more details on Aero given the significance of the aftermarket and what we're seeing. Looking at the top left graph on slide 8, you can see that the spares and R&amp;O revenue growth year-over-year versus global flight hours. Now, as we've previously discussed, the Aero aftermarket saw significant destocking and decoupling from flight hours in GDP in 2009 and early 2010. To put it in perspective, during the cycle we saw a one year of sharp inventory and spares decline versus multiple years of past &#x2013; that it's taken to get to that same level in past downturns. We also anticipate the recovery from that downturn to evolve over a more protracted period. From the chart, you can see recovering spares as a function of the end-of-destocking as we transition to recoupling our aftermarket growth to be in line with flying hours.</p>
          <p>R&amp;O, which accounts for about two-thirds of the aftermarket, tracks more closely to global flying hours; and although it's been down, it didn't decline to the extent that spares declined. We're also now seeing R&amp;O recouple the flight hours, and on a combined basis, we expect the fourth quarter Air Traffic aftermarket revenues to be up approximately 2X the growth in flight hours and then to recouple in 2011.</p>
          <p>If you look at flight hours on the bottom left of the same slide, slide number 8, you can see the recent history of global flight hours along with the forecast for 0'11. What's interesting, of course, is following the downturn in '09, we're already seeing the absolute level of flight hours above the prior peak of 2008, partly as a function of robust delivery schedules, as well as the increased utilization of the existing fleet. We now anticipate a 5% increase in 2010 over 2009, and we're looking forward to 2011. We're estimating about 4% to 6% increase next year. So as you can see from the chart, new aircraft deliveries, coupled with additional fleet utilization, will be partially offset by continued retirements of older aircraft.</p>
          <p>So this sets the stage for initial planning for Aero as we look forward to 2011. We're expecting the inventory, the flight hour ratio to stabilize in 2011, so aftermarket growth will be more consistent with historic levels.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at slide number 9, talk about ACS for the quarter. Revenues for ACS were at 9%, 8% organic. We had growth in both Products and Solutions businesses in the quarter. Segment margin was up 10 basis points to 13.6%, again demonstrating favorable Products performance and strong commercial excellence, in addition to continued good cost controls and the benefits from prior period repositioning. These benefits, as with the other businesses, were impacted by the headwinds from the absence of prior year labor cost actions that were not repeated, as well as the diluted impact, as we referenced earlier, in the quarter with M&amp;A. Now, the Products businesses for ACS were up 10% in the quarter, 9% organic, reflecting top tier performance in their respective markets. The businesses linked to the industrial production cycle saw both orders and sales growth supported by increases in manufacturing production, as well as the favorable impact of increased safety regulations.</p>
          <p>China and India led growth in Asia-Pac, China up 26%, India up 49%, respectively. And despite continued weakness in commercial construction end markets, we're actually seeing that segment of the ACS business hold up well, with moderate growth driven by the uptake of new products across the businesses as well as customer expansion. The Solutions businesses for ACS were up 7% in the quarter, driven by storage growth in Building Solutions, Energy Efficiency, and Demand Response. Process Solutions reflected modest organic growth in the quarter. With this year's strong order rates, their backlog, that is the Process Solutions backlog, is up 20% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Now, ACS segment profit up 9% again reflected strong operating leverage despite absorbing this year's labor cost headwind, and the acquisition dilution. Another great result by the ACS team, who continues to execute on commercial excellence including a robust new product pipeline, international expansion, and the addition, of course, of attractive acquisitions.</p>
          <p>On the subject of attractive acquisitions, I'd like to just give you a quick update on Sperian on slide number 10. We're obviously excited by the significant growth and the significant synergy potential combining Sperian with the company's Life Safety Norcross business to create the clear number 1 in the personal protection equipment industry. We're further building upon ACS's robust integration process and proven M&amp;A track record. And early indications from the integration team reinforce the attractiveness of this acquisition.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look at Sperian's mid-year performance and the outlook for 2010 which is slightly ahead of the original modeling assumptions, the headline purchase price is now about 10.8 times the estimated 2010 EBITDA. For planning purposes, we think the multiple looks more like 6 times when you include our initial estimates of run-rate synergies. When you look at the track record of ACS and Honeywell, the kind of synergies we're talking about, this is what we've been able to achieve in a number of prior transactions, and we're very confident that we can deliver at this level. We anticipate the transaction to be accretive in 0'11 and will further demonstrate Honeywell's disciplined and robust acquisition track record. So on a net purchase basis, we're paying what looks like mid single digits EBITDA for a very attractive growing business and a nice addition to the Honeywell portfolio.</p>
          <p>With that background, let's turn to slide 11 on Transportation Systems. Overall TS sales were up an impressive 19% ahead of expectations. Segment margins increased 460 basis points to 11.7% and, as you can see, the negative impact of foreign currency, about 5 percentage points, was more than offset by the strong volume in the quarter. Turbo was up 25% in the third quarter, reflecting favorable macro trends with higher sales to both commercial and light vehicle manufacturers.</p>
          <p>We saw another quarter of strong diesel penetration. In fact, diesel penetration was up 10 points year-over-year and the benefit of Turbo's robust new platform launches. The summer shutdown in Europe, as I mentioned earlier, had a less dramatic effect than we anticipated and allowed for increased EU light vehicle volume. Now, while European production rates continue to be stronger than expected due to higher exports and some inventory restocking, we'll continue to closely monitor the decline in light vehicle sales in that region. That said, we anticipate fourth quarter Turbo volumes to outpace production rates with higher diesel penetration and continued traction on new launches.</p>
          <p>In the Consumer Products business, sales were up 3% with growth in a number of our automotive brands including FRAM and Autolite. Overall for Transportation Systems, segment profit was up 60 million or 97% in the quarter, primarily due to Turbo's volumes, cost productivity, and also the benefits from prior period restructuring; and, again, partially offset by material inflation and the absence of last year's large labor cost actions that we mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Let's look now to slide number 12 and finish off the business segment highlights by focusing on Specialty Materials, which also had a terrific quarter with sales up 16%, segment profit up 25%, taking their margins to 16.5%. Now, sales at UOP were up 4% with growth in projects revenues more than offsetting lower catalyst sales due to project mix and timing. Overall UOP is seeing markets stabilize and a growing pipeline of growing energy projects with healthy orders rates and a book-to-bill now greater than 1. As always, though, there will be variability quarter-to-quarter in catalyst shipments for UOP and, of course, the mix of licensing revenue, which is difficult to predict. Beginning this quarter, we will also reflect the Resins &amp; Chemicals business, Flourines and Specialty Products.</p>
          <p>As Advanced Materials, those businesses on a combined basis were up 22%. Revenues across the group were up strong double digits in the quarter. Resins &amp; Chemicals were up 28% on robust Asia sales and tight industry supply dynamics. Flourines were up &#x2013; revenues were up 18%, driven by commercial excellence, continued strong demand for refrigerants in industrial applications. Specialty Products once again had an impressive quarter, up 22%, with above market growth led by the penetration of new introductions in specialty additives, advanced fibers, and industrial products.</p>
          <p>As you can see, segment profit for Specialty Materials up 25% to 194 million in the quarter. Margins were up 130 basis points <mark type="inaudible" /> to 16.5% on higher sales including new products, strong commercial and plant performance, and continued cost discipline. Again, gains were partially offset by material inflation and the absence of last year's labor cost actions. Overall, again, another great quarter for Specialty Materials.</p>
          <p>So given that preview or that review, rather, of the business segments and the quarterly performance, let's now take a preview, look at slide 13 for what we're looking for in terms of the fourth quarter. We're planning for total sales for Honeywell, as you can see, in the take away to be about 8.8 billion. That's up 9% from the prior year, reflecting continued good organic growth and we're anticipating EPS of approximately $0.78. We anticipate Aero sales to be about 2.8 billion, up about 5% on a year-over-year basis, up 3% sequentially, reflecting again the uptick in the commercial aftermarket activity that we referenced, some rebound in Business Aviation OE and a seasonally stronger fourth quarter in the Defense &amp; Space business.</p>
          <p>ACS, we're expecting revenues of about 3.8 billion, extending the positive momentum from the first three quarters with continued organic growth across the ACS portfolio. Again, the execution of Energy Efficiency projects and the favorable benefit of Sperian and the Matrikon acquisitions will also contribute to the fourth quarter for ACS. Transportation Systems, we estimate sales about 1 billion. And again, while the European light vehicle production has continued strong, we're expecting rates &#x2013; growth rates to be down year-over-year as we transition to a realignment to light vehicle sales in the region. Lower production rates will be more than offset by higher diesel penetration, and we're expecting to end the year at diesel penetration, end the year at about 58% in Europe and, of course, we'll also have the benefit in Honeywell of all of our successful new launches.</p>
          <p>At Specialty Materials, we anticipate about 1.2 billion in sales in the quarter with growth driven by healthy end markets in Advanced Materials, robust growth out of Asia in Resins &amp; Chemicals and commercialization of new products, partially offset by a seasonally weaker quarter in Flourines. We are also expecting improved growth in UOP, driven by projects growth which is a mix of higher equipment as well as licensing revenues. And finally, although not reflected on our page, our fourth quarter guidance reflects the continuation of tougher again year-over-year comps due to the impact of labor cost actions that we took last year. Again, as a reminder, we're absorbing this year in total, 2010 in total, about $600 million of labor headwinds in 2010 compared to 2009 and about two-thirds of that $600 million is weighted to the second half of the year. So the fourth quarter will also be influenced by that.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we now expect sales for 2010 of about 33 billion, earnings per share of $2.52 and, as Dave mentioned, we're increasing our cash flow guidance. Previously, we were at 3.1 to 3.3. We're increasing that to 3.5 billion, which is a function of higher cash earnings, terrific working capital performance, and the benefit of increased customer advances. And importantly, this revised guidance also includes the planned $600 million cash pension contribution in the fourth quarter that was not previously contemplated in our guidance.</p>
          <p>So with that, let's turn now to the discussion of 2011, the preliminary planning framework just to continue to update you on our thinking for 2011. Obviously given the continued uncertainty in the macro environment, we'll continue to take a relatively conservative approach in our planning. We're still in the early stages. We believe, however, we're well positioned for good growth next year. Given the improvement we're seeing in our major end markets and the strength of our execution, and I think both of those are clearly evident in our third quarter results and our fourth quarter outlook. While growth in our short cycle businesses, such as Turbo and General Industrial Products, is expected to moderate, the strong orders trends in the long cycle businesses will be reflected in higher sales growth in 2011. And again, while it's still early, I think it's reasonable to anticipate approximately 5% plus recorded topline sales growth for Honeywell in 2011 over the expected 2010 sales of 33 billion.</p>
          <p>Currency of course, foreign exchange, will obviously be an influence here and would impact the year-over-year bead. We also have a path we believe to double digit segment profit growth for 2011. We anticipate some favorable mix, driven by better commercial aftermarket versus OE sales growth in Aero and also continued improvement in Turbo, both of which are high margin contributors for Honeywell. We expect our robust pipeline of new products and technologies to continue to drive incremental organic growth as well as margin expansion.</p>
          <p>The Honeywell Operating System that Dave referenced earlier and the momentum that we're clearly demonstrating there will generate incremental productivity gains next year via accelerated site deployments, driving lower overall plant conversion costs. In addition, we expect year-over-year repositioning benefits from the actions that we've been able to fund across the organization. Importantly, $135 million in year-to-date funding to generate approximately 150 million in incremental operating income benefit in 2011.</p>
          <p>Turning to pension, with our current accounting, the expense is going to be a significant headwind for 2011 with interest rates declining approximately 100 basis points from where we ended last year. So if we froze the discount rates at the current levels, it'd be about 4.75%, hard to believe. And if we had assumed currently assumed planned returns, which would be in line with our year-to-date performance low double digits, about 11%, we would expect a pension expense headwind of approximately $350 to $400 million in 2011, compared to 2010 estimated pension expense of approximately 800 million. Now, if you assume interest rates stayed relatively flat in 2012 (sic) [2011] and we finished the year at let's say around 5% in terms of discount rate, you'd see an approximately 300 million tailwind in pension expense beginning in 2012.</p>
          <p>A couple of points further on pension about funding, first, for 2010, as we've said, voluntary contributions to the U.S. pension plan, we now anticipate totaling about $1 billion, 400 million in stock, and a planned 600 million cash contribution in the fourth quarter. For 2011, as we look at the latest estimates of the funded status of the plan and prevailing low discount rates, we're evaluating the merits of additional voluntary pre-funding in 2011 and it's reasonable to assume that we'll make additional cash contributions to the U.S. pension plan in 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, other than pension, we expect all other below the line expenses to be slightly below 2010 levels. I'm going to take a minute now just to refresh you on our 2010 assumptions. Repositioning and other costs, including asbestos and environmental, are estimated at approximately 570 million in 2010. Part of that includes the funding of an additional 100 million of repositioning offset by one-time gains this year.</p>
          <p>We expect continued excellent cash generation in 2011, converting cash at greater than 100%. Our priority for capital allocation in the near term remains further business investments, the pension pre-funding that we talked about, and our continued focus on growth and balance sheet flexibility. And of course, we'll continue to be very focused as well as very disciplined on the M&amp;A front. So while some things are too early to call, our preliminary framework for 2011 we think looks quite positive on the operational side. We look forward to sharing with you the details in our guidance call scheduled for December 15th. As always, we plan to take you through all our major assumptions and build up the numbers business by business at that time.</p>
          <p>So before turning it back to Elena and for Q&amp;A, let me just a couple points in summary on slide number 15. Obviously, we had another terrific quarter reflecting continued momentum across the portfolio. We saw positive upward trends in revenues, in segment profitability, but important sustaining continued upward trends in orders across all of our segments with the biggest improvements in Transportation Systems, Specialty Materials, and ACS. The company demonstrated strong growth, operating leverage, and obviously generated a lot of cash.</p>
          <p>2010 is shaping up nicely with good organic growth across all the segments. We're encouraged by the rate of improvement and the uptick in commercial Aerospace aftermarket orders, reflecting spares orders above utilization rates, general industrial recovery, our emerging market positioning continue to be bright spots fueling strong double digit growth. Turbo will benefit from their strong industry position and new launches; however, growth will be at a slower pace obviously going forward, given the projected decline in OEM production schedules. And reflecting this performance, we've raised our sales, earnings and cash flow outlook for the year. Now, we remain cautious in our initial planning for 2011 in light of continued mixed economic signals, but we anticipate the strength overall of 2010 to maintain in 2011.</p>
          <p>We've highlighted through today's review the results from our seed planting initiatives. We continue to invest in new products and services, our global footprint and the key process initiatives which are significantly paying off for the company. We're seeing the results show up in orders and sales, new product wins, and share gains, and the continued evolution of our technology portfolio. As a result, we expect good organic growth, double digit operating earnings growth in 0'11, and we look forward to providing you the details and color by segment in December.</p>
          <p>So with that, Elena, I'll turn it back over to you for Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wonder if you could provide a little bit more elaboration on just how you see the spares dynamic playing through this normalization process. In other words, it sounds like your '11 forecast for flight hours is about 5%, and it sounds like you expect the spares to be around that number. But do we have a period above trend before we come down and normalize? Any insight on how the orders are playing out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's tough to predict. As you know, I'm a believer that at some point, spares will outdistance flight hours just because they were so far below flight hours over a period of time, and you can only destock for so long. The difficulty is it's really an amorphous blob when you look at trying to understand airline inventory. And it's tough to predict exactly when that'll happen. My belief is it happens sometime in 2011, and we see it start to out distance. We've seen some evidence of that in this fourth quarter already, but not as robust I think as it could be. Difficulty is predicting when does that happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have the current numbers on a book-to-bill basis or something like that that sheds a little light?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what we could say, it's a pretty fast turn business, Jeff, as you probably know. So we really don't look at a book-to-bill. But if you look at the spares revenues, and I think I mentioned this, the ATR spares revenues were up 13% in the quarter, up 5% sequentially. If you look at the DGA spares, those were up 37% in the quarter, up 6% sequentially. Now, for ATR, what we expect in the fourth quarter is continuation of that strengthening. In fact, we expect even stronger performance on the ATR side of the business in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So the other positive thing, as we talked about, is that R&amp;O is now increasing. It's now growing. And given that that's two-thirds of our ATR aftermarket, that's very significant. And we would expect again in the fourth quarter, the total ATR aftermarket to grow at double the rate of flight hour growth. Now, we expect recoupling to begin. We could see some continued favorability, that is spares and R&amp;O combined, outpacing flight hours during the early part of 0'11. But we expect overall for 0'11 a recoupling that is, if you will, a linear relationship more like the historic relationship between revenue growth in our aftermarket &#x2013; commercial aftermarket &#x2013; and global flying hours. Is that helpful?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Steve, I just want to know, are you ready to eat that headline that you wrote a while back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, if you really recall that headline, it said that the pension fund &#x2013; it depended upon cost synergies, right, being realized. So I am looking forward to hearing the cost synergies reported, and if you achieved what you promised, then I by all means will be happy to say it was a good deal. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Steve, couldn't resist.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's okay. Although, once again, I wasn't ready for it. So let me &#x2013; I'm tempted to ask a harder question, but let me just stick with the first one's around ACS margins again, okay, and the sustainability and how you're achieving those margins going forward and why we can have confidence that this is not a short-term phenomenon around, say, pricing pressures, material, and wage inflation, those sorts of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it absolutely is sustainable, and what you're starting to see is the result of years of efforts. It's not something that you do overnight, and it goes back to having great positions in good industries, making sure that we are doing a good job on understanding commercially what's going on, the new products, the new services that we're introducing, the focus that we've had on organization efficiency, the OES that we've talked about before, the indirect management. I mean, it's all of those things. You start working on them. You don't see the results right away, but once you get the trend going, if you will, get the inertia moving in a different direction, it's really pretty darn good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the other thing, Dave, maybe just to add to that is two things I think in the quarter that, Steve, hopefully also gives support to Dave's comments. One is I mentioned as I went through the material is the impact obviously of the Sperian acquisition. And we're always going to be doing acquisitions, et cetera, but the fact of the matter, this was fairly significant in terms of its dilutive impact. If you adjusted for M&amp;A, just take that out of the equation and look at the operating performance, ACS was up 40 basis points in margin in the quarter, despite the fact that it absorbed an important portion of that $200 million of labor cost headwind on a year-over-year basis. So operating performance was very good.</p>
          <p>It masked the fact that ACS in the quarter had very good productivity, and all the things &#x2013; all the attributes if you did the walk in terms of margin rate, all the things that you would want to go right did go right for ACS in the quarter. So it really is those two factors that influenced it. And to Dave's point, the underlying fundamentals are just getting stronger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The commercial excellence element of ACS, the success rate of new products, what we're doing importantly in terms of the rate of growth that they're experiencing in both the traditional &#x2013; their traditional markets, Steve, as well as in emerging markets, all of that are going to support margin expansion for ACS over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And are there any labor &#x2013; additional labor headwinds into 2011, particularly in ACS, or are we finished after -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we'll be done. We'll be done as of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then can you just expand a little bit on pricing experience in ACS at least? What are you seeing? Are you seeing additional pressure at all coming to bear? Are you anticipating it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, probably one of the only businesses that you have in your entire portfolio that is secularly challenged is Defense, and I guess my question is, Dave, is how do you prepare for this? You know you're walking into Defense budgets likely the next let's say five years that are relatively flattish or slightly up. Can you right-size? I mean, is there a way to right-size or restructure this business appropriately where you can still grow operating profit in a flattish environment, or is this just something that you just have to get past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think flattish could be a very good outcome and we're going to plan for it to be worse than that. I think that's a smart thing to do. And, yes, you can restructure. You can also make sure that you built your capability in the places that are going to do well, and I think over time we will continue to see BGA bounce back, our business jets bounce back, and on the large commercial, that'll bounce back. But I think the smart thing to do when you're thinking about Defense is to assume that it's going to &#x2013; flat would be good, and that's &#x2013; that's the way we're going to think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you can right-size to that type of demand? Is that what you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got it. I know, Dave, you've talked about seed planting for a lot of years and I think it's fairly evident that from last cycle to this cycle that there's a fairly substantial difference in the Honeywell product line. But how do you benchmark yourself versus peers and have a &#x2013; and get a better sense or at least provide a better sense to us on whether you're out growing your markets? And I know you're in lots of different markets, so just how do you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we look at that with every one of our businesses, and as I think I've said before, I don't get too cranked up over market share, because I'm always concerned that you do well in market share by defining the denominator, and that causes people to not be as thoughtful as they could be. And what we tend to do is look at the overall versus the industry generally, and I think when you take a look at our revenue growth, for example this quarter, versus peers, I think you'd have to say we've done pretty darn well and it's a good reflection that what we're doing is working. And what we want to do is just make sure we're growing sales faster than everybody else. Now, there are some who still are a little bit better, but overall I think we're doing pretty well there.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Specialty Materials doesn't get the focus it sometimes should. I went to the meeting you guys had out there, and I came away thinking that the growth could be better than your long-term guidance, certainly the margins this quarter are suggestive of higher margins than maybe your longer term guidance suggested. Could you give us maybe an update on the perspective there in Specialty Materials in terms of growth and potential profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The prospects for growth in that business are huge, and going back to where we were seven or eight years ago, Bob, I'm sure you remember, we kept saying it's a bifurcated portfolio, and we needed to extract ourselves from a bunch of places, actually about 40%, and build on the remainder. We've done that, and I'm excited about the prospects in that business, both for sales growth and margin growth, and I'd say Andreas and his team are doing a very nice job of focusing that business on all the places they can grow. So I'm not going to put any numbers on it, like I never do, but I like it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. This is quite the softball quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We like those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm sure you do. So Dave Anderson, I want to just be clear. These headwinds that you're describing from labor costs, is that &#x2013; is this that you saved the 600 million last year or you spent to downsize and you're not &#x2013; I'm just &#x2013; can you just maybe explain a little bit more granularly what this actually is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. What we did last year, John, is forego the normal what you would call merit or salary increases, pay increases, last year in light of the recession. We cut back significantly on incentive compensation, and we had a number of work schedule reductions/ furloughs. So in combination, the total, if you will, policy-related labor cost actions that we took in light of the 15% revenue decline that we experienced last year totaled about $600 million when you compare either the non-repeat of those actions. For example, work schedule reductions or furloughs not happening, were not happening to the same degree this year. The reinstatement of merit or salary increases toward the latter part of this year, as well as accruing now at more normal rates, historic levels, or near historic levels in terms of incentive compensation, the combination of those three represent the headwinds that I mentioned to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm assuming this is a net number, meaning that you probably were still paying for some downsizing last year. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember, when we went through our cost actions, over $900 million of cost actions, we had a significant portion that were structural, costs that came out that don't come back. What we're doing is working obviously this year, and you're seeing it in our results, is we're offsetting or mitigating the year-over-year impact of these labor cost actions last year with additional productivity. So all the things that we're doing, continuing to do to drive cost performance and productivity of the company are paying off and living through, and you're seeing that in the margin expansion of the company. But the margin expansion on a full-year basis will be muted, particularly in the second half, will be muted by those labor cost actions. Therefore -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; in 2011, we won't have that same kind of encumbrance, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's what I was going to ask you. As we head into '11 given your preliminary walk, there is no comp headwinds or tailwinds per se, presuming that it sounds like kind of the blend of these puts and takes on the topline that gets you to sort of a mid single digit overall type of growth rate next year. Is that the way to think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the, Dave, the restructuring benefit, the 150, I guess about $0.15, is that based on actions completed kind of year-to-date or does that include some anticipated actions in the fourth quarter still or does not include? And then what are your thoughts about being somewhat opportunistic with respect to where do we stand vis-&#xE0;-vis restructuring opportunities next year? And I'm not really talking about continuous restructuring, but are there still things you could be doing, or should we just plug in the $0.15 cents? How should we think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess two questions there, John. number 1, the $150 million of operating income benefit that I cited for 2011 relative to 2010 is driven by the restructuring actions we've taken to date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In 2010. So that's &#x2013; that's a very good news story. The other really good news story, if I could just add a sub-point to that, is that the $72 million restructuring that we took in the third quarter, 54 for other than Sperian plus 18 for Sperian, that restructuring has really paid for, not in total, but has nearly entirely paid for by that $62 million gain that we had on the JV consolidation that I referenced. So we're smartly using gains to fund improved obviously cost structure and improved operating performance going forward.</p>
          <p>Relative to what you ought to anticipate for next year, we would use the same sort of planning assumption or guidance for next year as we did for this year which is about $50 million. In other words, a nominal amount in terms &#x2013; thinking about in terms of repositioning with additional repositioning coming about as a result of smart deployment of gains, most likely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, John, you've heard me say this before, but I always think there's opportunity for restructuring, and if there isn't, it probably means you've stopped thinking. Because nobody ever has perfect plants, perfect organizations, perfect processes, and we're going to continue to look for opportunities when we have gains of deploying them smartly. So that part's not going to change, and I still think there's a lot more opportunity in the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and just lastly, Dave and Dave, are you actually in process of looking to hire back anyone, specifically and I'm thinking the non-emerging markets, aspects of your businesses, given sort of the trajectory of some of the trends that we're seeing towards some slow improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, actually we have started hiring.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question today from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Shannon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up on the labor cost settlement from this year. So I mean, if you burden last year with those costs, your incrementals are like 50% basically. It doesn't sound like there's comp-related headwinds next year, but I assume you're not planning on 50% next year. So are there other things? Are there ramped investments or other things that we should factor into once this headwind is gone, how should we think about your leveraging of the topline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've given you &#x2013; we've stated that our target is to sustain operating margins 60 basis points, 50, 60, 70 basis points on average through the cycle. And you'll recall those numbers, Shannon, from our February Investor Day. So in terms of modeling, I think that's probably a good start in terms of as you think about modeling for 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the other way to think about it, Shannon, we've talked about this before, but if you can grow sales and control fixed costs, it's amazing how much leverage you get from variable margin. And when you look at fixed costs, 80 to 90% of it is people and people-related costs and that's why OEF is so important to how we manage the company going forward. We did it on a rough basis in the past, but OEF has given us a level of sophistication that I don't think most companies have out there when they look at what truly comprises their fixed costs. I'm actually quite enamored of what we're going to be able to do here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, that's kind of my point, is the underlying leverage that you're getting right now adjusting for that labor cost issue is really strong, and to only do 50 basis points or something next year, you'd have to be ramping a lot of growth investments or something, I would think. So I didn't know if you have anything in the hopper or things that would &#x2013; we would think of next year as being a growth investment headwind or something else like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the pension, have you guys done another pure pension analysis on the accounting differences to see where you're &#x2013; I guess you're going to be 1.1 billion, 1.2 billion, where that would be if you had different accounting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you might imagine, we do that a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it would be in the neighborhood of 40% of that level on the year-over-year basis when you look at 2011. So we'd be in the neighborhood of &#x2013; think of it in the neighborhood of about &#x2013; let's just say the high end of the range I gave you, the 350 to 400 range, so round numbers, 1.2 billion for next year, we would be in the range of about 500 million if we were using pure accounting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just in terms of funding, you said you might be opportunistic next year. Does the 2012 450 million after-tax, is that still the right way to think about future pension funding needs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd say that's a good range on that basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question today from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Steve. Welcome to the fold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I didn't &#x2013; I didn't even have a question to ask, so I've got to think of one. I've got to think of one quickly here. On just the incremental margin, you guys have done a pretty good job this year on incrementals. And the fourth quarter incremental looks relatively light on the kind of sales increase you're seeing. Can you just maybe remind us of the dynamics that are going on there? I don't know if it's &#x2013; actually I'm looking at segment income, so it's not the below-the-liners. Maybe if you could just say which segments will be above the average increase year-over-year and below? Is there a particular segment that drops off here in the fourth quarter from a margin perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the key thing you've got here is a couple things going on. Number one, we talked &#x2013; we've got labor cost headwinds. So when you look at the absolute numbers, you've got that. So when you look at year-over-year, obviously that encompasses that number, Steve. The other thing you've got is we've got anticipated higher launch contributions for our Aerospace in the fourth quarter. We've got our biggest <mark type="inaudible" /> coming up in terms of launch. So we'll still see as we &#x2013; when we peel the numbers back and look at the underlying operational performance, you'll still see very nice growth on a year-over-year basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I'm not sure if this was a question that was asked before by Shannon, but were you talking about the &#x2013; in your 10-K, you guys talk about your outlook for the next several years of required pension contributions. Where will that stand at the end of the year? Will that be any different? I think at one point it was anywhere from 600 million to 1 billion dollars a year for the next couple of years. Any update there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll update that. We'll update that for you in December. The contributions that we're looking at are obviously going to be influenced by the level of contribution that we make here in the fourth quarter as well as what we do in 2011, and we're still working through that, Steve. So we'll give you an update on that when we -- and we can do that on a multi-year basis range estimate as we've done in the past when we give December guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome.</p>

          <p>Moving on, we'll go next to Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Just a few follow-ons, I guess. Picking up on the employee adds for next year, the one thing that you guys didn't do is you didn't I guess destroy your Industrial base. The head count reductions you did were significantly less than other companies in the space. So 5% revenue growth, what sort of employee growth will you expect to achieve that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be less than that. And that's consistent with the OEF focus that we've had. Because when you look at OEF, it comprises a number of things. It's not just the number of people. It's also where are you adding those people, what kind of revenue are you generating with them, what the comp is, what the benefits are. There's a lot that goes into it. The more I think holistic look at how are you managing that at the same time having the best people motivated and organized the right way. So, yes, I would say in general I would expect that we'll be adding because the demand is there, the demand for the products and services. But we'll be adding at a lower rate than we add revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. And just finally, on the margin mix for Aerospace, you mentioned some puts and takes, the launch contributions, et cetera. But I want to dig into the spares and the repair and overhaul mixes, because it sounds like R&amp;O is going to be a big swing from 3Q to 4Q. I'm just wondering if you could maybe just put &#x2013; maybe quote to me how the margin mix for R&amp;O and spares compared to the overall segment average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The aftermarket is a very important and profitable piece of the business, Nigel. You know that. We don't comment on specific margin rates in terms of sub segments or products within Aerospace, but it's very, very important and a key driver for our outlook. We're encouraged, as we said, by the fact that we're now seeing double digit growth on the ATR spares, in addition to strong double digit on Business Aviation spares, and the R&amp;O piece of the business is now starting to grow, although modestly. But that'll pick up, and then again together, we expect those to recouple with global flying hours. So that &#x2013; you could model that in terms of your assumptions as you want to pick it, but for the fourth quarter, we're looking at high teens kind of numbers in terms of overall aftermarket for the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to clarify, R&amp;O is accretive to segment margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I just wanted to finish off by saying CBG up 3% this quarter. You guys got a lot of stick to CBG, and that's a good performance, because a lot of your comps were less than that, so good performance there.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Elena. Well, we continue to outperform and it's for the same reasons. We keep driving those key themes, having great positions in good industries, one Honeywell, and our five initiatives. Free cash flow has been just terrific, and I think it's a real reflection of our earnings quality and, as you know, our cash performance has been impressive for a long time now because we focus on it. We're excited about our prospects in the future and next year, even in a slow growth economy. We're going to keep doing what we have been doing, and that's relentlessly executing our consistent strategy day by day, week by week, over the years, and it's amazing where you can get to by just consistently executing smart strategies.</p>
          <p>It's our intent with our performance to make all of you look brilliant in owning Honeywell. Thanks.</p>
