          <p>Yes. Sherry, thank you. And also welcome from our side from Frankfurt. With me is Tony di Iorio, our CFO, who will present the financials to you and answer your questions.</p>
          <p>We have published, earlier today, the interim report as per end of March, the usual earnings release, the accompanying financial data supplement, and a set of presentation slides Tony will refer to in this call.</p>
          <p>As always, I assume that you all have read our cautionary statements on forward-looking statements. So in the interest of time, I will not read them out to you. But I will hand over now to Tony.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wolfram, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As Wolfram said, we announced this morning that Deutsche Bank in the first quarter of '08 had a loss pre-tax of 254 million and after-tax, 141. That loss was primarily due to markdowns in our CB&amp;S business as well as softer markets for that business.</p>
          <p>Before taxes, CB&amp;S had a loss of 1.6 billion, and that's after reflecting 2.655 billion of markdowns in leveraged finance, commercial real estate, and residential mortgage-backed securities. That compares to the 2.5 billion number that we announced on April 1st.</p>
          <p>Of interest, the gain from fair valuing our own debt was 77 million during the quarter, so a very modest effect and almost no impact on the overall. Our income before taxes from the stable businesses was 700 million, just over 700, which is up 7%. We had net gains on corporate investment assets of 700 million. Our Tier 1 ratio was 9.2%, and we continue to have ready access to funding markets.</p>
          <p>If you turn to our summary income statement that lays out the revenues, provision costs, non-interest expenses, as well as the net income number, our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 45%, reflecting, among other things, losses in the United States as well as the &#x2013; and our overall rate. And that compares with a guidance rate, which we said would be between 33 and 35%.</p>
          <p>Turning to costs. Our costs are down 25% from the first quarter last year and some points warrant mention. That's a 1.4 billion decline. Almost all of that is in the comp line, which resulted from reduced bonus accruals during the quarter. Although I should mention that in the first quarter and we reminded everyone of this last year, we accelerate &#x2013; we have to accelerate the amortization of share awards granted in February to those individuals who are eligible for early retirement. And in the first quarter this year that acceleration was just over 260 million and that will go down, the RU amortization will go down in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As far as non-comp expenses, we were at about the same level as last year. In non-comp this year, we recorded 54 million for capital injections by asset management into certain money market funds. And then the other oddity this quarter is the bracketed 100 million, which is, we broke that out, that's for the cost of policyholder benefits and claims. Normally that is a cost in the first quarter because the value of assets underlying these insurance policies declined, consistent with movements in the market. Our payable under the policies to the policyholders declined, and that's a credit. We've broken that out separately and you can see that on the chart. Adjusting for one-offs in the first quarter last year and in the first quarter this year, our ongoing costs were 1.850 billion, which is up by 1.830 billion compared to last year, and some of that was helped by FX movements, but likewise on the revenue side.</p>
          <p>Turning to the pre-tax results by segment. The item I'd focus on here is corporate investments, because we'll go through the other categories in a minute. What that profit recognizes is sales of principally three industrial holdings: Daimler, Linde and Allianz, but offsetting that are certain losses, the largest of which is on our option position to increase our shareholding in Hua Xia Bank.</p>
          <p>Turning to CB&amp;S, as I indicated earlier, income before income taxes is 1.6 billion. This reflects the 2.655 billion of markdowns that I mentioned earlier. And we have lower revenues in certain of our businesses, particularly in the credit businesses, but that was offset by increased strength in some of our customer distribution businesses.</p>
          <p>If we were to look at the 2.1 billion, 2.2 billion of reported revenues in CB&amp;S and adjust that for the markdowns that are included in sales and trading, which is 900 million of the 2.655 billion &#x2013; the balance is on the leveraged finance loans and commitments, and that's shown in Origination &#x2013; as well as a 600 million negative revenue in certain of our businesses, the credit businesses that I just mentioned, and a small write-down, markdown in designated equity prop, then our ongoing revenues for the quarter in CB&amp;S &#x2013; in sales and trading rather, would be 3.5 billion, and we'll go through where that is shortly.</p>
          <p>I should repeat again that our &#x2013; the gain in the quarter on marking-to-market our own debt was only 77 million. If we had elected to mark-to-market all of the debt that was eligible, then the revenues of 3.5 or 2.2 would have been higher by 2 billion. The importance of that to you is that on a cumulative basis, we have just under 100 million on the balance sheet from this deferred charge related to mark-to-market of own debt. As spreads tighten, when they tighten, the exposure we have to releases back into our P&amp;L is only that less than 100 million, and that compares very favorably to the large sizes of many of our peers.</p>
          <p>Turning to sales and trading debt, this is where the major effect, a major effect took place. We had a decline of 2 billion in revenues on a reported basis, but adjusting for these items that I mentioned, the change, they amounted for 1.5 billion, so we would have had a much stronger result.</p>
          <p>We are happy to report in our FX and Rates business that we had record revenues, as volumes increased, and we also take great pride in the fact that Euromoney magazine awarded us for the 4th year in row, which is unprecedented, the number one position in market share with 22% in the FX markets.</p>
          <p>The RMBS business suffered from net markdowns driven by basis risk. We had a very marked reduction in the Alt-A product during the quarter. We saw this as some of our peers sold large holdings into the market and there was an inverse correlation effect with the subprime market and in fact, in many cases the default rate on these Alt-A assets is &#x2013; implied default rate, given the prices is higher &#x2013; is lower. The default rate is higher and the value lower than in some of the subprime business. And we're monitoring this as we go long. So we had unprecedented selling pressure during the quarter and our basis risk resulted in that effect and that was just over 500 million in the RMBS business.</p>
          <p>With regard to commercial real estate, we also had markdowns and those were just under 350 million for the quarter. Those are net of hedges and we'll talk about that exposure, as we will, the RMBS exposure shortly when we go through the exposure slides. Our credit business saw substantially reduced client flow and we continue to focus on risk reduction and that's another chart that we'll go through shortly with regard to our exposures. So we're happy to report that our commodities business is growing and produced strong results for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the sales and trading equity business, we also saw a decline in the quarter from 1.714 billion in the first quarter last year to 745. The biggest shift was in equity derivatives and this rose from our structural short position on our retail structured notes issued and an unprecedented correlation in equity markets there. And that was the largest single reduction in our equity revenues. Cash equities were positive and strong for the quarter. However, they came in lower than the record levels in &#x2013; or the high levels in the first quarter last year. And as the chart shows, we see continued growth in Asia and North America.</p>
          <p>Prime services, we saw an increase in mandates and also an increase in revenues, albeit modest in the quarter, but it's another business that we see long-term positive for us.</p>
          <p>Our designated equity prop results were down by about 300 million on a comparative basis for the first quarter last year, although we were just slightly negative for the quarter, in the mid-double-digits &#x2013; so not a large loss, but a reduction from very high levels last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to Origination and Advisory, the story here is that difficult markets continue. We took write-downs of 1.770 billion markdowns in our high-yield business. That write-down was mitigated by a strong net interest margin of just over 200 million for the quarter. Advisory revenues were down from the prior levels, consistent with lower market activity and as was Equity Origination and investment grade.</p>
          <p>Turning to the exposures. On the CDO subprime exposure, we continue to see a reduction in that exposure. On a gross basis, our exposure went down from 2.9 billion to 1.8 &#x2013; on a net basis, from 1.2 to 900. It is important to define what this recognizes. This is our gross exposure. And the numbers &#x2013; if we had a 100% loss in the asset values with zero recovery, our loss would be at that point in time 900 million.</p>
          <p>The reductions, as indicated on the chart, are from markdowns and liquidations. And we should also mention that these numbers aggregate different vintages, locations, credit ratings, et cetera. So there is some basis risk that we monitor.</p>
          <p>Except for 385 million of subprime CDO exposure in our available-for-sales portfolio, which is substantially hedged, all of our CDO subprime exposure is in our trading accounts. And on this AFS security portfolio, we also recorded during the quarter 144 million of other-than-temporary losses in our P&amp;L. So although it's in available-for-sale, as we did in the fourth quarter, we had some charges from that portfolio reflected in the P&amp;L in the first. On a net short &#x2013; we're net short on a delta notional basis as well.</p>
          <p>Our US residential mortgage business, our exposures continue to come down there. The Alt-A book was reduced from 7.8 billion to 5.2. And this came from some liquidations, markdowns and the effect of FX, particularly the dollar weakening during the quarter. Our net exposure dropped from 3.6 to 1.7. And again, that's presented on the same basis as the CDO subprime with 100% default and zero recovery. I should mention again that all of our exposure on Alt-A is in the trading book and subject to mark-to-markets every month.</p>
          <p>Turning to monoline exposure. We show on the chart those receivables or assets we're carrying in our balance sheet, as potential receivables from monolines on the high credit prices instruments. And so that amount increased during the period from 1.1 billion, which we disclosed in the 20-F at the end of December, to 1.9 billion and as you can see on the chart, the predominant increase or all of the increase, most of the increase was in the Alt-A. We, in addition to this, have other receivables from monolines on asset classes that have not been subject to substantial dislocations, and those include CLO, CMBS, student loans and muni securities.</p>
          <p>We've taken credit &#x2013; we have the credit reserves on our books of just over 300 million against this exposure, and it warrants some explanation. In order for us to have a claim due from a monoline, there has to be a default in the underlying asset supporting the securities that they have insured. And so, we've highlighted here those securities that have had the most focus with regard to defaults, and that's the super-senior tranches, Alt-A and other subprime.</p>
          <p>Turning to commercial real estate, we show a summary of traded loans, and as you can see, through FX and sales we've had a reduction of our gross exposure, and on a carrying value we've also seen a reduction to 15.5 billion. It's important to note the geographic distribution of these loans. About half of them, just under half, are in North America, with the balance outside North America, principally in Germany.</p>
          <p>The write-down, the markdowns we've taken were not equally distributed across the geography, and the predominant amount was in the North American book. And in fact, in some of our European loans, which are fixed rate loans, and which are in different markets and different situations from those in the US, we had small markups. So in looking at this exposure, I think you'd need to focus on the geographic split. All of these loans are collateralized by real estate, and we're going through, where there are issues, trying to resolve with the owners and with the real estate collateral.</p>
          <p>On a leveraged finance basis, exposure, you can see that our exposure continues dropping. On a gross basis it's 33.1, and on a carrying value basis it's 30 billion. You can also see the amount of funded and unfunded.</p>
          <p>One of the issues you need to focus on here is the composition of the book. We have more of our loans outside the United State than many of our peers. And likewise the loans in which we are involved have not been many of those that have seen substantial problems. So, while some loans are trading in the market below 70, and looking at the average carrying value or average gross markdowns of others, you have to take that into account, compared to the loans we have. So it's important, as with the commercial real estate and the leveraged finance, that we don't just focus on broad averages, but consider the distribution of the risk across individual borrowers.</p>
          <p>Turning to the stable businesses, we generated &#x2013; they generated income before tax of 742 million in the quarter, which is an increase. And the first stable business we'll look at is GTB, which had pre-tax profits up 17% from the prior year at 250 million. It was a very strong quarter, 8% increase in revenues, and we show continued momentum across trade finance, cash management as well as our domestic custody business.</p>
          <p>Turning to asset and wealth management, we had pre-tax of 188 million, comparable to the prior year. As far as asset management is concerned, we had lower investment management fees, consistent with a decline in the equity markets. As I mentioned earlier, we've also had charges of 54 million in expense and a small charge to revenue relating to fund injections, and we did have some asset gains in the quarter, as, sales of assets as we, of a business in this case, as we did in the first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>And if you were to look at the change in this business from the increased asset sales, it is just under the amount of the fund injection. So on a comparable basis, if you excluded both the fund injection cost as well as the change in asset sales, and went to an inherent return, it would be about the same as in the first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>We showed, on the positive side in asset management, strong net new money, with 2 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We regard to PWM, there is a very positive story here. As we've mentioned to you in prior calls, we've spent the latter part of '05 and a good part of '06, early '07 investing in this business, bringing in new representatives, advisors, and we're happy to report that the results are beginning to show &#x2013; a very positive quarter, with strong year-on-year profit growth and net new money of 4 billion.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned, we also had a gain in these results, a small gain from the sale of an asset we acquired through an acquisition.</p>
          <p>Turning to PBC, their pre-tax income for the quarter was 304 million, a 4% increase over the prior year &#x2013; record revenues at 1.454 billion. What we saw here in terms of revenue composition is a reduction in our securities brokerage revenues, as people were cautious in terms of particularly the equity markets. However, that was offset by increases in the sales of pension products, particularly a product here in Germany. And so the net effect was that although securities brokerage revenues were down, total revenues were up. We were also helped with strong deposit flows and a continuing growth in the loan book. And our net new assets in the quarter were up 4 billion.</p>
          <p>If you were to look at the size of our invested assets, you will see that since December we had a decline from 952 billion in PCAM to 896. That comprised reductions in market performance, the value of assets declined in the funds, again consistent with trends in the market, an FX effect with the weakening dollar of 20 billion offset by the net new money that I alluded to earlier of 11 billion.</p>
          <p>We turn to credit, capital and risk. You can see that our loan loss provisions for the quarter were up slightly from the prior year first quarter at 114 million. Some of that, 9 million, is due to a reduction in the releases in CIB. But we still had releases of 11 million, and an increase in the PCAM provisions, and that's consistent with the growth in our loan book. Problem loans remained relatively stable at 62%.</p>
          <p>And if we look, turn again to our Tier 1 ratio at 9.2, a very strong results. And let me talk about what's in here, because there's a lot of dynamics. First, it's the first time we've announced a Basel II result. And so this reflects both on the risk-weighted asset side a difference in the risk weighting of assets, as there has been a great deal more differentiation and gradation among risk classes.</p>
          <p>On the other side, though, we've had some first time reductions, introduction of capital reductions for the first time, and those reduced our Tier 1 capital.</p>
          <p>We also had the movement of about 15 billion of risk-weighted assets on the leveraged finance from the trading book into the regulatory capital book, which we indicated in the past that would happen. And that's reflected in the risk-weighted assets. Notwithstanding that, our risk-weighted assets are down &#x2013; are only up to 303 billion, which we think is a very strong indicator of how we approach risk and all.</p>
          <p>We should mention one other factor. We took a reduction in the quarter of just under 600 million, assuming that the dividend for 2008 would be comparable to the 2007 dividend of 450 &#x2013; of &#x20AC;4.50. The ultimate decision on the dividend is taken by our Supervisory Board in recommendation to the AGM, and that will be next year. So you shouldn't view this as indicating a dividend policy. The reason we did it is because we thought it would be prudent this early in the year to allocate a portion of our Tier 1 in the first quarter, so we don't overstate that ratio at 9.2%, and secondly, so that we don't burden later quarters in the year with a full reduction of the dividend, which provides the Supervisory Board with full flexibility to determine dividend policy later in the year.</p>
          <p>So, this is an important statistic for us, both on the risk-weighted assets side as well as the Tier I ratio side.</p>
          <p>I mentioned earlier that we continue to have ready access to liquidity, and the next chart indicates what we've done to manage our unsecured funding base, which, as you can see from the numbers, has grown both in quantity, up 15 billion from June levels, the beginning of the crisis, from 511 to 526. But it's important to note what's happened to the quality and stability of those assets.</p>
          <p>If you look at the first stack in the bars, that is short-term wholesale funding. Our reliance on that source of funding has declined since last June by about a third from its former levels, or 49 billion, from 153 to 104. At the same time we've more than made up for that by a growing deposit base and a capital market funding of 64 billion. So, we've shown the more stable component of this unsecured funding base has increased from 358 billion to 422 billion. And we think that this is important to note in terms of our funding. It's a diversification away from the dislocated money markets, and it's strengthening our funding mix.</p>
          <p>You can see the effect and how the credit markets view that by looking at the next chart, which shows that our, the CDS spread on a 5-year basis as of April 25th was 59 BPS. That's up from where we were last July. However, if you look at how it compares with our major peers, it shows a very positive story of how the credit markets see Deutsche Bank.</p>
          <p>So much for the quarter. Probably one of the things you want to focus on is where do we go from here, and if you look at the next slide will address that.</p>
          <p>I want to caution and repeat something Wolfram said. These are our views as to where we see resources, where we want to allocate resources. It is not predictive, nor a forward-looking statement, although we would not be allocating resources in certain product and geographic areas if we did not believe that those provided opportunities for us in the future.</p>
          <p>If you look at investment banking, we think that the conditions in the market since last summer will have a substantial impact on structured credit. As Anshu and others, and we've said in the past, we will probably see a reduction in the more exotic structures. However, we believe that the need for businesses and the need for capital to grow economies in non-OECD and OECD markets will continue to support the structured credit market. The ability to originate and distribute will probably not go away, although the character, the structures and the nature of those structures will probably change.</p>
          <p>We see a potential for share gains in the flow products, and you could see what's gone on in this current quarter, in which we showed very strong revenues and growth in our FX and money market business, as well as in core rates. We see growth in non-OECD markets. Deutsche Bank is active in 76 countries around the world. We're very strong in Asia and growing in Asia. We're very strong in Europe and moving into Eastern Europe. And we believe that that puts us in a very strong position to continue capitalizing on the market. As far as products are concerned, we've seen our commodities and prime services businesses grow, and we'll continue to allocate resources to those two businesses.</p>
          <p>We also see the opportunity for share gains in corporate finance. As many of our peers are dealing with issues of current risk and P&amp;L, we believe, with our strong capital base and our ready access to liquidity, there is an opportunity for us to continue growing in the corporate finance business.</p>
          <p>As far as for the stable businesses are concerned, GTB is a focus business for us. We see continued growth and momentum there. On PBC, we're beginning to see returns on our investments not only here in Germany, but also in Poland, and India, particularly, and other parts of Europe. On PWM, we've had strong asset growth, and the investments that we made in the recent years are beginning to pay off. Asset management will continue under pressure probably for the remainder of this year, as market conditions both in equities market and in real estate infrastructure remain difficult. However, as we said earlier, they have shown an increase in net new money.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to grow in our insurance outsourcing business. Our institutional business is an area of focus and growth for us. And as we said, one of the mega-trends is the continued growth in invested assets, as wealth creation continues, particularly outside the developed countries, and as people in both developed and non-OECD countries see the need to save for their retirement.</p>
          <p>The following page is the highlights that I started in the introduction. And that concludes my comments, and now we'll open it up for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everybody. The balance of your leveraged loans and CMBS didn't fall this quarter as much as some of our peers. I know you've been linked in the press with a number of possible leveraged loan disposals. I just wondered if you could give us an update on how those are proceeding. And also, I know the LCDX has improved in recent weeks, but the FT was suggesting that you were having to offer subsidized financing to offload leveraged loans at the current marks. Is that true, or are you finding these things quite easy to dispose off now? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, first in terms of dispositions of leveraged finance, we sold some in the quarter &#x2013; in the first quarter. Since the end of the quarter, and these have been smaller tranches, but we have sold, perhaps, 1.4 billion of loans at about our marks, which was important for us to note. We did not provide, to my knowledge, any funding on those sales. And with regard to the second question, in order, there are some very strict requirements on accounting, both from a financial statement as well as a regulatory standpoint, on when you can account for a sale as a sale. And in order to the de-recognize loans, there has to be a substantial risk transfer to the buyer, number one, and number two, the value of the consideration would be affected by whether we provided below-market financing, because that has to be a price adjustment. We price these loans not by reference to an index, although we do look at indexes, just to see where the relative price levels and movements are, we price them, as we've indicated in the past, based on a bottom-ups, name by name analysis. And we do gauge where the sales, I receive a weekly sales activity report, which looks at the realized proceeds compared to our marks and we're not discounting or providing un-economic financing in order to unload these as has been indicated.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, I've got three questions, firstly, in terms of the risk-weighted asset trends. Obviously with average value at risk up 38% and your outstanding loans up 4% sequentially, just wanted to understand what the underlying RWA trend would have been ex-Basel II effect, and if you could quantify how much leveraged finance has now been included incrementally. Second question is on asset and wealth management, if I were to strip out the disposal gains, the annualized pre-tax run rate seems to be closer to 0.4 billion compared obviously to your original target of 1.3 billion. Could you please comment if my methodology is correct, and if that is true, then if there are any changes in strategy? And thirdly, in terms of the rates business within the investment bank, if we were to get a, to a more stable rate environment in the US, would you expect any change in the levels of activity within the rates business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the first question, Kinner, as far as Basel II and leveraged finance. The market risk increase in RWA terms in the first quarter was about 4 billion from the prior levels. In looking at VAR, though, I should mention that there was a technical factor, which is not to say that the ratio or the metric would not have increased. We updated market data twice I believe in the first quarter, and this accounted for most of the change. Now someone could say, but that's the way the ratio works, and you're right. But I just point that out in terms of the extent of the change during the period.</p>
          <p>With regard to the asset and wealth management, I think we come in a little bit higher, because you can't just take out the disposal gains, there are other effects that may not continue. The one I mentioned most prominently was 55 million, of which 1 million was in revenue and 54 was in expense. And I think if you take out the disposal gains, you have to look at that. The second is that, as we've mentioned in the past, performance fees are lumpy and don't come in on a regular or orderly basis. So any annualizing you do, based on a single quarter, is subject to some potential distortions.</p>
          <p>With regard to the rates business, we saw very positive returns during the quarter, as we increased both share and absolute revenues. And we see this as an advantage at Deutsche Bank, given the breadth of our platform, both geographically and product-wise. So we see the rates business as a strong contributor in the future, as it was during this quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you very much. Can I ask three questions please? Firstly, could you come back to the equity derivatives point that you mentioned in investment banking, and maybe if you could give us a sense of what's the size of the exposure and the mechanics of the sensitivities, so whatever it was that caused you a dent in the revenues in Q1, could you explain how that exposure works? Secondly, I just wanted to come back to asset management, because some of the core revenues, the core portfolio fund management revenue lines look very weak, and I just wondered if you'd give any more details on what is the source of the weakness there, is it just performance fees? And then third quick question, total assets went up dramatically in the quarter in the investment bank, up 15% or up 33% year-on-year, could you just comment on what's driving that please?</p>

          <p>Have gone up a lot in the investment bank, I think it's 15% in the quarter, 33% year-on-year, I just wondered if you could comment on the drivers?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yes, absolutely. As far as the equity derivatives change, I don't have the notionals here with me, so as far as size, I can't give you an answer, but maybe offline our investor relations colleagues can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and just, but broadly, is it something that is likely to recur in future quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, we don't know. We don't know. Let me tell you the mechanics of what's happened and what it is. As with other large European banks, we are an issuer of retail structured notes, which are very popular in Europe. These notes reference some index or some pool of assets. The notes have an embedded derivative. We look to hedge that exposure on a &#x2013; on the basis that if we have a return to give to the note-holder, we've got to do something on the other side. The hedge is not a static hedge, it's constantly reset and rebalanced, and what we saw during the quarter was a correlation, and as I said, that at times was as high as 85%. And so the moves we expected to happen, as the equity markets dropped, we did not see the same effect or a more pronounced effect on our asset side, and that was the effect. If there is more information that you'd like, I think we can deal with you offline on that.</p>
          <p>With regard to assets, you've got to be very careful here. If you looked at the change in our balance sheet since the time we converted to IFRS, the bulk of the growth in the balance sheet is coming from derivative mark-to-market. In the current quarter, on the asset side we saw an increase of 200 &#x2013; nearly 250 billion and if you look at the interim report you'll see that. In comparing us to the US peers, I think you have reflect on different accounting methods. If we were to net down under IFRS, all of the balance sheet that would be eligible under US GAAP, there are three principal areas here: it's the derivative mark-to-market, where we have master netting agreements in place and where we have collateral, which we do on a substantial amount of these; second is the trade date, settlement date effects, which are allowed to be netted down on securities transactions; and the third is on repos, our balance sheet would be one-third lower. If you adjusted for those factors, our tangible ratio of net or balance sheet capital to tangible assets would be in line with most of our US peers.</p>
          <p>Now if we look at the nature of what the growth in the balance sheet is, on the asset side, the derivative mark-to-market does not have to be funded and in fact, in many cases we receive collateral. On the liabilities side, if we have to post collateral that does require funding, but because the two numbers are very close, the asset and the liabilities side, many of the assets we receive as collateral on our receivables on the derivatives could be used to fund the margin there. So in terms of liquidity, there is an effect &#x2013; there is not as great an effect as if they were securities. In addition to that, because we have master netting agreements with our major market counter-parties, which account for a substantial portion of this, the credit risk, taken into consideration with the collateral, is greatly reduced. Now, is there market risk? There is on both sides, of course. But for that reason, while we look at tangible assets on a reported or on a gross basis, we also look at our risk-weighted asset levels and the Tier 1 is 9.2, which we reported. So we think that the focus on gross balance sheet, while well intended, has to be looked at in a qualitative and not just a quantitative sense.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just on that and then I wanted to come on to asset management as well, but just on that, I mean, I am struggling bit to understand to what's changed. I understand the different arguments about the accounting, but what's changed in the quarter that's driven up the balances still further? I mean is it volume or is it a change in the calculation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had, on the asset side, we had positive mark-to-markets, mark-to-market on certain derivatives and on the liabilities side, we had &#x2013; so as the derivative mark-to-markets flow through the P&amp;L -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It grosses up from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The offset goes in the balance sheet and that's the nature of the increase. And you have to look at that, and that's disclosed, if you look at the back of our interim report, we showed the components of our, what used to be called trading assets and liabilities, which is now I guess financial assets at fair value, but if you look at that composition, you'll see what's happened to our securities component, what's happened to our derivative component and the other components and that's fairly transparent as to what's happened. So with spread widening, we've &#x2013; depending on which side we were on the contract, we'd either had gains or losses. Those gains or losses go through the P&amp;L. The offset is through the balance sheet, either as an asset or a liability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. I'm sorry, just final question was just on asset management, it looked to me like the underlying, on your slide where you break out the different types of revenues, it looked like the core portfolio management revenues were soft and you mentioned performance fees. Is that the only effect there as well as the AUM balances?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's &#x2013; I mean it's softer. It's down by 8% from last year, from 525 to 485. If we were to look at the components of that, the bulk of it is, the largest component is the &#x2013; we had some sales in the first quarter last year in our REIT business, which were not repeated this year and we had, with the asset-based fees, with a reduction in asset values, the fees were down. Now, if asset values go up and as more new money comes in, we would hope to replace those. But that's the net effect.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good morning. Two questions, one on GTB and one on PCAM. Your GTB business has been pretty resilient, as it has for many of your competitors, and I'm just wondering, is there any seasonality first of all in Deutsche Bank's GTB revenues? And secondly, are there any parts of that business where you are picking up market share in Europe vis-&#xE0;-vis those competitors?</p>
          <p>And the question on PCAM is specifically on asset management Americas. You had net new money flows of zero there in the quarter, which under the circumstances, I think was fine, and I guess the invested assets going down, that was partly because of currency impact. But are you overall reasonably comfortable with your competitive positioning in asset management Americas or could we see some recalibration of that business going forward here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Matthew. As far as GTB, I don't know if it's so much seasonality to focus on, but rather two other factors that we're seeing an impact. The first, in Europe, we've gained market share with the Single European Payments initiative, where &#x2013; and in our &#x2013; and we've seen that in our cash management business, particularly in corporates, where corporates now have the opportunity to go to a single clearer for their European business. We're up on the platform, it's working well in terms of technology and that is an advantage to us, in addition to the swing to more stable institutions, which is why it's important to have a strong Tier 1 ratio and continued access to liquidity for us. So it's not seasonal. The second effect is what happens to interest rates, because there is a fee component to this revenue base, but there is a net interest margin component and as we see interest rates move, we see an effect.</p>
          <p>With regard to PCAM Americas, we're in a tough competitive position, and you're right to point that out. We think we have strong business opportunities in REIF, both in real estate and infrastructure. We're growing our institutional business. With regard to the retail asset management business, there is pressure both on asset values as well as in net new money. And we'll continue to work to strengthen that position, but it is a tough environment. I think our people are doing as good job as can be done to deal with it. But we do have strengths in other areas, as I've mentioned.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. A few questions, first of all fixed income sales and trading, if I look at slide 10 and I adjust the write-downs, I get to about 2.2 billion fixed income sales and trading. Just trying to understand how important FX and rates and money markets in this is. I have a rough idea commodities is relatively small, so is it fair to say that 70, 80%, more than two-thirds of the revenues are generated from this business, and considering that we're in a record environment in the first quarter, how should we look at this business going forward, as volatility and rate cuts in the US are going to be more limited?</p>
          <p>Secondly, is on the AGM proposal of authorize capital and the 90 billion which has been referred to also in the press, sorry, 17 billion, and first of all, what consolidation role would you like to play in Germany, and secondly, what kind of assets would attract you? Is it more deposits gathering, franchise, is it more consumer, is it a traditional consumer or more consumer-related assets such as credit cards, etc, if you could talk about that?</p>
          <p>And lastly, Gordian Knot, you own two-thirds of Gordian Knot. What is your position in a case of further downgrades or if potential defaults will happen and what is the equity investment in Gordian Knot? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Kian, starting from your first question in this quarter, and I don't know that I'd only focus on this quarter, because as other product categories revert to at least some more positive than they were, if you were to look at the adjusted amounts excluding those gains, those write-downs, markdowns that we talked about, for the businesses you talked about in this quarter, we would be somewhere in the realm that you're talking about, two-thirds of the revenues. That's correct, although we think that it's not just a condition of the current times, because if it were, everyone else would be enjoying the same success, and we don't have privy to the details of all of our peers, but we don't believe that the same effects are being felt. I said earlier that we have to look at the &#x2013; at our footprint, both from a geographic and a product basis. We were able to do &#x2013; our people were able to do what they did because of our strengths in those areas, not because they were just &#x2013; they just happened to be in attendance that day. So there is an effect, and I think you need to focus on that.</p>
          <p>With regard to consolidation, I'll repeat what we've said in the past. We always look at opportunities, and we have all along. We look at those opportunities in terms of what they will mean for the shareholder, and so we have financial hurdles that we look to achieve in any strategic combinations. With regard to specific businesses, we have indicated a goal to increase our stable businesses, so that would not just include PCAM, but also GTB, and we look for opportunities in those areas. There have been a lot of talk, and the only response I'd have is that we really cannot comment on specific market rumors.</p>
          <p>With regard to Gordian Knot, we own a, I don't know if it's preferred issue, it's not preferred, but it's an equity or long-term debt, subordinated debt position, I'm not sure legally of the exact form now. The amount is not a very large amount, and we're a passive investor.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good morning, everybody. It's three quick questions from my side. Number one, on the net interest income, if you just could outline the effects which led to the rise in net interest income and maybe try and explain potential trading elements which might be underlying in the rise there. Second one is on Tier 1; I see that the Tier 1 is down some 400 million quarter-on-quarter, which obviously includes the equity that you have chosen to put into capital and also the dividend accrual. If you can just indicate what the impact of the revaluation reserve what in that quarter, because I think it must have been negative by around 1.5 billion, if you can just confirm that? And the third and last question, on the monoline exposure, which rose to 3 billion from 1.5 billion quarter-on-quarter, if you can just explain the effect on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the net interest margin we &#x2013; the amounts are up 600 million from the prior year, because the first quarter in '07 was just under 2.1, the current quarter is about 2.7. Of that 600 million, the leveraged finance loans accounted for the number I mentioned earlier of 200. We had net interest on RMBS securities, Abby, so the rest of it was across the pitch and we had an increase in interest expense from our debt issuance of about 200 million. So that's the components of that increase. The Tier 1 capital, repeat what you said about the revaluation reserve, I may have missed that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Actually your capital is down 400 million net, i.e. the Basel I to Basel II swing is a net 400 million. I know it includes the dividend accrual, I know it includes the Tier 1 capital that you chose to finally add to it, the [$2.8 billion in Q1. So calculating backwards, there must be a kind of negative residual for the revaluation reserve, if you can just outline the size of that impact of the revaluation reserve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we had, as I said earlier, the, as far as the Tier 1 is concerned, we had some new charges for the first time. And those accounted for about 1 billion of the reduction, the largest component of which had to do with how expected loss is treated under Basel II, which is different from the former. And then the other two have to do with certain securitizations and our investments in finance subsidiaries, which are between 10 and 50%. So that's the one. The other effects are we had a reduction in, we had rather no net income, but we had almost a 600 million dividend allocation, and as far as the revaluation, we did have a reduction of about 700 million, and this is disclosed in our interim report in unrealized gains on listed securities.</p>
          <p>With regard to the monolines, these are hedges against risk, so what happens is as the cash side, and let's assume it's the cash side, declines in value, so the RMBS book is marked down. If we have insurance protection, and that's where the bulk of this change has occurred, we have an increase in our receivable from the monocline. And so, as we talked about earlier with the derivatives, that hedge is revenue, because it's an increase in our potential claim, although the claim will only occur in the event of default, not market decline, so if the asset doesn't default, then we don't have a claim and we don't have an issue of whether or not we have a credit impairment. So, it's as simple as that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just want to focus on your derivatives business, I was just wondering, given the basis risk you've seen in the first quarter, and there's some slowdown in activity from structured equity derivatives to clients, both M&amp;A clients and to retail clients. Number one, how has your view changed about the growth of that business? And then number two, does the breakdown in correlations and the significant basis risk you've experienced in Q1 change the amount of capital you think is appropriate for that business or at least how much buffer you want to hold at the group level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Huw, as far as the growth in the derivatives business, we still see it as an opportunity for us, both in the retail structured market as well as in our dealings with both market counter-parties and others. And we still see that as a business that we think we're ideally suited in terms of both technology, in terms of market penetration and market familiarity. So we'll continue on that. As far the equity derivatives are concerned, we think that the pain has substantially been taken, correlation is very high, and we don't think it can go much higher. And we believe we have upside if it falls.</p>

          <p>Good morning. A couple of follow-ups on the Tier 1 capital, if you don't mind. Firstly, your hybrids capital went up a lot during the quarter, presumably you converted some of the conditional capital. Is there any restriction that you see applied on the proportion of hybrid that makes up your Tier 1 capital, because it's now 26% I think, of your overall capital, which seems a bit high? Secondly, wondering if there's just a single figure percentage point number that you can give us for the impact of Basel II on the Tier 1 ratio on first application. And then thirdly, there doesn't seem any mention of your 8.4 billion vision. Just wondering where you feel about that, whether that's something that's now gone, whether you think it could come back in 2009, just your thoughts there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Matthew. As far as the effect of the conversions, it looks like we had about 1.8 billion added to Tier 1, so there's about a 58 basis point uplift in the Tier 1 ratio from the contingent capital. With regard to the ceiling, we still have some headroom. We look at this carefully, we talk to rating agencies and other parties about it, but we still have some headroom. As far as Basel I to Basel II, I would just look at the &#x2013; we reported under Basel II an 8.9% ratio and 329 billion of risk-weighted assets. The risk-weighted assets went down, as did the capital, but the effect &#x2013; 8.6 rather, at the end of the year we went to 9.2, so that, you can probably gauge the effect.</p>
          <p>With regard to a forecast of this year's earnings, I think we were pretty clear in the outlook statement in our 20-F, we reiterated that in the interim report that we issued today. These are very uncertain times, the markets are unpredictable and I don't think we're prepared to estimate a number as to what this year's results would be. What I can tell you is that our focus is on the risk that we take and understanding it, and managing it prudently, and liquidity and at reallocating resources to those businesses where we think we have the highest potential.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just follow-up with the hybrid question, you say you still have some headroom, how do you calculate that headroom? And is there any quantitative indication you can give us on how much headroom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that there is a hard, quantitative number, but based on discussions we have with various parties, as I've indicated, we have a sense of where they'd be comfortable and we look to manage to below that range, and we believe we have some room currently.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. Just a question on the compensation accrual, please.  Obviously with the write-downs in the quarter, it might be more difficult to follow your normal formula so I just wonder if you can give us an indication the extent to which your normal bonus formula was followed and therefore, in future quarters for the remainder of the year, would you expect each of those quarters to have a sort of standalone compensation accrual based upon that quarter's revenues or will there be basically a sort of overall picture being taken at the year-end as you decide how to divvy up returns between the shareholders and the employees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, we've mentioned before that we do have formulas that we apply. We've applied those formulas directly as usual in the non-CB&amp;S business. In the CB&amp;S business it was difficult to apply the formula because of the results, because the result is based on the profits before bonuses. Nevertheless, we thought it was prudent to reflect some accrual, albeit at levels commensurate with the returns. As we've also mentioned in the past, we update the successive quarters on a cumulative year-to-date basis not on a standalone basis. So we will be looking at the overall profitability in each quarter. That profitability will obviously be impacted by the first quarter results. But we will update that and look on the cumulative basis as we have in the past.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just questions in a few areas. The first thing is on leveraged finance and CMBS and the relation with risk-weighted assets. So if I look on slide 17, you've still got unfunded leveraged finance commitments of 17 billion and then you've got commercial real estate of 15.5 billion. Could you explain to us how that could affect risk-weighted assets over time? So how much of the commercial real estate is already in your risk-weighted assets and then how the 16.6 billion can come into risk-weighted assets over time? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is the area of goodwill impairment that's in the notes and you mentioned that you're testing your goodwill in corporate finance. Could you kind of talk about how much of your goodwill is involved because you've got, obviously, a rather large balance of 8.5 billion?</p>
          <p>And then the third question is kind of on conduits, when you talk about equity on page 18 of the report, you talk about the fact you've had additional write-downs I think on some of your conduits, it seems to be 900 million and what I'm trying to understand is the nature of these and why it's gone through the balance sheet rather than through the P&amp;L? And then I think your reporting accounts talked of lots more off-balance sheet entities, I think something like 33 billion. So whether you could update us on what's happening there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Fiona. With regard to the treatment of both the commercial real estate and the leveraged finance in RWA, until the loans are funded and in fact all long, as long as they're in the trading accounts and have not been funded for the 180 days, they are in RWA, they run through the VAR calculation in RWA and so they are reflected, albeit at a different rate from funded loans that have been on the balance sheet for 110, 80 days and it's the same for the commercial real estate.</p>
          <p>With regard to the goodwill, we did do a valuation this quarter because we thought it was prudent. Given the dislocations in the markets for the products in our corporate finance business, we thought it was prudent to do that valuation. We worked with the business, they updated their forecast on their strategic plan and as we reported in the interim, we concluded that there was not a write-off, an impairment. I'd rather not get into the details as to how much it is, although it's less than a billion.</p>
          <p>As far as the conduits are concerned and the 900 million, which I thought was a little bit less than that, what we, we have about 27 billion of DB-sponsored conduits, and Fiona, we've mentioned this in the past. We have a total number &#x2013; a total value of about 32, 33 billion of DB-sponsored conduits, where we organized the conduits. A lot &#x2013; these are organized in order for us to help customers finance receivables that they generated. So these are not Deutsche Bank receivables that we're putting into the conduits, but rather facilitating customer business. Because of the terms and conditions of these conduits, under IFRS we're required to consolidate them, and we do. And we have consolidated those since the beginning of '06 in IFRS.</p>
          <p>These are classified in available-for-sale securities and we're required to mark them to market, but that mark-to-market goes through equity unless there is a credit event of default on those underlying assets. The assets in those conduits consist of credit card receivables, automobile loans, mortgages other than subprime and other trade receivables. So there is a mark-to-market, but as long as that mark-to-market has not resulted from a credit default, then there is no need to put it through P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>I should add that we have other assets on our CDO subprime book in available-for-sale. And that balance is somewhere in the 350 million range, and that's disclosed, and we mark those through P&amp;L &#x2013; through OCI unless there is an issue with the valuation other-than-temporary, and as we disclosed in our interim report, we reflected 144 million of loss in our first quarter as a result of those CDO subprime assets held in our available-for-sale. The 900 million you're talking about is related to other assets on which they were marked-to-market through equity.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just coming back to that leveraged finance point, because I don't know if I missed it earlier on. But when I look at CBS, your RWAs have gone up 6%. I presume that's Basel I of 218 going to Basel II of 231, and there must be currency going on in there as well as leveraged finance balances. Could you just talk a bit more about what's going on in that number and whether if you could go up further?</p>

          <p>It could go up more. One of the reasons it will go up is because more loans that we funded will move into the 180-day category, and a lot of these loans are denominated in US dollars, so you could have an FX.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh hi, it's Stuart from Merrill. I just had a few quick questions on capital if I might. Firstly on the balance sheet, do you have any plans to shrink the nominal size of the balance sheet, or are you agnostic as to whether it carries on growing? That's question one. Question two is the economic capital usage, it was &#x20AC;13.6 billion at the end of the year, could you give us an updated figure for Q1 please? And then third question is Tier 1 ratio, your 8 to 9% target range used to look quite high, but many other banks are now increasing their own target ranges. Is there any debate about changing your target range for Tier 1 ratio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stuart, as far as shrinking the balance sheet, we are always focused on the size. We realize that this is an issue that has an interest to you, to the rating agencies, to investors and others. And therefore we are focused. We think it's prudent to be focused on it. But as I said earlier in answer to a question, I think you have to look at why it's growing and what's in there and what is driving the effects. So I don't know whether shrinking it, if we were to think about this past quarter, one of the ways of shrinking it would have been the close out those derivative positions. And whether that would have been prudent or not, so you can't look at the absolute size, you've got to look at the composition, you've got to look at how that fits into the business strategy, you've got to look the risk, both credit and market, and you have to look at liquidity and I think we've covered all of those in the past in other questions.</p>
          <p>As far as economic capital, largely unchanged from the fourth quarter. With regard to the Tier 1 ratio, we have always been, and we've had a consistent message of 8 to 9%, and that's when others were lower. We believe 8 to 9% is a good target range. The fact that others have increased to that level and perhaps higher may not change or does not change our view as to where our ratio should be. We think at 9.2%, it indicates capital strength and we revisit it periodically, we look at our peers, we look at our own risk and our own appetite and market opportunities, so we do look at it. But I don't know that we have &#x2013; or I can tell you we don't have plans now to increase that, Stuart.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Georg Kanders from WestLB. I have a question on the net interest income development in PBC as far as suggest from these figures loan volume has grown there and also the deposits, why do we see there a decline, is there a special reason for this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Georg, you've rightly picked up the point. What's happened is we've seen a growth in the loan book and hold on a second, let me just go to some data here so that I can speak with data in front of me. What we've seen is an increase in our loan book and a slight decrease in the margin. The deposit book has increased significantly in PBC, and with our deposit campaign in Neuris Bank (1:20:234) as well as in the rest of our German business, we have been successful in attracting increased deposit base and you can see that from the unsecured funding chart that we showed earlier. However, the higher cost of that has shrunk somewhat the net interest margin on those deposits. Overall, we have an increase from 709 to 742 and we're about flat with the fourth quarter, but it's the combination of both what's happened with balances and we have seen some compression on the margin. Although on the deposit side, it was not a compression that either we did not anticipate or in fact even pursue, because we knew what the result was going to be by offering the competitive rates and we have been successful in attracting significant deposit growth.</p>

We look to understand what is happening in the markets, so market intelligence, and the breadth of our portfolio is important there.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Carsten Werle of Oppenheim, good morning. One follow-up actually on the staff level in corporate banking and securities. I mean it's significantly down in the first quarter by nearly 1000. We don't see any expenses for restructuring activities in the divisional P&amp;L here. So how many of these people have actually left the bank? Is there any risk that we may see restructuring activity expenses coming in future quarters? Perhaps if you can say some words on this topic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, Carsten. You're right, there is a reduction in the head count in CB&amp;S of approximately 1,000. Any of those reductions that were redundancies have already taken place or they wouldn't be in the reduction. And if there were redundancy compensation required, it would be paid and in fact we did have an increase, albeit small, in severance during the quarter. A lot of the people, just over half, came from a mortgage banking operation in the United States, MortgageIT, and the rest of it came from various parts of our sales and trading and corporate finance businesses. As far as redundancy plans, as I said earlier, we are looking to redeploy assets and resources, which would include people, into the high potential businesses. However, we do not have currently any large-scale redundancy or reduction in force plans.</p>

I find 1.77 in leveraged loans, 340 commercial real estate, 310 monolines, is it correct to assume that the sort the delta of about 300 is in Alt-A and, or it's predominantly in Alt-A, or is there something in CDOs or other things?</p>
          <p>The second question is on equity derivatives, if you would strip out the problems you had from the correlation, what's the overall &#x2013; what would the equities <mark type="inaudible" /> and trading revenues look like compared to last year? And lastly, on VAR, in your VAR chart for the quarter, there are sort of three jumps upwards. Are these jumps because of the resetting of the VAR inputs largely, or is this just sort of the market developments?</p>

          <p>Sure, Dirk. The 2.7 are the markdowns in those focused businesses that we talked about. The breakdown is 1.77 billion in leveraged finance, it's just under 550 million in RMBS, and the balance of under 350 million is in our commercial real estate, whole loan business. So that's that point.</p>
          <p>As far as equity derivatives, it is difficult to strip out the effect, because all these issues are interrelated. So what happened with correlation, what happened, you'd have to somehow discount the value of the embedded derivative and figure out how much of that would have happened, and look at the assumption as to how much of the hedge would have worked. So I don't know how to answer that question.</p>
          <p>With regard to the VAR, your point is absolutely correct. Those blips are due to the updating of the market data. In fact our inherent risk in our trading book has remained flat or gone down during the period, so those are technical factors, which are important, because that's how the statistic is calculated, but that's was driving it.</p>

          <p>Just quick follow-up. In, other way of thinking about the equity derivatives question, did your client business decline in the first quarter in equity derivatives? And on the 500 million, is within the 500 million, that includes the 300 million from the monolines, or am I totally off there on the monolines?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're talking the 500 million on RMBS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of that &#x2013; let me answer the second question first. Some of the monoline effect is seeing the offset, the monoline effect is a revenue positive. One of the things that those monoline wrappers are hedging is our Alt-A portfolio, as we show. So there would be some impact on the decrease in the value of the assets, but it's not the total change in the provision for the quarter.</p>
          <p>As far as the other question you raised on equity derivatives, the business has slowed down, so if that was the original question, that is the answer. But to break out what would have happened in the P&amp;L or what the dynamics were is very difficult, Dirk.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I know, but that's, the other one is the more important answer, I think.</p>

          <p>Well, I think this concludes a rather unusual long conference call, but I think it's fair given the reporting quarter and difficult times and Tony I think also on your behalf, thanks for all your strong interest. If there's anything left over, please come back to the IR team and we'll try to help you out of it.</p>
