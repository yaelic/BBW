          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Barclays's Half Year Results Analysts and Investors Conference Call. I will now hand you over to Marcus Agius, Group Chairman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm joined here by Chris Lucas and also by our other ExCo colleagues. Before Chris takes us through the details of our good results for the first half, and before we take Q&amp;A, I'd like to say a few words about our current situation. This has been a difficult few weeks for Barclays. A great deal has been said about recent issues and while we're not going to add to that debate today, we do acknowledge the impact it has had on Barclays' reputation. The board understands clearly the need to address the issues which have been raised and to deal with the current management uncertainty.</p>
          <p>The Barclays' management team, together with our 140,000 employees around the world, is already focused on moving forward. We are committed to serving our customers and our clients and to contributing positively to the many communities in which we operate. We are well positioned to continue to deliver for the bank during this interim period while the board completes its process to identify a new chairman and a new chief executive.</p>
          <p>Despite not having a CEO, we continue to make effective and efficient decisions. As you know, I chair the group's executive committee and this comprises the executive heads of our main businesses and functions. Together, we continue to progress our One Barclays imperative, along with a number of other initiatives, of which you've heard much over the past 18 months. Importantly, we remain committed to maintaining Barclays' position as a leading global universal bank underpinned by a strong and diverse set of businesses. We've also begun the process of repair and recovery, including initiating earlier this week, an independent review of our business practices led by Anthony Salz.</p>
          <p>Our results for the first half of 2012 are good. They demonstrate how the business delivered resilient earnings even in the current difficult macroeconomic environment. You should have every confidence that we will continue to perform through the remainder of the year and beyond.</p>
          <p>So let me hand over to Chris to take us through the results in detail and after that, we'll all be happy to take your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcus, and good morning. We're reporting adjusted profit growth of 13% today with good performances in U.K. Retail and Business Banking, Barclaycard, Corporate Banking and Wealth. There was also a good performance relative to the industry in the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>Operating costs decreased 3% while capital liquidity and funding remained strong with a Core Tier 1 ratio of 10.9%. We've reduced our exposure to the Eurozone and though we have further to go, we've made progress towards our 13% return on equity target.</p>
          <p>Let me take you through the financial headlines before we talk about the individual businesses. In general, my comments compare the first half of this year with the same period last year. Profits increased 13% to &#xA3;4.2 billion on an adjusted basis, which is much larger than the statutory profits of &#xA3;759 million. The adjusted numbers exclude the charge for unloaned credit of &#xA3;2.9 billion, a gain on the sale of a stake in BlackRock of &#xA3;227 million, the additional &#xA3;300 million PPI provision that we told you about in April, and a provision for redress of interest rate hedging products of &#xA3;450 million. I'll used adjusted numbers this morning as usual, to give you a better understanding of the operating trends of the business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the other headlines; total income grew 1% to &#xA3;15.5 billion. Impairment was flat at &#xA3;1.8 billion as reductions in many of our businesses were offset by an increase in Investment Bank. And we've reduced operating cost by 3% to &#xA3;9.5 billion. Together, these movements resulted in adjusted profits of &#xA3;4.2 billion. Return on equity grew to 9.9% and return on tangible equity increased to 11.5%.</p>
          <p>In our three largest businesses, which account for two-thirds of Barclays' risk-weighted assets, returns were at or above our targets. U.K. Retail and Business Banking delivered returns of more than 16%; at Barclaycard they were 22%, and the Investment Bank had rates of return on equity of almost 15%. Other businesses were below our targeted returns and we continue to work to improve them. Our overall cost income ratio improved from 64% to 61% and we've announced a dividend in the second quarter of 1p, bringing the dividend for the first half to 2p.</p>
          <p>I'd like to move now to the performance of the individual businesses. In UK Retail and Business Banking, profits grew 6% to &#xA3;746 million, largely as a result of improved impairment in personal unsecured lending. Total income decreased 2% to &#xA3;2.2 billion, mainly as a result of lower net fees and commissions. Margins have reduced slightly as expected, reflecting a lower benefit from the structural hedges. Net interest income remained broadly stable as a result of higher volumes. Impairment charges reduced by 56% to &#xA3;122 million and the annualized loan rate was 19 basis points compared to 46 basis points in 2011.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased 5% to &#xA3;1.3 billion including costs related to processing PPI claims. Return on equity grew to 16.6%. Customer deposits have grown 2% to &#xA3;114 billion since the year-end, while total loans and advances grew 2% to &#xA3;123 billion driven by growth in mortgage balances with net new mortgage lending of &#xA3;2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>In Europe Retail and Business Banking, we've worked hard to restructure the business and this has helped to reduce the loss of 43% to &#xA3;92 million. Income decreased 20% to &#xA3;486 million, both as a result of the difficult economic environment and the fact the business is now smaller. We've reduced the number of distribution points and head count by 14%.</p>
          <p>Impairment charges increased 35% to &#xA3;157 million due to increased delinquencies across the mortgage book in Spain, Portugal and Italy especially in the second quarter. Profits have decreased 35% to &#xA3;428 million reflecting a restructuring charge of &#xA3;129 million in the same period in 2011 and the benefits from that restructuring.</p>
          <p>In Africa Retail and Business Banking, profits decreased 20% to &#xA3;274 million as a result of increased impairment on mortgages in the Africa recovery book along with adverse currency movements. We're disappointed by the level of provisions and expect to see this moderate in the second half.</p>
          <p>Total income was down 8% to &#xA3;1.6 billion; impairment charges increased 19% to &#xA3;321 million and costs fell 11% to just over &#xA3;1 billion. On a local currency basis, profits decreased 8%. We remain committed to our One Africa strategy and this is an attractive market where we have a strong competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>There was strong growth in Barclaycard with profits up 32% to &#xA3;753 million as a result of balanced growth in UK consumer cards, the acquisitions made in 2011, a significant improvement in the U.S., and good growth in business payments due to higher volumes. Income grew 3% to just over &#xA3;2 billion. Within this, income in the UK was up 2% to &#xA3;1.3 billion and international increased 3% to &#xA3;745 million.</p>
          <p>Impairments improved 29% to &#xA3;460 million as 30 day arrears fell in the UK, U.S. and South Africa. The annualized loan loss rate was 285 basis points compared with 420 basis points in the first half of 2011. Operating expenses grew 8%, reflecting the enlarged business after 2011 acquisitions, PPI processing costs and the investment in the business. Return on equity was well above last year at 22%.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Investment Bank, total income grew 4% to &#xA3;6.5 billion compared to the first half last year. Fixed income currencies and commodities grew 11% to &#xA3;4.4 billion. Equities and prime services fell 12% to just below &#xA3;1 billion and Investment Banking was down 11%, reflecting lower market volumes.</p>
          <p>There were impairment charges of &#xA3;323 million compared to a release of &#xA3;111 million in the same period last year. This included a charge related to legacy CDO assets as well as a corporate default in France.</p>
          <p>Costs fell 3% to &#xA3;3.9 billion after absorbing about two-thirds of the settlement relating to LIBOR. The remainder is accounted for in head office. Performance costs decreased 19% and non-performance costs were up 4% as a result of the LIBOR settlement. Taken together, this resulted in profits decreasing 2% to &#xA3;2.3 billion. The cost to net operating income ratio was within our target range at 64%. And the compensation to income ratio was 39% compared to 45% last year. Return on equity was placed at 15%.</p>
          <p>Since the year-end, we've reduced credit market exposures by &#xA3;2.5 billion to &#xA3;12.7 billion mainly driven by the sale of commercial real estate loans and properties. If you compare second quarter performance with that of the second quarter last year, income was up 5%. Despite subdued market volumes, we continue to grow share in many of our business lines including debt capital markets where we've retained our number two position in the global lead tables; equity capital markets where our share grew from 3.6% to 4.8% in the first half; and M&amp;A where share increased during the first half from 13% to 15.6%.</p>
          <p>In Corporate Banking, we've continued to make good progress in group profits to &#xA3;346 million. This compares to &#xA3;54 million for the same period last year. Within this, profits in the UK grew 18% to &#xA3;487 million; the loss in Europe was &#xA3;180 million, which is an improvement of 50%; and there was a profit in other corporate markets of &#xA3;39 million compared to breakeven for the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Impairment reduced 31% to &#xA3;425 million with a substantial improvement in Spain as a result of reduced exposure to the property and construction sector. Costs fell 16% to &#xA3;754 million due to restructuring in 2011. Return on equity improved from under 1% to 6%.</p>
          <p>Wealth and Investment Management profits grew 38% to &#xA3;121 million. Income grew 5% to &#xA3;892 million. Costs grew just 1% despite ongoing investment in the business and client assets grew to &#xA3;176 billion. The return on equity grew to 10%. We expect Wealth to become a significant contributor to Group profits as a result of our investment program.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to capital liquidity and funding, our Core Tier 1 ratio remains strong at 10.9% with risk-weighted assets stable at &#xA3;390 billion. Adjusted gross leverage was 20 times and we had a liquidity pool of &#xA3;170 billion at the end of June. 92% is held in cash, highly liquid government bonds and deposits with Central Banks. Our wholesale term funding maturities for 2012 are &#xA3;27 billion and we've already raised &#xA3;20 billion during the first half. While our long-term credit ratings moved down in the second quarter, our short-term ratings remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>We continue to manage the business to absorb changing regulation. We're pleased that risk-weighted assets have remained broadly unchanged in the last 12 months despite the implementation of Basel 2.5. Allowing for consensus retained earnings for the second half and assuming no organic RWA growth, we estimate our Core Tier 1 ratio will improve to 11.3% at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>I'd like to share our current thinking on Basel 3 implementation, which is scheduled to start from 2013. Based on our current estimates of the RWA impact, we expect our Core Tier 1 ratio to reduce to 9.2% taking into account consensus retained earnings in 2013. This improves to 10.3% by the end of next year. These pro forma ratios are indicative as the rules are yet to be published and are clearly subject to change. Further phased capital reductions under Basel 3 transition rules are likely to reduce our Core Tier 1 ratio by about 60 basis points in total between 2014 and 2018.</p>
          <p>If we were to apply all these deductions at the end of 2013, our fully loaded Core Tier 1 ratio would be 9.7%. The equivalent fully loaded figure for the end of June this year would be 7.9%. This takes no account of our planned management actions and future profit generation. For me, these numbers demonstrate the solidity of our capital. There's more detail on the impacts of Basel 3 in the appendix.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to costs. We've reduced overall costs by 3% to &#xA3;9.5 billion while income grew 1% to &#xA3;15.5 billion. As a result, the cost to income ratio decreased from 64% to 61%. Performance costs were down 14% to &#xA3;1.4 billion despite the income growth and non-performance costs reduced 1%. We know we have further work to do to create the right balance for all of our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at non-performance costs in more detail, in the first quarter, we told you that our cost reduction program would result in a non-performance cost base of about &#xA3;15.5 billion in 2013. We've reduced the run rates of non-performance costs by almost &#xA3;600 million in the second half of last year through actions such as head count reduction and infrastructure consolidation. We've sustained these savings into the first half this year and this has allowed us to absorb regulatory and investment costs of about &#xA3;450 million.</p>
          <p>Excluding the LIBOR settlement, non-performance costs in the first half were &#xA3;7.8 billion. During these six months, we've largely achieved the cost run rate necessary to deliver a &#xA3;2 billion reduction in non-performance costs. We aim to maintain this run rate and self-fund any additional investment in the business over the next 18 months.</p>
          <p>Before I close, I'd like to take you through our Eurozone exposures. As you'd expect, we continued to manage our risks carefully in Europe, focusing especially on re-denomination. We've taken a series of actions this year to reduce local net funding mismatches in Spain and Portugal, including drawing down &#x20AC;8.2 billion from the ECB's three-year LTRO and growing deposits in Spain. Since the year-end, net funding of the Spanish balance sheet by the group reduced from &#xA3;12.1 billion to &#xA3;2.5 billion and for Portugal it fell 46% to &#xA3;3.7 billion.</p>
          <p>We have reduced sovereign exposure to Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus and Greece by 22% in the last six months to &#xA3;5.6 billion. Spanish sovereign exposures decreased to &#xA3;2.2 billion. Our financial institution exposure also totaled &#xA3;5.6 billion; a significant part of this relates to a non-Irish bank with administrative centers in Dublin but with little Irish exposure.</p>
          <p>The majority of our corporate and retail exposures are in Spain, Italy and Portugal. Our corporate exposures in these markets decreased to &#xA3;10 billion. As you know, we've already taken substantial provisions in this portfolio, especially in Spain, with credit risk loans 54% covered. Impairment charges in our corporate book in Spain continue to decline.</p>
          <p>Retail lending in Spain, Italy and Portugal decreased 5% to just under &#xA3;40 billion. About three-quarters of this relates to residential mortgages in Spain and Italy and have an average loan to value of 63% and 47% respectively. Credit risk loan coverage ratios were broadly stable.</p>
          <p>As far as the outlook is concerned, while it's too early to predict an outcome for the full year, performance in July has continued to be ahead of last year. We continue to remain cautious about the operating environment, however and will maintain a strong capital leverage and liquidity position.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we're reporting a resilient performance for the first half. Adjusted profits grew 13% with good profits in UK Retail and Business Banking, Barclaycard, Corporate Banking and Wealth as well as good performance relative to the industry in the Investment bank.</p>
          <p>Operating costs decreased 3% and capital liquidity and funding remained strong with a Core Tier 1 ratio of 10.9%. We've reduced our exposure to the Eurozone and though we have further to go, we've made progress towards our 13% return on equity target.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much indeed. Let me now hand you back to Marcus.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. I'm sure you all have questions, but let me first address the following point which I know is of interest. The board is focused in its efforts to find a new Chief Executive and to find a replacement for me as Chairman. Presently, processes are already well underway but our intention is to identify a new Chairman first as it's important for an incoming CEO to know who that will be.</p>
          <p>Above all, we are conscious of the need to move quickly and assuredly but it's also vital that our stakeholders are convinced by the rigor of the search and so are confident that we have selected the best candidate. And we will, of course, update you on progress when it's appropriate to do so.</p>
          <p>So with that wonderful extra bit, I'm going to start the Q&amp;A and because I imagine most of the questions are going to be about numbers, I'll ask Chris to chair this part of the questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And the first question today comes from Andrew Coombs from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I have two &#x2013; actually three questions please; one on the Investment Bank, one on UK Retail and then just one on your slides on your European businesses.</p>
          <p>Firstly with regard to the Investment Bank, I'd just like to drill down to the fixed income result, down 18% Q-on-Q. Your peers are pretty close to down 40% so just interested to know what products are driving that? I know you make a reference to rates and commodities but if you can perhaps expand a bit on that? And also, how sustainable you think that improvement is relative to the wider peer group in terms of market share gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, good morning. Can I ask Rich to just give you a bit of color on that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Andrew. It was a good quarter for us. I think we did mention rates and commodities. I'll cover more detail in a moment but clearly it's been volume driven. We continued to take share. We were joint number one in terms of market share this year again. And it's stretched, slightly offset by some decrease in structured products, but it's fairly widespread across the spectrum of products. It's really driven by volumes and some renewed investor confidence. I do believe it's sustainable. I think that the way we've built out our FIC business over the years and the fact that it's flow driven is helping. It's been a good quarter and half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, your second part of your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll put this, the second and third part together because they're both fairly short. The second question was on the one-off provision release in the UK Retail business that you referenced. How do you quantify that? And then final question, you talk about a funding mismatch in Spain of &#xA3;2.5 billion and Portugal of &#xA3;3.7 billion. Perhaps you could quantify the funding mismatch in Italy for us as well, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure there's a major provision release in the UK Retail Bank. There is certainly some improvement on impairment in the unsecured business. And I'll ask Robert just mention that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just quickly look at that. You're right to notice that the UK Retail Bank impairment in this half is down significantly from last year and from the second half of last year. There's no large sort of single release. There's always adjustments we make when we look at models so during this half we looked at LGD or loan severity and made adjustments to that. There's been some operational improvements in some of the processes; that gives us a different impairment outlook.</p>
          <p>So listen, bottom line here is that very good impairment for the first half. Impairment will be naturally then higher in the second half for us in the Retail Bank this year, but lower than it was last year in the second half. So the positive trends in Retail Bank will continue and it's a stable credit environment basically in the Retail Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Robert, can you touch on re-denomination risk and the gap in Italy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. I mean listen, when we look at re-denomination risk around Europe in general, remember before we get into that that our Western Europe businesses are for the most part a set of conservative mortgage portfolios. And although the credit performance, of course, has been affected by the environment, those mortgage books have good asset quality and good impairment coverage and there's a bit more information you'll notice in the appendix that describes Italy, Spain and Portugal and the composition and sectors for the mortgage book. I think that &#x2013; I hope that will be somewhat helpful. We do have a commercial lending business. It's much smaller and as Chris mentioned, we have very good impairment there with declining impairment on commercial property lending in Spain over the past couple of years.</p>
          <p>But broader Eurozone risk, we've conducted a lot of stress tests since the beginning of 2010, both internal stress tests and regulatory stress tests; and from all of them, we've had satisfactory results from an income point of view, from a balance sheet point of view, from a capital point of view. And as Chris mentioned, in the first half of this year we've reduced re-denomination risks principally in Spain and Portugal where we focused, and the numbers are in the results, but from about &#xA3;12 billion to &#xA3;2.5 billion of net funding into Spain and from about &#xA3;7 billion to about &#xA3;3.5 billion or &#xA3;3.7 billion in Portugal.</p>
          <p>We achieved that mostly by doing about &#x20AC;8 billion of LTROs through the local Central Banks as part of the ECB program. But we've been reducing assets both in terms of what's been originated and through some AFS asset sales. And we've raised more liabilities locally principally in Spain where we brought on about &#xA3;3 billion of additional local wholesale deposits.</p>
          <p>So, overall, I think there's been a pretty substantial reduction in the re-denomination risk in Portugal and in Spain and we've got to focus now on looking at Italy. But we wanted to try to address Spain and Portugal earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. I mean, perhaps you could just share what the deposits are in Italy. That would be useful.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The increased deposits in Italy or in Spain, I'm not sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm so sorry. In Italy, what the deposit figure is because you provide very good disclosure on the loan side of the book but perhaps if we could have a deposit figure. Sorry, please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question today comes from Michael Helsby of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, everyone. The &#x2013; I'm just looking at the cost performance which is clearly very strong, Chris, and looks like behind it was a reduction in the comp ratio as well as the non-performance costs. So the comp ratio is overall 33% versus 37%. Is that a reflection of you've just not done your bonus accruals properly yet or is that a reflection of a bit of a step change that we can think of and carry forwards? And I've got a completely unrelated question on the hedge revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me answer that and then we'll do &#x2013; we'll take revenues. The movement you've seen, I think, is not because we haven't done our accruals properly. If anything, we've done our accruals with more rigor than we normally do because we've given you more granular disclosure.</p>
          <p>What we've seen in terms of where we've set the provisions and accruals is the view that there is a step change that's taken place and the sorts of levels you can see are exactly what we say when we say we pay for performance. And we have worked to start to move the allocation on returns from stakeholders to other stakeholders which is very much what we say we'd do at the AGM and what you've seen in these numbers is that put into practice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I can comment on that. The &#x2013; this was an area of great debate at the time &#x2013; around the time of the AGM and shareholders, quite rightly, have been pressing for a greater share of the cake as compared with employees and we obviously understand that and have listened to that. But at the same time, as we observed then, there's a limit set of the rate at which we can do that. What you have seen here is further progress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I should take it as this is, as you say, a step change that we can think about as going forwards. That's good.</p>
          <p>And just secondly, clearly, the hedge revenue historically has been quite a topic of debate and I note that it's down again quite a lot in the first half. I was wondering if you could just comment whether there's any gilt gains in that hedge revenue in the first half of &#xA3;6 million, &#xA3;8 million, &#xA3;9 million and if you could just give us an idea on what the amortization rate you would expect for that in the second half? And then if you can, excluding any more disposals, what it might be for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can confirm there's no abnormal non-recurring gilts gain in those numbers. What you see is very much the pure numbers as the hedges continue to generate about &#xA3;800 million contribution in the first half. That is going to continue to decay and you should expect to see it falling off as we continue into the second half. But I'm not going to give you a profit forecast in relation to that for the future. What I think you've got in the results is a pretty clear view of the amortization over the first half.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. The next question today is from JP Crutchley from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, chaps. I've got two questions, actually maybe a few questions, if I can. The first to Rich and then I have two follow-ups with Chris.</p>
          <p>Rich, I guess now where your head is as the sole head of BIB, when you sort of look at BIB performance, I mean there's still &#x2013; we sort of expected to hear over a period of time was one where the group would become more balanced, less dependent on FIC and equities and the Investment Banking business would very much pick up the slack there presenting more of a more balanced stool, if you like, three-legged stool.</p>
          <p>And I guess if you look at the performance, I mean clearly it's still based on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:39) comes from FIC and the other two legs. So it really looked like they're maybe stepping up and moving forwards; I know it's a difficult market and the rest of it. But I guess now that you've got sole charge, if you like, of the BIB, how are you looking over business going forward? Do you see any need for any sort of radical re-think of that implementation or executional strategy? Is it right to maybe refocus on the things that you clearly excel at and de-emphasize others where you don't seem to be sort of moving up the pace? I just wanted you to comment on that and I have another question for Chris afterwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks JP. First of all, I think that you're right about tough markets. I point to the stats that Chris read out about the progress we're making in ECM and in Investment Banking in terms of taking share. And I suppose we'll only see how good we are is when markets come back but we're very confident that the investment we've made is paying off in that share gain.</p>
          <p>I also look at things like we're number one now in the UK in M&amp;A; we're number three in the United States in M&amp;A. Again, difficult markets, but I think that because we chose to build when we did on the back of the big Lehman franchise, people are willing to listen to a different voice. And I'm very pleased with the development of those franchises.</p>
          <p>I look at our corporate brokerage mandate here in the UK. We started at zero in 2010; we're now at 30 and no one's even close to the net gains we've had so I feel good about it. Do we always look to be as efficient as we can be in terms of how we execute our services and products? Yes, absolutely. But am I planning a big size of scale reduction or any of these big head count reductions we're seeing other houses? No. I think we've been in front of that and we're pleased with the investments we're making. We're pleased at the way they're performing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, JP, you had a second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I did have; sort of two big think questions for you, Chris. The first was I think something happened on the pension funds; I saw there was a hit to Core Tier 1 there. I just wondered if you can just comment around that.</p>
          <p>And the second one was just on liquidity portfolio which is clearly very large now and obviously there appears to be an element of a wind of change in terms of regulatory attitudes towards that. And I wonder if you could envision that portfolio actually reducing over time as opposed to growing it ahead again in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try and answer that. The pension is the payment we made for the deficit reduction which is part of what the agreement was with the trustees' completion of last tri-annual evaluation. The impact of that has played through Core Tier 1 and that's part of the reason that the Core Tier 1 growth looks fairly low. I think there's not much more to say than that, JP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the actual reduction from that, Chris? It's probably in the statement; I just haven't found it yet. What was the Core Tier 1 impact in the half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Core Tier 1 impact was I think around about 20 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the liquidity portfolio, we manage it quite carefully. We think it's at the right sort of level. I'm fairly relaxed as to whether it's at &#xA3;170 billion or &#xA3;150 billion so it's in the sort of area that we like to have it. There's quite a bit of active management of it as we look at what we can do to minimize the cost of it, but the key thing from our perspective is it has to be a liquidity pull rather than a pull that generates a return. So we look at the liquidity of it first and then look to see how we can minimize the cost of carry but it's in the sort of region that you would expect or I'd expect.</p>

          <p>Thank you. And the next question today comes from Tom Rayner of Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everybody. I just have a couple of questions, please; maybe one &#x2013; first one for Marcus, second one for Chris. Marcus, I saw I think a quote from you on the newswire this morning saying Barclays remains committed to being a leading global universal bank. I just wondered if we can infer from those comments that whoever the new Chief Executive might be, he's not going to come in with a mandate to try and split the group up or make it a much more domestic-focused operation.</p>
          <p>And I have a second question on margins, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question and the reason I gave such a definitive announcement is that's what we meant to say. The fact is in any organization, the strategy is set by the board. Of course, it's promoted and taken to the board through the executives. But at the end of the day, it's settled by the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors remains fixed on its belief that the global universal banking model is the one that is right for Barclays.</p>
          <p>So that's not to say that any new Chief Executive coming in won't look at what he's got and won't discuss with the board any ideas he may have. But the idea is we're not looking for someone to come in and change everything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You had a second question as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's just back on the margin. When I look at your sort of margin presentation on page 35, if I look at first half versus first half, it looks like a fairly comfortable progression; customer margins sort of a bit of ongoing sort of across the division; some going up, some going down. But it looks fairly comfortable and the total sort of margin figure over the space of a year looks quite comfortable.</p>
          <p>When you compare it to the second half of last year, it looks like a much more severe drop and I suspect it really reflects the sort of the impacts of the gilt sales and how they sort of fed into the numbers. I was wondering if you could maybe help clear this up in terms of what you think the sort of ongoing underlying margin pressures are. Does it really reflect the sort of year-on-year comparison or is that first half, second half demonstrating that things might have gone a bit tougher in the last six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Tom, you pretty much answered the question. The second half was benefited from the gilt gain, so if you look at first half 2012 versus first half 2011 you get a better picture of the underlying margin movement. And that, I think, is down from about 197 basis points to 189 so it gives you the impact of that 8 basis points in half year on half year.</p>
          <p>And I think we would expect to see the same sort of continuing progression that we saw in first half on first half. The one thing this doesn't take account of which, this is important, is volume growth. And what we're seeing is the decline in margin being offset by some volume growth that helps at the net interest income level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. The next question this morning is from Manus Costello from Autonomous. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I have a couple of questions on capital fees, one for Chris and one for Marcus. Chris, in your very helpful new slide about the impact of Basel 3, I noticed that you've reduced the scale of management actions, mitigation, that you're planning. I think you were previously in the high 40s and you're now talking about &#xA3;34 billion of mitigation. I wondered if that's come down because you're taking a less aggressive view on tweaking models or why that's changed.</p>
          <p>And secondly, for Marcus, I noted in the letters which were published by the Treasury Select Committee that in your statement to Adair Turner you were pointing out that there was a guideline capital ratio for Barclays of 10.3% which was demanded at the end of 2011. I wondered, Marcus, how you thought the FPC guidance on capital was evolving for Barclays, whether that 10.3% was likely to be moving up or down in the near term? And as a follow-on from that, how much buffer you would want to maintain on top of that FSA guidance, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the first part and then we'll see where we go in the second. The reduction in management actions, I think, is largely because the balance has been delivered and is already included in the numbers. And you'll know that we had quite a successful implementation of Basel 2.5 where we had approved the management actions. I think also the numbers evolve over time as we become more certain in terms of deliver so the numbers I've given today are our best estimates of the available management actions that we still have to complete. But I think that's a pretty good summary of where we are.</p>
          <p>In terms of the FSA and ECB guidelines, let me start that 10.3% was a number that we were working to. The FSA and the European banking authority had a 9% number for the stress test and we cleared that comfortably. In terms of where I think we try to operate the group, it's somewhere around about 10% and we look at that over a period of time. So if it was slightly below that that will be fine and if it was slightly above it, it would be equally fine. But that's the number we use for planning purposes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and if I could just make a quick general comment on the relationship with that part of the regulatory system generally, it's in a statement -- a state of flux and we are still regulated by the FSA. That's not going to happen too much longer. The FPC is getting up and running. It is going to be, I think, a new style of regulation and the FPC is probably going to be more judgmental than the FSA.</p>
          <p>Certainly, they will focus on capital as they should and I think if I can articulate what you have probably heard from them at the moment, I think generally, they remain concerned as we all do about the situation in Europe and, therefore, all things being equal, they prefer more capital to less capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to interpolate from that, you think the 10.3%, therefore, is likely to move up not down, obviously?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everybody. Could I have two areas of questioning please? Firstly, could I invite some comments on the impairment outlook for the group overall? Just wanted to check that given the recent events in the Eurozone as well as perhaps some of the GDP data, are you still comfortable with your impairment guidance?</p>
          <p>And I've got two other related questions on liquidity if I may just after.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask Robert to respond on impairment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Raul. I think you've raised some interesting components of that looking at GDP, looking at developments in the Eurozone; and we look pretty carefully at our portfolios in all our businesses in all the geographies.</p>
          <p>I think the trends in the first half were mixed across the different businesses as you could see. And I'd say for the second half overall, that the retail and wholesale trends you've seen will be fairly steady and will continue. And although there will be different changes within the individual businesses, overall the total impairment in the second half will look pretty similar to that in the first half.</p>
          <p>So we'll see continued difficult times in Western Europe, Spain and Portugal, for example. We'll see continued strong performance in U.S. and UK Retail Banking. We'll see more normal conditions in the Investment Bank, et cetera. But overall, I would say second half to look more or less similar to what we've seen in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And second question, sort of two sub-areas within that, is around your liquidity. It does appear that the group is holding liquidity well above what you might expect it to given the comments that we've had recently from the FPC so your liquidity pool is &#xA3;170 billion. It looks like it's close to the top end of it. Could I invite you to comment on whether you're consciously holding that while you have the uncertain period ahead of you right now?</p>
          <p>And then the second part of my question on liquidity was your LCR ratio. That has come up significantly; it's up to 97% now, you say, from 82% the previous time you talked about. That's quite a material improvement as far as I can see. Could you just talk about what's driving that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The two questions are sort of connected as you quite rightly say. At &#xA3;170 billion, we feel that the liquidity pool is in a good place. It may be a bit higher than we planned but bear in mind that this is not a complete precision exercise. You can't land a pool of that size on a pinhead. So some of it &#x2013; it's altered by, for example, the level of deposits that you receive on the end of the period, which at lunch time you didn't expect to come in but by the evening you have.</p>
          <p>So therefore, whenever you ask me what sort of level I look at, I always have a range in my mind. For us, &#xA3;170 billion is probably at the higher end of the range. That's no problem given the environment in which we operate. And I think if it was slightly lower than that that would similarly not give me a problem.</p>
          <p>In terms of the LCR, I think it's very much the number that they come out in that system. We report that to you recognizing that it's not at the current stage how we run the group because it's not yet finalized in form. But I do notice that over 100%, very close to the 100% for the stable funding ratio and LCR. Of course, it's in good place for when they do become binding constraints.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. If I can just follow-up, so we've started to see the other UK banks reducing their liquidity buffers and that appears to have a positive impact in various ways on the P&amp;L. Would that be something that we can expect form Barclays as well going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You could expect that this is at the top end of the range and there may be some downward reduction, but it's in very much where I'd like it to be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I had a couple of questions if possible. The first one was just on UK loan growth and how that's evolving. Obviously, you're still able to grow in UK Retail which is good news and so growth rate had slowed down a bit. I was just trying to work out are you going to use the funding for lending scheme and how do you see your ability to take share versus system loan growth?</p>
          <p>And the second one was on...</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chris. Let me say I'm very grateful for your asking me a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say firstly, that I am very pleased with the performance of the Retail and Business Bank in the first half of this year. If you look across the product lines between Barclaycard and the Retail Bank, we've added 1 million new accounts in the first half of the year in a very difficult environment.</p>
          <p>In general, we are taking share from our competitors in the market although the market itself is quite subdued. So you'll see continued growth in mortgages, continued growth in small businesses, small business lending at a relatively subdued pace given what's going on in the market. I think you would say the same for corporate lending in the UK. The trend of corporates being reluctant to borrow and continuing to build cash has continued.</p>
          <p>So the net of it is we expect the market to be quite subdued for the foreseeable future in terms of overall growth. But we also expect to continue to grow our share disproportionately quicker than the market because of all the very good things we're doing with customers.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the funding for lending program, we are very supportive of the funding for lending program. We expect to be a leading participant within it just as we've been the leading participant in the National Loan Guarantee Scheme. And it's also important to us that the benefits of those programs in financial terms are passed on to customers and we'll be ensuring that that happens.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Chris, you had a second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the second one was just actually on sort of deposit margins and how you see the competition there. I mean, as far as I can understand, it's sort of jacked up a bit as people are trying to out rebounds, LDRs; and also not in a competition side, the flattening of the yield curve, how that's impacting those deposit margins? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again, Chris, it's Antony. We've been very pleased with our performance in the savings market this year. Of those million accounts, 400 of them &#x2013; 400,000 of them were new savings accounts and we've been able to do it by putting out products which really work for customers so not fees or rates for them to fall off a cliff at the end of the intro period. And I think we'll continue to be competitive. We have seen a bit more interest in liabilities in the UK market but we've continued to do very well in terms of share and I expect us to do so in the future.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. I've got one question on ICB and a couple of quick ones. On ICB run-ups, your competitors seems to be keen to speed up refinancing. Would you consider something similar?</p>
          <p>And related to ICB, the regulators say the cost of it will be &#xA3;4 billion to &#xA3;7 billion; you there have given some kind of number of &#xA3;6 billion to &#xA3;9 billion of impact on their investments. How much to do think this number is for Barclays?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the question and then ask, maybe, Marcus to comment on the position with the ICB. The &#xA3;4 billion to &#xA3;7 billion, I think, was the total from the U.K. banking sector of the expected impact of the ICB. I think we also said that within that, Barclays would be over &#xA3;1 billion and we haven't really reworked the numbers so it's &#x2013; those remain appropriate and our best estimates. Marcus, in terms of the ICB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the ICB, I mean it's a work in progress and the final shape is not clear but we are working very hard to &#x2013; with the system and I think &#x2013; I'm sure we'll keep you informed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do I think we're trying to speed up the project? No. But is there plenty of work going on to get prepared, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could follow up on, Marcus, on some comments that you made. Do you just want to clarify at what stage are you in the appointment of the new chairman, CEO process? Have you formally interviewed any candidates or are you still in the process of short-listing them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to get into that much detail except to repeat the sort of general policy which we're following which is what I call the Goldilocks policy. In other words it's not too fast, nor too slow. In situations like the ones we're in, it's very tempting to find a quick solution for obvious reasons. Invariably, that's the wrong thing to do because you need to make a very, very careful choice. These are two very important positions and they need to be filled by people who have absolute credibility and who can be seen by the external world as being the right people for the job. So that's going to take as long as it takes. We are &#x2013; I've said that; we are moving as fast as we sensibly can. Sorry to be so vague, but when we've got plans to tell you, we'll tell you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And Chris, just on the redressal provisions for interest rate hedges, what is the basis of calculating that and what would change that basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The &#xA3;450 million that we've booked really breaks out into two parts. It breaks down into the redress estimate of about &#xA3;350 million. And that is based on our initial assessment of the cost of responding to the FSA and the bank's agreed work plan and it is an early estimate. So it's our best number, but obviously, there's a degree of latitude around it.</p>
          <p>The balance, the &#xA3;100 million, is due to an accounting requirement, which in effect values the new loans you put on the book at the current credit spread. That creates an immediate loss as you enter into the transactions, which amortizes over the life of the loan. So the &#xA3;450 million is best thought of as &#xA3;350 million redress, &#xA3;100 million credit spread adjustment that reverses over the life. So we've reported it as &#xA3;450 million, but you could recognize that the net number is &#xA3;350 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Can I &#x2013; I've got two areas of questioning, actually. The first one is back on currency re-denomination risk. Thanks very much for the disclosures that you've given on that; I think they're very useful. Can I just check your attitude really to reducing those exposures further? And in particular, if you could perhaps sort of explain why you didn't take more LTRO funding, for example, which would have been a quick and easy way and I guess, cheap way of cutting that local mismatch. And also, if you are planning to cut it further, by what means will that happen? Is it asset reduction or is it issuance of local funding of one sort to another?</p>
          <p>And then my second question is really a big picture one which is how do you ensure &#x2013; after the loss of the senior management in the firm, how do you ensure that the business continues to motor along? And in particular, we're getting questions coming in about how resilient certain franchises within the bank, particularly within the Investment Bank, will be in the absence of senior management and perhaps, therefore, clarity of strategy. I wondered if you could just address that as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask Robert to touch on re-denomination risk as we look forward and then I think Marcus is best suited to answer the second of your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning. We are going to be looking at all the possible asset and liability combinations to address the re-denomination exposure. On the asset side, we're being careful anyway from a sort of conservative risk appetite point of view about the type and rate of asset origination in our mortgage and commercial books in Western Europe. And so that will have some effect. And we're also looking at ways and have been successful in ways to sell some of our available for sale assets over time into the right market conditions.</p>
          <p>And on the funding side, we will continue to pick up deposits. Some will be wholesale and, to some degree, we'll be able to pick up retail although as you're aware that's become more expensive and more difficult to do over time. We're also planning to use greater Central Bank funding against local assets. In other words, basically using mortgages as collateral for Central Bank funding in the different countries and I think we'll focus on Italy in the second half.</p>
          <p>You asked a question of how we chose how much to do in LTRO. Last time, I would say we were comfortable with the &#xA3;8 million we did. There were a number of reasons, none of them particularly spectacularly unique but we think it was a good balance there and that puts us in a good position. And so, I think going forward, you would expect us to see some focus on Italy and using more of our assets in that basis.</p>
          <p>And just to touch back on the question that came out very early in the call today about deposit base in Italy, I'm not aware that we break out those numbers but what I would say simply to help answer that question, if I may, is that when you think about how we will be increasing funding locally in those markets, think of us as doing more asset-based financing in Western Europe rather than pure retail deposits. It's very difficult to increase retail deposits in this market by substantial volumes in a short period time so think of our strategy as more asset-based.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, do you mind if I just follow-up? Are you &#x2013; is it your intention really to take those mismatches down to zero ultimately?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have a &#x2013; clearly a zero target. I think we want to manage these things within a risk appetite. When you look at those notional exposure numbers that &#x2013; those are the numbers you've seen; those are not sort of profit at risk numbers. Those are notional exposure numbers. You would consider some fraction of those to be your risk in the event of a breakup of the euro or an exit of the euro. And we have some risk appetite around that given the probability of those events as you could imagine. So we don't have a clear zero target. We've said we want manage it on a cost and benefit basis on a dynamic basis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jon, on the question of the health of the business, it's a very important question and we're going to take a little bit of time to answer it because it is so important. In a moment, I'm going to ask Rich and Antony and Tom Kalaris to talk in terms about their own businesses and what they're seeing. But I'd start by making an absolutely crucial general point, which is typically when you see companies in crisis, and particularly when they're looking for a new Chief Executive, the new Chief Executive is coming in to fix a broken business. We are in exactly the opposite situation.</p>
          <p>You can see from these figures, our business is not only <mark type="ph" /> imbued with (1:00:42) health, it's doing well. And not only is that the case, but the people who have driven those results are sitting around the table with me today. So from that point of view, we feel comfortable. That doesn't mean that we're going to drag the search for the new incoming Chief Executive and Chairman; we're not. As I said earlier, we'll do that as fast as it make sense to get the right quality person. But it is vital to reassure people that this is a great business.</p>
          <p>And from that point of view, I'm actually looking forward to some of the interviews we're going to have with the potential Chief Executive candidates because anyone who hasn't got their wits to realize what a great opportunity this is shouldn't be in that list. Anyway, with those general comments, let me start with you, Rich, and then Tom and then Antony just to give some color as to what it feels like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marcus. Hi, Jon. First, I would point out that not all of senior management has left the Investment Bank. I'm still here as well as our Executive Committee in the Investment Bank is still there.</p>
          <p>I think from a business and franchise perspective, our clients have been incredibly supportive. Our pipeline is at an all-time high. We recognize that there's been some reputational damage done and we've got some work to do in helping repair that. We've announced some initiatives internally around looking at our businesses with a reputational lens, looking at our rewards and evaluation process to make sure that we're incenting the right behaviors. And we're also looking at a business practices review, all dovetailed with the work that the board is leading and Anthony Salz is leading.</p>
          <p>But the franchise is actually in good health. I think that as I said, clients have been incredibly resilient. You can see by the performance of the business, it's been very good. As I mentioned, the pipeline is very strong.</p>
          <p>On the Corporate Bank, which has a large majority of our clients here in the UK, we've touched 92% of our clients; 1% of them had some issues, whether it'd be redress or issues with us on &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> our plans (1:02:40) around the LIBOR situation, but again remains very supportive and we're also taking market share there. So I'm not worried about the overall health of the franchise. I think we've got other things to worry about, regulatory environment, Europe. But I'm not worried about the health of the franchise.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't repeat what Richard said other than to reinforce that we really have the same experience in Wealth Management. And frankly, as you know, we have a clear and well-articulated game plan to reposition the business. You're seeing the results &#x2013; you see the results in the asset growth; you see the results in deposit growth. So from our perspective, the numbers speak for themselves so we're quite pleased about where the franchise is and where it's going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And from the RBB perspective, as I mentioned before, we've seen a very strong financial performance in our two big businesses, Barclaycard and the Retail Bank. But also equally gratifying, as a result of the emphasis we've been placing on the customer in the last 2.5 years, we've seen very strong growth in the underlying drivers of the business.</p>
          <p>In terms of the impact of the recent events on how customers are feeling, it's true to say that a small number of customers have been disappointed and frustrated in Barclays but we have seen no large-scale movement of accounts nor have we seen any decline in the rate at which we've been booking new business.</p>
          <p>So the franchise is very strong. The management team of RBB and the colleagues within it are committed to Barclays and committed to continuing to serve our customers.</p>

          <p>Let's have the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Ian Gordon of Investec. Ian, please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Good morning. It's just one quick follow-up on Spain, please. You dealt with earlier &#x2013; you explained earlier the substantial fall in the incremental impairment within Corporate. Just on the Retail side, obviously we can see that that impairment charge has ticked up a little bit. But looking at the additional disclosures which Robert mentioned earlier, in terms of arrears, if I'm reading the data right, there's been no deterioration at all in Italy; in Spain 0.7% in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:02) plus arrears is still a very low number. And indeed, even looking at your disclosures for forbearance, the increase in forbearance in the first half even in Spain, which you have pulled out in your comments, doesn't seem to be material to me.</p>
          <p>So is the explanation for your differentiated performance just simply the different geographic profile and the different behavioral profile coming from your avoidance of the expat community or is it something much more fundamental than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is broadly those things and I do think those things are actually very fundamental. There's sort of four factors I think of when I think about the quality of a mortgage book in a place like Spain. One would be very simply the channel. How much do we originate ourselves through branches versus how much through third parties or brokers? And the business we originate ourselves, which is the vast majority of what we do, is always safer and better business.</p>
          <p>There is, of course, also the location within Spain and you'll see from the appendix &#x2013; basically, if you think of Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, that's more than 50% of our business. It's a very urban business and the problems there have been, as you know, in second homes, in vacation homes and on the coast a lot. I think Madrid center itself has only seen something like a 10% property price drop all through this crisis. The customer profile is very critical and we've been careful about that. But then the mix of segments, as whether it's first home, second home and type of home is important as well.</p>
          <p>Listen, just to give you a quick sense of why I think we do have &#x2013; an indicator here of why I think we do have a good quality mortgage business there, there is available across industry statistics for the total number of properties in possession in Spain. And that number is about 380,000 properties in possession. We're about 2% to 3%, call it 2.5% of the market in mortgages in Spain so you would expect us to have a similar proportion of properties in possession.</p>
          <p>But we have about one-tenth of the amount of properties in possession we should have. Now that doesn't prove everything about the whole business, but it's a pretty useful indicator. If we're running at 10% of our share of properties in possession, I think that's a reasonable, quick thumbnail sketch of the kind of quality of assets we have in our mortgage book there.</p>

Are we supposed to infer from that &#xA3;7.8 billion of costs there, excluding LIBOR, of course, that's an ongoing run rate for the current business environment? Are you basically happy with that and that we shouldn't expect further cost reductions to bring that number lower?</p>

          <p>Let me answer that one, Andrew. The &#x2013; on page 19, the &#xA3;7,779 million is the...</p>

          <p>...H1 2002 (sic) [2012] non-performance cost level which also is the amount, if you annualize it, it's &#xA3;15.5 billion. It's the number that we gave you last year for the stock of costs that you have to get to to get the &#xA3;2 billion run-rate reduction.</p>
          <p>So what you should expect is it's annualized to be the sort of non-performance cost number that you should expect to see as we go into 2013. If we want to spend more than that, we have to self-fund it through further reductions. So what we've in effect done is taken a run-rate number, the &#xA3;2 billion, because this translates to an annualized non-performance cost of &#xA3;15.8 billion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right, I see. Okay, thank you very much. And then I've got a question on the Investment Bank provisions. You've highlighted ABS, CDO, super-senior positions as one of the reasons for the increase in provisions. I was wondering if you could give more color as to whether they're one-off in nature or whether you're sensing a deterioration in provisioning going on there on an underlying basis?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me ask Rich to comment, but my sort of high level view would be this is an adjustment we make periodically to reflect the market value of &#x2013; the carrying value of those instruments. And do they occur regularly across the portfolio? They do. Individually, these are just big enough to highlight.</p>
          <p>But I guess what really pleases me is when I look at credit market exposures, the number is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:57) coming down <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:11:00) in total and the transactions we did this year, which are a couple of big property transactions, are at marked or evaluations above those at which we're carrying the assets in the books. So not only are we reducing our exposure, it's really important as we think of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:11:17) but we're actually getting <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:11:20) as well.</p>
