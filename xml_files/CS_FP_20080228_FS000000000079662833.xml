        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 2007 has been a great year for the Group. As you see in the numbers, the &#x2013; it's a record year. It's a record year on all aspects, revenues, earnings, dividend. I think it shows the strength of the operating model, even in an environment which is more difficult than at the beginning of the year. If you look at the 2007 highlights, let's just start before going through the numbers on a comparable basis, by the total numbers because I think it's important to understand the AXA model.</p>
          <p>The revenues are up 20%. Earnings are up 27%. Adjusted earnings are up 22%. Why so? It's a combination of organic and external growth and I think this is important to have in mind if you look at the long-term development of the Group, what we try to do is to combine organic and external growth. 2007 is reflecting the integration of Winterthur on one hand and on the other hand the fact that on a comparable basis the Group has performed well because revenues have increased, fuelling the bottom line.</p>
          <p>If you look on a comparable basis at what the underlying earnings are, they have been progressing by 15% to reach a record number 4.9 billion euro, slightly below 5 billion euro, well aligned with the 2012 ambitions and this growth has been fuelled by all the business lines, Property/Casualty, Life and Savings, Asset Management. We see that has a very satisfactory performance once more in an environment where, as you know, market turbulences have been significant since the beginning of the second half of '07.</p>
          <p>Back to the point, how does the model work? The fact that earnings are growing at a significant pace is coming from the growth in revenues. If you look at the activity indicators for the three big business lines, part of the financial protection model, Life and Savings have enjoyed a significant growth, the APE's have been growing at 8%. It's well aligned with the goals we have as part of ambition 2012. You know that we want to have the APE grow between 7 and 10%. We are there for 2007.</p>
          <p>Property/Casualty revenues, we would like to see them grow in between 3% and 5%. We are just in the middle at 4%, which we see as a very satisfactory performance.</p>
          <p>Asset Management revenues have been growing at 17%, it's less for the total of the year as well it was for the first half and I think this is easily understandable. If you look at these three numbers, you understand that we are well aligned with our long-term plans.</p>
          <p>We are gaining market share in all the markets and I think this is showing the fact that the model is a strong one and that earnings or earnings growth is going to be strong in the future. This growth in revenues has, as I said, been creating a growth in underlying earnings.</p>
          <p>Underlying earnings have been growing at 10% on the Life side, 8% on the Property/Casualty side and 21% on the Asset Management side. Earnings growing faster than revenues is I think, a good situation to be in. Denis will come back to that later to explain you into more detail where it comes from.</p>
          <p>The other point I think you have to have in mind, especially at a time where many people are questioning the way the world economic growth is going to go in 2008, the geographical basis of these earnings is a very well-diversified one. In the remote past we were, from time to time, hearing comments on the fact that well the French business of AXA, the U.S. business of AXA were very profitable but other than that, the situation was not that great.</p>
          <p>If you look at where do the earnings come from now, you will see that the base is a well diversified one. Basically we have got three engines which are producing around 20% of the earnings each: it's France, it's the Northern European region, it's the U.S., and we have the U.K. and Ireland, Asia Pacific, the Mediterranean region and the Asset Management producing approximately 10% each. It's a well diversified geographical source of earnings, which is another element of strength in the model and we think this is highly valuable in the current circumstances.</p>
          <p>The next point is what has happened in the capital gains. It's the difference between underlying and adjusted earnings. We've been able in 2007 to extract a decent amount of capital gains from our investment portfolios, 1.1 billion euro &#x2013; between 1.1 billion euro and 1.2 billion euro, slightly in excess of the long-term guidance. This has helped up create adjusted earnings going up 14% when compared with the previous year; we think it's a satisfactory situation. All this has led to a strong return on equity, slightly higher than in 2006, 19.7%. We think there too it's a strong number.</p>
          <p>If you look at what the earnings are on a per share basis, the picture is even slightly better than the total earnings. Why so? Because, as you know, in 2007 we have bought back a significant number of shares to offset the dilution created by the share plans, by the options, and therefore this has enabled us to show a 16% underlying earnings growth on a per share basis, once more very well aligned with the long-term 2012 goals. It's now &#x2013; we've been now exceeding the 2012 target every year since we have started the plan.</p>
          <p>On an adjusted basis, the earnings per share are growing at 13%. It's slightly slower than on an underlying basis because the capital gains are representing approximately the same amount as the year before, so there is no growth or limited growth on the capital gains extracted that is explaining the difference between the 16% for underlying earnings and the 13% for adjusted earnings.</p>
          <p>What does this lead to in terms of dividend? Since you know that the basis on which we are proposing our dividends is the adjusted earnings basis, we are proposing to increase the dividend by 13%, bringing it from 1.06 euro to 1.20. We think it's a good number, it's showing the confidence we have in the future and on top of that, given the current market prices, it's a very strong yield since it's a 5% yield given what the stock price has been in the recent days.</p>
          <p>What sort of comments can we make beyond the 2007 numbers, which are strong numbers, and I will come back to the outlook in the conclusion. But before going there, and to give a little bit of background to what Denis is going to say, the market turbulences have not had a major impact on us, neither on earnings nor on the balance sheet. Why so? Because the business model we are in, this financial protection business model &#x2013; multi distribution, geographically diversified, is resisting very well to the current turbulences and we are a pretty clear and clean model.</p>
          <p>We are not operating in a diverse source of businesses including banking as an example, it's a clean, straight &#x2013; an easy model to understand and when you look at where are the revenues coming from, where are the earnings coming from, and how can these revenues or earnings be affected by world economic growth, which could be slightly slower than before even if it remains very decent &#x2013; how can it be affected by the market turbulences? You will see that through both the three business lines and the geographical diversification there is a very strong resilience of the model.</p>
          <p>The Property/Casualty business is representing 30% of the revenues, 39% of the earnings. We are in a very solid situation there. The Life and Health and the Savings and Annuities business is representing a little more than 60% of the revenue, then approximately 50% of the earnings. There too there are many reasons to believe that it's a very resilient model.</p>
          <p>The Asset Management business is representing 11% of the earnings. It's probably going to be slightly affected by the fact that the asset bases are going to be lower because of the decline in market prices, but we don't see that as breaking the long-term trends. We think we are in long-term growth businesses and we think that the way we operate is relevant in the current market environment because we have highly diversified assets of high quality.</p>
          <p>You will see what our real exposure to the turbulences is; it's a limited one. We think our asset liabilities management strategy has proven to be efficient. We have no significant duration mismatch. The impact of the ABS crisis is a limited one. It's a 0.6 billion euro impact on the Group. We think, when compared to some of the numbers we've seen out there, it's a quite limited one. It's never pleasant but it's very limited. We have no investment banking type activity. We have sold them now a very long time ago so we think we are in good shape even if the environment is more difficult than what it used to be, but I'll come back to that later.</p>
          <p>Why do we think we are in good shape? Well if you look at 2007, I'd like to come back for a short moment on the organic growth. We are attracting new clients every day. We are generating firmly positive cash flows. I think this is very important to have in mind, because at the time where what's going to fuel the earnings is the ability to grow the revenues, at a time where given the fact that spreads are higher than what they used to be a few months ago, there are people who can see that as bad news because they have negative cash flows and they are forced to sell assets, there are people who can see that middle term is very good news because they have the ability to reinvest at higher rates.</p>
          <p>We are in that situation. If you look at the Property/Casualty business, this business now a number of years ago was a slow growing or slightly shrinking business. It's not the case anymore. The portfolios have been increasing significantly, if you look at the Motor portfolio. The Motor portfolio has been increasing by 7% last year; the Household portfolio which for years was a portfolio with no growth has been growing by 3%. So we think there we have very sound and well-organized operations.</p>
          <p>If you look at the asset bases, we've had, despite the turbulences, very significant positive inflows last year, approximately 30 billion euro. Of course, less than in 2006, but nevertheless strongly positive and we've had also in our Life and Savings operation, outside of the sub-party business, 10 billion of inflow. So we think it's a well-diversified asset base and, as you see, the proportion of unit linked business within the insurance companies is a good one and a growing one.</p>
          <p>The other point I would like to outline is the fact that on the Life and Savings business, there is very good momentum in the unit linked business, especially in Variable Annuities with secondary guarantees. You know that we've been making efforts to spread the accumulator model throughout the world, it's working.</p>
          <p>If you look at what the numbers have been for the whole year, the APE's in terms of total valuable annuities have been growing at 46% with a good growth in the fourth quarter, as you see. Their contribution to the total earnings of the Group has moved from being &#x2013; is now, sorry, 20%, and it's representing 14% of the APE's, so it's a significant portion of our business. We think it's very well adapted to the current environment because you have a situation where many of the clients are hesitating. They don't know if they should invest for the long-term, they can be very tempted to go short-term investment, especially when the banks are trying to attract them with more attractive rates. We think that offering these secondary guarantees is going to help us keep the good momentum in the business because they are well adapted to the current circumstances.</p>
          <p>If you look at the portion of the non-U.S. Variable Annuities within these numbers, it's something which has been growing. If you look at the sales, at the full year sales, they have been increasing significantly between 2006 and 2007. They have been multiplied by 4. We've launched these products in now most of the European countries, and the average monthly sales have been consistently growing, so there too it's a positive element for the future even if sometimes the short-term market turbulences are creating some hesitation in the mind of the clients.</p>
          <p>The next point I'd like to briefly touch in terms of operating performance is the fact that the Winterthur integration is very successful and very fast. It's interesting to see that a major operation like this one is not discussed any more because there are no issues.</p>
          <p>Everything is going well and the point I see as particularly satisfactory for us is that the usual model, when you buy a big company and when you have a significant number of integrations in different countries, is that during the integration phase, in the key markets where you have to merge things, reorganize distribution, harmonize the product range, you lose market share for a number of years. It's not the case.</p>
          <p>In 2007, in the key markets, Germany, Spain, the U.K., Belgium, we've been gaining market share despite the integration. This probably says something about the ability to integrate fast the acquisitions within AXA. The synergies they are, I would say, coming, they are slightly higher than expected. We think that there everything is well under control and positive.</p>
          <p>The last point I wanted to mention is also the &#x2013; what has been achieved on the Swiss market in Individual Life, which was seen as a particularly difficult market. It's a market where for the first year the business has been growing. You know that the challenge for us is to regenerate growth within the Swiss business. This was a question you have very frequently asked, how we are going to do that, our answer has been it's not going to happen in six months but we are confident that over a couple of years it is going to happen. We start to see some interesting preliminary signs, it doesn't mean that everything is in the pocket but we think that there progress has been made.</p>
          <p>We will continue to focus on our operational priorities, on pre-engagement customer satisfaction, because we think it's a way to increase the retention, to increase growth in revenues and at the end of the day to increase the earnings. If you look at the achievements in 2007, the employee engagement index has been progressing by two points. It's good but I think it can be better.</p>
          <p>We should aim for something starting with an eight. It's going to be difficult to reach, but we will put our effort there. Customer satisfaction index is something which is very precisely measured. We've been moving by a little less than a point, it's now part of the short-term compensation grids of the executives, so the level of attention to this element has been growing over the last months and at the end of the day I'm sure it's going to have an impact on the retention.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, increased exposure to high growth markets; the exposure of the Group to emerging markets was good but relatively, I would say, under-exposed when compared to some of the competitors. If we want to have higher than average growth in the long-term we have to increase the exposure to these markets.</p>
          <p>As you see with all these little flags, we have not been inactive in 2007 or at the beginning of 2008; we've bought back our minorities in some of the countries where we were already operating like Turkey and Morocco. We've been acquiring in the Central and Eastern European countries, in Russia, in Ukraine, in Hungary. We've been active also in Asia and in Latin America very, very recently. So this is progressively increasing the exposure of the Group to these high growth regions. We are seeing we can on top of that extract quite good margins. So overall I'm going to let Denis now go into more details within the numbers, but strong numbers for 2007 with a well working operating model and a very limited exposure of the balance sheet and of the earnings to the current market situation.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Henri. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I will now turn to a more detailed presentation of the IFRS earnings. Starting with the analysis by segment, all operating segments contributed positively to our 2007 underlying earnings performance. I just want to highlight on this slide that the change on the comparable basis is on an AXA only perimeter because we didn't have the IFRS detailed information by segment for Winterthur, so the plus 15% is in AXA only and the plus 27% is on a reported basis.</p>
          <p>So Life and Savings, up 10% on a comparable basis, a creditable performance which I will comment further; P&amp;C 8%; Asset Management, 21% on a comparable basis. You see that there's a small difference with reported. It's an exchange rate difference more than the fact that anything was coming from Winterthur. International Insurance up 54% on a comparable basis. All in all, plus 15, so all segments growing quite nicely.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of volume of business in Life and Savings, strong organic growth momentum. You see the very high figure for the U.S., 19% and for Asia Pacific plus 25. You see a decline in Japan minus 17% which is reflected, something which is not new, the impact of the change in tax regulation on some of our products in March of 2007. You see a small number for France that's plus 3 which should be read in the context of the market which was down 3 in 2007 and you see good growth in Northern and Central European region that's 7% and the U.K. at 6, so all in all a good picture, 8% on a comparable basis.</p>
          <p>Our Life and Savings reserved have remained flat over the year. This is the combination of good net inflows 11 billion euro, good market appreciation of 10 billion euro and a little bit of change in scope with the sale of the Netherlands and the acquisition of the Monte dei Paschi business in Italy and a quite negative foreign exchange difference linked to a strengthening of the euro against all other currencies.</p>
          <p>I will not comment the next slide which is the reserve roll forward by country, just to highlight one point which is that in Asia Pacific where the net inflows represent only 1% of the asset base. In fact if you take into account mutual funds which are the main way we collect assets in Asia Pacific, the growth is 9% of the asset base, so all in all you see that we have a 2% net inflow, but if you adjust for the Australian situation and the U.K. with-profits business which is in run off, our net inflows represent 4% of the asset base.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the analysis of our earnings on Life and Savings through the usual margin analysis; you see that we continue to have a positive scissor effect between our gross margin which grows at 8% and our expenses and taxes growing at 7%. Looking at the elements of the gross margin you see a modest improvement in investment margin at 4% which is in line with what we've shown in the previous years.</p>
          <p>Solid growth in the fees and revenues at plus 13 fed by the unit linked management fees which are growing at 25% and a decline of the technical margin of 9%, which is not a good evolution but is essentially the reflection of a decline in the technical margin in the U.S., because of the combination of lower GMDB/GMIB margins due to lower interest rates and higher volatility on one hand and higher no lapse guarantee reserves on the universal Life products sold to higher age individuals. This is not a &#x2013; this is a problem that we've flagged now since our half year results in August and this is the translation of that effect in the technical margin.</p>
          <p>On the expense side, acquisition expenses growing by 10% reflecting the solid growth in the volumes, administration expenses growing by 5% which is a bit high to our taste but is the way the business grows at the moment where we have to make significant IT investments in particular.</p>
          <p>Looking now by country at the Life and Savings underlying earnings, you see that we have the biggest contributor remains the U.S. with a change of minus 4% on a comparable basis. This is the combination of the technical margin effect that I have mentioned earlier, of higher seasonal renewals because of rapidly growing asset bases and of lower general account margins reflecting both a slight contraction of the general accounts and lower mortgage repayments in the general account.</p>
          <p>You see on the French business growth of 15% of earnings reflecting an increase in the asset base and the non-recurrence of a mortality reserve strengthening in 2006. In the Northern region a very strong growth of 49% reflecting both higher asset bases and higher spread from the general accounts in Germany and Belgium.</p>
          <p>The U.K. growth of 50% reflects higher bonuses in the with-profits account, higher fees on unit-linked balances and partly offset by lower reserve releases in the technical margins. Japan reflects the fact that the asset base is not growing while expenses are slightly growing and Asia Pacific reflects an increase in the asset bases.</p>
          <p>Moving now to P&amp;C, we had a 4% growth on a comparable basis of our P&amp;C revenues. This is &#x2013; the revenue comparison includes Winterthur for both periods and the growth was modest in the Northern region where both in Germany and in Belgium &#x2013; well Germany, Belgium and Switzerland we had I would say significant price composition in the retail side and the growth of the exposures, the number of contracts has been very modest.</p>
          <p>Good growth in France of 3% reflecting a continued solid growth in the small commercial lines business. Stronger growth at 5% in the Mediterranean region showing that we have a position which is increasing in the emerging markets of that region which give us a very solid growth but also in Spain in spite of the merger, we had a very good increase in our volumes and solid growth in the U.K. at 8% and solid growth in the other territories of 6%.</p>
          <p>On the P&amp;C pricing environment, we give you on a regular basis this slide with the flags which shows that we had resilient renewal prices in our key markets. I would say if anything that the picture is slightly improving compared to the past periods. You have first to reflect that 60% of our P&amp;C business is personal lines, 40% commercial lines and within the commercial lines it's really SME business.</p>
          <p>All our large corporate business is in the international segment. It's in the International segment that we see the biggest price competition with prices down between 5 and 10%. When you look at this picture of retail and SME you see the picture is quite contrasted but improving.</p>
          <p>You see that Motor, in almost of our, all of our territories is at 0% or above. Household is at 0% and above in all territories. You see that there is still significant competition in Motor fleet and Property and we see that the situation is improving in liability. So overall a picture that is quite encouraging for the coming years.</p>
          <p>Our combined ratio in 2007 was 97.6 compared to 96.9 in 2006. Like for like for the AXA parameter it's a deterioration of one point. It's deterioration, which is really a reflection of natural catastrophes with the Kyrill storm in January, which hit Northern Europe and the floods in the U.K. in June and July. The natural catastrophes represent 2% of the combined ratio. So the deterioration of the loss ratio is what is reflected in the number, the deterioration of one point, while on the expense ratio we have maintained the expense ratio flat during the year.</p>
          <p>Looking at it by geography, you see that we have an improvement in the combined ratio in France, the Mediterranean region, which shows that in the countries which are least effected by the natural catastrophes that the situation continues to improve. You see that there is a significant impact of the catastrophes in the U.K., Germany and Belgium; again the total is two points. So absent those catastrophes our combined ratio would have been 95.6 so a significant improvement against last year.</p>
          <p>This is not the result of a more a difficult situation from a reserving standpoint. In fact our reserving levels have remained high despite positive prior year reserve developments. But prior year reserve developments were plus 1.3 billion euro or 2.9% of our reserves, comparing to 1.1 billion euro in 2006, so that we had a little bit more reserve risk added only in past years, than in 2006 but our strength of reserves remains unaffected if not better at the end of '07 than it was at the end of '06.</p>
          <p>The earnings growth in P&amp;C of 8% is the combination of a lower technical result in comparative terms, high investment income as our cash flows intensity continues to be quite strong as Henri de Castries indicated earlier, and some tax went up representing roughly 100 million euro. So a situation which gave, can give us in total plus 8% on our P&amp;C earnings.</p>
          <p>Looking at the P&amp;C earnings by region, you see a growth everywhere, substantial growth in all the regions with the exception of the U.K. where the U.K., there was both a deterioration of the current performance with the floods and also a deterioration of the all-year performance.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the Assets Management business, first our average assets under management have improved 21% during the year which is reflected in the earnings. When you look at the year end assets of our two asset managers they reach 1.1 trillion euro, an increase which is the reflection of 28 billion of net inflows, 45 billion of market appreciation, 68 billion of change in scope, that's the transfer to AXA Investment Managers of the big two assets for the most part and 77 billion euro of negative forex impact because of the strengthening of the euro against all other currencies.</p>
          <p>AXA IM saw its revenues grow by 21%, the cost income ratio improved by 70 basis points and the earnings grew by 31%. The net inflows in AXA IM were only 5 billion euro in 2007 reflecting the cash outflows in the money market funds of roughly 8 billion euro following the liquidity crisis of the summer of last year. Assets under management reached 548 billion euro of which a third is third party assets.</p>
          <p>On the AllianceBernstein side a solid performance in 2007 in spite of a slow down in the second half, revenues up 15%, again an improvement in productivity with 40 basis points of improvements in the cost income ratio, earnings running at 14%. The lower earnings performance is the function of much lower performance fees on the hedge fund portfolio of AllianceBernstein. The net inflows were 23 billion euro; assets under management 543 billion, third party assets, 85% of the total.</p>
          <p>I want to comment briefly on the other segments' underlying earnings. International Insurance a growth of 54%, this is the combination of a growth of 16% for AXA Corporate Solutions and a very good performance on our run off portfolios which exclude AXA RE.</p>
          <p>On the Banking and Holdings segments, two brief comments. An improvement in the performance of the bank in Belgium and on the Holdings segment we had significant profits linked to the currency options that protect our earnings in non-euro currencies and this is reflected here, plus the impact of lower interest rates on the debts that we incurred.</p>
          <p>Now from underlying earnings to net income; underlying earnings reached 4,963 million euro. The net capital gains of 1.2 billion euro include 400 million of asset impairment of which 60 million for the asset base securities portfolio. We had, so, I'll just do the next one, 6.1 billion euro. We had a number of other impacts on the net income.</p>
          <p>The change of the fair value &#x2013; in the fair value of our mutual funds and other assets a negative 205 million, a change in the fair value of derivatives, foreign exchange and other of almost 400 million negative. This is related to items that are not eligible to hedge accounting and of that three quarter of the negative 391 is not economic. This has a &#x2013; the other leg of the transaction is an increase in the value of the assets in the balance sheet or an increase in another number on the earnings side.</p>
          <p>Winterthur integration costs of 252 million euro. And the sale of the Dutch operation reaching a plus of 480 million and a higher goodwill and intangible number of 160 million negative, which is not reflective of goodwill write-offs, but of the amortization of the customer intangibles that we have to book into the purchase of the Winterthur for the P&amp;C business.</p>
          <p>Shareholders equity moved from 47 billion to 45.6 billion during the year. You see the dancing  boxes on this slide, net income of the year 5.7 billion euro less the dividend of 2.2, exercise of stock options and employee subscription to our share plans 700 million euro positive. Buy back of shares of 2.3 billion euro including the buy back of the conversion option of our convertible bonds in January '07, a decline in the unrealized gain position of roughly 3 billion euro and a negative 400 million euro on the foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>The lower annualized gains on the balance sheet are mainly driven by higher interest rates and spreads in Europe. When you look at the yearend position of 6.9 billion at the end of 2007, you have 2.1 billion which is not on the balance sheet which is the real estate and loan portfolio and 4.8 which is &#x2013; the part attributable to the shareholders of the equity capital gains of 5.2 and a negative of fixed income, not equity capital gains, equity unrealized capital gains and on the fixed income an unrealized capital gain position of minus 500 million euro.</p>
          <p>We have tried on the right hand side of this slide to give you some sensitivities. Those are our own estimates, not audited. Sensitivity on assets of stock market movements a negative 10% in the stock market would have an impact on the equity of 1.8 billion euro, a P&amp;L impact of roughly 400 million euro, that would be the impairment impact. Interest rates a drop of 30 basis points, we'd have 1.8 billion euro positive impact on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Increase of credit spreads well 50 basis points would have an impact on the balance sheet of 700 million euro negative and a P&amp;L impact of 200 million euro and a five point reduction in the value of our asset backed securities portfolio which is roughly what has happened between the 31st of December 2007 and Monday of this week, the exact impact is 4.7% but let's say 5% is negative 200 million on the balance sheet and 100 million on the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Our solvency ratio has decreased during the year from 186% to 154%. When you look at the movements you see 22% of movements coming from the free cash flows, the net income less the financing of the organic growth. You see a minus 31% linked to capital management, the dividends, the share buy backs, our employee share plan and acquisitions, and you see a minus 23 points coming from the financial markets. Fixed income 17 points, equities five and foreign exchange one. So at 154 we believe that we are still in a very solid financial position. Our ratings are AA with S&amp;P and Fitch, Aa3 with Moody's.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn to the topic that everyone talks about these days which is the asset base. We have 615 billion euro of invested assets, of that 382 billion euro in the general accounts assets and the bank, 28 billion euro with profit, 183 billion euro in a separate account. The topic that everyone talks about is the fixed income, 298 billion euro and I will commence now in more detail on what happens in the fixed income part of the portfolio. In our fixed income portfolio, we have an average rating which is A+. You see that we still have 46% of govies. Corporate bonds represent 44%. Asset-based securities represent 16 billion euro or 5% of the fixed income portfolio, or 3.9% of the general accounts portfolio.</p>
          <p>Looking at the corporate bonds portfolio, you see that it's broken down between 73 billion euro in the participating funds and 59 billion euro in non-participating. So 55% in participating contracts and 76% of the bonds are A, or higher rated. We have an exposure to credit before swaps of 13.6 billion euro. The credit before swaps are used as an alternative for investment grade corporate bonds. We invest essentially about three-fourths of our exposure is through the iTraxx index. Why are we using the iTraxx index rather than single-name exposures? It's because of the depth of the market, its liquidity and the fact that the iTraxx is under-exposed to financials.</p>
          <p>You have at the bottom right of the slide an illustration of how it works. The other reason why we invest in CDOs is that our general account portfolio has a cash flow, which is roughly zero, or slightly negative and it's the best way to increase our exposure to corporate credit has been not to sell assets, but to buy CDOs to transform essentially economically Government bonds into a corporate bond.</p>
          <p>Another topic, which people have talked about a lot is the monolines. Our exposure to monolines all-in-all is 800 million euro. First, it's made of a direct exposure in equities and bonds of monolines 64 million euro. And then, we have an exposure both to our general accounts and to our U.K. with profits of around 800 million euro in terms of our credit-enhanced securities. The vast majority of these credit-enhanced securities are corporate bonds, not ABS and more than half of the exposure is in the U.K. with profits segments. And you see that the bulk of the exposure is to Ambac and MBIA.</p>
          <p>For the sake of completeness, we also have and this is mentioned at the bottom right of the slide, a reinsurance run-off portfolio of 7 billion euro, which is a portfolio of municipal bonds more than 5,000 issues, which dates back to 1998 to 2004, before we put this portfolio in run-off and before we sold AXA RE. When &#x2013; and the company that was writing this credit enhancement business was AXA Re Finance. We have had no defaults since inception in this portfolio of more than 5,000 names and this portfolio is reinsured to MBIA, that's why we mention it here, but we've seen no defaults and we're not particularly concerned with this portfolio.</p>
          <p>Moving to the asset backed securities, our portfolio of asset backed securities at year-end was 16.2 billion euro, compared to 15.4 billion at the mid-year. We've slightly increased our exposure during the second half of the year by 2.5 billion euro. We've not reinvested in subprime, we've reinvested other asset classes. The mark-to-market was a negative 1.1 billion during the second half, and we had also 600 million, negative forex impact, which is &#x2013; but this forex impact is matched in other parts of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Looking at the asset backed securities by type of assets, you see that the subprime remains at 1.6 billion and represents a small proportion of the total. You see that CDOs represent 1.8 billion and that CLOs represent 2.9 billion. 70% of the portfolio is AAA and AA. We are investing in those assets as part of a long-term investment strategy, the average duration of the portfolio is seven years. This is not a trading book. We have positive cash flows and we are not forced sellers. Obviously, we have to mark-to-market those assets but we still believe that they are well-suited for our long-term investment strategy and that they give us higher yields and they give us a liquidity premium. Obviously there is no liquidity in this market right now, but we are not looking for liquidity.</p>
          <p>The gross exposure is 16.2 billion after policyholder participation the net exposure is 11 billion. I won't dwell more on this page.</p>
          <p>I'd like to move to slide 51, where we talk about the valuation methodology. As you know there is a both in U.S. GAAP and IFRS a valuation hierarchy. With level 1, which is a valuation by reference to public price quotations in an active market, roughly 80% of our asset backed securities are valued using that level 1. Level 2 valuation techniques using observable market inputs, i.e. an index. It's roughly it's close to 20%. Level 3 internal sources, which is valuation techniques not supported by prices from observable market inputs, so using internal models. This is roughly 1% of the asset base. The mark-to-market of the portfolio is roughly is 89.4% of par at the end of the year. So that means for the full year a mark-to-market negative of close to 1.5 billion euro. The net impact is a negative 600 million euro of which 300 million through the balance sheet, 100 million through impairments, which got to adjusted earnings, and 200 million change in fair value, which go to the net income.</p>
          <p>A further focus on the mortgage backed securities, you see all the categories of mortgage backed securities with the U.S. subprime and Alt-A U.S. subprime change in the last two columns. You see that the valuation of our portfolio is 59% of par for Alt-A and U.S. Alt-A, this is reflection of the average quality of the assets, which is lower than in other categories. I mean average rating of the assets. U.S. subprime you see that we've reached 71.6% in terms of valuation, reflecting that's a big part of the portfolio is AAA. I don't need to comment on all the figures that you have on this slide, but we've given all those figures for the sake of transparent disclosure.</p>
          <p>Focusing more the U.S. subprime on the next slide, you have the breakdown by vintage and by rating of our U.S. subprime RMBS portfolio. We don't have any home equity line of credit in this portfolio and you see that the portfolio is a combination of a more older and more recent vintages and you see all the breakdown of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Focus on other asset backed securities, we've given you the breakdown for CDOs, CLOs sorry we can move back one slide for other asset backed securities you see CDOs, CLOs and consumer ABS and can you move one slide. Okay, so other asset backed securities, the CDOs include only 18 million euro of CDOs of subprime and the consumer ABS is a very diversified portfolio. You see that CDO portfolio has been significantly marked down. The CLO portfolio, because of the existence of collateral has held up pretty well.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the debt analysis, our debt was roughly stable during the year 15.8 billion at the end of 2007. You see that the bulk of the debt is made of TSS and TSDI, which are perpetual debts representing almost 8 billion euro. We have 5.7 billion euro of subordinated debt, only 2.3 billion of senior debt. When you look at the maturity of breakdown you see that we have very little to pay back until 2011 and you see that our cash and cash equivalents in the portfolio is 17.2 billion with 6 billion euro of committed, undrawn lines of credit.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the shareholder cash flow, we give you this breakdown of cash flow now for each period. You see that we had a cash flow from operation including the earnings of the previous year, 2006, of 4.5 billion euro which we reinvested with dividend &#x2013; which we used paying the dividends, investing through acquisitions, benefiting from the proceeds of divestitures, the U.S. Winterthur operation and Dutch operation. And using significant amount of money, 2.4 billion for the share buyback and you see that &#x2013; we had the capital increase with the exercise of stock option and employees share plan and our debts decreased slightly in terms of cash flow, even though the decrease of the debt in absolute terms is bigger because of the currency impact.</p>
          <p>With that I will hand over to Gerald Harlin who will comment on the embedded value figures. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. So let's start off with the roll-out &#x2013; roll forward of the Life EEV. First of all I remind you that Life EEV is the addition of Life net asset value and the value of its business. You can notice Life EEV is stable at 38.5 billion. The total return is 13% and then we have all other equity adjustments. Starting with the dividends which are paid to the Holdings segment 1.6 billion &#x2013; minus 1.6 billion; then you have the FX impact which are partly offset and you will see later on when presenting the Group EV by some hedgings which are in the Holdings segment. And last you have soft scope changes mainly corresponding to some transfers of cash from the Life segment to the non-Life segment.</p>
          <p>I'll give you now more details on the return. So first of all, you can notice that NBV is very strong at 5% and despite the bigger base; in fact we have a base which is roughly 10 billion higher, it still contributes 5% return.</p>
          <p>As far as operating performances are slightly lower by 1% that means moving from 7 to 6 compared to 2006. It's due to very strong operational experience, mainly in France, due to the decrease in interest rates in guaranteed interest rates that took place on the pension business in France in '06.</p>
          <p>Current year investment experience then is dropped significantly and I remind you that the investment experience it's the return &#x2013; the investment return so far &#x2013; the asset return assumptions and in '06 the asset return assumptions which are part of the operating return were roughly speaking 7.5% for equity and 5% for fixed income. So we had very strong current year investment performance of 8% in '06, mainly due to the outstanding, the out-performance of equities and due to the rising in all currencies' interest rates, whereas in '07, we had a rise in interest rates in Europe but a drop in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Moving to, let's focus now on NBV. First of all we have a growth of NBV of 8%, that's at constant exchange rate, constant scope and constant methodology. Moving through the various elements, let's start off with volume effects of 58 million. In fact there is a pure volume effect of 136 corresponding to a growth of 8% of EEVs that has been explained by Denis. Then we have a country mix, a negative country mix of minus 78, 78 mainly explained by the fact that, for example, in Japan we had an 18% APE drop, whereas in the U.S. we had a 19% drop, but the return in Japan is much higher.</p>
          <p>Second, the business mix, mainly explained by the rise of the medical business in Japan and to spread out the rollout of accumulator type products in Europe. Then expenses, coming from acquisitions costs, minus 43, minus 36 mainly due to the drop in interest rates in the U.S., and then some currency impact for minus 73 mainly coming from the &#x2013; corresponding to the strength of the euro versus all currencies.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at NBV margin by country. And I won't focus on the left part of the slide that has been presented by Denis, but focusing more on NBV margin. First of all you notice that NBV growth is plus 8%. NBV margin is increased by 0.1% at 23%. And explaining a few countries, let's start off with the U.S. with minus 2.2%. Minus 2.2% mainly explained by &#x2013; universal Life products with the mis-pricing for older age people that has been re-priced in June '07, so that means that it's no more the case. And also minus 2.2 explained by &#x2013; some part is explained by the lower interest rates in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In Japan, NBV margin increased by 15.8%, that's due to the tax change and a shift from a Life product to a medical product with much higher margin. Last the Mediterranean region, plus 6.4% is explained by a much more favorable business mix and by the sales of accumulator in Spain and Italy.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to the sensitivity analysis of the Life and Savings EEV. As far as NBV is concerned I remind you that all the sensitivity, all the changes in all these indicators are supposed to take place before the point of sale.</p>
          <p>Starting with the equity sensitivity, on EEV it's mainly due, plus 4%, minus 4% in case of a 10% increase or decrease of the equity market, it's mainly explained by the unrealized capital gains move in France, in Belgium, in Germany. And also by the unit linked asset base in countries like the U.S. and the U.K.</p>
          <p>Sensitivity to interest rates, which are quite strong as far as NBV is concerned, plus 13%, minus 23%. It's mainly explained by VA products. It's &#x2013; of course the option cost is much more bigger if interest rates go down, and at the reverse when interest rates go up. And that's assume that there is no re-pricing. Don't mean that in case we would be in such a situation, re-pricing is always possible. At the same time for NBV the <mark type="inaudible" /> is explained by the move in the discount rate.</p>
          <p>As far as EEV is concerned it's more, I would say, a typical pattern that you saw in the last year. That means minus 4% in case of the dropping the interest rate, explained by the guaranteed rate. And if interest goes up it's explained by the profit sharing with policyholders.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, sensitivity to volatility. We here are showing a 25% increase on volatility, which would make a drop of 6% on NBV. That, don't forget that here we are dealing with long term implied volatility, that, of course, has a strong impact on VA products. But don't insist on that point because that means that our ultimate cost is not the implied volatility, but the realized volatility, and you know that there has always been a strong difference between implied volatility, which is much higher than realized volatility. You've got all the explanation of this variation in your report, in your EEV report.</p>
          <p>Let's move to Group EV. As far as Group EV is concerned, first of all I remind you that Group EV is the addition of the Life EEVs that I've just presented and other business, tangible NAV. Let's focus on the right hand column. Let's start with the IFRS shareholders equity at 45.6 billion; that's the shareholders equity, consolidated shareholders equity at the end of '07. Let's exclude all kind of intangibles, that's minus 27.2. Let's also exclude <mark type="inaudible" /> debt since under IFRS it's part of the shareholders equity. And we have another line of plus 1.4 mainly coming from the debt, from the mark-to-market of the debt.</p>
          <p>So, we end up with a tangible NAV of 12.1 billion and we add the Life value in force, the Life VIF, which is 22.8 billion. In the end the Group EV amounts to 34.8. One remark, don't forget that other businesses, for all the other business which include the Holdings, which include the P&amp;C and all the other business which re not live, intangibles are fully eliminated. Second, no value is added for the value of in force book, of in force business. And also there is a deduction that is part of the other business of 16 billion of debt since its part of the Holding segment.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Group EV roll forward. So the total return is 18%. First of all let's notice that Group EV is dropping from 13.3 to 34.8 billion. Total return is strong at 18%. The difference between the Life EV, which is Life EV return which is smaller, is the strong return from the non-Life business, and also due to the leverage effect coming from the 16 billion debt.</p>
          <p>Then we have some other equity adjustments, starting first with dividends paid. Then forex impact and you will notice that it is much smaller loss only almost 700 million explained by the hedges that we've implemented in the Holdings segment. Then we have some scope adjustments, mainly coming from the goodwill of acquired business that we are deducting.</p>
          <p>Here is a presentation of the Group EV returns. First of all operating return on Group EV dropped from 20% to 19% and Life and Life EV we have an investment experience which was quite strong in '06 coming from the equity market and from the drop of all <mark type="inaudible" />. Whereas in '07, we have a mixed effect with U.S. yield coming down.</p>
          <p>The key message here is to notice that in '06 we realized an operating return of 20% on 29 billion of Group EV. In '07, we realized an operating return which is in the same magnitude at 19% but on 36 billion of Group EV. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, where do we go from here? Well, I mean if you sum up what we've done in 2007, I think we can characterize these earnings as being a very strong operating performance in line with the long-term plans of the Group. A very important element, organic growth, is there, is strong. Underlying earnings are aligned with the 15% target. That's the first point.</p>
          <p>The second point, the balance sheet is strong and you have no surprise on assets. And I think you have to put the two things into perspective. The situation is very different from what you have seen between 2001 and 2003 for the insurance sector, and for AXA in particular. At the time entering into the term the balance sheet was strong, but the operating earnings were not at the level where they are today. If you look at the solvency ratios, if you look at the way they've been moving in 2007 we are generating approximately through the earnings 2.5 points of additional solvency every month, which shows you the flexibility and the strength of the model.</p>
          <p>The third point, which is an important one too, the M&amp;A strategy is I think a successful one. We've been showing that we were pragmatic, able to acquire quickly if there are opportunities, but also able to integrate the new operations within the Group with very low execution risks. So we are, as far as the fundamentals are concerned, pretty relaxed and confident.</p>
          <p>Of course, what's happening out there has an impact. Of course, 2008 has started in a much less favorable environment because of the volatility, because of the bearish equity markets, because of the liquidity crisis concentrated on the banking side, and because everybody's fearing a slowdown in the world growth, seeing lower rates, seeing higher spreads.</p>
          <p>In this environment how do we see 2008? Well, I mean what we think today is that assuming that there is, starting from now, a stabilization of the equity markets at the current levels, we should achieve positive revenue and underlying earnings growth in 2008.</p>
          <p>So as you see it shows that we think that the strength of the model is going to stay. Why so? Well, because in the Life and Savings segment, which is representing approximately 50% of the earnings, we think we should continue to benefit from positive cash flow driven by the strength of the product range, driven by the fact that the unit linked products with secondary guarantees are well adapted for what the customers are looking for in this environment.</p>
          <p>On the Property/Casualty side, which is representing approximately 40% of the earnings, as Denis has shown you, we are pretty confident about the pricing cycle, we see the portfolios growing day-after-day with positive inflows. We are extremely well reserved, so we think we are in a pretty strong position.</p>
          <p>On the Asset Management side, which is representing 11% of the earnings, of course we are going to be affected by the fact that the asset bases entering into 2008 are lower than the average asset bases for 2007. But we think that very tight expense management, on one hand, and on the other hand, the good long-term track record of the products is going to help us partially offset the negative impact from the equity market.</p>
          <p>So, 2008 is probably going to be a challenging year, we know that, but as you see we are not negative at all. We think that if the market stabilizes we will show positive underlying earnings growth, and we think our 2012 long-term plans remain unchanged. We don't see why we would, just because there is one difficult year, put into question long-term plans in businesses whose fundamentals have not changed. The people are getting richer, they are looking for more protection, this is good for our long-term business.</p>
          <p>The last point I'd like to mention, it's not a financial one, it's a corporate governance one. We are seeing changes happening at the Supervisory Board level. You know that we have been operating now for years under a two-tier structure with a Supervisory Board and a Management Board. Claude B&#xE9;b&#xE9;ar has decided because his tenure as Director expires at the next Shareholders' Meeting, not to ask for renewal applying to himself the rule we have set for the Directors, which is that once you have crossed the 70 years limit you don't ask for renewal. So we are going to see him replaced, if the shareholder's meeting so decides, by Jacques de Chateauvieux, who is a member of the Board since 2005 and is a great entrepreneur, has very, very successfully transformed a family business into a world leader in its sector.</p>
          <p>So Jacques de Chateauvieux has been yesterday appointed as the Vice-Chairman of the Supervisory Board will be appointed as Chairman of the Supervisory Board following the Shareholders' Meeting. Claude B&#xE9;b&#xE9;ar will become an Honorary Chairman of AXA, so we are opening a different page.</p>
          <p>We want to keep the two-tier structure because we think it's the best one in terms of corporate governance. It's a very good thing for the management to have a Supervisory Board, to be challenged and to have a part of our discussions. It's also a very good thing for the long-term stability of the company, because we think that it's a good way to be even more, more solid. So that's where we are and this has been announced of course this morning.</p>
          <p>That's what we wanted to share with you and we are now, with my colleagues and friends of the Management Board ready to answer your questions.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> from Exane BNP Paribas. I have just one question regarding your investment allocation and business strategy. Are you going to accelerate or to change your investment strategy in the current market environment? And in fact I mean are you going to accelerate your exposure to credit risk by taking the opportunity to perhaps to take more credit risk within your initial 2012 plan because one of your competitors explained that clearly in the current credit environment there is opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes there are. Denis is going to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes there are obviously opportunities in the credit market right now, with the spreads on AA at unprecedented levels. So I would say that looking at what we've said in the past, we've said that we would gradually transition our corporate bond portfolio from AA to A. I believe that right now we can get very good spreads in the AA category, so right now we are trying to increase our AA exposure, which is an asset category which has a good mix of risk and spread.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I'll make two other comments. First, you've seen that we've slightly reduced our <mark type="inaudible" /> exposure which now represents 10% of the assets versus 11% in the past period. Secondly, the situation in the corporate market now is a situation in Europe of very little liquidity. So if you want to invest in the AA category you have very little possibility to invest directly. So right now, it's possible to invest through the iTraxx, through the credit default swap Index. It's quite difficult to invest in single corporate. We are trying to do that but we will do that very gradually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to <mark type="inaudible" /> on the corporate bond side, insurance looks, seems to have a very high exposure to financial institution impact. Now I know that this only a company that are able to deliver a AAA or AA rating, but in terms of investment strategy on corporate bonds, are you going to change the strategy and perhaps look into more industrial companies to reduce the exposure to financial institutions or is it too late regarding the current spread?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We leave those kinds of decision largely to our asset managers. Right now it happens that the investment universe in corporate bonds is quite populated with financials, so you can't avoid them. It is true, and I made the comment earlier in the presentation, that we have tried in the recent past to look for industrial names rather than financials. I don't believe that the financial system is threatened. We will adopt a prudent strategy and invest on the basis of the quality of the individual names. We are not strategically changing the allocation.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. Thomas Jacquet from Cheuvreux; I have two questions. The first one, can you give us an update on the AXA U.S. LIBOR Plus fund and the outstanding position? And my second question is regarding your CDO portfolio, or at least the CDOs which have been originated by AXA Structured Finance. They are currently not on your balance sheet, but how are evolving the relationships with your clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the U.S. LIBOR Plus funds, first one comment, the mark-to-market of the part of the LIBOR Plus fund that is on the AXA balance sheet is a negative 70 million euro. So we did suffer from that because of the continuation of the credit turmoil in the U.S. subprime. Secondly, the portfolio is, in terms of external clients, has significantly diminished in size. I would say it's less than 30% of what it was at the beginning of the crisis. Thirdly, the intrinsic quality of the portfolio has not deteriorated, so we didn't have, in any significant way, downgrades, and we have no credit events in that portfolio which means that we still believe that the customers who have stayed invested in this portfolio will at the end recover the mark-to-market losses that they have experienced. So that's the situation for LIBOR Plus.</p>
          <p>On the CDO portfolio of the structured finance business of AXA IM, the situation is the same. The CDO portfolio is behaving quite well, given the circumstances. We have, obviously, mark-to-market losses in that portfolio, but the portfolio is behaving very well compared to the benchmarks and I have not heard that there were any significant issues with the customers of the structured finance division of AXA IM. Those portfolios are made of investors, which are professional investors. They are &#x2013; the CDOs are held, for the most part, in closed funds and so therefore the liquidity is not the issue. The people that are invested there are long term investors, so the situation from my standpoint is under control.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. <mark type="Inaudible" /> Couple of questions. First of all I would like to know, the 600 million charges regarding ABS, how do they look like in U.S. GAAP? Is it the same amount? Have you released some U.S. GAAP figures? My second question is with regard to your program of realization of capital gain. What have you been doing so far this year and what's your situation in terms of unrealized gains or losses? My third question is with regard to the activity, looking in detail at Q4 figures. On a like-for-like basis it looks like APE has grown only 0.7%. And I just wanted to have a view of what the main trends in January? You've seen FSSA releasing the net new business down 27% in France but I mean if we could have a view of what's going on there. And I have some other questions but I will come to see you after the meeting. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Denis will take the two first and then maybe a little bit on the activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So first U.S. GAAP, Jean, I'd like to remind you that the SEC has allowed the foreign registrants to stop providing U.S. GAAP reconciliation. So we have, I hope, forever discontinued U.S. GAAP within AXA. And I have absolutely no idea of what these numbers would look like in U.S. GAAP and I'm no longer interested in that because the SEC has made the great move that was a commitment in the European/U.S. dialogue to eliminate the need for foreign registrants to reconciliate their numbers with U.S. GAAP.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the capital gains since the beginning of the year, as usual in insurance companies like AXA we take a significant portion of our capital gains in the early part of the year. So we have realized a portion of our capital gains budget during the month of January. I don't have a total figure in mind but I know it's probably at least 300 million euro and probably a little more than that. So that's for this element. Obviously, if equity markets continue to go down we would have to record impairments that would come against those capital gains.</p>
          <p>As far as activity is concerned, you need to keep in mind that the beginning of last year was &#x2013; had, I would say, three positive elements that we don't have this year. We had very significant Group contracts in France. We had an acceleration of the Stranger Owned Life Insurance phenomenon in the U.S. for universal life. And we had large amounts of offshore cash inflows in the cash bonds in the U.K., which have been terminated with a change of tax regulation. So we won't have those three elements in 2008.</p>
          <p>The two comments that I want to make on the activity for January are that in the U.S., in spite of the market turmoil &#x2013; the U.S., as you know, we finished 2007 as the number one Variable Annuities provider in the market. And in January we continued to have a positive momentum with a growth of 6% of our VA advance collective VSA. And in France, in APE terms, but I will let Fran&#xE7;ois comment on the French numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The life market growth is affected by the <mark type="inaudible" /> for the whole year to be stable including the decrease of minus 2% in Individual Life. At the end of the January, the figures show minus 8% for the market including a decrease of minus 5% for Individual Life. If I compare minus 8% for the market to AXA figures, it is for AXA more or less plus 0.5%. Because &#x2013; but we have started very well the year in Individual Life, we expect at the end of February a growth, premium growth of around plus 14%, is better than the market. But due to large and medium deals in line with the second half of '07, because in '07 in the second half we recorded a growth of plus 12% and very above the market.</p>
          <p>So I know that a swallow doesn't make the summer, even if &#x2013; sparrow! Sparrow! Even two sparrows in January and February, but I am confident in the capacity of our specialist network, life agents and a salaried sales force too always is better than the market through the business cycle. And they will be supported by capital resource. As a reminder that we have recorded in '07 more than 250 million euro with capital resource and we will launch a new accumulator product in the second half of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as you see, it is not a bleak picture, far from that. On the Property/Casualty side the business remains strong with a very good momentum. I think Fran&#xE7;ois would probably say the same thing about the French Property/Casualty business, which is also continuing to grow. And on the Asset Management side, we have recorded positive inflows in January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear, so I was telling you that the three exceptional positives in 2006, which will be such that the APE growth overall will not look necessarily good, but we have on the individual business quite good signs. And on P&amp;C in the first quarter, our growth always looks not very good because we have the annual renewal business of Switzerland and Germany which is a January renewal, which are local markets. So as you will have seen last year that our growth in P&amp;C accelerates quarter-after-quarter and it's smaller in the first quarter because of the January renewal in Germany and Switzerland.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I mean &#x2013; maybe as the last concluding word. As you see 2007 was strong. When we look to 2008, we are way more relaxed than what we were between 2000 and 2003. Okay, it's a turmoil, but we think the business is in good shape and the company is strong. Thank you.</p>
