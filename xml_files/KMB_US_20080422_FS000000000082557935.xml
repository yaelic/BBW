          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience in holding.  We now have Mr. Mike Masseth in conference.  Please be aware each of your lines is in a listen-only mode.  At the conclusion of Mr. Masseth's presentation, we will open the floor for questions.  At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Masseth.  Mr. Masseth, you may begin, sir.</p>

          <p>Thanks, David, and good morning everyone.  We appreciate your interest in Kimberly-Clark.  With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Randy Vest, Vice President and Controller.  Now, here is the agenda for today's call.  Mark will start with a review of our first quarter results, then Tom will provide his perspective and discuss the outlook for 2008.  That will leave us plenty of time to finish as usual with Q&amp;A.  For those wishing to follow along we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website which is www.kimberly-clark.com.</p>
          <p>First let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the call today.  There can be no assurance that future events will occur as anticipated or that the company's results will be as estimated.  Please refer to the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a description of factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted profit, and adjusted operating margin.  Management believes that reporting in this manner enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.  For additional information on why we make these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, see today's news release and additional information on our website.  Now I'll turn it over to Mark.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike, good morning everyone.  I hope you had a chance to review our news release this morning with all the details of our results.  I'm going to briefly review the quarter starting with a few headlines.</p>
          <p>First, we achieved very good top line growth with sales up nearly 10%.  That includes organic growth in excess of 5% which is in line with our 4 to 6% target for 2008 led by strong performance in our Personal Care businesses.</p>
          <p>Second we reinvested back into the business at a healthy rate.  Strategic marketing spending rose more than $20 million in the quarter, climbing faster than sales.  And third, we delivered solid bottom line results.  Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.08, up 5% from last year and in line with our previous guidance for earnings in a range of $1.05 to $1.08 a share.  This was despite absorbing cost inflation that was well above our previous expectation.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to review some of the details of our results starting with the top-line for each of our segments. In Personal Care sales climbed 14%, driven by strong volume growth of 7%, improved net selling prices and product mix -- each added an additional point of top line growth, and currency benefited sales by 5%.  In North America, sales volumes increased about 4% and net selling prices rose 2%.  Volume growth was led by our adult care business with a double digit gain behind improvements to Poise and Depend.  Baby and child care delivered solid volume growth compared to a year ago, along with good early benefits from the price increases that started to go into effect in February.</p>
          <p>Moving to Europe, Personal Care sales volumes rose 1% with growth in Huggies diapers and baby wipes and our Pull-Ups and DryNites child care brands.  Net selling prices were off 3% due to continued competitive activity in core markets.  In the developing and emerging markets Personal Care sales jumped more than 25%.  That's the 14th consecutive quarter of double digit growth.  Sales volumes increased 13% with broad based growth in each region.  Highlights included high 20s growth in the fast growing BRICIT countries, double digit growth in Latin America overall, and also in South Korea.  Our D&amp;E teams delivered outstanding results in the first quarter.  We expect the positive momentum to continue going forward.</p>
          <p>Turning to Consumer Tissue, sales rose 7% including 4 points of benefit from currency.  Higher net selling prices contributed three points of growth while the one point gain in product mix was offset by lower sales volumes.  In North America net sales were up slightly; our focus on improving revenue realization drove a 2 point gain in net selling prices and a one point benefit in product mix.  Those gains were offset by a 3% decline in sales volumes.  That falloff was driven primarily by our decision to shed some low margin business in order to improve revenue realization and to support continued growth of higher margin offerings.  In other parts of the business, Kleenex facial tissue volumes recovered from a soft cold and flu season in the fourth quarter and were essentially even with year ago performance.</p>
          <p>Switching to Europe, sales volumes gained 6%, spurred by growth from our market leading Andrex bath tissue brand in the UK and the Kleenex brand in several markets.</p>
          <p>Moving to K-C Professional &amp; Other, sales increased 9% including nearly 5 points from currency.  Organic sales were up more than 4% with higher sales volumes and net selling prices each contributing 2 points of growth.  We had another good quarter with key growth initiatives in KCP.  Global wiper sales continued to expand with a first quarter increase of 12%.  At the same time, KCP's business building efforts helped drive a strong double digit increase in sales across the developing and emerging markets.  We also had a solid quarter in North America with good volume growth in our washroom business.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Health Care segment sales were down almost 2%, despite two points of favorable currency.  Net selling prices were off about 2% in the quarter and product mix and sales volumes each fell about 1%.  Although volumes were down slightly, overall performance was essentially on track with our first quarter plan for Health Care.  Comparisons were impacted as expected by strong growth last year in face masks which benefited from avian flu preparedness that didn't recur this year. In addition, volumes and net selling prices declined in surgical products due to continued competitive market conditions.</p>
          <p>On the plus side, we generated solid growth in medical devices led by our Ballard airway management offerings. We also had good performance outside North America with our overall business growing at double digit rates.  Based on plans in place, we expect improvement in top line performance from Health Care overall going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to operating profit and cost savings -- and for this discussion I'm going to refer to adjusted operating profit and margin, which excludes certain charges that are detailed in this morning's news release.  First quarter operating profit rose 3% to $688 million with an operating margin of 14.3%.  Profitability was impacted by significant cost inflation which totaled about $160 million in the quarter.  Due to escalating oil prices and continued increases in eucalyptus pulp and secondary fiber the inflationary impact on our bottom line was several cents per share worse than our first quarter plan.  Despite the inflation we're continuing to invest in strategic marketing.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, spending was up $22 million supporting growth in areas such as personal care in the developing and emerging markets and adult care here in North America.  We also kicked off our "Be Kind to Your Behind" campaign for Cottonelle bathroom tissue.</p>
          <p>Now turning to cost savings, we delivered total savings of more than $50 million in the first quarter.  Our ongoing FORCE program generated savings of $24 million in the quarter despite higher spending levels at some of our facilities.  At the same time we realized $28 million of year on year benefit from our strategic cost reduction plan.  We still expect to deliver total cost savings for 2008 in the 200 to $250 million range.</p>
          <p>Now let's look briefly at first quarter segment operating margins.  Personal Care continues to perform at a very high level with strong improvement versus year ago fueled by our top line momentum.  Profitability was up significantly in each region of the world.  Both Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional &amp; Other segment margins continue to be impacted by inflationary pressures.  In both of these businesses, the benefits from top line growth did not overcome cost increases, particularly from pulp and higher manufacturing costs. Finally, Health Care margins were down reflecting lower sales, higher input costs and the impact of down time to manage inventories.</p>
          <p>Now, switching to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 27.7%.  That was toward the high-end of our previous guidance for a rate in the 26 to 28% range.  Compared to last year, taxes overall were about a 1 cent drag relative to year ago earnings.  Looking ahead, based on what we know now, the second quarter 2008 adjusted rate should be in the 30 to 32% range.  That's higher than both the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of last year due to the expected timing of tax planning initiatives.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash provided by operations was $426 million compared to 525 million in the prior year.  The decline was driven by increased working capital levels, particularly higher inventories.  Although a significant portion of the inventory increase came from the combined effects of currency rates and cost inflation, we know we've got to be more efficient overall.  Working capital is a key focus area for us company wide.  Our business teams are engaged in implementing plans to improve our inventory management performance; we expect to make progress later in the year.</p>
          <p>Looking at capital spending, we invested $220 million in the first quarter; that's in line with our full-year investment target of 850 to $950 million.  Regarding share repurchases, we bought 3.1 million shares of KMB stock at a cost of about $200 million during the quarter.  That's consistent with our full-year target to repurchase 800 million to $1 billion worth of K-C stock.</p>
          <p>So that wraps up the financial review.  To recap the quarter, we achieved strong top line growth, we reinvested nicely back into the business, and we delivered solid bottom line results in line with our commitments.  Now I'll turn it over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone.  I'll comment briefly about the first quarter and then I'll review the outlook for the balance of the year.  My headline today is that we're continuing to deliver as we build for tomorrow.  Our teams are driving great results in Personal Care and across the developing and emerging markets organization.  While inflation remains a big challenge for us I'm pleased with how we've been able to continue to overcome these cost pressures.</p>
          <p>As for my perspective on our first quarter results, I'd like to highlight several key points. First, our businesses in developing and emerging markets are very healthy.  Our teams are capitalizing on the opportunities these rapidly growing markets offer us with a blend of great marketing, solid product innovation, and strong customer programs.  And with a 22% jump in sales in the first quarter, our D&amp;E businesses now represent 31% of our portfolio and that's up from 28% just a year ago.</p>
          <p>Second, we're making good progress in improving our revenue realization with net selling prices up about 2% in the first quarter.  I'm encouraged by the successful implementation of the mid quarter price increases for diapers, training pants, bathroom tissue and paper towels in the US; from both a customer and a consumer point of view, so far these increases have gone very well and our market shares are in solid position overall.  And with oil at $115 per barrel or even a little higher than that this morning and pulp nearly $900 per ton, you can be sure that improving revenue realization will remain a key focus for us.</p>
          <p>And third, even though we hit our plan for the quarter, we have still got lots of room for improvement.  Inflation aside, we're not satisfied with the margins in our Consumer Tissue, K-C Professional or Health Care businesses.  The fact is our operating costs were higher than we would like in all three of these businesses.  We're also not satisfied with the working capital performance, which as Mark mentioned earlier was a drag on our cash flow in the quarter.  We've got too much inventory and we're committed to being more efficient in this area.</p>
          <p>My final point is that throughout the first quarter, we continued to do the right things for the long-term health of our businesses.  We stepped up marketing spending to help build our brands, we brought innovation to market across our business, we're investing in capital to support our growth particularly in developing and emerging markets, and we're driving cost out of the system to help improve our competitive position.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the outlook.  Our global business plan is creating sustainable growth and we're confident we will continue to execute our plan well and deliver on our commitments going forward. In building on the momentum of our first quart performance, we expect solid growth in organic sales over the balance of the year.  Favorable currency effects at current rates of exchange should also benefit sales comparisons.  One of the consequences of a weaker dollar, however, is inflation and dollar based commodities like fiber and oil.  As a result, we anticipate that inflation will continue to put pressure on our margins, particularly in light of the escalation in costs over the past quarter.  Nonetheless, we expect to generate good bottom line improvement for the full year as we focus on improving our revenue realization and reducing costs. Meanwhile we plan to continue to support our growth and further strengthen our competitive position with higher levels of spending for strategic marketing and customer development.</p>
          <p>Overall, we remain comfortable that our results in 2008 will be in line with the long-term objectives of our plan.  Specifically, we expect adjusted earnings per share in 2008 will be in a range of $4.45 to $4.60 per share.  That's up 5 to 8% from the $4.25 per share we earned last year.  As for the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share will be in a range of $1.08 to $1.11.  This will represent growth of 4 to 7% compared with the $1.04 per share we earned in 2007 even though we're projecting an increase in the effective income tax rate versus both last year and the first quarter of this year; that's equivalent to several cents per share or more.</p>
          <p>To summarize, we're off to a good start in 2008 and we have solid plans in place to drive results over the balance of the year.  We remain focused on delivering sustainable growth in sales and earnings and in deploying our cash in shareholder friendly ways.  We believe we have the right strategies in place and we intend to continue to drive our targeted growth initiatives, strengthen our capabilities and improve our cost effectiveness.  Our strategies are designed to build strong enduring global brand franchises, trusted brands like Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kleenex, Kotex, Scott, and Depend to name just a few and we're confident that our efforts will result in long-term success for Kimberly-Clark regardless of the cost environment and create value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, thank you for your interest today, and now we'd be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will open the floor for questions.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our first question comes from Jason Gere with Wachovia Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question.  Can you talk a little bit more about what's going on in Europe, specifically maybe in the UK market on the diaper side?  I believe P&amp;G had been taking pricing there, and I'm not sure if you guys followed, so I was just wondering -- if you can talk about the UK market but also your four key markets, you know the competitive pressures going on in that diaper market right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify, Jason, which direction did you think they were taking pricing, up or down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I heard that they were going up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you have seen, is if you look at the UK market in particular, but this is to some extent true across Europe, is that you've seen a lot of retailer generated price activity where the retailers are actually funding very low prices in key destination categories like diapers, so you've seen a lot more "buy one get one free" activity, you've seen them advertising diapers that might normally retail for 6 pounds a package being advertised on TV at 3 pounds per package, and that's not all funded by the manufacturers.  Most of it is being funded by the retailers to try and drive foot traffic in what's viewed as a slightly weaker economy in the UK.  So I think you may see if there was maybe less promotion in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter, you could see some sequential improvement but I wouldn't say at this point in time there's been any broad upward movement in price in diapers at least in Europe.  We have taken some tissue pricing up in the UK specifically, but Procter is really not a player in that category any longer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean, what's your general outlook over the next couple of quarters for this business?  I mean, do you think things can get better, or do you think it's really going to -- with the sluggish European economy that we should continue to see these type of activities going on for at least the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the retailer generated activity -- it's hard to predict, you know, what they're going to do, they don't always give us a complete visibility to those plans.  You know, as we look actually at Europe in a couple of categories, I was pleasantly surprised to see our tissue volumes were up by 6% in the first quarter, and really across the core markets in Europe for diapers, we were down a little bit, but across the entire European marketplace, we were up slightly from a volume standpoint; price was negative in Europe for us on diapers in the quarter which reflects the promotional environment that we're in.  I guess I would say at this point in time I'm not seeing that easing.  One of the consequences of the weaker dollar and the stronger European currency is that a lot of the local manufacturers aren't seeing the same level of cost inflation on dollar based commodities as we're seeing in this country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then -- I'll just ask one more question then jump back in the queue.  Can you -- I know last quarter you talked about cost inflation, that 400 million plus.  I didn't see a number this time.  I mean, I'm guessing it's somewhere in that -- I don't know if you can look at the quarter and use that as a run rate going forward, but it's certainly well over 500 with -- seems to be the right rate.  Can you talk maybe a little bit about if that is the case, are there more cost saving initiatives you can step up, is it inevitable that there's more pricing that's coming through and especially in North America do you feel comfortable taking another price increase with what you've seen over the last two months of consumers' reaction to the first price increase that's been kind of enabled?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of questions in there.  I guess I would say on the cost front, certainly with 160 million of cost inflation in the first quarter, our 400 million estimate that we started out the year is -- looks light, based on our current outlook, you know, it's probably going to be at least 100 million more and maybe 200 million more than we started out, but obviously you pick the oil price, and you can calculate what the impact is.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost savings, you know, we are still comfortable that the 200 to 250 million a year is about what we're going to deliver this year.  I think to the extent we're going to cover it it's going to come more on the revenue side, so when we've talked about price being 1 to 2%, you know, we were trending to the high end of that range in the first quarter and that's certainly going to have to continue.  Without speculating on future pricing, I guess I would say that this price increase seemed to have gone well from a retailer standpoint and a consumer standpoint.  We're not seeing private label shares improving, in fact to the contrary, private label shares are declining, and so I think in an inflationary environment like this you've got to focus on revenue recognition to be able to cover that.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Ali.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A few questions.  One is just around working capital.  Clearly it continues to bloat here and you guys keyed in on it not only on this call but on the previous conference call.  Love to get underneath what specifically from an operational standpoint you guys are doing to tackle that, because there's at least one school of thought out there that says you can't really get at those numbers unless you change the incentives for both your sales folks and your ops folks to really, really focus in on that.  I'm just trying to understand how you're going to go about trying to fix that issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll give you a little bit of color and then maybe ask Mark to add some detail to it.  I think first of all if you look at the working capital -- well, we look at primarily working capital, receivables, payables, inventories, essentially the receivables and payables are basically on track in terms of days sales activity, so you're -- not seeing a lot of movement there.  You saw a little bit of sequential decline in payables which really has more to do with timing of capital spending and year-end accruals and things like that, but I'd say basically there is obviously more you can do in those areas, but no major issues.  So the big issue is inventory and if you look at inventory and kind of break it down, about half of the increase in inventory is due to inflation and currency, and so obviously that's not a lot that you can manage on that front.  But the other half is things that we can manage, and I'll have Mark just give you a little bit of color on that in terms of what we're doing from a compensation standpoint and how the team is focused on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ali, this is obviously a focus for us organization-wide both for our finance team and the business teams, and for the first time we have got a specific incentive metric in our compensation plan related to working capital improvement.  In the business teams, there's a whole variety of activities underway, starting with improving our demand planning, focusing on SKU management, as we've done a much better job with innovation and focusing on our customers, making sure that we're really getting the right amount of velocity for every SKU we've got in the portfolio.  So I think your comments are spot on.  We've got to get incentives right.  My belief is we've got all the information systems we need.  We're fully deployed now with SAP across the organization.  We've got all the tools and the processes, now it's a matter of driving those activities down through the organization, which we have got plans in place to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  A different type of question, just around the commodities obviously which is -- continues to be a big concern here.  Last quarter there was a sheet of assumptions, you go through the assumptions now and you compare the numbers and obviously at that point we and other folks I'm sure thought that they were conservative assumptions on the commodity cost and what you're assuming going forward.  That's clearly changed.  Can you give us a taste of the assumptions that you have embedded in this 3.45 to 3.60 going forward similar to what you did in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's 4.45 to 4.60.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we didn't lose a buck there...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, sorry, sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's okay.  I just want to make sure you got the numbers right.  I think that as you look down the list, fiber continues to be a swing quarter on quarter, but more of that probably was in secondary fiber, even more than pulp, which is a bit of a switch for us and you've seen recycled fiber has been in tight supply actually and, in both the US and Europe, and so that's been probably the biggest dynamic, and it's led to more pricing in the KCP business. I think our secondary fiber costs were up something like 35% in the first quarter, and expected to go higher in the balance of the year, and that's probably been a big shift.</p>
          <p>On the oil front, that's a little bit harder to measure.  Obviously diesel fuel is a direct pass through from the carriers and so diesel is at $4.20 and think we came into the year, it was probably 3.50 or thereabouts was our expectation, so that's been a big impact and that will continue.  The balance of oil, we don't have a lot of direct oil exposure, but as it works its way through the supply chain into polymer, into adhesives and other materials, that will work its way through our cost assumptions and so in some ways it depends on how hedged some of our suppliers were as to when you see those price increases coming through. And as they do come through, you're challenging every supplier to go back and find ways to offset it or to offer us alternatives that mitigate some of the cost, so we're -- to the extent we can, we're trying to avoid some of those, but obviously that will play a factor for us. When we looked at the other materials in the first quarter, it was up about 60 million, I think, year over year, which is a big number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it sounds like all these numbers obviously are up yet guidance hasn't changed.  You know, you mentioned a second ago or a couple minutes ago that a lot of that will have to be passed through in terms of pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in terms of reconciling the cost to the bottom line numbers, I mean the positives will be, probably get more pricing than we expected, so more toward the high end of the range.  We're probably going to be more positive on the interest expense line as commercial paper rates are down at about 2% right now, so we're expecting to be a little bit more positive on that assumption for the year.  Other income and expense is another area where we typically assume a small amount of expense, as we have had some currency hedging gains that's been more positive, so there have been other areas of the P&amp;L where we've been able to pick up some amount to cover that -- those cost differences.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And I guess a little bit of a broader question just on the pricing, how do you mitigate or at least how do you know that the consumer is about to balk on your price increases until they actually do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, we've done price elasticity modeling for a lot of our categories, and working with the retailer, what they understand -- what items do you need at an opening price point and where's the move-up price point, what are the promotional lifts at varying levels of activity, we have got a lot of modeling data, but in this kind of an inflationary environment, everybody is having to go back and relook at those, so in some cases you'll do it with count or -- with a sheet count or package count, in other places you're doing it with straight list, and so it's probably more of an art form than a science in terms of understanding how to play that.</p>

          <p>Morning Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to go into marketing spending a little bit.  So it was up 22 million year-over-year.  Is that the right run rate we should think about for the rest of the year?  And then just can you sort of benchmark yourself versus your peers in your categories?  I know it differs by market and by peer, but I was just wondering if you could benchmark yourself, where you think you stand today on marketing spending versus the peer group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, typically we're measuring share of voice in each of our categories and where we are versus launch activity and versus others, so we're -- in some markets we will spend more than our share of voice and in other markets we'll spend a little bit less, but generally we're looking to see that we're at least competitive and being heard.  I'd say that metric is getting a little bit more complicated as we're doing more with alternative media and so we believe that we're among the leaders in looking at integrated marketing planning to spread our marketing dollars across a wider range of media and PR activities. So I'd say we're probably a little less TV than average, and a little bit more alternative than average, but I know that marketplace is changing pretty dramatically.  In terms of how we spread the funds, we spend pretty aggressively in D&amp;E as we're really trying to build our brands in emerging markets.  Obviously spent, you know, a fair amount in our tissue business behind some of the Cottonelle relaunch, so where we have innovation and news, we'll spend aggressively behind the news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as the run rate for the year, do you think the plus 22 million in Q1 is similar what to what we'll see for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess our expectation as we have said over the long term is to continue to increase our strategic marketing spending.  One of the interesting things is as we've done that, we're basically on plan with that for the year so far, but as we've done that, we've gotten more top line for it than probably we would have anticipated, so we're over delivering on the top line and doing it with fairly modest increases in marketing spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Thanks.  I just wanted to go back real quick to the offsets that you guys are generating to the materials cost inflation.  So this quarter in particular, it looks like other income swung pretty positively from expense to income.  Was that hedge gains on currency and what do you think about that line item for the rest of the year.  Is there any way to sort of get our arms around that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the big swing was we had hedging losses last year and hedging gains this year, and so -- and we're not -- we're pretty routinely hedging about half of our transaction exposure, so it wasn't that we were doing more hedging or being more aggressive with hedging, it was really just more the movement, the more consistent movement of the US dollar, so we're every month hedging about 1/12th of our transaction exposure 12 months out.  So --</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Filippe Goossens with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Filippe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Tom, how are you today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to focus my two questions this morning more on your developing and emerging markets if I may.  The first one, we've seen sort of a subtle broadening in terms of your advertising mix particularly in Latin America to now also include the Huggies toiletries in addition to what you did previously with Huggies.  So the three questions related to that observation, the first one is given that you're now advertising Huggies toiletries, is that an indication about your continued comfort that emerging markets will continue to significantly out perform the developed markets?  Secondly, can you talk a bit about your return on invested capital for that type of advertising compared to let's say the diaper business, and then finally given the better margin profile of toiletries, could we expect from you to continue to focus on that side and perhaps look at let's say tuck-in acquisition opportunities in order to make the company as a whole less dependent &#x2013; or less -- make yourself less subject to these higher commodity prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I got all those down, Filippe. You'll have to help me if I forget one of those part way through.  In terms of the Huggies toiletries marketing, pretty much the way I would think about that is where we've got strong diaper shares, we're going to drive everything we can with the Huggies brand and own all of the occasions around that Huggies brand name that we can.  So in a lot of the developing and emerging markets we have very strong diaper shares, and so we're driving the toiletries business.  We've had some great success behind launches in Latin America and have built nice share positions; having said that, it's still a relatively small category relative to the rest of our businesses in feminine care, for example, diapers and even tissue in some of those markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of marketing ROI, that's a tool we're continuing to build and develop, and so we have got better metrics in place, but again that's another one that's still more of an art than a science, and it's easier to see after it's happened than to be predictive on what's going to happen, so it's one that Tony Palmer and his team is really trying to build better capability to analyze our marketing spend and be more predictive with what we should expect given levels of investment around the world. But developing and emerging markets has been a place that we've found is a good opportunity to continue to invest and grow our business.</p>
          <p>In terms of the signal on toiletries and whether that should -- we should look for more tuck-in acquisitions, you know, I think again this is more about building out the Huggies brand and we've got some great innovation there and we're able to bring that to the marketplace.  But I wouldn't interpret that to be a strategic shift to the negative that you were describing.  I think that was all of the questions.  Did that cover everything you were looking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, Tom, and then I just had one other question on China -- obviously a very fragmented market at this juncture both for personal care products as well as consumer tissue.  Given the indications of the Chinese government that they're going to become more stricter as it relates to regulations, what specific opportunities will that create for companies like yourselves, and maybe just a little bit from a more broader perspective, if you look at China specifically, do you see the opportunities for you coming more from benefiting from category growth as you make people more familiar with the Kimberly-Clark brand equity or do you see opportunities more coming from taking market share away given that the market is still so fragmented at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, China is a very exciting market for us, and it would appear for probably every other CPG company in the world, so there is a lot of companies pawing the same ground in China right now, and so it is a very competitive marketplace, and there are lots of brands particularly at the low end, but more in the mid to premium tier where we want to play -- you know, we tend to run into the same global players with an occasional local player, so it's us and P&amp;G and Unicharm are the major players in the premium personal care arena like diapers and fem care in China. And so our strategy is to really grow the premium and super premium segments of the category, and as income has improved for Chinese consumers, that seems to be happening.  We had a terrific top-line performance in the first quarter as we did across most of the developing and emerging markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any concern, Tom, about some of the stronger local players let's say like a Hengon trying to move more up scale and become incremental competition for you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hengonis a terrific operator and they do a great job in a number of categories so yeah, I would say absolutely that would be a concern.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First thing was in the press release you guys mentioned some business exits in North American Consumer Tissue.  Can you just elaborate on what that is and how much of an impact there was on the quarter and if it's something we should be then building into the next three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, that was a private label contract and it accounted for more than half of the volume decline in the Consumer Tissue US numbers that we quoted for the first quarter, and that comparison will be with us for most of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And about that same magnitude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, roughly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no seasonality in it or anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So then the rest of the decline which then is obviously not that significant, would you say that it's tied to the pricing that came through, or is there something else to be aware of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really probably de-sheeting on Cottonelle, so we report volume in sheets as you know, and so as we de-sheeted Cottonelle in the fourth quarter of last year, that always has a volume comparison, so we had good single digit volume growth on Scott tissue, and we improved our net sales dollars overall for Cottonelle, but the de-sheeting was probably the other volume comparison that you typically see in a period after a count change like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then K-C Professional, I mean that is the one business that you've spoken about as being really somewhat cyclical.  Volume was still really solid, so -- and you also made it seem as though -- I think Mark just said it seems to be typically a forward indicator.  So what are you seeing?  I mean, are you expecting volumes to moderate going forward?  And are you expecting pricing to accelerate based on what you know about contracts coming due?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark and I just spent some time with our KCP team in Atlanta, and several of them had just come back from a meeting with a lot of their North American distributors, and they were more bullish than I was expecting, so they were feeling like the first quarter was overall pretty solid, January and February were good months for most of the distributors, and March was a little soft, but their outlook for April was positive, and so they weren't really seeing the weakness.  Obviously, you know, if you're making something that requires consumer credit to buy it like a car or a house, it's a different story, but the rest of the economy broadly based was in pretty good shape, so I'd say overall their outlook continues to be pretty positive, more than you might have expected for the economy at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then on the pricing question, should it be accelerating, what comes through in the P&amp;L based on contracts coming due?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we were very aggressive in pushing this most recent price increase through.  It appears to be sticking.  It appears that competition is mostly following in the professional market, and so obviously as contracts come up, the message that we're giving that team is to be aggressive on revenue recognition this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Lauren, they have had &#x2013; I think KCP has had 8 separate price increases over the last three and a half years, so they've actually been ahead of the consumer business, and in discussions with the team, they're very focused on improving realization so they've got -- I wouldn't call it a rhythm, but they've got almost a biannual price increase model, and they've really got the sales team focused on realization now which is a good thing to see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but just to be clear on that, those price increases, it only applies for a certain amount of time, so as contracts come due, things don't come due every year, so it's not that --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things we're trying to do, Lauren, which maybe we haven't talked about as much is we've been trying to convert more of our contracts to what's called an "until further notice" contract as opposed to an annual negotiation, so that we can change price more flexibly going forward. Now there still are some, the big government contracts that are an annual bid, but more of the day-to-day business is on an "until further notice" contract.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great.  And then just finally on the Health Care business, also the press release mentioned something about some issues in surgical supply, pricing was down which I wouldn't have expected, and volume was a little bit better, but if you can just talk about some of the dynamics there, what exactly is going on from a competitive standpoint, and if you've started to make up some of that business in the nitrile gloves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, Health Care is a tale of two cities there, we've got the supplies business which is things like gloves and surgical and surgical wrap, and gowns, and that's been a tough competitive battle, and then we've got the devices business which are all the Ballard products. And those have been going very well, so we had solid growth in devices in the quarter, and we had good international growth in the quarter, which was up double digit, but the drag, which are the bigger parts of the business are on the supplies side. And some of it was comparisons to the prior quarter where we had a fair amount of mask sales still for avian flu ordering which obviously it was a weaker flu season, so there wasn't as much of that this year, some of it was still the gloves comparison, it's a longer sales cycle to really gain back customers from a glove standpoint, so the team feels good about the order pipeline, but it hasn't all translated into orders at this point in time. And so I'd say pricing is more competitive than you would think in this environment on the supply side as we have companies like Medline and even Cardinal have been more aggressive in trying to take -- bid business which is why you saw the little bit weaker price comparison. So I think there's more competition in Health Care than we were probably expecting at this point in time given the costs that are occurring in the cycle.</p>

First, I think you mentioned in your remarks that while you were pleased with the margins in the Personal Care segment, you thought there was more improvement than the rest of the business.  In those businesses were the costs higher than you expected because of inflation, or is there something in the SG&amp;A area that is ahead of budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'd say the SG&amp;A were on track.  I think particularly in Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional, you know, it's our big manufacturing operations.  We didn't operate a couple of our mills at plan, so we had some higher costs in Consumer Tissue in Europe as we were converting over to the Andrex long roll, that affected us, a couple of our tissue mills in the US had some unplanned maintenance spending that was higher than we anticipated in the first quarter, and so those were areas that we were referencing and that, despite the inflation, we also didn't operate at plan in a couple of our businesses in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can you quantify what the gross margin impact of the mills not operating at plan would have been just to put it into perspective relative to what's happening with inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, inflation would be by far the bigger number, so you're probably talking in the high single digit, low double digit millions of dollars as opposed to the 160 million of cost inflation that we saw for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then secondly, as food inflation rises in a lot of the developing and emerging world, have you seen that start to cut into disposable impact and -- I mean, disposable impact and have some sort of impact on your BRICIT sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, obviously we had a great D&amp;E quarter where sales were up 22%.  I think if you look at our BRICIT sales for the quarter, they were up more than 40%, and so we're not seeing that yet at this point in time.  Obviously as we have thought about that, you've got about a billion people in the world that live on a dollar a day or less, and as rice has doubled and other food stuffs have doubled that's clearly cutting into their purchasing power.  If you think about our strategy we probably are aimed at more the middle income consumer or the growing middle class, and in most of those markets, incomes for that group are still rising faster than inflation, and so you're not seeing as big of a pocket book impact on the food cost. But it is something that we continue to watch and have some concern about, but so far it doesn't seem to be affecting our D&amp;E sales as much as you might have expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's great and just one final question, back to inventory.  I think we understand that you are going to -- that you have changed your compensation structure to address the inventory issue, but are there targets in terms of the number of days you want to take out or the growth rate of inventory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're basically targeting working capital as a percent of sales, so and then they can break that down into individual business units in terms of how they track back to get to the percent of sales targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Can you give us what the inventory targets are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will vary by business.  At enterprise level, again, we're setting the goal to reduce working capital as a percent of sales.  Obviously we were up in the first quarter, so we'll be talking to our top 1,000 leaders right after this call and talking about how we're going to get back on track, so --</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Gail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You have told touched on this a little bit on the call but just to be explicit, last call you were very bullish on the US consumer and having pushed through the price increase, I'm just wondering, the experiences you have had in this quarter, are you just as bullish, less bullish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it still feels pretty good.  We were looking at private label shares and kind of how it compared versus first quarter last year and also sequentially and you're seeing private label shares flat or down in nearly every category that we compete in both sequentially and versus first quarter of last year, so that would say that the consumer is holding up pretty well in this environment. You're still seeing solid growth in the super premium segments of categories, so where we're able to bring those little luxuries that don't cost that much more, but mom is willing to buy that to take better care of her family, you've got to obviously deliver value in those situations, and so she'll keep coming back and buying that.  But so far we're still optimistic about the consumer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great.  And just going back to inflation, when you were talking about fiber, you were highlighting waste paper, and during your earlier -- during the earlier comments there were comments on eucalyptus, but just in general specifically looking at pulp, is that playing out largely as you expected?  There's been a little bit more push back on pricing lately.  Are you any more encouraged that you'd see some relief later in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd say northern softwood has been tracking with -- pretty much with expectations.  Eucalyptus has run up faster than expected.  In fact with more capacity coming on in the southern hardwood type environment, we'd expected that to be the weaker grade for the year and it's actually &#x2013; with the $20 a ton they took in February and they're proposing $40 for April, that's a more aggressive move than we would have expected for eucalyptus at this point in time.  Secondary fiber has had more to do with Asian demand for secondary fiber as they're buying up a lot of the secondary that's available in the US and Europe and shipping it to China to be used in cardboard box plants that are being built over there, so that's one that I don't see that trend slowing down too much either in the near term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And finally a last question, going back to Europe, you talked about not as much cost pressure because of the currency and what that means.  I'm just wondering, I mean, given that prices are actually down in Europe, there has to be significant margin pressure there.  Is there any sense what might get that to break and turn in the other direction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we did get some Consumer Tissue price in the quarter, but did not achieve any on the Personal Care front, and so I think that what you're seeing right now is more of the retailer driving category price levels and while some of those retailer skirmishes take place, it's going to be difficult to call what the long-term pricing levels are going to look like.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning Mark and Tom.  First question is on the -- you mentioned that Consumer Tissue prices were up 2% year on year.  How much of the first quarter initiative did you actually experience in the quarter and sort of how much was left over to see -- realize in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the pricing on both consumer tissue as well as on diapers and training pants which all happened around the same time happened around mid quarter, so around the middle of February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have about half way to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then you mentioned -- I think Mark you mentioned that the fiber -- I think you said either fiber or fiber and energy were several cents above plan in the first quarter.  Can you talk a little bit about how that broke down, and did you mean 2 cents, 4 cents just to give us an idea?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>...less than 10, so --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But were you talking about both those categories or just fiber?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both those categories.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then you mentioned on the -- just one thing on the other income which was -- usually is a negative number, and the currency gains, we would I guess expect to see that kind of a number if we see the dollar maintain it's relative &#x2013; it's pace of decline, which was pretty sharp in first quarter, but if we don't, then I believe we would not see such an increase in the future quarters.  Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chip, I think it is really tough to predict, but I think kind of plus or minus 5 million expense or income is the range you ought to think about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Got you.  And then lastly on the tax rate, in your press release on January 24th, you mentioned a tax rate for '08 of 30 to 32% but in the comments you said 26 to 28.  Usually I believe you're supposed to -- I'm not an accountant, but make your best guess each quarter as to what your full-year rate will be, and it looks like this year you're telling us 30 to 32 in the second.  Is that also your best guess of the year, or is that an adjustment to get you to a level that you think will be different for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, our full-year outlook is still the same at 28 to 30.  Just timing of various initiatives hit us such that under the current accounting rule -- under the accounting rules, you sort of book them when you have them, and we're expecting the second quarter to be 30 to 32.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chip, I used to be an accountant, so I understood it the way that you described it, that you used to have to kind of true it up, but the way the new accounting rules work which is FIN 48, you basically have to mark all of your reserves up or down during each quarter, so you're going to see I think for most companies more volatility in interim effective rates, but we still think the long-term rate for the year is going to be in the 28 to 30 range.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello guys.  I was just wondering if you could maybe help me through the Personal Care margin behavior.  I guess if you could just kind of break down how much of that is coming from pricing versus leverage on growth in emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, Personal Care if you look at price and mix, it was about a point in North America.  It was down 3 in Europe.  You know, we were up about 5 points of price in Latin America, and Asia was about a push, so I'd say price and mix was overall slightly positive, probably a couple of points.  The bigger factor I think driving some of the margin activity was volume, where we had decent volume growth in North America, about 4%.  Europe was pretty flat, but Latin America and Asia were up double digits, so I'd say volume was a bigger impact on Personal Care profitability in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just kind of shifting gears, you see strategic marketing up but you guys have acknowledged that you're kind of paring back on your in-store promotional support which we have seen come through in the Nielsen data.  Do you have any early feedback on how competitors or retailers are responding to that?  I guess what implications you see that, at the consumer level as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, in terms of paring back in-store promotional support I think we are trying to make sure that we are managing the rate of increase in our trade funding, but I would expect that you're going to see us continue to get our fair share of promotional support, and so it's just trying to do it in a more efficient way, and spend less where we can to achieve that. So I think as we look at our marketing execution, we're more focused on full 360 execution than ever before, and so being able to take the great strategic marketing work that we're doing and then carrying it all the way through the retailer. So it's really getting those dollars to work harder for us and to lever more volume for the same marketing spend is really the focus that our teams are centered on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I'm just wondering about Consumer Tissue in Western Europe.  The 6% volume number was pretty astounding and do you think that's something that you can continue to achieve or improve upon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say a couple of things.  Europe had a much different cold and flu season than North America, so it had -- particularly France and the UK, we had a great facial tissue quarter as symptomology was much worse over there than it was here, so some of that was a seasonal impact that won't be sustained, but we also had a very solid launch of Andrex long roll in the first quarter.  I'm sure there was some pipeline fill as we brought that new product to market, but it was a solid launch, and good promotional support behind it, so probably I'd say the category is certainly not growing at that rate, so we were growing a little bit ahead of the category, so I would expect we won't sustain it quite at that level, but we were encouraged by the performance in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm encouraged that they kept the flu over there.  The other pricing side of things, can you just give us a rough number as to what the average price increase was at mid quarter?  You know, weighted for your portfolio?  And also if that was something that still needs to be offset by commitments and promotions or what have you and when we can actually see those numbers coming in to Kimberly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at for the whole company, net price promotion for the first quarter was about 2%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so the list price increases in North America were more in the 5, 6%, and so obviously we had about a half a quarter of that, but as we look at our outlook for the whole year, our guidance for -- when we laid it out was to have price in the 1 to 2% range.  I still think that's the right guidance but I guess we would trend more to the high end of that range than the low end of that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And is your focus more upon taking the pricing to cover the cost rather than looking for more volume at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  But still the 2%-ish looks like the number for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that if you continue to see inflation at the level that it's at we'll obviously be more aggressive in looking for price and give you more guidance as that plays out, but that's our planning assumption at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just in general too, I'm wondering what makes you optimistic about the 108 to 111 range given the much higher tax rate during the quarter.  What in the basic business looks very strong going into the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have some sequential improvement from revenue realization in our North American consumer businesses.  Our K-C Professional business also typically starts out a little slow as most distributors tend to not order as much in January, so we'd expect a pick up in K-C Professional sequentially.  D&amp;E momentum continues to be good.  We expect that to be strong heading into the second quarter, so those are probably the biggest factors that we would be looking at.</p>

          <p>That's a pretty good trick actually.  And then operating profit growth for the year -- actually operating profit growth for the year and then free cash flow growth for the year, do you guys have any assumptions on those two metrics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think operating profit growth for the year will be relatively consistent with our original assumptions.  We were looking for some margin expansion for the year, given where we're starting out I think that's going to be more difficult. But with the stronger top line, you should still see reasonable operating profit comparisons.  Free cash flow growth is going to depend on how successful we are at improving working capital in the back half of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So there's no number around it?  If it stays at current trends it probably doesn't grow, but if you do get some of the improvements you should see modest low single growth?  Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's probably fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then you kind of talked about the sensitivity to all the other input costs in the model but you never really have talked about diesel.  Can you just give me some help on your sensitivity to diesel prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if you look at the first quarter, I mean, distribution cost other than volume was up about 20 million bucks which is -- that's not all diesel, but a good chunk of it is diesel, so I don't know, Mike, or Paul if you've got any other input on that, but --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, Bill, just part of the overall assumption that we would have on oil is that in North America, which would be the biggest impact, for every dollar per barrel of oil change, we have got about a 5 to $6 million impact to us in various things that come through including diesel fuel and <mark type="inaudible" /> packaging and other things like that.  I would say that diesel fuel comes through the quickest and then the other things take some time to roll through the system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That was the answer to my question.  So in that 6 million, diesel is incorporated into that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.  I really apologize for following up on this inventory situation again, but I just wanted to square something in your opening comments where I think you said that you had had some factory down time to keep finished goods inventory lower, and I'm assuming this is the same down time that you referred to as sort of a maintenance issue during the Q&amp;A.  Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, my comment was in my remarks, and that specifically relates to the Health Care business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's different than the comments Tom talked about with regard to down time which impacted our cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Got it.  And then, as we look at this -- so maybe this question isn't really relevant then, but did we see a bigger increase in raw material inventories as opposed to finished goods inventories in this quarter when we look at that inventory number and again does that -- exacerbated by the cost inflation we're seeing, does that mean a little more forward buying in pulp, what have you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say we saw a little bit of that, for example in our K-C Professional business.  They're keeping a little bit more secondary fiber around just because it was hard to get and so where you can find some, you tend to buy it, but I'd say the majority of the increase was in finished products and not in higher quantities of raw materials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And so as we follow-up on the finished products commentary you guys have talked about this pretty consistently over the past nine months, in terms of being related to the restructuring piece et cetera, so it seems as though the commentary there is still consistent with where you have been over the past nine months, it's just probably a little bit worse than where you anticipated and so the back half benefit probably will still happen, just maybe off of a higher base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we just finished a set of forecast reviews on each of our businesses and everybody had a reason why we had more inventory, but -- and they all had plans to bring it down, and some of it --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the problem is everyone has a reason why they have higher inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some have been building it for product launches, and some of it legitimately is the case, but in the end, I think we have probably added more complexity with more SKUs, we've got a more complex distribution system, and so some of it will be systemically higher than it was before we started, but we can still do better than we have done today and we will be taking some down time in the second quarter and third quarter to help bring it back into line.</p>
