        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mar&#xED;a and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining Telef&#xF3;nica's 2009 First Quarter Results Conference Call. Today with me I have Julio Linares, our Chief Operating Officer, Guillermo Ansaldo, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a, Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Latinoam&#xE9;rica, and Matthew Key, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe. During the Q &amp;-A session you'll have the opportunity to ask questions directly to any of them.</p>
          <p>In a more difficult economic environment, Telef&#xF3;nica has again posted very solid earnings, showing our focused strategy and our strength. As of today, we are delivering on the management priorities announced in February. We are pursuing major growth opportunities in our markets, which combines the benefits of our high geographic and business diversification, and our leadership in key markets, sometimes underappreciated, allow us to post industry-leading organic top line growth.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth in Latin America continues to be very strong, but Telef&#xF3;nica Europe has shown an outstanding performance. We are also leveraging our scale and execution capabilities to actively manage OpEx and CapEx to further enhance efficiency and increase cash flow generation, and it's bearing fruits, as we continue to expand margin across geographies and operating cash flow growth well ahead of revenues.</p>
          <p>And we are fully committed to have the very attractive shareholders remuneration, with growing dividends and share buyback programs tactically used. As we announced, in 2009 dividends per share will increase 15% year-on-year to &#x20AC;1.15 per share.</p>
          <p>At the same time in the first quarter of 2009, we have recorded a strong 13% year-on-year increase in earnings per share, while we have reinforced our solid financial position, enhancing our debt maturities profile. The positive results reported in the first months of the year allow us to reiterate our 2009 guidance for all metrics &#x2013; revenue, OIBDA, operating cash flow growth &#x2013; and we do also confirm our previously stated EPS and free cash flow per share targets for 2010.</p>
          <p>In slide number four, we show a summary of our first quarter earnings. In organic terms, we continued to post healthy growth rates, driven by Telef&#xF3;nica Latinoam&#xE9;rica, which contributed the most to the growth, and Telef&#xF3;nica Europe, which helped offset the lower contribution of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a. As a result, organic sales in the first three months of the year grew 2.8% year-on-year, while OIBDA growth rose 2.5%. OIBDA margins stood at 39.1%, showing the benefits of scale and higher efficiencies achieved. Operating income growth stood at 3.9% year-on-year, purely organic.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash generation, organic operating cash flow grew by 4.5% year-on-year to reach &#x20AC;4.2 billion at the end of March. Please note it that the reported growth rates are negatively hit by ForEx, impacting major financial metrics by 1.3 to 4.7 percentage points. Net income amounted to &#x20AC;1.7 billion, showing an outstanding 10% versus the last year.</p>
          <p>Organic revenue growth is driven by the continued expansion of our customer base. We ended March '09 with more than 261 million accesses at the Group level, or 4% above last year's figures. Growth rates posted by mobile, especially in mobile broadband, fixed broadband and pay TV are to be highlighted.</p>
          <p>We are delivering very strong growth, not only in terms of cash, but also in terms of earnings per share. Reported basic earnings per share reached &#x20AC;0.37 per share, up around 13% annually. If we exclude the impact from purchase price allocations, earnings per share would have reached $0.14. And free cash flow per share totaled &#x20AC;0.28 in the first quarter of the year, recording a notable 57% year-on-year growth.</p>
          <p>2009 guidance execution is presented in slide number six. Taking into account the seasonality of CapEx, we are fully on track to reach our growth targets. The guidance criteria consolidated year-on-year growth rates, revenues and OIBDA were 3.3% and 2.9% respectively, within the guidance ranges announced last February. CapEx up to March stood close to &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>As a result of the guidance criteria, operating cash flow growth reached 5%. However, growth will accelerate along the year as we have recorded lower investments in Q1 '08 to Telef&#xF3;nica O2 in Germany due to timing differences, higher investments in Q1 '09 in Vivo that should not be extrapolated for the full year, and the 3G licenses accounting in Q2 of '08 in Vivo.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide number seven, we saw that our strategy is adapted to market conditions in each of our geographies, and we are successfully executing our priorities in each region to deliver sound group results, combining the solid top line performance with an even higher cash flow generation. We are fully capturing our organic growth potential in those markets that keep growing, mainly in Latin America and Europe; while in countries like Spain, where trading conditions are more difficult, we are focused on increasing cash flow.</p>
          <p>I'd like to highlight that operating cash flow organic growth exceeded by close to 2 percentage points the growth rate of sales on the back of our larger scale and the execution of our OpEx and CapEx efficiency measures. This is true not only for the Group as a whole, but for every single region of operations on a comparable basis.</p>
          <p>In slide number eight, we show our ongoing focus to increase cash flow generation with an active management of OpEx and CapEx. A key message I want to pass is that we have flexibility to manage them without jeopardizing growth opportunities. Total Group CapEx decreased 4% year-on-year in the first quarter of '09, with reductions across most items, mainly due to the high investments already made in past years in GSM in Europe, and lower commercial activity in the traditional fixed-line business. However, we continue to invest in growth platforms, such as fixed and mobile broadband and pay TV. These investments represent 30% of our total CapEx year-to-date, and are increasing 10% year-on-year with an outstanding 36% rise in 3G CapEx versus last year's figure.</p>
          <p>Two key data points show our flexibility to manage CapEx. First, 75% of the CapEx planned for 2009 is related to business transformation and growth projects, which could be managed and adapted to respond to changes in demand, competitive pressures, and the economic environment. Second, against the first quarter, CapEx committed was only 30% of our annual target.</p>
          <p>We do also have a relatively high flexibility to retain control of our costs, as a significant part of our expenses could be manageable in the short term to respond to changes in demand. This ability is reflected in the 4% organic annual drop in total commercial costs on the back of lower handset subsidies, advertising and billing costs, and on the year-on-year decrease in interconnection costs, mainly driven by lower usage and tariffs in Spain.</p>
          <p>As we explained in our previous conference calls, we are also developing global initiatives to further sharpen OpEx and CapEx efficiency at the Group level, leveraging of the advantages of the higher scale of our operations. The global initiatives already launched in the first quarter of '09 will generate more than &#x20AC;100 million savings for the full year, while we keep working across areas to accelerate the transformation of the company's operating model and obtain further efficiency gains.</p>
          <p>Let's now review the performance of our operations, starting in Spain. In a more challenging environment, Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a has been focused on maximizing operating cash flow and retaining value customers. Efficiency measures implemented have allowed to limit the OIBDA erosion, despite revenue pressure. Let me remark the increased OIBDA margin in wireless and flattish margins in wireline reflecting the royalty flexibility to adapt our cost base to the current situation.</p>
          <p>Investments rationalization leveraging our integrated approach, have driven CapEx significantly down by 28%. Our OpEx and CapEx discipline have led to a strong performance in cash generation, with operating cash flow increasing by 0.2% year-on-year on a comparable basis in the first quarter, offsetting top line decline across businesses.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide number 10, let me summarize the major trends we are seeing on the top line. In a weaker economic scenario, we continue to see positive drivers. IT services are growing by almost 25% on contracts won over the quarter, while wireline data revenues are also showing a strong performance. Wireless data revenues keep growing by a notable 7%, boosted by sustained strong performance of connectivity revenues, up 50% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On the negative side, the current environment is more noticeable in lower usage patterns across businesses, decrease in roaming in revenues as we have a lower number of visitors in our network, but also due to regulated price cuts. Additionally, the different phasing of wireless handset shipments to the channel are the signs of declining handset revenues. And we are also seeing a major impact from regulatory decisions. So as with the trend happening in other European markets, full ULL prices have been cut by 20% this year, and the PSTN monthly fee has remained unchanged versus 2008. In addition, we are being hit by the cumulative 17% cut in MTRs in the last 12 months. It's true that in terms of commercial activity during the quarter we have not led the growth of the margin, but we were able to do some revenue share and with some success I can say.</p>
          <p>In wireless, we have seen over the last 12 months a positive gap between our customer revenue share and our access market share widening, and our estimate for the quarter is that this gap would finish the standard between four to five percentage points. In the wireline, we think that the gap should also have improved in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In slide number 11, we review the main KPIs of our Spanish operations. In Q1, we took a more rational commercial approach, which was not followed by other players in the market. With the slowing wireline retail Internet broadband market, that's another major European market, we posted over 9% growth in accesses, maintaining our leadership in the market with an estimated share of 56%.</p>
          <p>The wireless business, with fast evolution of wireless data flat rates matching last year's figure. In the wireless business, we keep our focus on the value segment, extending our contract customer base ahead of the total. The mobile market continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace, the competition stays very compelling. In this environment, we kept under control churn at 1.9%, relatively unchanged versus last year's figure, with economic churn being well below this figure. ARPU reflected lower usage patterns, mainly in voice and in the residential segment and lower MTRs, though outgoing ARPU performed better as obtained by the solid data incoming ARPU. Data ARPU increased from 19% of total ARPU, growing five percentage points more than in January-March 2008, showing a very healthy performance.</p>
          <p>Fixed telephony lines dropped 5.3% year-on-year, but still one of the best performances across main European markets, despite the tougher economic environment. It is worth mention that there is 53% of lines lost are now Telef&#xF3;nica wholesale lines, and therefore generate revenues for the company. Second, the ARPU of these customers is lower than the average ARPU, and most of the disconnections are single-play accesses; the remaining 47% of lines lost are related to the lower market growth and higher unbundler activity.</p>
          <p>To finish up with Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a's review, I'd like now to provide some more color on how we are managing our OpEx and CapEx base. Now we'll start things, we are doing a good job as our efficiency ratio shows, so the OpEx plus CapEx over revenues has gone down by 1.3 percentage points over the last 12 months. For the sake of comparison, we are using a 12 months rolling figure to avoid CapEx <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, CapEx was down 28% year-on-year led by lower investment in GSM. The fact that the deployment of the traditional routes has mostly halted as construction sector is closing, and broadband demand has slowed down and related investment has been adjusted accordingly, and we have adopted our fiber rollout to the current economic environment.</p>
          <p>This, together with those initiatives, means that increasing CapEx efficiencies such as wirelines and wireless network integration, IT systems rationalization and also per unit cost reductions on delivering Group purchasing power and vendors adjusting prices to adapt to economic situation will continue benefiting us in the coming quarters. At the same time, we keep investing in growth platforms such as mobile data, without jeopardizing future growth prospects.</p>
          <p>On the OpEx side, reductions came to 6% on a comparable basis due to commercial costs down 11%, handsets by 24% and interconnects 12%. Also, last year's head count reduction, together with lower CPI, has put less pressure on personnel costs.</p>
          <p>As with CapEx, initiatives being deployed will also provide some OpEx lowering in the future. The energy efficiency and rationalization programs, logistics simplification mobile network sharing, among others.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide 13, to review on Latin American property, I would like to stress the very solid performance across most of our business, combining growth and profitability.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, customer organic growth across the region reached a healthy 13% year-over-year to surpass 159 million accesses, mainly driven by broadband and mobile services. The strong fundamentals of the business have led to an over 10% revenue growth ex-FX and 9% up to March in organic terms, supported by the further expansion of the mobile service revenues and Internet and pay TV sales.</p>
          <p>OIBDA performed even better, posting a 14% organic growth. The OIBDA margin reached 38.5%, improving almost 2 percentage points versus March '08 in organic terms, driven by the strong advance in the mobile business, as we leveraged scale economics and further commercial efficiencies. Wireless OIBDA increased 6 percentage points year-on-year to 38.2%.</p>
          <p>Improved profitability boosted operating cash flow generation, which, despite higher CapEx devoted to growth platforms, rose more than 4% year-on-year, even in organic terms.</p>
          <p>Let me quickly sum up the evolution of our Latin American wireless businesses. Customer growth remained very strong in the quarter, registering double-digit growth rates in most operations in a region where the average wireless penetration has increased in the last 12 months, 12 percentage points to 83%. Further potential is still to be captured with the two largest markets, Brazil and Mexico, still lagging behind. Gross adds were lower than in the first quarter of 2008, but net adds in Q1 reached 1.3 million customers, as we capitalized on churn improvements year-on-year. Our strategy to stimulate usage to new commercial offerings led to a 17% increase in traffic However, ARPU performance was negatively impacted by the strong customer expansion and MTR cuts.</p>
          <p>In terms of financials, I would like just to highlight that mobile sales posted a sound evolution, mainly explained by the remarkable growth of outgoing service revenues. Mobile data services, and in particular datacom activity and content SMSs continued to gain traction and already represents 17% of service revenues up to March, versus 14% last year. This area is a huge growth opportunity for us, and we will further exploit it along the year with a push on our 3G networks and mobile broadband offerings.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, we show the events in the transformation of the wireline business. In the first quarter of 2009, broadband net adds were 142,000, to reach a total retail broadband access base of 6.2 million in March '09, or a 19% increase on an annual basis. The strong expansion was driven by our strategy to push our bundle and a deeper market segmentation through innovative propositions.</p>
          <p>Pay TV to a triple-play solution is also key to limit the pressure on the traditional fixed-line business. These accesses advanced by over 30%, topping the 1.6 million mark at the end of March. As a result, Internet and pay TV revenues continued increasing their weight quarter-on-quarter, to top 20% of total wireline revenues; 2.6 percentage points more than a year ago, being the driver of wireline top line expansion.</p>
          <p>In summary, our operations in Latin America continued to record a very healthy top line growth rate across most markets, despite the slowdown in some of the economies. In our scale, integrated management model and further efficiency gains continue to be approved with margin expansion across markets.</p>
          <p>Let me outline the main topics across the key countries. In Mexico, with a market share north of 19.5%, service revenue continues growing ahead of customer growth and doubling our main competitor growth rate. And we have posted a strong increase in profitability, with a close to 10 percentage points margin expansion and an over 40% increase in local currency in operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, Vivo has consolidated its leadership in a very competitive market, expanding its customer base by 19% in organic terms year-on-year, with service revenues growing ahead in organic terms and further margin advances. Telesp has reinforced its strategy of bundling and segmentation, fostering local flat rates and double- and triple-play offers with high broadband speeds in this first quarter, though Q1 performance was impacted by the introduction of a new call center law.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, we have posted a very robust double-digit revenue growth, both in mobile and wireless, on the back of a strong bundling and on-net traffic strategy. In addition, operation leverage and further cost control measures drove OIBDA up by more than 30% year-on-year in local currency.</p>
          <p>And finally, in Venezuela, the business is showing a very strong performance on all operating and international metrics. Profitability continues to improve, reaching margins over 52%, despite the double-digit growth in customers.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 17, which shows that Telef&#xF3;nica Europe continued posting a strong financial performance in the first quarter, maintaining market momentum with a steady revenue growth in constant currency, while delivering year-on-year organic 12% growth in operating cash flow. It is worth mentioning the improved balance in our European business portfolio, particularly Germany, and the increase in revenue contribution from DSL activities.</p>
          <p>Total customer base was up 9% to 47 million, highlighting an exceptional performance in the wireless contract segment through some propositions around flat rates, SIM-only, mobile broadband as well as successful retention of business across markets. Ongoing focus on efficiency programs and flexible management of CapEx are also key to adapt business to an increasingly tough operating environment.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., Telef&#xF3;nica O2 business, again, outperformed in a slower market. After adding close to 300,000 contract customers at the end of March, contract customers made up 43% of the mobile base on the back of healthy gross adds and market-leading contract churn rate at 1.2%. The combination of O2's range of innovative propositions and its leadership in customer satisfaction across all segments continued to drive market share gain.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth remains solid at 7% year-over-year in local currency, driven by the 5.2% rise in wireless service revenues. The increased number of mobile broadband connections and continued success of high-end phones, such as the BlackBerry and the iPhone, running non-peer, peer-to-peer, SMS data revenue year-over-year growth of 42%. Obviously, the voice ARPU declined as it reflects the current trading environment.</p>
          <p>The company was able to keep margins in the quarter at 24%, leveraging on efficiency optimization of customer investment costs, continued operational efficiencies in non-commercial costs, and improved contribution from the DSL business that helped the business maintaining momentum in the market.</p>
          <p>On slide number 19, we show that Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany is on track to realizing its full potential in Europe's largest telco market. The business continued to deliver profitable growth in the quarter, with total revenues increasing 3.6% year-on-year on sustained mobile business and fixed broadband performances. A significant 38% growth in contract net adds quarter-on-quarter already shows the benefit from the ongoing investment in our own network build out and increased distribution channels.</p>
          <p>The recent introduction of the O2 one proposition in the German market based on the clear, simple and transparent tariff structure, will start to drive momentum in the German market. A clear outcome from building foundations of the business is the 24% year-on-year growth in OIBDA and 23% margin in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our financial profile, we show that it remains steady. In the first quarter, our debt has been reduced by &#x20AC;500 million and our debt ratios stand below two times OIBDA or just above it when we include other cash commitments.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we have further improved our financial profile as of both in the short and in the long-term. We have raised &#x20AC;3 billion from the bond market for pre-financing debt maturing in Telef&#xF3;nica SA in 2009, and we have extended &#x20AC;4 billion of our syndicated facility maturing 2011, where we have 50% one year later and 50% two years later. As such, our existing cash balance exceeds gross maturities for the remainder of 2009. Our average debt life exceeds 6.4 years in March '09, registering a 0.5 year increase, thanks to our financing activities. Our financial expenses stay at 5.95% of our average total debt of &#x20AC;45.1 billion. As 25% of our debt remained exposed to floating risk, we expect a decreasing trend as new lower rate fixings gradually replace the old ones.</p>
          <p>To sum up, we continue to post strong results, capitalizing on our highly diversified asset portfolio and delivering on the management priorities that we announced for 2009. First, we are capturing growth opportunities in our markets, allowing us to post benchmark organic growth rates. Second, we increased our strong cash flow generation across regions. Third, the 2009 dividend per share will increase 15% against the fiscal year of 2008. In addition, we have a sound financial position and we have posted double-digit earnings per share growth.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to reiterate our confidence to deliver again on our commitment. We are fully on track to meet 2009 guidance and we do confirm our 2010 EPS and free cash flow per share targets.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much for your attention, and now we are ready to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions, please. First, with regards to Telesp, the trends deteriorated quite a bit versus Q4, so obviously positive revenue growth. But we note that in traffic, the turns are much worse than 2008. So I was wondering if you could give us a bit of color here on this quarter and then normally versus 2008, or is this the trend we should expect for this year?</p>
          <p>And second, about your performance in Venezuela, I note that total traffic is up 7%, yet ARPU is up 22%. So I was wondering if the increase in ARPU was merely due to the fact that you are able to pass the high inflation in the country to your customers, or is there anything else in terms of new product adoptions et cetera? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thanks for the question. On Telesp, I would like to outline that bulk of the performance has been driven by the impact that we have been having on the new law on call centers that has been driving us to focus our main activity in addressing quality concerns and sustaining the number of lines. And therefore, we have been closing some of the commercial activity till those problems were fixed. It is true that this new call center law was issued in December, but the main impacts have been flowing in January and February.</p>
          <p>On top of that, it is true that we have been forced to adopt the commercial offer in order to focus on new products and bundles. But mainly, the impact in Telesp in the first quarter is driven by this fact that we have been focusing our main activity in addressing the impacts of these new call center law.</p>
          <p>It is also true that the figures of last year were impacted by the <mark type="inaudible" /> incorporation and therefore growth last year appears to be higher than the organic growth. But mainly the impact has been adverse. And therefore, we are focusing all our efforts in addressing the situation and we are confident that the situation will be improving gradually in the next quarters. On top of that, Brazil is extending some kind of cooperation in terms of industrial activity, in terms of credit activity, so we do think that the Brazilian market can offer some additional possibilities in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>In Venezuela, we have several effects. It is true that we have been increasing tariffs, but it is also true that we have been focusing on the mobile traffic, on-net traffic and contract customers. It is also true that the handset activity in Venezuela in different concentrations has also been very high and therefore there are several effects that are mixed in Venezuela, not only the factor of inflation. We are also driving the quality of our customers and that way, you will see that our -share of revenues is higher than the share that we have now &#x2013; on market share on customers. So I think that there are several effects that are being mixing in Venezuela.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Three questions please. Firstly, the CapEx level in Spain is very low this quarter; I wondered whether that was sustainable going forward? And secondly, you mentioned the roaming effect and what that does to service revenues. Can you perhaps quantify how much of the revenues are roaming, and also perhaps give us an indication of what sort effect you'd expect in later quarters? Presumably it's got a greater effect in Q2 and Q3. And then finally, performance in Colombia looks a touch like, I think you've probably lost in subscriber markets there. Can you perhaps talk to us about what's happened there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding your questions in CapEx, yes it is a low level but has several levers that explain that levels. First, we are reducing CapEx on 2G and we are focusing on 3G; that's a strategic move and that will be sustained. Second, the lower level of commercial activity in some CapEx-intensive accesses, like broadband or pay TV, is a bad news on the revenue side, but on the CapEx side, we're able to obviously save money on that front. Obviously also third, we are adapting the fiber rollout to the current environment: that means that whenever we have a case where we see a positive NPV and a very short repayment period, we will do it. But otherwise we will postpone it, or we'll think it for future times.</p>
          <p>So some of these &#x2013; and also, sorry, another very strong factor is that we are getting better prices on the purchasing vendor side, profiting from the scale of the Group and our industry alliances. So that's our very sustainable reasons. Obviously, I hope that trading conditions improve and I will be able to spend more money on the commercial side. But and also &#x2013; but quarter-by-quarter we have some seasonality in the way we spend the money. But the savings due to model our spending to the commercial activity is something that is very natural and the purchasing savings and the scale savings that will be there to remain.</p>
          <p>Regarding your roaming questions, let me see if I get it right, you want the numbers. Let me give you all the numbers and then see if I answer your question but, total service revenues &#x2013; service revenues is revenues without handset revenues, is 1,900; 21 is the table in the information we published. Out of that, 29 million is roaming in, and that has a decrease of 32%, and that's based on two factors. One is approximately a 7% decrease in the visitors, 7.7 decrease in the visitors, and also there is a decrease in the traffic linked to those visitors of 5.9%, and the rest is price reduction.</p>
          <p>So if price reduction and some of the savings are in line also with expense reduction related to roaming costs, but roughly 29 millions in the quarter for roaming in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess I was trying to get is that going to be a greater impact in Q2 and Q3, if you have the same trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's 29 millions out of almost 2,000, not 1,921.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's basically the level of impact that we're going to get. And on the OIBDA level, remember that on the roaming expense, all the price reductions we also get some reduction on volume reduction on the expense, so it's not that relevant. I am much more concerned on the customer revenues than on the roaming.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question about Colombia wireless, it is true that credit rates has been increasing in this quarter because we have been changing that part of the customer base after the Christmas campaign, which is I would say normal. I know our main competitor did the same in the same period. It is true that on the contract side, we need to replace the offer and we are focusing on that on the pre price, while we have, I would say, an attractive offer on the market, we need to strengthen our commercial distribution networking in Colombia, and that's what we are doing.</p>
          <p>But let me stress that in the same time we are highly focusing on profitability. We have been reducing handset subsidies and we have been much more focused on profitability on our traffic campaigns and as a result of that, let me stress that OIBDA has increased by 28%, and that operating cash flow has been increased by roughly 70%. So it's a need of looking for more profitability and replacing and refocusing our commercial campaigns there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Guillermo, I don't know if you can provide us a bit more detail on traffic in Spain in mobile. I know you're not reporting MoU anymore, but, then if you can give us some thoughts of what the numbers look like?  And then a question on Venezuela: what is the cash position right now at the end of Q1? And what can you do to get that money out, if there is anything you can do? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is also Guillermo. Regarding traffic in Spain in the mobile business, two comments. First, you see service revenues are decreasing but the gap is half the gap of the total revenues because of the handset sales. But focusing on client revenues, roughly again 75% is ARPU reduction and 25% is less access growth. And in ARPU reduction, obviously, we are seeing a modest deceleration, particularly in prepaid. Postpaid is deteriorating the same way as in the fourth quarter, but prepaid is the one that has changed shape in this quarter.</p>
          <p>So roughly in terms of MoU, to give you the actual number, we are decreasing 6% total MoU minutes. And again, if you take away the things that we usually take away, like the data only SIMs and campaigns so we can compare in the same level, that number goes down to, I think, 4.4. So basically, it's a 6% reduction in MoUs and 4.4 reduction if you take away these two effects. Again, it's much more focused, the change in trend, in prepaid. So the top-ups in the quarter, particularly in March, were lower than expected and obvious that was hit in the MoU and obviously hit in the ARPU.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jesus, this is Santiago. And on terms of the cash position in Venezuela, as you know, Venezuela operates under currency controls, so you have to ask a permission to <mark type="inaudible" /> the local currency agency to repatriate dividends or other payments. Currently, we have asked for the 2006 dividends to be repatriated. And on top of that, we have a cash position, which is roughly equivalent to the dividends that we would expect to claim to go home for 2007 and 2008. The net cash position is roughly equivalent to $2 billion as of present, which is also roughly the amount that the two dividends &#x2013; or the two net profit figures for 2007 and 2008 &#x2013; should look like.</p>

          <p>And if I could follow up, the black market rate of the bolivar is what eight bolivares per euro right now against official price of three more or less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's not a black market; it's actually a so-called parallel currency market and it's been going from four to eight, depending on when you look at it. Truthfully, the result is under inflationary pressures and that is no secret, but it's anybody's guess exactly to where the currency should be aligned, if the market were to be first opened. What we can say, what we have been saying all along, is these attentions are significant, that so far we have been repatriating at the official exchange rate, which <mark type="inaudible" />. And while the cash is there, it is not sitting idle, it is earning interest. And so this has a mitigating impact on the time delay relative to the times when we request the repatriation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Could I ask you two questions. First of all, in Spain, I am keen to know whether the slowdown, or shrinkage rather, got worse during the quarter, or whether the ex-rate, excess rate, from the quarter was similar to the beginning of the quarter. Secondly, I don't really understand why Argentina did so well from a profit point of view, given the slowdown in revenue growth, and I wonder if I could ask you to link the answer to the level of inflation in Argentina. What was the real ex-inflation rate of sales and profit growth, please?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Terry, this is Guillermo Ansaldo. If I understood correctly your question, you want to know the shape of the slowdown across the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>March was worse than the first two months in terms of traffic, in terms of all buying patterns and consumer patterns. Good news is that April is better than March, so we still trying to understand what happens in the minds of consumers. But March was a very low month for trading in Spain in general, and also in our business. April was better than March in some categories, much better; in some, slightly better. But it's a different month, so we'll see. But March was the worst month in the three months of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guillermo, could I just follow up? I was unclear whether you claiming that you'd taken or lost revenue share during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, two things. First, in the quarter, we have an estimation because we don't have all the companies publishing their results. So, for example, up to now, if I'm correct, Vodafone has not published their results, so we do estimation &#x2013; we do a lagging quarter type of estimation. So in mobile, our estimation &#x2013; again, this is our estimation &#x2013; we have, and you compare that to the first quarter of last year, we have improved. That's our intimation.</p>
          <p>And in fixed, we tend to decrease because we are losing &#x2013; we are the incumbent and we lose more fixed lines. So we are defending very well, but with a trend going down. Our estimate to give you a flavor, that we lost in one year 1 percentage point in the fixed business in revenue share, and when you combine both, we are pretty stable. So basically, first quarter compared to first quarter is, especially mobile, again with an estimation because we don't have all the public figures for all the companies. And in wireline we are slightly increasing; that's due to the fixed line. When you combine both, we are flattish and this is our estimate, so. In the case of mobile, what we tend to measure is outgoing traffic. The other categories are very hard and tricky to estimate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question about Argentina, let me say that with inflation, which is in the neighborhood of 60%, our consolidated revenues in the countries are growing 20% and our OIBDA is growing like roughly at 31%, so it's more than inflation. And let me remind you that on the wireline business, 50% of our revenues are subject to a tariff program for the last eight years.</p>
          <p>So, on the wireline business, with a revenue growth of 17.4%; you need to compare that with half of our revenue base in program for eight years, and OIBDA increased by 14.3%. We have been able to basically maintain flat the number of our traditional lines, to increase in ADSL roughly 25% year-on-year, and the margin of OIBDA has been flat on the wireline side year-on-year.</p>
          <p>On the wireless side, it's even, I would say, more outstanding on the operational side. Revenues are growing 21.4%, our OIBDA 46%, margin's expanding little, operating cash flow roughly growing 50% and we have been able to increase further on our share of revenue.</p>
          <p>So it's not inflation which is mainly driving the operational performance of our business in Argentina. We are highly focusing on quality in both wireline and wireless, on customer base, migrating prepaid customers to contract customers, unbundling with ADSL and pushing up the speed of access of ADSL. This is more than just last two applications.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it, is appears it is not as bad as inflation but the OIBDA expansion has been much greater than it was in the fourth quarter. And I just wondered if there were any one-offs or non-permanent effects there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have been more rational in terms of subsidizing handsets, for example, on the wireless side, and much more focused on value added campaigns on the traffic side, and the contract base of our customers is the highest in the region because we are, I would say, successfully migrating our prepaid customers to contract customers. So it's a mix of different things but let's say that from operational standpoint we are highly focused on improving the performance in Argentina and it's going well.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. First question just on the Spanish mobile. I think we have seen some new tariff plans from Orange in recent weeks, where they've halved the call sector fee. I wonder if that is a trend that Telef&#xF3;nica or other operators might follow. And then secondly just on Germany, we did see a slight slowdown, I think, in the service revenue growth trends compared to Q4. Obviously, you've got quite a big termination rate cut impacting from the start of April. So I wondered is it still realistic to expect positive service revenue trend for O2 Germany this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Spain, we are focusing our commercial activity in mobile in three areas, with three objectives. The first one is to stimulate usage. As I've mentioned in other questions and other answers, we did suffer from usage from our existing customers in our first quarter. So we are focusing a lot of the promotions on trying to stimulate usage of our customers. Examples are, top-ups promotions, special rates for international calls, flat rates, some on the weekends, some during the day. Those are our plans that are in some cases are massive, some cases are targeted to specific groups, but the idea behind those plans are to stimulate usage to get more traffic, for example, more activity for our existing customers.</p>
          <p>The second objective is a very specific need, which is the SIM-only offers; that's a trend that we adapted from the success in the U.K. These are specific low tariffs, but SIM-only, that means that we are not investing in subsidizing handsets and so on, so we are giving away on tariffs, but saving on the subsidies.</p>
          <p>And the third area, obviously, is boost &#x2013; we're trying to boost mobile data adoption, which is growing very well. We are much more focused on flat tariffs. In that sense, we have basically doubled the number of flat tariffs that we have, both for small screen and large screen; that's roughly 1 million customers. And so, we are not trying to enter in a price wars and we are not in a price war. Basically I think that the wise thing to do is try to stimulate this usage and try to push up the mobile data adoption, which is a trend that is positive, even this in this scenario, and obviously to address a specific segment need.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David hi. Matthew here. Very marginal slowdown; I think the quarter four number year-on-year was 0.8 and the Q1 number is 0.6. If I had to point to anything, it would be actually giving customers extra value in the tariffs. When I look forward, you're right, the MTR cut comes in from the start of quarter two. That will approximately take out a couple of percentage points out of revenue growth in Germany.</p>
          <p>The key offset to that is we've just launched a new tariff in Germany called O2 o. We launched it at the start of May, and from our perspective we got great hopes for the tariff because we think it's actually revolutionary in the German market. And so we think that's going to get some great traction, hopefully, to offset some of the MTR downside.</p>

          <p>Yes, just a quick question on the EPS guidance, please, the EPS stress test guidance, in particular. Was that based around trends we saw in Q3 and Q4 in Spain for instance? Because it would seem like trends into the beginning of the year, how it's further deteriorated; indeed you just indicated that perhaps March, once again has slipped. So, does the EPS stress test guidance reflect this Q1 dynamic? Does it reflect these pressures, certainly, in the Spanish market?</p>
          <p>And then just another couple of questions, please. To Jose Maria, it looks like in Mexico the 3G license auctions are being pushed back again. And you guys, I think, are scrambling for capacity there. Is that proving to hold you back now, AMX indicating that it's looking to price closer to guys to take some share away? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David. This is Santiago. Let me answer briefly the EPS in 2010 question. What we meant when we said that the stress test concluded, the prevailing trends was exactly what turned out to happen in Q1; that is, the weak economy or push in, with a lot of pressure on the top line and us being able to counterattack by first managing costs and second, adapting CapEx deployment to the environmental conditions. This is especially what we meant, and you probably have seen in the Q1 numbers, we are right on track, both on the EPS and on the free cash flow front.</p>
          <p>Of course, you can always design a scenario where by the doomsday it falls in and everything falls apart. We certainly do not think that the current environment is conducive to that kind of outcome, and but we certainly will continue to monitor the outlook. But so far, so good is what I would answer. Having said that, you may also have noticed that the currencies that were a dragging factor have actually turned for the better, and it is only a matter of time, should they stay where they are, that they start contributing in this in a more positive way.</p>

          <p>So just to check on that, Santiago, the EPS stress test, then, assumes that this kind of pressure in Spain, the kind of materially negative service revenue growth, underlying loss trends, are we assuming they continue or were you assuming they recover until 2010?</p>

          <p>Well, we are halfway down the line from October of '07 long term guidance towards the end of the 2010, so let's take the game as it comes. And what we can say is what we have said, that is, so far we do not see that our EPS implicit growth guidance is at risk, and we have no reason to believe, despite the ability of the weakish March, which has been probably more than compensated, as Guillermo explained, by a not so weakish April; and I am sure we can now see a couple of these months, some good, some not so good.</p>

          <p>Thanks for the question, David. Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a speaking. In Mexico, we do not have an issue on the voice part of our offer, and the only thing is that we will require more <mark type="inaudible" /> while it is broadband that we think is could be an opportunity and therefore we keep looking for the regulator to do this auction and our position as expected. But let me explain that from the voice point of view, we are in good capacity terms, and in fact after the first quarter, we will become let's say more aggressive in terms of doing more voice offers in this second quarter because we believe there is room for that in Mexico.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi. Three questions. The first one was just, could you dive into the change in, or the improvement in margin between the first quarter '09 and the first quarter '08? And could you just clarify whether or not you included its savings from not paying Deutsche Telekom for their network? I think Deutsche Tele had mentioned not receiving 42 million from you guys. My second question is, if you could provide an update on what you expect to be announced in the next weeks from Ofcom sort of beyond 2011 MTRs? And the same for Spain would be the third question, obviously CMT not Ofcom.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan, let me &#x2013; it's Mathew &#x2013; let me pick up your first one. I presume that the first question was specifically related to Germany, was it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, firstly, let me say that I just don't recognize the numbers Deutsche Telekom quoted, but it just happens to be about the same as our year-on-year OIBDA from Germany, which I think is like 40 million. I would point to four things, as far as the increase in Germany year-on-year. The first is we are getting more throughput through Telef&#xF3;nica Deutschland, which is our DSL wholesale business, taking through more customers and that's now moved into a positive situation. Secondly, we are benefiting from the rollout of our increased retail stores, so we're getting a higher proportion of our connections direct, and therefore not paying the indirect channels. Thirdly, we've moved our commercial model more to SIM-only and away from a pure handset. And fourthly, we're certainly using less of the minutes that we've committed to T-Mobile because of they are a better quality network.</p>
          <p>If I break those four down very roughly, if you take about 25% of improvement on each of the four, so sort of put 10 million alongside each of those four elements. So, where T-Mobile's 42 million comes from I don't know.</p>
          <p>You want me to pick up the Ofcom? Yeah, was that a U.K, question, Jonathan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you could pick up the Ofcom MTR and also the Kip Meek spectrum cap document this morning?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I don't know how many days you've got for me because the Kip Meek spectrum ...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me try. Effectively, what Kip Meek's proposal does, it suggests that there is a way forward on U.K. spectrum, such that the potential outcome is us and Vodafone hold on to our 900 megahertz spectrum, but we're blocked for a period from buying 800 megahertz spectrum, but all the operators are allowed to buy 2,600 spectrum.</p>
          <p>We welcome Kip's approach; we think it's a great proposal for a digital Britain, to give a USO potential, and from our perspective we'll be supporting the proposal through the next five weeks consultation process, which will happen with all the networks.</p>
          <p>And as far as Ofcom MTRs post 2011, pretty difficult to say, actually, because clearly it's in the future and it very much depends on what happens from a European perspective, but also it seems related clearly with the spectrum question from a cost perspective. But the current environment actually kicks in back end of this year. So we wait and see what Ofcom are going to do post 2011.</p>

          <p>So regarding MTR in Spain, as far as we know, we expect news in July. And you know the <mark type="inaudible" /> ended this last April, so <mark type="inaudible" />. We don't know if CMT is going to issue a three-year or four-year guide path, or a year-by-year. We do know, or we expect, two things: first, continuous reduction of asymmetry as want to converge to similar tariffs, that's good for us. And second, we expect, we hope to continue with non-disruptive path reduction but a non-disruptive reduction.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Luis Prota from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. I have two questions. The first one is on domestic mobile revenue trends in the second quarter. I'm trying to figure out what could be the impact from the new tariffs that you were launching late first quarter? And more specifically, I would like to understand whether these new low cost tariffs and subsidies that you are giving are going to be rating accretive or rating dilutive, and how do you address the risk of all the customers migrating to this cheaper tariff, diluting out. So I wonder whether if there's like a percentage of customers already benefiting from on-net or bundles at cheaper prices could help us understand this risk?</p>
          <p>And then the other question is on mobile data revenues in Spain, which are up 7% this quarter, which is around half the rate of the last few quarters. So I'm interested on hearing on SMS revenue trends within this, and whether this is affected mostly by volumes or pricing, and any change in dynamics that fits in here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the impact of new tariffs. Well, we have a long tradition of launching savings tariffs in mobile in Spain, like numbers like Nico Vita, which are savings models to one specific number, and Cinco, which is five specific numbers, a lower tariff, the on-net and so on. And with us, also some flat rates in our portfolio. Obviously, you always run a risk of cannibalization, but the way we try to deal with this is that we try to target more aggressively with outbound marketing for example, customers where we believe there is a trade-up, so we can improve revenues while giving customers a lot of value.</p>
          <p>And obviously, we monitor, we measure week-by-week how we are advancing, and if we see that a specific trend is not generating the elasticity we expect, or the cannibalization is higher than expected, we do what we have to do. We change the promotion or we change the product.</p>
          <p>So far it's too soon to tell about these new products, because some of them have been launched in February, some of them in April. Some of them are doing very well and above our expectations, and some others, like the weekend plan tariffs, has only two weeks of life, so it's too early to tell.</p>
          <p>As you have seen, some of them have TV campaigns and some not. The ones that that &#x2013; those that don't have TV campaigns are the ones that are much more outbound marketing driven. So something that we tend to manage in all our operations and we monitor week-by-week, so we are not expecting a disruptive effect on cannibalization because we monitor that and if we have a problem, we will try to compensate or change the product.</p>
          <p>Regarding data revenues, one comment, I'm not sure, taking that. You've seen that we are improved in data revenues, we are 7% up this quarter compared to the first quarter, while the fourth quarter last year we were up 14%.That is playing exclusively due to this premium SMS grand contest that we have. This quarter we have only 15 days of one of these super computers and while the last &#x2013; the first quarter last year was last almost 12 months, so if you take away this premium SMS grand contest the rate will be 11% and 11%, so basically the same rate.</p>
          <p>If you take away person-to-person SMS, the data revenues are above 20% and connectivity revenues are up 50%. So we see that data revenues are growing very healthy and obviously, this super computers or premium SMS grand contest depending on the seasonality of when specifically they are done, they affect the quarter measures, but if you that take that effect away, we are the same growth in data and we are improving in ARPU.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks for the question. And two questions. The first on Latin America similar to the earlier question on Spain: if you could just talk about the trend through the quarter, the trend in March relative to the earlier month, and how that's continued into April, that would be helpful. Obviously, there is concern about growth continuing to slow. And secondly, just to clarify the comments earlier about cash held in Venezuela, will it be possible to understand at what rate that's hedged and whether, when the hedge runs out, and whether it's possible to re-hedge it at that point? And my understanding is the hedging market is becoming lot less liquid. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, taking your question on trends in Latin America, those are not homogeneous; those depend country-on-country. But globally speaking, let me tell you that we do think that the situation is improving in Brazil, which is the main economy in the region. It has showed some signs of at the end of the year and in January because of the summer campaign there, and another microeconomic impact that it's getting better. All the microeconomic indicators in the country are showing our strength. I just want to say those are sustainable but Brazil, being the main economy in the region, is doing better.</p>
          <p>Our operation there, both on wireless, mainly in Telesp, I covered the fact that we have some influence of the new call center law, that we are popularizing, and therefore, we tend to think that the situation in Brazil should get improved month after month. But I just want to say, let me address the fact that in May we have the models campaign in the most of the countries and that is going to be a first real sign of evolution; it's too soon to say that according to preliminary indications proves to be okay.</p>
          <p>But just want to say, globally speaking, let me express the fact that in these economic environments and with different patterns of behavior in different countries, thanks to the diversification of our portfolio, we have been able to grow roughly 9% in revenues and roughly 14% in OIBDA. So if that's an indication of how we are experiencing the current economic situation in Latin America, I think that says it best.</p>
          <p>It is true that in terms of customers, especially on the mobile side, we have been a little bit weaker, but it's also true that we have been reducing <mark type="inaudible" /> because of the movement in the currencies and because we are also focus on preserving profitability. So part of this deterioration of the customers may have been caused by our less active way of subsidizing handsets. And also, mainly in Mexico, for example, we have been doing less profit campaign.</p>
          <p>So I would say that, we are running normal business in those countries and models campaign is going to give us the sign of the year.</p>

          <p>Santiago, again. There is no hedging instrument or market for the Venezuelan bolivar, either onshore nor offshore. So for all practical purposes, you can assume that we go naked on the Venezuela bolivar exposure. There is no other way to run this game.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. I'm just following up on the question on domestic business. What sort of factors do you think could influence coming quarters, either up or down? And in particular, I can think of a couple of negatives on mobile with the Easter effect in the second quarter with these new tariffs. And then, obviously, in the summer, the roaming may actually bring revenues down. Is that reasonable, or are there any other countering effects that might mean that the service revenue decline in the first quarter was the lowest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the coming quarters, obviously, we have Easter in April; When I said that April was better than March, it was taking away obviously the Easter effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And looking on the underlying trend factors, in the mobile business, usage will be key meaning, what type of traffic, SMS, data usage our existing customer will have been during the quarter. That, in my opinion is key. Obviously, second in mobile, in a second degree, will be access growth, and we saw a low access growth in the first quarter. As Santiago explained in the presentation, we tried to play too much on rational commercial efforts on getting new results. Our success was on the churn. Churn is stable, but we're not very successful in controlling in the gross adds. So we hope to improve in gross adds. But the key factor in mobile, to be honest, is the usage. If we get some elasticity on our customers, if we convince them through these tariffs and so on, that they can spend more money on mobile, that will be key on the revenue side.</p>
          <p>In the fixed business, different story. It's much more scattered through different lines. First quarter you saw three revenue lines going down, which were basically accesses, fixed access, voice and broadband are still going up, data and IT. While the costs are too going up, basically means that we are focusing on high-value customers, so in large corporate and in the large companies we are continuing to focus in structural profitable value. And again, voice traffic is something that is not as relevant as in mobile, but also we suffer negative evolution in the first quarter, so usage again will be key. And also, demand for new broadband lines will be also another indication of improvement or not.</p>
          <p>But if I have to sum up, there are many factors, but usage in general is the main factor that we are going to try to foster, and that will help to explain much of the revenue side. For the margin and on the operating cash flow, we've done very well in the quarter. Obviously, it's an easier task if the top line grows better.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we will continue pushing for savings and efficiencies, and obviously, we would like to be prepared for different scenarios. So again, answer to your question, usage in the first time, and then keep on working on efficiency. And also as you notice, we are keeping a very close eye on revenue market share as a health indicator that we're not losing touch with the market.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. A couple of questions on Latin America. Firstly, again Venezuela. Just looking at a 33% revenue growth, it's obviously a great result in a market over 100% penetrated. I just wonder to what extent you're taking revenue share in that market? And then if you can talk just around the sustainability of that trend as you see it? And then secondly, on Mexico, I wonder if you can help me understand the 16% growth in service revenues in the quarter. I can't quite reconcile that with, it was 20% growth in the average mobile customer base with a 10% ARPU decline. Because I think that gets you to around 8% service revenue growth. So I guess I'm missing something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Venezuela, working this with, you are right, we are focusing on growing new market share rather than customer addition. We have reduced to almost zero the handset subsidy, and that's what we have to grow the revenue there because the money highly <mark type="inaudible" />, both in terms of service revenue and in terms of asset revenues.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we already state the revenue that we are following, <mark type="inaudible" /> concerned to the contract, and is highly focused on churn. We have been reducing churn again this quarter. The changes would affect that we are affording the rated company we're seeing in Venezuela because we're providing also fixed wireless and wireless broadband. We're multiplying the wireless broadband in Venezuela and therefore wireless broadband is also helping us to build revenues. So we're going to take mix of our issues in Venezuela. And all of them are helping us to boost revenues and to increase profitability.</p>
          <p>Also we launch now <mark type="inaudible" />. It's difficult to say how we're going to be doing World TV, satellite TV, offering only two parts of bundles. But remember that in Venezuela you have all sorts of things. You have wireless telephony, fixed wireless and also very complete wireless software, wireless broadband and bundling taking upward the value chain of our customers, so there is full amounts of, I would say initiatives going on. ARPU has been going up 22%. So in Venezuela, it's a major issue. And remember also that we are not subsidizing handsets; our handsets are <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Taking your question of ARPU on service growth in Mexico; let me remind you of two things. First in the basis for calculation of ARPU, it isn't because we think the total customer base at the end of the previous and the average customers base that helps to reconcile a little bit numbers, but mostly the fact that some revenues, some service revenues have not included in ARPU calculation, namely roaming in or wholesale revenues, or the fixed wireless activity that you have in Mexico. So these factors explain the difference &#x2013; or reconcile the difference &#x2013; between the service revenue growth and the ARPU growth.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening. A follow-up question is on Telesp. The margin's weakness was explained as a spike in the call center expenses. Can you give us some guidance on how the margins will develop over the year? Are they going to go more down or as the business gets more scale and we have seen the bottom of it? And second on Spain, you're running on a CapEx over sales ratio of around 4% in mobile and 8% in fixed line. Shall we assume that this is a floor, so no more room to go below that, so if you need more CapEx flexibility that has to come outside Spain? Thank you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. Taking the Telesp one, as you know we don't give any guidance for margins. But let me comment on some issues that will try to help you on understanding the evolution. First, in this first quarter, we have been increasing the call center expenses in order to match the requirements of the new call center law, which the initial impact has been higher than the one that we were estimating. And therefore, have processed to increase the number attendants in order not to destroy the quality levels.</p>
          <p>And that has also drive us to reduce the commercial effort, because we have been putting retention and quality efforts before trying to do additional commercial efforts on the call centers. So that will help us &#x2013; that will help you to understand part of the expense.</p>
          <p>And top of that, the trends in margin last year were driving to stabilization. We think that with the effort that we are doing, both on the transformation effort that we are doing in order to simplify the offers that we have in Telesp, and the new contract that we are having with the subcontractor activity, should help us throughout this present situation. So, I don't think, that you should calculate the initial impact of the call center lowering the margins. We are working very hard with the regulatory situation.</p>
          <p>But let me add in the meantime. For example, in terms of net adds of ADSL, the quarter has been pretty stable compared with the previous one. In fact, we have been adding roughly a little bit more than 100,000 ADSL lines. This is slightly above last year's figure of the first quarter, and is above the figure that we have in the Christmas campaign. So, we tend to think that even if it's true that we have been having an impact on margin in the first quarter, we should be able to address or stabilize the situation.</p>

          <p>This is Guillermo, Luigi. Regarding your question of CapEx, well, the combined CapEx over revenues for the quarter is 6.9. Obviously, although it's first quarter, so a little bit lighter than next quarter in general. But if you look at the split between mobile and fixed, two comments: first, a lot of the common infrastructure, like transport and so on, even though we are two related business units, are done on the fixed; or fixed tend to be a little bit more loaded with transport and connection, also to the base stations and so on.</p>
          <p>And second, the mobile number, in this case is low, it's going to increase a little bit over the year, not a lot and the fixed number maybe, is stable or reducing a little bit. So you will see the evolution in the year, you will see a lot of reaction compared to last year similar quarter last year, but the photograph for the &#x2013; photo for the first quarter is a little bit skewed to the lower part in mobile and will increase a little bit during the year. You have got the floor in fixed, well we think that we can continue reducing CapEx and we will see maybe in some reductions are easy to get than others, but I think in fixed we can do more.</p>
