      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone and welcome to our first half presentation. I am joined here by our chairman and our executive team which is now complete. As you know George Culmer joined us as Group Finance Director in May and you will hear from him later. And Cathy Turner joined in June as our new Chief Administrative Officer, in charge of HR, legal, brands and audits; and Andrew Bester joined as the new CEO of Wholesale just this month.</p>
          <p>In the first part of my presentation I will describe our strategic progress in the half year. Our continued risk reduction reflect in our ratings update and the resilient operational performance we have delivered in a challenging environment. George will then give you more detail on our financial performance. And Mark Fisher, our Group Operations Director will update you on the progress we are making on the simplification and cost programs. Finally, we'll summarize our first half and talk you through our expectations for the remainder of the year and outlook for the medium term.</p>
          <p>So turning first to the first half highlights. We made further substantial progress in strengthening our balance sheet and reducing risk. We have further reduced &#xA3;23 billion of non-core assets ahead of expectations. Our core tier one capital ratio has now increased to 11.3%. We have completed our term wholesale funding program for the year by the end of April, and as you will hear from George, our liquidity position improved further. And we have continued to deliver above market cost on the deposit growth, further reducing our wholesale funding needs by around &#xA3;40 billion and allowing us to further improve our group loan to deposit ratio.</p>
          <p>There is no doubt that this is a challenging environment for the banking sector with subdued loan demands, high funding costs, very low interest rates and a stringent regulatory environment. Nevertheless, the actions we have taken to reduce balance sheet risks, non-core assets, costs and impairments, when combined with the delivery of improved management profitability at the group level and stable core returns should give you a clear idea of the potential of Lloyds core bank going forward.</p>
          <p>I am of course disappointed to report a statutory loss for the period, driven entirely by our decision to increase the PPI provision by a further &#xA3;700 million to address this disappointing legacy issue. More on that later. We have continued to implement our strategic initiatives, building for the future. We did an additional &#xA3;600 million investment behind the growth initiatives in the first 12 month of the program. And elsewhere we have seen encouraging developments. Last week we signed high level terms of agreement with a co-operative group for the disposal of Verde, as you know. And we remain on track to complete this disposal, as required, by the end of November 2013.</p>
          <p>In June the substantial progress we are making in delivering our strategy was also reflective in the outcome of the Moody's rating review, which reaffirmed Lloyd's short-term P-1 rating, while the longer term rating was lowered by only one notch to A2, a good outcome relative to others in the sector and as good as we had hoped for. And we have now completed two-thirds of our international divestments, having announced the exit of ten international locations.</p>
          <p>Also, the changes we are seeing in external environments endorse that the strategy focus on traditional retail and commercial banking in the UK is the right one for Lloyds. Our business model is fully aligned with the white paper's proposed banking reforms, and the recent regulatory authority focus on supporting the UK's economic recovery is most welcome.</p>
          <p>So it is clear that the strategy we set out a year ago remains entirely appropriate, even more, given the deterioration in the external environments. And the progress we have made against it means, in my opinion, that the group's prospects are getting stronger in spite of this deterioration.</p>
          <p>I will now look in more detail at the key achievements in the first half against this strategy. A cornerstone of the strengthened balance sheet has been the substantial growth of customer deposits we have achieved over the past 18 months. In the first half, we delivered a further increase of 3% and 6% year-on-year, broadly consistent with the growth rate we achieved in 2011. This solid performance reflected in particular our compelling multibrands and multichannel customer proposition.</p>
          <p>As a result of this strong deposit growth and the substantial non-core asset reduction, the group loan-to-deposit ratio reduced further to 126%, 28 percentage points down since January last year, with the core loan-to-deposit ratio down to 103%. As you can see, we are well on track to achieve our targets of a long-term loan-to-deposit ratio of 120% by early 2013, approximately two years ahead of target, which will lead to a 100% core loan-to-deposit ratio.</p>
          <p>We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing the non-core portfolio, and we made strong progress again in the period in spite of challenging market conditions. We achieved a substantial reduction in non-core assets of &#xA3;23 billion with &#xA3;11 billion in Q2 ahead of expectations, and again in a capital accretive way as we had committed. This included reductions of &#xA3;11 billion in treasury assets, &#xA3;3 billion in UK commercial real estate, and &#xA3;5 billion in international assets of which &#xA3;2 billion was in Ireland. George will give you additional disclosure on our core assets &#x2013; non-core asset later on.</p>
          <p>We remain confident that we will reduce non-core assets by at least &#xA3;30 billion this year and to &#xA3;90 billion by 2013, one year ahead of target. We now expect our non-core assets to reduce further to &#xA3;70 billion or less by the end of 2014, 50% of which will be retail assets, so non-retail assets being around 5% of total funded assets. As a consequence of this, from 2015 onwards we will cease to report on the non-core business separately. Moving on to capital.</p>
          <p>Our Core Tier 1 capital ratio increased to 11.3% at the end of June, up from just over 10% a year ago. This was mostly driven by our management profits and a reduction in risk-weighted assets with one-off legacy items offsetting progress, which would have otherwise been even more significant.</p>
          <p>Our Basel 3 fully loaded core tier 1 capital ratio stands at 7.7%, up from 7.1% at the year end, and I expect it to continue to trend towards our core tier 1 ratio throughout the transition period, well ahead of regulatory requirements.</p>
          <p>The total capital ratio increased to 16.6% from 15% a year ago, positioning us very well relative to the ICB's recommendations for loss-absorbent capital in excess of 17%.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the income statement. Our income performance continues to be affected by the subdued economic environment, very low interest rates, and higher funding costs. However, the actions we have taken to accelerate our cost management program and reduce impairments meant that we improved group profitability and returns and continued to deliver stable returns above our cost of capital in our core business. Even though we delivered a resilient underlying performance in this first half, we are disappointed that we had to make further provisions in both the first and second quarter for PPI contact and redress which impacted our statutory results as a consequence of the current claim experience which did not decline as quickly as anticipated in quarter one.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding pressures on the top line, we have continued to invest a proportion of the simplification cost savings, around &#xA3;600 million so far, to grow our core customer businesses through the launch of new product and services. We are continuing to do what we said we would do, and a bit more. We have made good progress, but it is clear that some of our businesses need some additional attention to operate more effectively in their particular environments. However, it is also clear that our initiatives are delivering the sort of returns we want in the next three to five years in the restructuring journey that we started last year.</p>
          <p>Some highlights are: In retail, we are investing in new channels for customers, ensuring that our products and services remain convenient and accessible, and thereby increasing usage and engagement. We are pleased with the very strong increase we have seen in our Internet banking user base by 650,000, which takes us to over 9 million users.</p>
          <p>We now have 2.5 million mobile banking users, accounting for almost 25% of all customer log-ins onto our banking systems. In commercial, we are on track to exceed the SME charter commitment of &#xA3;12 billion of gross lending in 2012. While we have now increased our target by a further &#xA3;1 billion and we are proud to have supported 64,000 start-up businesses so far this year. And net lending to SMEs is also positive and accelerating despite a falling market. Let me move on now to the performance of each of our divisions.</p>
          <p>In retail, we have delivered further reductions in costs and in impairments, more than offsetting the fall in income. As a consequence, underlying profit increased by 12% with return on risk-rated assets improving to over 3%, well above our cost of capital.</p>
          <p>Customer deposits increased by 3% since the year-end, significantly above the market as a whole. This successful deposit growth is a result of retail's ongoing commitment to its multi-brands, multi-channel strategy, the investment in our relationship brands Lloyds Bank of Scotland and Halifax and a strong focus on holistic and continuous fine tuning in the pricing of both our loans and our deposits together.</p>
          <p>In mortgages, we have continued to supply one out of four loans to first time buyers, having supported 25,000 people in H1 to get their first home. And we have achieved an overall gross lending market share of 18% in the period.</p>
          <p>In wholesale, underlying profit before tax in the first half declined modestly year on year, although we delivered a slight increase in returns. While continued customer deleveraging and higher wholesale funding costs drove a decrease in underlying income, the continued improvement in asset quality drove a substantial decrease in impairments. These returns are still not acceptable, and we have reviewed the strategy and asset allocation to improve this going forward in the context of the ICB recommendations.</p>
          <p>Total cost rose modestly as cost savings and continuing cost management focus were offset by ongoing investments in core customer facing resource and systems, in line with the priorities we set out in the group's strategic review a year ago. I am looking forward to Andrew Bester leading the next phase of the reshaping of this business, as we also advance in our plans to become a "ring fence" bank ahead of the regulatory deadline, and we will let you know more on these plans at the Q3 IMS.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Commercial. Commercial delivered a strong result with underlying profit before tax, increasing by 24%. It has continued to focus on strengthening its customer relationships and on supporting SMEs through the difficult trading conditions by further developing its understanding and support of individual businesses &#x2013; business requirements. This is demonstrated by, amongst other things, the growth in our net lending to SMEs, with car loans and advances increasing by 4% against a contracting market as I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Customer deposits grew by 3%, ahead of the market, and reflected our ongoing success in attracting new SME customers, particularly through current accounts. In Insurance, we continue to generate strong returns with IRRs or new life pensions and investment business of over 16% and a combined operating ratio on our General Insurance business of 80%. Sales through the bank insurance channel have nevertheless been impacted by subdued demand for investment products and by the preparations for the RDR.</p>
          <p>In terms of results, core underlying income is down 19% with changes to economic assumptions and the diverse weather accounting for most of this reduction. The remainder has been partly offset by further action on expenses, which decreased by 8%.</p>
          <p>These are decent performances in challenging markets, particularly given the impacts referred to above, although we will have to do better and get it right in the context of RDR. As I said before, the retail distribution review will materially change the landscape of bank insurance and wealth from January 2013, and we will update you with the Q3 IMS on our latest plans.</p>
          <p>Wealth, asset finance and international profits were stable with a continued reduction in impairments and expenses, offsetting a decrease in income of 3%. The focused deposit-gathering strategy delivered 29% growth, primarily due to the continued strong inflows in both the Wealth and International Deposit businesses, which have strongly supported our overall deposit growth.</p>
          <p>Our European Online business is expanding quickly, bringing a stable, diversified retail euro deposit base to the group. And the international wealth deposits are also progressing strongly, following a more targeted approach in the business and a perceived safety of the Lloyds brands in the current European turmoil. Our Asset Finance unit continued to deliver strong profits and returns and is continuing to gain market share in the segments where we already have significant leadership positions.</p>
          <p>As I have said before, only by focusing on customers' needs and addressing those needs in a cost-effective way can we expect to deliver strong and sustainable benefits to our shareholders. Throughout the group, we are focused on implementing a number of service initiatives to drive improved customer experience. These are already showing significant progress, as Mark will detail later on.</p>
          <p>Internally, we measure customer satisfaction through the net promoter scores, which indicate the likelihood of customers recommending us to others, and is based on a comprehensive set of over 45,000 customer interviews every month. On this basis, all of our major brands made significant headway in the first six months of the year. There was good improved in the Halifax and the Bank of Scotland, reflecting the investment in their relaunch as standalone brands, and also on Lloyds that has the highest scores and ranks highly among high Street brands.</p>
          <p>At the channel level, we also saw improvements across branch, telephony and the Internet. And as a result, our overall group-wide score has seen significant progress with an 11% increase in the first half. We will continue to build on this strong start to improving our customer advocacy across all brands and all channels.</p>
          <p>As part of our best bank for customers strategy, we have also committed to reducing banking complaints per 1,000 accounts to 1.3 by the end of 2012, a 40% reduction from 2010. We are making good progress towards our target, having already achieved 1.4 at the half year. This reduction was driven by initiatives to remove the causes of complaints, for example, by ensuring that our telephone banking teams now have the ability to see details of ear-marked transactions on a customer's account which enables our customers to get the right item faster as we ensure that complaints are resolved at first touch whenever possible.</p>
          <p>These improvements we are making to the customer experience have also been evidenced by the continued significant decline in our FOS overturn rates where we now have the best outcome of the five major banks. Only one out of four customer complaints going to the ombudsman is decided in the customer's favor from one out of two 18 months ago, which clearly proves the appropriateness of our customer redress policies.</p>
          <p>Retail deposits increased by 3% in H1 and by 5% year-on-year, once again outperforming market growth. This solid performance across all our brands reflected a compelling customer preposition retail has developed, and has again been achieved in a cost-effective manner as you can see from the headline, ISA rates in the first half of this year. This strong evidence of customer preference and trust in Lloyds is a sign of appropriate segmentation and illustrates the value of the core bank we are building to the benefit of our customers and shareholders, a stronger, simpler and more efficient retail and commercial bank which will create strong and sustainable returns over time.</p>
          <p>This concludes the first part of my presentation. I would now like to pass over to George for more detail on the financial performance in the first half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ant&#xF3;nio, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to be here to present the results for the first time. This morning I'll update you on our performance in the first half and then cover our balance sheet, funding, liquidity and capital positions. As you heard from Antonio, in the first half we delivered a resilient underlying performance, with improvements in costs and impairments offsetting the expected decrease in income. With NII impacted by the smaller balance sheet and higher funding costs and OOI by subdued demand and adverse economic assumptions, and weather in insurance.</p>
          <p>Underlying profit for the half year is &#xA3;1.1 billion for the group and &#xA3;3 billion for the core business. Management profit for the group was &#xA3;1.2 billion. However, this was after a number of offsetting items. Volatility of our own debt was a charge of &#xA3;357 million. Was the mark-to-market movement and our AMTNs and ECNs, and reflects improvements in credit spreads towards the end of the half. Assets and bond sales of &#xA3;585 million comprised a loss on asset disposals associated fair value unwind and gains on bond sales. Other volatile items of a charge of &#xA3;452 million is mostly timing and accounting and economic mismatches as we hedge out the group's interest rate and FX exposures.</p>
          <p>Liability management of &#xA3;168 million is again on our own debt purchases, while the fair value unwind of &#xA3;157 million is significantly down on prior year, which included a much higher level of impairments. That brings us to the management profit of &#xA3;1.2 billion for the group and &#xA3;2.7 billion for the core.</p>
          <p>Looking now more closely at underlying profit and starting with income, underlying income of &#xA3;9.2 billion is &#xA3;1.9 billion down on prior year. &#xA3;648 million of this movement comes from subdued lending demand and customer deleveraging in the core business and accelerated non-core asset reduction. Increased wholesale funding cost contributes a further &#xA3;254 million, while insurance saw an adverse impact of &#xA3;266 million, primarily from the changes to economic assumptions and adverse weather. Non-recurring items of &#xA3;257 million, mostly comprised recoveries in the prior year.</p>
          <p>Looking next to the net interest margin, in the first half of 2012, we delivered a robust margin performance. The core net interest margin was stable at 2.32%, with asset repricing offsetting deposit spread pressures. The non-core margin has fallen 35 basis points since year-end, largely due to wholesale funding costs, although the impact on the group is mitigated by the decrease in proportion of non-core. For the total group, the margin stands at 1.93% for the year-to-date and 1.91% in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect the net interest margin to be in line with existing guidance of around 1.93%</p>
          <p>Moving on to asset quality, our asset quality ratios continue to show favorable trends with a group AQR of 1.1%, reflecting the improved quality of the core book and improvement in experience in non-core, and again, the decrease in size of that book. And going forward, we remain confident that we can achieve the group AQR target of 50 to 60 basis points in 2014.</p>
          <p>In terms of impairments, the first half charge of &#xA3;3.2 billion was 42% lower than the first half of 2011, but continues to benefit from our prudent risk appetite and strong management controls, while the external benefits of low interest rates and stable UK retail property prices are partly offset by subdued UK growth, rising unemployment and a weak commercial real estate market.</p>
          <p>Within the divisions, retail's total impairment charge decreased by 35% to &#xA3;0.8 billion with continued reductions in both secured and unsecured portfolios. In wholesale, the 31% reduction to &#xA3;1 billion, largely reflects a &#xA3;0.3 billion improvement in the core book where we've seen reduced levels of large defaults and a benefit from the improvement in overall quality through a collective impairment release. In wealth, international and asset finance, the impairment charge fell by 51% to &#xA3;1.3 billion, with lower charges in the wholesale Irish and Australasian businesses.</p>
          <p>In Ireland we have seen a significant reduction in the rate of increase in newly impaired loans, while in Australia the net wholesale book now stands at &#xA3;6.8 billion, following recent successful disposals. This improvement in portfolio quality is consistent with what we are seeing in new to arrears and newly impaired data.</p>
          <p>In retail, new to arrears and securities down 14% on last year, and in unsecured by 31%. In wholesale and commercial we are also seeing a reduction in newly impaired assets. These trends support our confidence in the sustainability of the improvement in impairments. But for the full year, we now expect to come inside our previous guidance of the impairment charge around &#xA3;7.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at the statutory result, here we show the movement from the management profit to the statutory loss after tax of &#xA3;641 million. Simplification and Verde costs total &#xA3;530 million; simplification comprised &#xA3;274 million of this, while Verde costs were &#xA3;239 million.</p>
          <p>On PPI, as you heard from Ant&#xF3;nio, claims continue to run ahead of previous estimates. The additional &#xA3;700 million we have provided in Q2 reflects our assessment of the expected total, based on current complaint levels, projected future trends and our own separate analysis. The provision does, however, remain sensitive to future claim levels.</p>
          <p>As described at Q1, the past service pension credit of &#xA3;250 million relates the move to CPI for discretionary pension increases within the Group's main defined benefit schemes. And finally, the tax charge for the half year of &#xA3;202 million includes &#xA3;120 million from the lower carrying value of future losses following the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate and a further &#xA3;258 million of insurance policyholder tax that has no net impact on the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, as you already know, we continue to take action to strengthen the balance sheet, and have made significant progress over the last 18 months. The first half of 2012, we have kept up the pace. In the last six months, we have grown deposits by &#xA3;13 billion and reduced non-core assets by &#xA3;23 billion. We've also seen a reduction in core lending of &#xA3;8 billion, although it is pleasing to see this stabilize in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>These movements have helped us drive a &#xA3;37 billion reduction in wholesale funding and build our liquidity buffer by &#xA3;10 billion, mainly in the first quarter. These actions have improved the Group's loan-to-deposit ratio from 135% to 126%, while our primary liquidity portfolio now stands at &#xA3;105 billion, providing a substantial buffer and giving us optionality.</p>
          <p>Looking more detail at non-core. The noncore portfolio now stands at &#xA3;118 billion, with a decrease in the first half, including &#xA3;11 billion of treasury assets, UK commercial real estate, and &#xA3;5 billion in international assets. Non-core RWAs stand at &#xA3;93 billion and are down 14% since year-end and broadly in line with the reduction in non-core assets. And as Ant&#xF3;nio has said, we now expect the non-core portfolio to be below &#xA3;70 billion in 2014, and with more than 50% of that being retail assets, we will cease separate reporting of non-core after 2014.</p>
          <p>On wholesale funding, we continue to reduce our requirements and improve the profile. At the half year already &#xA3;73 billion, or 34% of wholesale funding at a maturity of less than one year, compared with 45% at December 2011 and 50% a year before that. And less of one year money market funding now accounts for only 21% of total wholesale funding, again down from 27% at the end of 2011, and 34% in 2010.</p>
          <p>On liquidity, the group has built up a strong position and considerably in excess of our ILG requirement. As mentioned, our primary liquidity at the half year was &#xA3;105 billion. And this represents approximately 240% of our money market funding and around 140% of all wholesale funding, with maturity of less than one year.</p>
          <p>We also have significant secondary liquidity holdings of &#xA3;110 billion, which provide access to the open market operations at a number of central banks.</p>
          <p>Liquidity requirements is an area of evolving regulatory guidance. However, this level gives the group significant flexibility, one of the first examples of which was the successful recent tender for &#xA3;4.6 billion of senior, unsecured funding.</p>
          <p>Finally, coming to capital, in the first half, our Core Tier 1 capital ratio increased by 50 basis points to 11.3%, while fully loaded Basel 3 ratio increased from 7.1% to 7.7%. Both measures benefited from management profits and RWA reductions, offset by statutory profit items and other adjustments, including of course, PPI.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we will continue with our strategy to maximize capital generation. While the successful resolution of open items such as the treatment of insurance, recognition of defaults, CVAs and SMEs could represent significant upside potential to our pro forma numbers.</p>
          <p>I'm comfortable with our current capital position and outlook. I'm confident of meeting our guidance to be both prudently excess of transitional requirements and of course, to comply fully with Basel 3.</p>
          <p>That completes my review of the financials, and I would now like to hand over to Mark.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, George. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to spend a few minutes updating you on progress on costs and the simplification program that I talked about when we were here last in February.</p>
          <p>Starting with total costs, we've seen a reduction of 6% compared to the first half of 2011. The key driver in the lower cost has been the simplification program where run rate savings have now reached &#xA3;512 million, up from &#xA3;242 million at the end of 2011. Simplification investment cost, &#xA3;274 million in the first half. The savings from the program that we're reporting today are ahead of our original plan and are completely consistent with the increased target of &#xA3;1.7 billion of savings in 2014 and an exit run rate of &#xA3;1.9 billion.</p>
          <p>To put some context on these results, it's worth looking at the longer-term trend. Costs have reduced significantly since the acquisition of HBOS, but the key point here is that last five half years of costs have progressively reduced half year and half year, firstly through the integration program and now through simplification. This is after re-investment in our strategic programs and is a pattern we very much like and we're working hard to continue.</p>
          <p>I'm sure you'll note that typically the second half year reductions are not as strong as the first. This is largely due to the UK bank levy, which accrues in the second half. For example, the levy costs last year were &#xA3;189 million.</p>
          <p>Moving to the half and half comparison, here's some more detail on how the 6% reduction came about. There were final synergies of &#xA3;168 million from the integration program, and then very material benefits from simplification amount to &#xA3;298 million in the first six months. These savings are partly offset by the &#xA3;135 million investment we've made in our strategic initiatives, such as the ongoing development of our digital capabilities. Then there is an inflationary wage increase of &#xA3;46 million representing about 2.5% increase for the majority of our staff.</p>
          <p>The range of other cost movements unusually sums to a net positive variance of &#xA3;22 million. Within this, there are a number of increases, inflation on non-labor costs, energy prices, higher regulatory costs, but these are more than offset by the impact of one-off items.</p>
          <p>Now for a closer look at how simplification is going. I'm very pleased that within a year of announcing the program, we have already achieved more than &#xA3;0.5 billion of sustainable run rate savings. In fact, we're ahead of where we expected to be at this stage. We've seen a strong flow of early deliverables, whilst the more heavy lifting projects have been mobilized and moved into build. In 2012 to-date we've announced over 4,000 job reductions, bringing the total since the start of the program to over 6,000; and I am pleased that we continue to achieve over half of our job reductions through natural attrition, management of vacancies and redeployment.</p>
          <p>We remain focused on reducing the supplier base. Over the past 12 months, we've moved from over 18,000 suppliers to less than 14,000. You may remember, I said a year ago, the target was a supply base of less than 10,000, but that I thought that was still a large number. With the progress we're making now, I'm confident we're going to achieve the target earlier than expected and beat it by the end of 2014.</p>
          <p>We continue to make very good progress in flattening the organization, reducing management layers and increasing spans of control. Crucially, was also started to simplify the organization in other ways. We're consolidating our back office operations into 15 scale-efficient centers, down from our existing 27 centers. Having worked through all the details of our property plans, we now forecast reducing our non-branch office locations by nearly a half, from 112 to 68.</p>
          <p>As you've heard from Ant&#xF3;nio, we're also making a difference for our customers. Our account transfer or switches process is the first significant reengineering of a core process, and is going extremely well, averaging over two thousand transfers a day since we launched the new process in April. We're seeing errors reduce, colleagues are spending 75% less time on the process as a result of automation, and the removal of 23 manual process steps and customer feedback has been extremely positive. Customers like the fact that they typically receive a text message confirming that the transfer process is underway before they leave the branch.</p>
          <p>In February, I mentioned the improvements we were making to the cash ISA process for this year. Through the tax year-end, we successfully managed significant leash for increased volumes, followed by a &#x2013; by delivering a range of changes including auto-validation of data entry and enabling customers to reinvest their funds online. By the end of the next tax year, I expect the ISA process to be fully automated.</p>
          <p>In commercial, we're rolling out a more effective loans process, with greater automation and reduced hand-offs. Across the regions where this has gone live, we're already seeing a 45% reduction in the time that it takes for customers to draw their loans. Our relationship managers now have more time to spend with their customers. In fact, in Birmingham and South London regions, where we have rolled this out first, they are now ranked second and third in terms of volume of new term lending, where as previously they were thirteenth and fourteenth.</p>
          <p>In general insurance, we have completely redesigned the process for handling home insurance claims. Customers now have a dedicated advisor through the process. We've rolled this out in dealing with the largest type of claim, escape of water, and we're already seeing a 40% reduction in the follow-up calls between ourselves and customers, with settlement times reduced by 30%. Of course, we're rolling this out now across other claims types.</p>
          <p>We continue to see a rapid increase in the usage of our Internet channel as we improve our digital service. This includes a strong growth in the mobile banking user base.</p>
          <p>Our latest peak of customer log-ons was 4.2 million on the day of the 30th of April, and we're well on the way to seeing more than a billion log-ons to our banking systems during 2012. As Ant&#xF3;nio has mentioned, our improved service is reflected in lower levels of complaints across the board and a strong improving trend in all quality measures.</p>
          <p>Finally, this slide shows the trajectory of our cost savings target. The savings are split by the four core workstreams that I have described in previous presentations. By using a balance of initiatives, we are aiming to deliver a regional linear increase towards our target. So far we are one year into a 3.5 year program, approximately 28% of the way through and we've delivered 27% to the benefits. Overall, we're strongly on track with a good line of sight to our benefits delivery for 2013 and 2014, and the program is now well into its stride.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I'd now like to hand back to Ant&#xF3;nio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark. I would now like to sum up the highlights of the first half, our expectations for the rest of the year, and our outlook for the medium term.</p>
          <p>We have a clear strategy which is being consistently implemented. Overall, the first six months represent further good progress on implementing our strategy to strengthen the group's balance sheet and liquidity position, to reshape the business portfolio to fit our capabilities and risk appetite, focusing on UK retail and commercial banking, to simplify the group, improving agility and efficiency, and simultaneously, to invest for the future.</p>
          <p>We are, as you have seen, on track to meet our 2012 financial guidance despite the subdued economic and the adverse external environment. Simplification is already bringing annual run rate cost savings of over &#xA3;400 million, as you heard.</p>
          <p>We confirm our loan to deposit ratio target of 120%; should be reached in the first quarter of 2013, well ahead of target. We now expect 2012 impairment charge to be less than previous guidance and non-core assets are now targeted to be below &#xA3;70 billion by the end of 2014 when we will cease separate reporting. We also remain confident that our other medium term financial targets are achievable over time.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, the operating environment will remain challenging, as the outlook for the U.K. economy remains uncertain and exposed to continued vulnerability in the eurozone. It is clear that corporate and consumer deleveraging will continue to impact demand, and interest rates will remain lower for longer. As I have said many times now, this will be a long and difficult recovery.</p>
          <p>Also, the sector as a whole continues to face a number of challenges and uncertainties, some of them arising from past industry behaviors which have attracted much comment in recent weeks. This will make rebuilding trust even harder for the industry, and addressing these issues head-on a top priority for management. This is what we intend to do at Lloyds.</p>
          <p>As far as the banking reform white paper is concerned, we are already close to loss of solvency requirements, and given that our business model is aligned with the ring fencing goal, we plan to discuss with our regulators the advantages of becoming a ring-fenced bank ahead of regulatory requirements.</p>
          <p>And turning to recent policy and regulatory changes aimed at encouraging UK growth, again this supports our chosen operating model and we will therefore play our part in making it happen. In concluding, I believe we are building a very powerful yet simple core bank, totally aligned with our customers' interests and the external environment. We have unfortunately to do this at the same time as we deal with legacy issues, accelerate the shrinking of non-core assets that 15 months ago still represented one-third of our funded assets and execute the EU-mandated sales of Verde and other assets.</p>
          <p>In this three to five-year journey, now two to four, we are doing what we said and a bit more. We are delivering on our operating guidance for 2012 while delivering the balance sheet guidance faster than planned in spite of the deterioration of the external environment and in response to what we perceive to be an increase in the external risks. Simultaneously, we are relentlessly pursuing the creation of a leading cost efficiency competitive advantage and a portfolio characterized by a lower risk premium through the cycle, which will differentiate Lloyds from its competitors.</p>
          <p>These measures will, I believe, create a sustainable return on equity above our cost of equity and therefore deliver strong and sustainable returns for you, our shareholders. Thank you. We would now be happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. It's Chris Manners from Morgan Stanley here. Just two questions, if I may. The first one was, you had sort of six-plus quarters of sequential falling in the interest margin on group basis, and you're guiding that the second half is going to be sort of 103 basis points, and so the margin should actually start to tick up from here. Will you first of all sort of run us through what the biggest moving parts are? Is it repricing, funding mix, Funding for Lending scheme, etcetera?</p>
          <p>And the second one was just on the core lend book. Obviously, it shrank by &#xA3;8 billion in the first half, stabilization in the second quarter. How do you see the outlook here? I mean, the way that I look at it is that if you got 7.7% Basel 3 Quarter 1 ratio, the Financial Policy Committee has indicated the UK banks need to raise capital levels. That capital will still be a constraint on your thinking about growing that call-in book. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay, Chris, and good morning. Look, starting by the NIM, as I said, its year-end results. We expected NIM to go down this year by the same amount as last year, and I said it should be concentrated on the first half and then flattening out. So we have exactly the same guidance, both in terms of intensity and shape, as we have, and as you are seeing.</p>
          <p>How do I see things going further? Well, as I had said then, as our core loan-to-deposit ratio reaches 100%, our funding &#x2013; our wholesale funding costs will progressively decrease. And given that we are offsetting the repricing of liabilities with a repricing of the loans, I believe we will see the NIM progressively ticking up. And in my &#x2013; my expectation is that this should happen by the end of Q1, so around March. So you will see a flat NIM approximately through H2, as we had said the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>And given that we are now with the ratings outcome of Moody's and also with different schemes to support growth, and we now have excess liquidity, that as we told you, we were hoarding because of the Moody's review as an insurance, that was costing us money, but we were expecting not to use like an insurance. We will now deploy that excess liquidity, the first of which employments was, as George told you, the buyback of senior unsecured bonds by &#xA3;4.6 billion. And therefore, all these factors together lead me to expect that our NIM will turn up &#x2013; tick up by around March next year. Given I'm not an economist, maybe I get it right.</p>
          <p>On our current loan book, and following what I just told you, I expect &#x2013; first, I expect the UK economy, as I have told you many times to continue deleveraging, because we have as a country more credits versus GDP than we should. But while I expect our mortgage book to continue ticking down a bit because we want, as I told you before, to rebalance our market share from 26.5% in mortgages and 23.5% in savings to 25%, which is our natural market share post-Verde, and which will bring, as I told you, the core loan-to-deposit ratio to 100%. So I don't expect a significant different behavior in the mortgage book over the second half, although I think we will reach what we want by H1 next year.</p>
          <p>I do expect SME gross lending &#x2013; net lending to continue to increase. We are now at 4%, up from 3% last year. And given the Funding for Lending scheme and the good dynamics that we have inside the bank, I think we will continue increasing net lending positively in spite of a falling market of 4%. And by the way, we are 20% of that market. So it means the market's falling 6%, while we are increasing 4%, so it's a 10 percentage point difference which is very significant.</p>
          <p>We now want to do two things. First, we want to increase our Mid Corp's net lending, building on the best practices we got in SMEs. And I think we will achieve that through the second half of the year. So by year-end you should see our Mid Corp segment to also turn net positive in terms of lending. And given the Funding for Lending scheme, which we welcomed immediately as it came out and we thought it was the proper thing to do when I told you about the holistic solution of financial stability where we were better in capital supervision and ring-fencing, increasing the credibility of recovery and resolution. And therefore, liquidity was not in my opinion &#x2013; should not in my opinion be super-equivalent as well.</p>
          <p>We are going to use the Funding for Lending scheme especially to offset the disadvantage that we have in larger corporations where our funding cost, as I told you many times, did not allow us to be competitive, not for credit standards but because of funding costs. And therefore, we expect those efforts to reverse quickly, because you know in larger corporations these things are quicker. And therefore, I think that all these impacts combined, so continued positive SME lending, Mid Corps turning positive by December, larger corporations stop shrinking given the elimination of the cost disadvantage and mortgages still decreasing until H1 next year, I think again with a risk &#x2013; with a risk of not being an economist, I think our core book will start increasing by June next year.</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:47) from Nomura. Just on the SLS, if I can follow-up to your comments from the previous question, the Bank of England clearly expects that the UK banks will grow lending to the economy. From what I'm hearing from you, that's probably not going to happen at least until June next year. What kind of pressures would you expect from the regulator, if, being a large participant, you're not able to deliver some stability in your UK lending as an aggregate number? And whether you need to react based on what regulatory pressures you may get on the back of that?</p>
          <p>And my second question would be on asset quality. You have stated that you expect lower impairments than before. Given the macropolitical outlook, I would think that's quite a brave guidance. Where &#x2013; you must be seeing something in your operations that gives you that confidence. If you could just elaborate on where some of the quarter-on-quarter half-on-half spends are coming from? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on your first question, I strongly disagree with what you said, because the purpose of the Bank of England's scheme and the objective overall of the regulators in this shift towards growth is exactly to support two segments; first, small businesses which do not have access to other funding sources; and second, first-time buyers in the mortgage markets. We are keeping a very strong focus on first-time buyers, and although our market share in gross lending in mortgages is 18%, we kept a 25% market share in first-time buyers where, as I said, we are giving one out of four new mortgage loans in the half. So we will continue the first-time buyer effort. And the reason why our mortgage book is decreasing is because people are repaying their loans, which is up to the customers to decide.</p>
          <p>On the small businesses, we are probably the only large bank that is increasing SME on a net basis. And as I just answered to Chris, we are 10% above the market. So that is absolutely in line with what the economy needs. We are the largest bank in this country, and therefore as I said many times, our future and of the UK economy are inextricably linked.</p>
          <p>On Mid Corps, irrespective of the Funding for Lending scheme, we are going, as I said, to replicate the best practices of SMEs and make it grow on net terms by December. So in terms of pre-scheme and after-scheme, we will continue to contribute to SME net growth; we will turn positive in Mid Corps, and the only reason why our core book as a whole will not increase is because customers are repaying their mortgages, which is their wishes. And large corporations is less relevant to the economy, because as you know, they have multiple funding sources. So I think we are absolutely in line with the authorities' objectives. We do not do it because of regulatory pressure, but we do it because we think, number one, is the right thing for our shareholders, and secondly, it is the right thing for the economy, and again, being the largest bank in this country, what is right for the economy is right for Lloyds.</p>
          <p>In terms of the asset quality question, which you are absolutely right in asking, I strongly believe, with the caveats I said before about economists, that the number yesterday is incorrect. And the reason is, because everything we see in the bank, all trends in NPLs in all segments continue to trend better than we expected, and falling, as you saw in George's presentation, and I will ask Juan to comment and give you more color in a moment &#x2013; and therefore, I am very confident that the economy will be around flat this year, as I said many times, and will start recovering next year, as CPI comes down, given energy prices and some appreciation of the pound, which will increase people's disposable income and will allow them to spend a bit more.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, I think, as I always thought, this is going to be a long and difficult recovery, as all debt recessions are; recovery from debt recessions are always long, and when I was probably being accused of being too cautious 12 months ago, I'm &#x2013; you are accusing me of being too optimistic, and I am basically saying the same thing. And I think the facts absolutely substantiate what I'm telling you. Also, unemployment is lower than people would have thought and is not compatible to yesterday's numbers. So I think we can be a bit more optimistic than the mood of yesterday's number. Juan, can you give some more color on these numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just to comment on Ant&#xF3;nio's points. To give you some more color, I think if you look at the different portfolios, all of them are performing much better, so it's not a &#x2013; I think our portfolio at least is growing. The second thing I could say, I think it's very important in our bank to separate the core from non-core. I would recommend you to look at the numbers separating both portfolios. And you will see that our position has always been that our core book is a good book and our non-core book is well provisioned. This is how we see the picture in Lloyds in terms of provisioning. The encouraging thing is that the core book &#x2013; I mean you have seen the new improved trend across the whole bank, and all of them are improving as well, which is a very good indicator &#x2013; a lead indicator on what impairments could be in the coming months. And the good thing is that in the core book the level of impairments that we are having in the different portfolios are really good. So look at the quality of this book, and we are very confident that the core book that we are building for Lloyds in the future is a very good one.</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning. Ian Gordon from Investec. Just one question, please. George, you referenced in your remarks the evolving regulatory guidance, as the Bank of England with FSA, seek to reverse some of their policy in the states the last five years. Specifically, in relation to emerging FSA guidance in relation to liquidity buffers, can you help us with some quantification of the latitude this may give you? Obviously, the tender offer which you reference earlier gives us a indication of the direction of travel. I'm assuming that some of the benefit is wrapped into your margin guidance. But what we can't yet see from the outside is what level of dispensation FSA may be giving you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I'm going to frustrate you today by not giving you a precise number. Part of that is because, precisely as you say, this is actually evolving regulation. So there was a meeting this week which didn't shed too much light on what precisely that meant. So I can't give you that precise number. Obviously, we do have flexibility in terms of the balance sheet structure, in terms of how we might deploy it to support some of our core lending activities. So, I won't be precise, but the big message is, that that optionality is there through all the hard work and endeavor over the last 18 months and puts us in a very good position. But, sorry, I'm &#x2013; I will not, and I cannot give you what a precise pound, shilling, pence number that equates to.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'm Sandy Chen from Cenkos Securities. I just have one question, and it's going back to impairments and related to the mortgage book. The &#x2013; looking at the UK mortgage book, 40% on a loan-to-value basis is still 80% LTV or above; 23% is still 90% LTV or above. Is &#x2013; are your improved impairment assumptions based on a relatively flat set of house prices over the next 12 months, or are you factoring in, say, the 5% to 10%, 15% house price declines that some economists, as you say, are looking for? And if that is, is there &#x2013; what's going on in terms of that underlying dynamic in terms of the impairment assumptions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have my chief economist on the first row so I cannot comment anything else about economists. But our forecast in the group is for reasonably flat house prices, which we had &#x2013; last year we had forecast minus 2%, which actually happened. This year we forecast reasonably flat house prices, which are happening. And therefore, we forecast accordingly. So as you saw, and as we mentioned, the non-performing loans are trending downwards. We thought in the beginning of the year they would trend slightly upwards, as I think I said at the time, so they're trending better than we thought. And the house prices are behaving according to flat house prices in spite of some predictions they might fall a lot.</p>
          <p>I really don't share that to you because I think that in the UK, as long as interest rates are very low, as you know there is no oversupply because of housing permits and therefore it is reasonable to consider reasonably flat prices, and that's what we consider. I mean, we have to provision according to an expected view and not according to an extreme scenario. Of course we know what would happen in extreme scenarios and we do not think that it would be, as we said sometimes in previous questions in other presentations, very, very significant impacts. But what we think is, house prices are going to be flat this year, should continue to be flat for the next foreseeable future, and we have been reasonably good in terms of our chief economist's predictions in predicting house prices. So I'm quite confident about that. You want to add something?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the rate on the mortgage book, so in the mortgage book I think you have to analyze it by vintages. So we &#x2013; it is a combination of a couple of years, of three years of bad vintages. I mean, what I think of the book is that these bad vintages ended in the middle of 2008, so they have been on our books for four years now and our expectation is that they are seasoning. So at some point &#x2013; the rest of the vintages are very good quality, and you know that the average life of a mortgage full season is four, five years. So what we should expect if the rate &#x2013; rest of the conditions remain stable, that we should start to see an improvement in the portfolio. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Cormac Leech here from Liberum Capital. I'm not sure of this, so I just had two questions, one on the NIM. I think you guided that from first quarter of next year maybe we see the NIM for the group start to tick up slightly. Just wondering, are you making any assumptions about Bank of England base rate changes in that forecast? In other words, if we for example saw a 25 basis point cut in the Bank of England base rate, would that change the guidance for the group? And then I just had a question on other operating income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am assuming flat interest rates for the rest of our three-year plan, which is the reason why we said in November last year that our guidance in terms of income-orientated targets, would be delayed beyond 2014 but achievable over time, because 12 months ago the structure of the yield curve was positive, as you know. Market was expecting interest rate to start increasing six months ago. Now we are assuming interest rates get half a percent for &#x2013; throughout 2014, and it is on debt basis that I gave you my assumption. So, of course, if there was a cut in interest rates, there would be an impact on NIM.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then &#x2013; sorry, can I just ask one follow-on just to invite you to possibly provide a little bit more transparency on how much of your mortgage book is available to reprice over the next couple of years? Because I'm conscious of the old legacy Lloyds TSB book. I'm not sure if you're willing to comment on that or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have never commented on that, and to be honest, I mean, I don't know those numbers by heart. There is a proportion of the book that we can't reprice on an individual basis, as you know, and another one that we can, like we did in the Halifax book in May. And we can do that in that part of the book if we want going forward. But what I just told you does not take into consideration any unilateral repricement, in the same way that when I said that NIM guidance for this year was in like &#x2013; in line with previous year. We had, as I said at the time, incorporated the repricing of May in the estimate. So this new estimate has interest rates flat throughout 2014, number one. Number two, no new unilateral increase in mortgage price included.</p>

          <p>Great. And then just briefly, on other operating income, if I'm modeling that forward, is it fair to assume that it should track average interest-earning assets? Or would you expect the growth in other operating income to be higher or lower than average interest-earning assets going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question as well. As we said in the strategy review, we expect OOI to trend towards 50% of total income. So it should grow over time, as it is slightly growing. This quarter, second quarter, was not good because the markets were very, very bad. And although we have very little exposure to markets, obviously, our corporate clients were more standing still, as you know, given what happened. And on the other hand, also given the markets, all our investment products through the insurance business and in <mark type="ph" /> two half ones (1:06:53) and private customers were not sold, given the preferred deposits where we are performing above expectations and go through NII instead of the investment products.</p>
          <p>I expect this percentage to increase over time as I said at the strategy review, and all the investments we are doing on the growth initiatives are mainly orientated exactly at OOI initiatives because we have substantial segments and products in the market which are OOI-driven, where have sub-scale market shares for example, in FX products to our medium size corporations, or SMEs. As I said last year, interest rates, money markets, in terms of retail, we are sub-scale in terms of asset management in the affluent and the private space. So most of the 20 growth initiatives where we have already invested, as I said, &#xA3;600 million, are mostly orientated at generating OOI and therefore the percentage should increase towards 50% over time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, mate. Just a couple of follow-ups on what you've just said. Actually, I mean, the insurance revenue did look a little bit weak in the first half, sales margins and returns on policyholder funds all seemed to contribute. I'm just wondering if the retail distribution review can make a big enough difference to sort of offset this fairly difficult environment? And I've just got a second follow-up question on the margin, if that's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, that first question, George is going to give you more color on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean on &#x2013; well, on the insurance as I think we said in the presentation, there are a number of factors that impacted the results. First, it was obviously just the economic assumptions, so the lowering of the assumptions at the start of the year basically means that the value being forced is going to unwind at the lower rate, and that accounted for about &#xA3;100 million of the movement in insurance result from first half last year to first half this year. And obviously we had the god-awful weather over the summer, which again I think was sort of &#xA3;50 million, &#xA3;60 million swing factor in terms of half year-on-half year.</p>
          <p>And then in sales of products, yes, I mean going back to part of the earlier comment, it's been a difficult quarter for sales of particular products, also as things like the retail branch prepares for RDR. What we have seen compensating that though, I think again, I think as we said in the presentation, in the release, we've seen very strong sales through the IFA market of corporate pensions where we very much lead the market. Core pensions hit our required returns, they make our required returns, but they are at the lower end. And when you see that, that slight drop in the EV from new business, it's just the increase in proportion of copper pensions that's pulled that slightly back from the equivalent number last year.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you had a question on margin as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just could you comment on everything you've said about that amount and how material the issue of structural and product hedging is to the current margin and the sort of guidance that you're offering us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, we don't comment on our hedging in detail, but as we said before, we have some hedges. What we are doing &#x2013; I mean, and I'll tell you about that direction so you understand our reasoning. As a bank we are basically a hedged bank, i.e., we are a retail commercial bank. We have a basic ALCO position which is basically hedged. And we may open small positions according to what's happening in the market. So relating to your question on the hedge, what we are seeing is that given the very low interest rate levels in the long ends on gilts, we have growingly thought and decided among ourselves that it makes less and less sense to have hedges connected to the gilt portfolio given that it doesn't make a lot of sense to put our capital into sub-CPI yields for 10 years. And so, we have progressively stopped additional hedging, and then we have sold some of the gilts on those hedges as you saw &#x2013; or when George explained the volatile items, because we think that as interest rates trend lower and lower, it makes sense for us at the minimal accrual costs to increase the duration of our liabilities. So that's as far as I'm going to go on this one. Michael?</p>

          <p>Thanks. It's Michael Helsby from Merrill Lynch. Just two questions. Firstly, at the Strategy Day, you talked about Verde having a &#xA3;500 million PBT contribution. Clearly, it didn't turn out that way, so I was wondering if you would give us a best guess on what the PBT will be transferring over, because I think most of us have got &#xA3;500 million to &#xA3;600 million still in the muddles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; that's a very good point. Well, what I can say on Verde? And I'll ask George then to add a few &#x2013; some color. It is true that &#x2013; we had absolutely forecast that, but that was in line with the big balance sheet, and there was the option &#x2013; at the request of the buyers, we discussed many times to go to a lower balance sheet. And the final outcome we reached with a Corp, at their request, was for an even lower balance sheet. And therefore, the impact on results of the sale is much lower in terms of the net income we forego, than originally forecast. You want to add some follow-on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I just want to add to what Ant&#xF3;nio said. Yes, we've looked at this a variety of ways and it's a bit of which assumptions you plugged &#x2013; plug in and the timing, but to endorse what you said, we certainly don't expect it to have a material &#x2013; the disposal to have a material impact on the sort of BAU trends PB &#x2013; at the PBT level within our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I mean as you can expect, given it is not a good moment to sell assets, as we said all along. And we had to do this &#x2013; I mean we like these assets, as we said, but it was a mandated you sale given the rescue of HBOS. This was clearly the best proposal the Lloyds Board was faced with, and given it was a sale below book value, our strategy was, as you just said, to minimize what we were selling and afford to have as least capital as possible and results included on the sale, which is what we basically did. And I think that apart from being the best offer the Lloyds Board was faced with, it is clearly the best earner for our customers and for our employees.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not going to give you any categoric percentages. I mean one of the discussions that we've had internally, a lot is in terms of things like the short term wholesale, what is the right number? How far, how low do you need to &#x2013; how low can you go in terms of keeping access to markets open and thinking of the world ahead where you're going to have entities that in the years to come are going to sit outside the things that are within fenced bank, and they need to leave their own access to markets. So I won't be precise, because it will depend upon the price at the time, but as the FTI shows how light the percentage of the more than one year going up. And Michael, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's very important relating to your question to really understand &#x2013; and now I can speak about it because we have had a very favorable ratings outcome, and the progress is done, as you said, so these are the type of things you can only speak when you have solved the problem, not before you solve the problem. When you have 18 months ago, &#xA3;300 billion of wholesale funding, out of which &#xA3;150 billion short-term, I really think, as I said at the time, it was not the proper balance. And imagine what would have happened should the ratings review have been done.</p>
          <p>Now, we have &#xA3;73 billion of short-term funding, so less than half a year-and-a-half ago, and less than half means more than &#xA3;75 billion. Those cost at LIBOR. Now, they cost us at least 200 basis points. So it means &#xA3;1.5 billion less in NII. But that was not a free lunch. That was something, in my opinion, that should have never been there in the first place because we were basically funding a mortgage portfolio with a five-year duration with short-term wholesale funding.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Rohith Chandra-Rajan from Barclays. A couple of questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One on the wholesale bank. On your numbers, pre-tax return on risk-weighted is about half at wholesale as it is retail, and if we look, I guess, at the pre-provision level, it's more like a third and it consumes more capital. And all of those metrics I guess get worse under Basel 3. Appreciate, you're going to give us more detail at Q3, but I was just wondering if you could give us some early hints as towards your thinking in terms of the scale and effects of that business going forward. And then I have second one on non-core.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's very easy. I mean, as I said in my speech, either the income will go up, or the capital will go down to the division. And I think it will be a combination of the two. So we have to absolutely increase the returns. The strategy last year was absolutely correct in the sense, let's maximize the share of wallet of customer instead of being a wholesale bank just focused on lending. We have been doing good progress on those items, as you can see from the market shares, in stalling capital markets issues, in terms of the Arena platform, number of customers, money market transactions. But still, the environment worsened a lot, number one. Second, the ICB is very clear. And for the returns, as you say, are not acceptable, as I said. And they will have to increase either through increasing income or decreasing capital allocated to the division. And I think it will be a combination of the two. And we'll give you more detail at Q3 IMS.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It was worth a try.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. No, very briefly, non-core so less than $70 billion by the end of 2014 at which you will drop reporting. Just wondering, wanted to clarify whether that's a very straightforwardly reporting and you'll continue to look to reduce those assets or whether what's left you would consider core or it takes a long time to work them out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think that's a very fair point. Basically, what we think is the following. So in 2014, instead of &#xA3;90 billion, we will get to &#xA3;70 billion. And I know that is I hope a decreasing concern that we have time bombs left in what we don't sell, because we continue to sell ahead of target in a capital accretive way and across the board. But the only thing we can do to increase your degree of confidence is continuing to sell, which we'll continue to do, so it's a matter of time. But relating to the center of your question, when we reach &#xA3;70 billion in 2014, half will be the retail assets like the self-certified mortgages in the UK and the retail mortgages in Ireland which, as you know, we cannot sell in terms of &#x2013; if they are on SVR it's the option of the client, and they are quite sticky.</p>
          <p>And the UK ones perform well. It's just a closed book because we don't do self-certified anymore. And the Irish ones do not perform well. And therefore, we are provisioning them much quicker than others where we have already, as you know, declared impaired assets above the 90 days over. We have 22% impaired ratio which is more than the 90 days over ratio. And we have covered those at the 72% coverage level. So the ones that are not good we are covering &#x2013; provisioning as much as possible, as quickly as possible. The self-certified book, which is most of it, its &#xA3;29 billion, as you know. It's a good book, but it is not core. So by 2014, those &#xA3;35 billion of assets will come into the core book and we will run them off, and you can very well extrapolate the behavior because they are known, they are retail, they are sticky, they are predictable.</p>
          <p>The other 35 or less non-retail, non-core assets we will cease reporting, because given they will be less than 5% of our funded assets, they will become in our view non-material, and therefore we will bring them back and report as a single bank. But as you correctly ask, we will continue to run them down to zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:20:19) from JPMorgan. If I can just ask about PPI. Would you be able to clarify some of your assumptions behind the &#xA3;700 million provisioning? And the reason I ask is, from the outside it appears that if you take the efficacy data for example, which was about &#xA3;730 million for the industry in May, if you analyze that &#x2013; if you take for a quarter even, that means two billion plus for the industry and with 50% market share for &#x2013; between Lloyds and HBOS that means &#xA3;1 billion a quarter for the group as a ongoing run rate. And then when I look at the remaining charge on your balance sheet it looks like you've probably got &#xA3;1.3 billion left. So would you probably quantify what assumptions you've put behind the provisioning? Do you expect claim rates to tick down from here or have you sort of assumed it to stay at the same levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I &#x2013; the company's approach to PPI provision has been entirely the right one. Going back to the early mover and the original 2.2, and then at Q1 going for the 375 which basically costed what we have seen as a &#x2013; the company had seen as a spike in PPI claims at that particular time and that was costed, and that was costed based on an assumption that it would revert back to previous estimates in terms of claims levels.</p>
          <p>As you know what's actually happened since is that claims actually stayed at a higher level. We have in the last few weeks seen a decline, a slight decline in those claims numbers coming through which is cause for encouragement without getting carried away with it. The &#xA3;700 million that we have provided this time has been based upon both an assessment obviously of the claims that we're receiving, but studies into populations in terms of ones we've received from, expectations from future mailings etcetera, and the propensity of those people is to complain.</p>
          <p>So we have applied as much high science as one can to this particular number. Yes, the run rate remains significant. I think we got about &#xA3;4.3 billion, as you say is the aggregate provision. I think we talk about &#xA3;2.9 billion in terms of spend to-date within the RNS, so you can work out sort of run rates etcetera. I'm not going to give you the precise components of how its built up because it doesn't mean anything. We have based our assessment on what we think the cost will be and we've done it in the most appropriate way that we can. That all said, future claims levels are uncertain. And much as I would love to tell you that, that is it and there's a line under that, there is still uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you. It's Manus Costello from Autonomous. You talked a lot about the improvements in impairment trends, but if I look in core, Q2 versus Q1, there was quite a big step-up in fact in impairment in Q2. I wonder if you could give us an indication of which divisions drove that step-up quarter-on-quarter? And then I have a follow-on on that base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Juan can give you color on that, but just to enter this point, we have said specifically in Q1 that the dip in the AQR of the core book, 2.35 or 2.36 was too small and abnormal, so we are basically recovering the trend. But the overall number, as Juan said, is very positive. It's below our guidance for the future, 50 to 60 basis points, but Juan will tell you exactly what happened and why.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is some seasonality in some of the portfolios between &#x2013; so the Q1 is only the strange quarter, so you close the accounts in the previous quarter and there isn't normally &#x2013; I can touch on anything. And so some of the variances between the Q1 and Q2 are due to these different treatment between quarters. Is not a change in trend. You can see it from the different quarters information that we have provided to you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Indeed. So just to follow-on from that, on the basis therefore that Q2 is normalized in terms of your pre-tax return on risk-weighted assets, that means we see a continual decline in the return on risk-weighted assets in the core bank. And I wondered &#x2013; I mean this looks like it's the lowest return for the last seven quarters at least. I wondered if you could give us an indication of when you would improve core return on risk-weighted assets, if 1Q was just an aberration?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I thought I had already answered that question, but I will tell you again. So if costs are going to continue to go down, impairments or trends are in the direction of going down and our NIM is going to improve by margin, the volumes by June. I think you have all the ingredients you need, right? Robert.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Robert Law, Nomura. I've got two questions, please. Firstly, on the ICB issue, I'm interested that you're looking at accelerating, creating a ring fence bank. Could you give us some idea of what you think, as a result of this, the cost to the organization will be of the ring fencing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I said exactly &#x2013; and I think that's a very fair point, by the way. But what I said exactly is the following. We do not have a strategic question to answer like most of our peers. We said last year we are going to be a UK-centered retail and commercial bank with our wholesale bank focused on creating value around the retail and commercial bank. So we do not have a strategic existential question. And therefore, we are able, as we have already 90% of our assets inside the ring fence, we are able to move very quickly into being a ring-fenced bank.</p>
          <p>As I said in my speech, therefore, we think the uncertainty for investors and for customers may be advantageous for us in going to a ring-fenced bank sooner. But if it is advantageous for us, because as you said correctly, there are costs in terms of setting up the ring-fenced bank. Those costs for us are not very high. If in the discussions with the regulators we see it as favorable for our shareholders and customers to move ahead, we will. And we think it will be, and therefore, it is likely that we will be a ring-fenced bank well ahead of regulatory requirements. As we evolve in our discussions with the regulator that we are now going to start, we will report to you more on that trade-off. But I think, strategically, it is very clear where we are going and I think that should take away a lot of uncertainty in terms of direction of this bank for the future which I think we are the only one that can really do that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I paraphrase that, does that imply you think the bulk of your costs would be one-off in nature and any ongoing costs thereafter would be pretty immaterial to the group? Is that a fair statement?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is absolutely correct. That is exactly what is behind this thinking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Secondary is, in terms of the non-core business, now that you're planning to discontinue reporting it for 2015, could you give us some idea of what financial performance is at the moment of the assets that you will be retaining, so we can get some idea of where we think you are underlying, sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, that is a very fair point as well, Robert, but we are not seeing it that way; i.e., we will retain the &#xA3;35 billion of retail assets which you can &#x2013; which is the disclosure we are now giving is much bigger than before, so you can assess the behavior of the UK self-certified book and of the Irish retail market. You have that information. The other, at most, &#xA3;35 billion, which we'll then bring back into the core book, we are going to do that because it becomes immaterial, but it is not because it will be a ramp full of problems. As I said many times, we are selling the non-core assets across the board based on risk concerns, and we will continue to do so and in a capital accretive way. We have on the table every 15 days at maximum level in the bank, all the non-core assets, all in process of being sold. And as markets evolve, as buyers come up, as prices change, we are going to sell them all.</p>
          <p>So our estimate at the moment is that instead of &#xA3;90 billion by 2014 we will have only &#xA3;70 billion. Given that the retail ones are stable and sticky, we will bring them in the bank and you can model them. And the other &#xA3;35 billion, at most, we will bring in the core bank which will continue to exist. They will not be there forever. And I cannot tell you at this moment because I don't know exactly which ones they will be because we have everything on the table that we can sell. And it may happen that we get to 2014, and instead of the &#xA3;70 billion we have less, because we said &#xA3;70 billion or less. So let's discuss this as we go.</p>
          <p>I think the main take here is, instead of &#xA3;90 billion, we are going to go to &#xA3;70 billion. Second, it will become immaterial because it's 5% of non-retail, non-core. So we don't think it is worth reporting separately. And third, we are doing this in a capital accretive way, and by the way in a very different, difficult quarter, because quarter two was very difficult and we sold, for example, our remaining exposure in Australia, which was terrible; and it was sold and everything together was again sold in a capital accretive way. Difficult to have so &#x2013; such bad portfolio in Australia. That's why you were laughing I guess. Such a good country, such a bad portfolio. Things happen.</p>

          <p>Hi there. It's Claire Kane from RBC. Can I follow up on your other operating income trends, please? In the core business I believe in Q2 it's down 4% quarter-on-quarter, 15% year-on-year, and you did mention that there's more of a push towards deposits rather than savings products.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you then maybe give us an indication of the marginal cost of these deposits if you're seeing these come down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also how that ties up with your aim to get to 25% market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that marginal cost of deposits has been around for us 200 basis points. We measure, as I told you many times &#x2013; I mean, sorry, not to you, but in these presentations &#x2013; we absolutely measure the cost of deposits versus wholesale funding. And the reason why we have been growing deposits at twice the market rate is twofold; first, because the customers have been having a natural preference for the products we have given to them for example, in the ISA season with the same value date as of the request of the customer which was very important given the Qs that happened last year, for example. Or, in October last year when we set out for the first time drawing lottery process in Halifax, which we now have close to a million customers enrolled. So first is the customer's preference. But second, we are only growing the deposits as I said many times, as long as the marginal cost of deposits, as you asked, was lower than our marginal wholesale funding costs. And given that the wholesale funding costs was much more expensive, we have continued to increase deposits, and those marginal deposits were probably around 200, 200-something basis points.</p>
          <p>Given that now our rating has relatively improved and that we have additional schemes, as we have discussed previously, it is likely that on margin we skew our portfolio a little bit less towards deposits and a bit more towards lending, even the Funding for Lending skew. But overall, this is a marginal thing and the main take you can &#x2013; I think you should take is, customers, given the financial market conditions in the first half have preferred deposits to investment products. That has an impact in OOI and benefits NII because our wholesale funding costs were higher. So we just accepted what the clients' want. And as times move, depending on customers' preference, probably we'll go back to OOI which will also &#x2013; think will be enhanced by the fact that the retail distribution review is putting the market a bit on hold because there is uncertainty and therefore when it is implemented in January 2013 you should see a more natural behavior depending on the clients' response to the distribution review. More questions?</p>

          <p>I wanted to come on to your statement about dividend. Are you sort of signaling here that FSA or other regulators might preclude you from making a dividend payment until you're Basel 3 fully loaded number gets to say 10%, or is there some other thinking here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. And I haven't yet commented dividends. It was difficult to have hinted anything. Now what I said in Q1 was, I told in Q1 that when we knew the white paper content in terms of the ICB and the draft Basel 3 paper on CRD4 rules, we would give you what we thought was the likely path to dividends. We now have the white paper of the ICB which does not present any significant differences to what we thought. But unfortunately as you know, the CRD consultation paper was delayed to September. So we think we'll only be able to give you that path in quarter three at the Q3 IMS. In any case, as I said in Q1 IMS, we are following a capital maximization strategy, which is based on lower non-core in a capital accretive way, and lower costs and lower impairments on the core book. So whatever will be the context of the CRD4 paper, we would not change our strategic direction because we are maximizing capital as much as we can. And in spite of the one-off hit that we have, we have been generating between 20 and 30 basis points of core Tier 1 capital per quarter.</p>
          <p>In January '11, this bank was at 10.2; now it's 11.3, so 110 basis points higher with a PPI hit of &#xA3;4.3 pounds. You see? So we are maximizing capital generation. We think the core book is very powerful, as we told you. Key leading retail brands, leaders in their markets, totally segmented. We are achieving a leading position in costs where we will achieve a key competitive advantage, which as I said, and now for many years, is what retail in the UK should do. UK retail banks have never been very focused on costs. Especially now, in a low interest rate environment, in a high regulatory cost environment and difficult economic circumstances, I think costs are even more key.</p>
          <p>As we get to a cost leadership position, we will growingly be offering our customers more value for money. And as we offer them more value for money, those segments I mentioned before where we are sub-scale will increase as they bank more with us, especially in OOI, and this will become a virtuous circle, whereby we will then in the future have flat costs and start increasing.</p>
          <p>So I think we are absolutely in the right strategy, and the only reason why I don't tell you more about the path is because we do not know the content of the CRD4 paper. But the capital maximization part of the strategy is absolutely clear.</p>
