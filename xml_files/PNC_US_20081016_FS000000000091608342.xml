          <p>The following statements contain forward-looking information. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that we anticipated in our statements and from our historical performance due to a variety of factors, including those described in today's conference call, in today's press release and related material, and in our 10-K, 10-Q, and various other SEC reports available on our corporate website. These statements speak only as of October 16, 2008, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.</p>
          <p>We also provide details of the reconciliations to GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures we may discuss in today's conference call in today's press release and in our financial supplement, in our presentation slides, and the appendix for our call, and in various SEC reports and other documents. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, in the Investor Relations section.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Rohr.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The environment we're facing today is clearly as volatile as extreme as I've seen. In the space of a few weeks, the financial services industry has been completely transformed. Several large investment banks are gone and the pendulum has now swung back to traditional banking as the business model for stability in this industry.</p>
          <p>And I think that was recently confirmed by the extraordinary government intervention in support of the banks. On the wake of these changes, financial companies are being liquidated, consolidated, merged, and the governments worldwide are taking extraordinary measures to stabilize these economies. In short, every financial services company is meeting its balance sheet, and the quality of that balance sheet is determining the future of many companies.</p>
          <p>Many consumers have lost confidence and the ramifications are extraordinary. And we support the efforts of the Treasury to stabilize and restore confidence in the financial industry, and PNC is currently evaluating the Treasury initiative, and as we get full details we will review it with our Board.</p>
          <p>Overall, we're seeing renewed respect for the importance of the fundamentals: balance sheet strength, solid capital and liquidity position, and a focus on customers. And that's where PNC has been all along. We continue to take the long view, investing in products and markets where we see opportunities for growth. And during a time of great uncertainty, PNC we believe has posted solid results, reflecting the performance of our core business activities. Let me go through those core items for you.</p>
          <p>Our net interest income grew 31% compared to the same period last year. That's very much in line with the full year guidance that we provided. Our treasury team had our balance sheet well positioned from a credit and an interest rate perspective.</p>
          <p>Moving on secondly to credit quality, this reflects our moderate risk profile and our third quarter results were well within the parameters we projected last quarter. For example, our third quarter total net charge-offs, which were marginally above our second quarter results, should continue to be among the best in the industry. And as you've come to expect, our expenses were well managed in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As we told you in September, we expected market volatility to affect several non-interest income items in the quarter. The impact of this volatility affected corporations such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other valuations in our portfolio. On the valuation side, we had some valuation changes for our commercial mortgage loans held for sale. These valuation adjustments did not represent credit quality concerns with the underlying assets, as the credit quality remains excellent. The BlackRock share price was up linked quarter, increasing the quarterly valuation of our LTIP obligations.</p>
          <p>Reflecting volatility on the corporate side, we took some other than temporary impairment charges in the quarter, primarily related to the ownership of Fannie and Freddie's preferred stock, but we also had losses in our trading position. Rick will discuss these in more detail in just a moment.</p>
          <p>Moving to our businesses, PNC added 36,000 net new consumer and business checking relationships through organic growth during the third quarter, a 160% increase over the growth in the second quarter, reflecting the flight to quality. Virtual Wallet, our banking product designed for Gen Y customers, helped drive that August &#x2013; that account growth. We started marketing this online banking tool in early August. It generated 15,000 accounts by the end of September. And these are high quality accounts with deposit balances that are nearly 20% higher than we expected. Retail Banking also saw strong growth in consumer loans and transaction deposits compared to the same period a year ago.</p>
          <p>When we look at our Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking segment, we also saw significant growth in the quarter as more large corporate, middle-market and municipal customers are turning to us for a banking relationship that includes credit and fee-based products and services. While softness in the real estate market remains, we're seeing very good returns on our new customer relationships and spreads are better. And we continue to allocate capital based upon risk-adjusted return opportunities.</p>
          <p>And for our third business, servicing revenue in Global Investment Services was up compared to the same period last year. Now despite experiencing outflow funds due to the dislocation in the global equity markets, we saw net new customer growth in the third quarter as a result of our acquisitions of Albridge Solutions and Coates Analytics, and the pipeline for new customers is strong.</p>
          <p>In this very volatile market, we're pleased with the performance of our balance sheet from an interest rate and a credit quality point of view. Our expense management remains strong for the quarter, and our strategic focus on maintaining a moderate risk profile continued to serve us well.</p>
          <p>Now Rick will provide you with additional insights about our financial results with particular focus on the quality of our balance sheet. Rick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jim, and good morning, everyone. PNC generated solid results in the third quarter, particularly considering the current economic environment. Our results were characterized by strong net interest income growth, solid fee income performance, disciplined expense management, and manageable credit cost migration. However, as we explained in the 8-K we filed in September, our results were also affected by the BlackRock LTIP loss of 51 million, 82 million of valuation adjustments related to market dislocation on commercial mortgage loans, and net security losses driven by our 80 million investment in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock.</p>
          <p>In addition, we recorded a $44 million charge of other than temporary impairment losses in the quarter, which should have been recorded in the second quarter. As a result, PNC reported 248 million of net income, or $0.71 of diluted earnings per share for the quarter. While these results are below our quarterly expectations, we still remain comfortable with our full year guidance. And that's my first key message for today.</p>
          <p>My second message: we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions. And third, our moderate risk profile has provided us with a differentiated balance sheet, resulting in high quality securities portfolio and manageable risk from our credit books.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look about the second key message, as capital and liquidity are critical differentiators in these tumultuous times. Our disciplined approach to capital management has resulted in a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.2%. We intend to continue to work to build capital flexibility to retain earnings growth to provide the support our customers need during this period of uncertainty. However, we're also evaluating the government program and we'll consider this as another potential source of further capital strength.</p>
          <p>We also take a very proactive approach to liquidity management. We regularly stress test our liquidity forecast for extreme market events beyond the current environment and for funding contingencies such as our outstanding commitments, our conduit and our VRDN programs. We remain comfortable that our liquidity forecasts are more than adequate under these stress scenarios. Further to my point, government actions continue to provide additional sources to our liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to slide five and talk about our differentiated balance sheet. In the current economic &#x2013; in the current environment, balance sheet strength is critical to the long-term management of capital and liquidity, and PNC's balance sheet is strong and well diversified. We have grown our non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits. In fact, total deposits grew 8% year-over-year. In addition to acquisitions, much of this growth was a result of a flight to quality, and we were not under as much pricing pressure as many of our peers. In our retail segment, we have seen core growth in demand and money market deposits, partially offset by lower CD deposits, reflecting our focus on relationship customers.</p>
          <p>We also saw loan growth of 14% year-over-year. With less access to the capital markets, more companies are looking to banks to meet their needs. We are seeing higher utilization rates by some of our existing commercial customers. Further, we've had opportunities to grow new customers, as we had the products and capital flexibility to respond to opportunities that meet our moderate risk profile.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our securities portfolio. As shown on slide six, our $31 billion securities available for sale portfolio represented 21% of our balance sheet at September 30, and this is a high quality portfolio. First of all, 12 billion of the securities are agency backed. Second, 95% of the non-agency securities are AAA rated, with 98% greater than single A, all with relatively high levels of subordination. And third, the remainder of the portfolio is granular and well diversified.</p>
          <p>While the net unrealized losses on this portfolio have increased from 2 billion to 3.6 billion in the third quarter, this increase was primarily driven by market liquidity factors and was not representative of credit quality concerns on the underlying assets. In addition, the expected weighted average life of these fixed income securities was 4.7 years at quarter end, which we believe is one of the shortest in the industry.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we have the liquidity to be patient, as these short-dated assets pull to par and we recapture the market valuations. However, as you would expect, we did take some charges during the quarter related to this portfolio. The most significant being a $74 million charge related to our ownership of $80 million of Fannie and Freddie preferred stock reported in net security losses.</p>
          <p>Now turning to other balance sheet assets, our loan held for sale represents 1% of our balance sheet and declined 36% year-over-year. As you know, the securitization market was essentially frozen in the third quarter. Despite the lingering softness, our goal is to continue to reduce our position. In fact, we reduced our inventory by approximately 90 million during the quarter due to individual loan sales. However, we did incur 82 million of valuation losses this quarter in this category due to market illiquidity.</p>
          <p>Overall, this portfolio is comprised of high quality assets and the largest portion of this portfolio is 1.5 billion of commercial mortgage loans with less than 15 million of delinquencies. Other assets of 30 billion includes our investment in BlackRock and other equity investments, trading positions, goodwill, and other intangible assets. We did have some valuation impairments to our equity investments in the quarter, the largest of which was the additional other than temporary impairment of 30 million to our investment in GMAC and 23 million of mark-to-market adjustments in our private equity portfolio.</p>
          <p>In addition, we reported 54 million of trading losses during the quarter, driven primarily by significant widening of credit spreads in extremely illiquid markets. As we have been doing all year, we continued and we will continue to reduce our risk in this portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at our credit portfolio and our overall charge-off and reserve trends. Now slide seven shows our credit quality metrics on a consolidated basis. Our loans make up only 52% of our balance sheet at quarter end. So relative to our peers, we have fewer credit assets overall, and the performance of these assets on a relative basis has been better than most. In these challenging markets, deterioration was to be expected.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we saw a manageable migration of 142 million in assets to nonperforming status. As you can see from the recent trends, our net charge-offs of 66 basis points continue to be relatively stable and should be among the lowest in the industry. And the allowance to loans ratio continued to increase to 1.4%, representing another form of capital in this challenging period.</p>
          <p>On the commercial side, our residential real estate development loans continue to be the concentration of our commercial credit deterioration. These loans are primarily located in Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and New Jersey. This 1.8 billion portfolio represents less than 2% of our total assets. And the average size of these outstandings is about 1.4 million per loan. We believe this gives us greater flexibility in dealing with these credits during this difficult market. However, we do expect further growth in nonperforming assets and charge-offs in this category for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>On the consumer side, our largest position is in home equity loans. This nearly 15 billion portfolio is comprised of 39% first lien positions and the rest are second lien positions. Both portions are performing well at this stage in the cycle. Nearly all of these loans are in our footprint and our strategy did not involve targeting the subprime market.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, net charge-offs on our home equity portfolio were 58 basis points compared to 53 basis points in the second quarter. While I expect this to be significantly below our peers, I do expect this charge-off rate to increase modestly in the periods ahead. However, the 90-day delinquency rate of 46 basis points remained flat compared to the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, our credit trends remain manageable and our loan portfolio continued to perform well in this difficult market. We believe our moderate risk profile and the adequacy of our reserves differentiated our balance sheet from our peers. Looking ahead, we continue to see our full year provision to be around 750 million, with the outcome largely dependent on the strength and weakness of the U.S. economy. I hope you get the sense that our long-term approach to business and our moderate risk profile is delivering a balance sheet for all economies.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn to our diverse high quality revenue streams, another reason we are succeeding in this challenging environment. One of PNC's differentiating strengths is the diversity of our revenue streams. For example, we generated 49% of our revenues from non-interest income and over 80% of our year-to-date revenue from non-interest income and deposits. As a result and despite the isolated revenue volatility due to the illiquid markets, we have seen our year-to-date total revenue grow 9% compared to the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the drivers of revenue, our liability-sensitive balance sheet was well positioned for the rapid decline in short-term rates that took place earlier in the year and reduced our overall cost of funds, resulting in strong net interest income growth of 31% compared to the same quarter last year. Net interest income also increased 2% on a linked-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>Looking at our non-interest income, two revenue streams you would expect to be affected most by current market volatility were fund servicing and asset management. Now despite these challenges, fund servicing revenue was essentially flat linked quarter and grew 12% compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by growth from existing Global Investment Servicing clients and new business from our emerging products.</p>
          <p>Our asset management revenues were down linked quarter and year-over-year due to lower asset values in the broader markets. Nevertheless, we continue to have strong sales in our wealth management business and a tremendous number of referrals through our branch distribution network. Clearly, asset valuation and outflows will put pressure on these revenue streams. However, our focus remains on deepening client relationships and developing products to create long-term value. Together, consumer service fees and service charges on deposits were up 4% from the linked quarter, primarily due to increased debit card usage, as a result of higher activation levels and the acceptance of our products and services in new markets.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year revenues were down due to the impact of the Hilliard Lyons sale. Corporate service revenue increased 7% linked quarter, primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, offset by lower capital market revenues from fixed income derivatives and loan syndication.</p>
          <p>Our other non-interest income was affected by losses mentioned earlier. Approximately 285 million due to the BlackRock LTIP shares adjustment, commercial mortgage loans held for sale, valuation, net security losses, and trading and equity management losses, partially offset by 61 million reversal of a legal contingency reserve that resulted from settlement. Overall, we are pleased with the growth of our fee-based businesses and we see opportunities for further growth through our investments in new products and markets.</p>
          <p>On slide nine, you can see we created positive operating leverage on a year-to-date basis through a 9% growth in revenue and a 7% increase in expenses, primarily driven by investing in new products, new markets, including acquisitions. Based on our economic assumptions, as we look to the full year, we expect full year total revenue growth to exceed 10% on a year-over-year basis. We still expect non-interest expense growth will remain in the low to mid-single digits, resulting in significant positive operating leverage, more than enough to cover the increased cost of credit. We also expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 32% for the full year.</p>
          <p>Now all in all, we believe our business model, which focuses on the long term, has continued to serve us well. Our full year guidance has not changed. Our capital and liquidity positions are strong. Our balance sheet is well positioned. And credit quality migration continued to be manageable, reflecting our moderate risk profile. We believe this strategic focus positions us to deliver a very solid year.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it back to Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rick. We believe this is a good quarter for PNC during an extremely volatile time for the financial services industry, and I'm particularly pleased with the results of our core business activities. We posted strong net interest income growth. Our asset quality remained manageable in a very challenging market. Our capital and liquidity positions remain strong. And many of our fee businesses did well, drawing clients and revenues. But clearly, market volatility affected some of our fair value assets.</p>
          <p>Overall, we remain focused on the long term and it's working for us. We're investing in products, retaining and increasing our customer relationships, and developing markets where we see opportunities for growth. Our fundamental approach is emphasized balance sheet strength, expense management, and a moderate risk profile. This business model focused on the long term has served us well, and we believe we have the momentum and the initiatives in place to capitalize on market opportunities and to continue to create value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And with that, we'd be pleased to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my question relates to equity and capital raising. Bigger, unrealized loss in the bond portfolio now took the tangible ratio down under 4%. You did sort of allude to the fact that you might access the government preferred equity plan. Could you give us maybe a little more color on what your thoughts are with respect to capital raising? First off if the government plan is preferable to doing some kind of maybe private common raising? And then approximately, what your thoughts are in terms of how much capital raising you might consider?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first off, I mean we're pleased with where our capital position is today. With the Tier 1 ratio being over eight, we're very comfortable. We think the capital position that we have today, given the quality of the balance sheet, is fine. So we're pleased with that. I think the balance sheet quality is the key issue there. Clearly we're in difficult times and I think raising capital is something that a number of people have done, and they've increased their capital position based upon the quality of their balance sheets. And so I think that environment might say that raising more capital is probably not a bad idea.</p>
          <p>The government program, I think they've done an awful lot of work in order to provide an opportunity to raise what appears to be relatively inexpensive capital. And there's a number of things, some of the issues are still coming out. As a matter of fact, we were talking about it last night, since they actually are still drafting some of the particulars of how it would actually work. And I think those particulars we're trying to gather as quickly as we can. And we've got to discuss them with our Board before we would make a decision on that. But we think it's a &#x2013; obviously a very attractive plan that they've put together and we're considering it very seriously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'd add to that, the tangible common equity ratio you mentioned at 3.6%. And I think I took you through the quality of the securities portfolio, because it is that one item that's causing and it's a very high quality book. If you remove that, Ed, we'd be well over 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it sounds like then from a capital raising perspective, that you're comfortable where &#x2013; maybe to say it a different way, you're comfortable that taking the Tier 1 ratio up with a form of say, preferred equity that would not positively impact tangible common E to A is perhaps the best way to proceed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, we're evaluating all those choices at the moment, and I think it would be inappropriate to go into details on that right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are comfortable, however, as Rick said in his presentation, that with the quality of those securities and the securities book, just over a moderate period of time, they do pull to par. So the credit quality is quite extraordinary there.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Many think we're going to get a wave of bank M&amp;A in part because of the environment we're in as well as the Treasury infusion of capital. Could you just give us an update on where PNC sits in on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I agree with that. There's a fair amount of speculation. I think the one &#x2013; the thing that hasn't been addressed and can't really be addressed by the government is the fact that housing prices continue to decline. The fact that housing prices continue to decline, I think most of the estimates that I've seen, that they think it's going to go down another 10 to 15%. Those are government estimates. Those issues, quite frankly, will mean that there will be more losses in the portfolios.</p>
          <p>We also are seeing rising unemployment. Government estimates are that the unemployment numbers will rise from 6 to 7.5% early next year. Those kinds of issues would tell you that the consumer credit, whether it be credit cards or others, will continue to deteriorate as well as housing prices. So I think in terms of acquisitions, you've got to be as careful as you've ever been in terms of acquiring someone else's balance sheet. So I'm not certain that the capital opportunity will cause a great deal of M&amp;A activity.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I guess specifically in the media, PNC has been linked to speaking with National City about a combination. Any comments you can provide on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we can make any comment on a particular rumor. I mean we don't comment on rumors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean maybe just bigger picture, I mean based on your earlier comments about the credit environment, I would think that you wouldn't be open to taking on a lot of risk. But we've seen some Fed-assisted deals. There obviously is opportunity to offload riskier assets. How do you weigh &#x2013; kind of distracting yourself from what you've been able to accomplish organically in recent quarters with some of the opportunities that might provide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first say that the business opportunity of running the business has probably never been as good in my career. The demand deposit growth, we're actually being very judicious in terms of looking at risk-adjusted returns on capital. On the corporate and institutional side of it, we've got opportunities there that &#x2013; for backlog &#x2013; I'm not saying it's endless, but we've got an awful lot of opportunities there. And that's without even touching the municipal business, which is going to be &#x2013; which continues to just have enormous opportunities.</p>
          <p>So the opportunity to just run the business &#x2013; I mentioned about the 36,000 new accounts, the Virtual Wallet opportunity, that's our first and foremost opportunity. Acquisitions, and I think I've been quoted as, "You've got to be very careful, you don't want to catch a falling knife." To take on someone else's balance sheet, but there's a great deal of risk on it, you just have to frankly be awfully comfortable that you can manage that risk. And that's not easily done.</p>
          <p>Government transactions, those are all &#x2013; you have to look at those one at a time, because they're &#x2013; if we look at the recent past, they take so many different forms and I think you just have to look at them one at a time. So I think just in terms of the M&amp;A space, I think we just &#x2013; the old-fashioned way to acquire customers is the best way. And if there would be a unique opportunity that where we could understand how we can manage the risk, we would consider it. But we'll be very careful in that space.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  guess you have 41 billion of commercial loans or 31 billion of that that's not real estate-related, still everything is generally fine, though the non-accruals went up some. So can you comment on your exposure to retailers and kind of what's moving up on your watch list or what you're concerned about? Because as the rest of the economy gets weaker, is it inevitable that we see a lot more problems in the commercial portfolio? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we're pretty concerned about the retail market. But the good news is, the places that you have to be most concerned I think are the consumer debt, and we're very small in that space. As you know, our credit card business is extremely small and quite frankly, our number one key item on the consumer side is our home equity portfolio and that's performed, as Rick pointed out, extremely, extremely well. So the consumer play I think is the place that will be most difficult next year. Automobile credit as well, especially with the loss of AIG who was a big guarantor of leasing residuals, I think &#x2013; and we're out of that automobile leasing business, I think that's the place that is most difficult. Rick, do you have a...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was just going to say less than 20% of our commercial real estate exposure is in retail. It's actually about 17% of the total. And you're right, we're watching that very carefully. I think we're watching lodging, hotels, and those kinds of areas. Those are what we would expect to have some stress as we move forward. And also office space. And we're keeping a close eye on each one of them. So &#x2013; but right now, we're feeling pretty comfortable as to at what pace they are migrating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I guess a related question, maybe this is either good news or bad news, you tell me, you don't have a whole lot of reported loan growth. And I know there's a lot of ins and outs there. So some might say &#x2013; Wells Fargo might say, "Hey, you know, you need to get loan growth in an environment like this, spreads are a lot better." But if you're extremely cautious on credit, you say, "We don't want loan growth." So can you just explain why your loans aren't growing more or whether you want them to grow less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our loans grew fairly well on a year-to-year basis, but I would tell you that we're really still using the risk-adjusted return on capital versus other opportunities. We've grown a number of relationships, taken market share in literally every one of our markets. As a matter of fact, if you look at our markets, every single market we're in is over plan on sales. And we will almost &#x2013; I'm not certain this will be true, but we are very close to having every market over plan in every business segment. So I think one of the things that we could say, we can grow loans a lot faster if we wanted to...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at all. I think if you look linked quarter, you're seeing the commercial lending is up about &#x2013; almost $2 billion. What's really flat overall is a lot of the consumer activity, as well as the fact that we've taken down some of our residential mortgage exposure.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And last question, just a follow-up to the other one. I mean, how would you not want to do a merger in this environment if you got some government protection on problem loans and maybe some other government assistance? I mean, isn't this the moment you've been waiting for to do another deal?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think as I mentioned, all government deals are unique in their very case. I think we would certainly consider one if we could understand the downside risk. I think that's something we would be interested in.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Couple questions here, first on the trading loss. Jim, you guys have kind of struggled with trading over several quarters here, and I kind of felt like you felt that you'd gotten some of the issues on your trading desk straightened out. And I'm just wondering if the trading losses in 3Q were of a different nature than the ones maybe we saw a couple or three quarters ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The issues on the trading loss again were just to the widening of the spreads on quality assets, Nancy, and we were very disappointed with that. We've taken that risk down now by 75%. And in this environment, trading is an extraordinarily different &#x2013; difficult opportunity, and I think that's why we've taken that risk down by 75% effectively right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it wasn't a positioning issue as much as it was just a market issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the spreads went up, and the high quality assets were worthless. And trying to figure that out in today's environment is extraordinarily difficult.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Nancy, we have to balance as we do that, taking down the risk and taking it down to the right value as opposed to giving away value. But at the same time, trying to reduce the volatility that &#x2013; as that impacts our income statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also on the utilization rates, you had mentioned that utilization rates had gone up. Can you just give us some color on that, sort of where they've moved over the past year or sequentially or what kind of level of magnitude you're seeing in the utilization rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it's just a few percentage points. It's not dramatically different than it was, but it has moved up. We had a period of probably 10 years where it didn't move at all. So we are seeing some companies take the credit risk down. But most of the people that we do business with are fairly comfortable with where we are. Let me see if we have a number for that. Hang on one second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't have specific percentages, but I would say that corporate finance of course would be increasing, and real estate finance would be up as well, and corporate banking is pretty much flat. I don't have specific percentages, but that's where people are actually utilizing the lines we have outstanding more than they had in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one quick question, on Virtual Wallet, which seems like a very, very interesting product, but seems aimed at the Gen Y generation, whatever that may be. Whenever I hear about these products that are aimed at the kids, I always want to say to banks, "What am I, chopped liver?" And I guess I would ask if there's sort of &#x2013; there's going to be a Virtual Wallet Seniors or something like it coming down the pike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a great question. You're exactly right, us Gen Y seniors are very important. It's a very important product group. What you'll see, Nancy, is as all customers continue to evolve their use of banks. For example, Online Bill Pay is up 35% a year, each of the last three years. By 2011, 50% &#x2013; more than 50% of all payments will be made by cards. So people behind the scenes, we talk about the housing prices and what have you, but behind the scenes, our customer base is changing dramatically, how they use banks. The Gen Y was initially &#x2013; Virtual Wallet was initially targeted at people between 20 and 30 years old and the acceptance appears to be quite acceptable.</p>
          <p>The other thing we have to hook on to that is our investment and retirement module, which we're working on right now. If you look at the product, the calendar is the key and it's patented, really is a key development in bill pay because as you put your bills in there, it shows you in your calendar exactly the dates that you have to pay bills, and also you program in there the days that you receive money as well. So you get notifications on danger days and you can understand when you can save.</p>
          <p>That same thing is true for retirees who are on fixed income or some form of fixed income, and then who have regular payments, that calendar applies to them as well. So we're building retirement module that will put on Virtual Wallet, and as you know, the people who use the Internet the most, the age group is people under 30. The second largest user of the Internet are people over 70. They e-mail to their grandchildren, they do a lot of research, and they have extra time. So I think, quite frankly, that piece will be equally as valuable, and may even have some more money tied to it when we get that rolled out for us, other Gen Y-ers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Goldman Sachs.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to come back to capital, because I think there's a lot of confusion about what is the appropriate level of capital for a bank today, and even more basically, what is even the right ratio to focus on? So appreciating your comments earlier, is there any minimum tangible common equity ratio that you have to manage still?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, first of all, let me address the point around what capital ratio we do manage. I mean we do manage to economic capital. That's how we manage the institution. But from a regulatory point of view, we focus on the Tier 1 ratio and we moved to that about a year-and-a-half ago. For exactly the situation we're in today, which is the fact that it is a better reflection of the risk-weighted assets of the entire balance sheet as opposed to just cherry-picking one component of the balance sheet and putting a mark on that.</p>
          <p>And to the point before that, I think Ed raised the question originally, we talk about the tangible ratio and we talk about the valuation of the securities portfolio. What we don't put in there is the value of our BlackRock stake, which is actually just as much as &#x2013; the value we have not recognized is just as much as the value that we've marked down on our securities portfolio, as well as the value of our deposit base. So there's a lot of factors that don't go into tangible common equity that we think is very misleading about the overall capital health of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, following up on that, is there any breakdown you can give us about how much of the OCI is coming from agency MBS, which presumably we could take off the table?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Large proportion of it is coming from non-agency residential mortgages. Spreads there have widened dramatically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I guess the last few questions from me. The commercial mortgages held for sale, I guess it's kind of hard with the inflow and outflow and paydowns and markdowns you've taken, so is there an average carrying value you can give us for the loans at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, we're probably $0.85 on the dollar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly on the residential construction side, appreciating that it's not a very big portfolio, the NPLs and charge-offs are very high this quarter. Is there any sense you can give us a sense of cum loss expectations or some kind of lifetime credit metric?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I couldn't help you there. But I will tell you that the vast majority of the nonperforming loan increase is coming from residential development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll also mention that the concentration is in the mid-Atlantic states, with the real softness being in Northern Virginia and the eastern shore of Maryland.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the par value is very low, so that gets rounded. You don't even see that. It's the capital surplus that it creates and that goes into that account.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you also had some losses on low income housing. Can you give us a dollar figure on the low-income housing? And I assume it's basically a tax adjustment, an adjustment to what you guys thought you would receive in tax benefits over time. But can you provide a dollar figure and exactly what that was?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not that material. It's probably less than 15 million. But what you're seeing there is the write-off of the investment, which is a passive loss going in early, and then the tax benefits come at a later date.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I noticed that the deposits increased kind of smartly in the quarter, up, I guess, 8% versus 1%. You mentioned a couple of the types of deposits. I was wondering if you could give us any more information regarding the &#x2013; obviously they had to leave somewhere else. Was it primarily smaller community banks or regional banks or thrifts? Maybe you can help a little bit on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you, we asked the same question. I was wondering whether we were getting it from one bank or two banks. And quite frankly, the deposits have come in across the board from, well, all kinds of competitors, and I think that was evident &#x2013; was the most evident when we looked at our market-by-market sales success, where every single market is over plan, and the plans were set aggressively. So every single one is over plan.</p>
          <p>So when you look at who we compete with, we compete with different people in different parts of our franchise. When you look to the West, it's &#x2013; you see Fifth Third and National City and JPMorgan Chase. When you look to the East, you see &#x2013; you see Bank of America and Wachovia. And then all across the board, there's small banks everywhere. So the success has been across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Has it been driven by kind of reallocating to get underneath an insurance limit? Or has it just been a change in better marketing? Or what do you attribute it to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All of the above. I think people clearly have moved &#x2013; have moved money to get under insurance. I think people have also &#x2013; we like to think that our marketing has been particularly good, and clearly, I think we like to think that the flight to quality has been positive for us as well. And we're seeing this continue.</p>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; I personally don't think that the deposit guarantee will stop all of the changes in deposit flows, because I think once confidence is clearly the issue, we've lost confidence in a lot of our institutions. And if you think of each and every one of our businesses, confidence is a key component. Once you &#x2013; once you have changed your mind about having confidence in your bank, I think, quite frankly, the ultimate answer is that you will move your accounts. So I think we're continuing to see success in that space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's a little bit different than one of your &#x2013; I guess Eastern competitors, Sovereign mentioned that in their 8-K that deposit redistribution had calmed down, particularly in October after some of these measures were introduced, but one last question -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the other things you have to watch is that we're letting CDs run down. We're not particularly competitive at all in terms of pricing longer-term CDs and those go into some of the FDIC reports. We're much more interested in the demand deposit account and the money market account. I think it's worked out very well for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a great point, Jim, because even in that space, the CD space, even that we're pricing down as we reprice the portfolio, we're seeing retention rates that are very, very high, which again comes back to the point that people are coming in for quality, not just for price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last quick question on the NIM, a slight decline in the quarter, and I guess from what you said on price, why aren't we seeing, I guess, a greater expansion of NIM, and maybe in conjunction with that question, is there substantial undrawn commitments? I know you talked about the utilization rates going up a bit. But are there commitments out there that have &#x2013; will kind of drag on NIM going forward? Or do you have a size or magnitude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think what we need to see in that space is we need to see LIBOR rates come down a bit. You can reduce Fed funds all you like and certainly you get a benefit from that, but until LIBOR comes down as well and as you know that's trading like 300 over, until that comes down, you're not going to see the full benefit of that repricing of your liabilities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert of Stifel Nicolaus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, Collyn.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning, guys. Just two questions. First, I have to give you guys credit. I think you're one of the best managers of risk in the industry. And given that fact, I'd be curious to know where you are taking on risk. I mean what's your appetite and where do you kind of see opportunity now given obviously what's gone on in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we're &#x2013; we have &#x2013; there's a few places where we like the risk return. I mean in our business credit portfolio, we're roughly the third largest secured lender for traditional assets, financing just receivables and inventory. There's a lot of opportunity in that space. And the returns are quite exceptional, and I think that opportunity is really great. I think we're working on that. We've got municipalities that are coming to us remarkably every day, and we're able to get the entire relationship of the municipality. They don't come with just the borrowings as they had in the past and so that both of those basically are high quality municipalities, but again the risk-adjusted return, the relationship is pretty extraordinary.</p>
          <p>And the middle market space I think is a place that we've been dominant. We've been the number one middle market player in the Northeast and the number one middle market syndicator over the years. So that's been a place that we focused and we continue to get opportunities to bring the entire relationship into the company. In cases where we &#x2013; we tried for years to get certain customers to join us.</p>
          <p>So  I think across the board, we have excellent opportunities, and we're actually being very diligent in terms of making sure that we aren't taking undue credit risk, because we don't have to in order to get a good return today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And actually my second question really sort of ties into that. I mean the fee income component of your business has obviously been a huge driver of the revenue model in the past. But given the considerable changes that we're seeing in the financial marketplace, do you see that strategy modifying at all in the next couple of years? I mean those kind of &#x2013; those three segments to me seem to be more of kind of on the spread business and kind of the core banking business. I mean do you see the overall pie changing a little bit as sort of opportunities change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good question. One of the keys to our businesses, that we do have a number of fee businesses and we also cross-sell our customers with fee businesses, and so that strategy isn't going to change. Just the fact we have &#x2013; we have opportunities to move into relationships that have higher spread relationships and they could actually increase our net interest income as a percent of our total revenue.</p>
          <p>But that won't stop us from continuing to cross-selling products to customers and make sure that we're growing fee income aggressively, because we like the diversity of &#x2013; the diversification of revenue streams. So I think that allows us not to have to double down on certain types of credit risk when margins are lower than they might be today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Operator, I think we have time for just one more question here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Gerard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Gerard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. My question's on credit. Jim, you touched upon on what some of the forecasts are calling for on the economy, and more economic data came out this morning that would suggest that the economy is in a recession. And clearly recessions bring on credit problems. I noticed in your top 10 nonperforming assets from the second quarter, which nine out of the 10 were construction-related, this quarter it's now six out of 10. Are you guys starting to see a migration of credit deterioration into the broader commercial book or the &#x2013; just the broader book of business from what was primarily a residential construction problem maybe six a couple of months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, that's a great question. I'll tell you, we ask it every day around here. I ask every day about the commercial &#x2013; the CMBS portfolio and that's unbelievably clean, I've been very pleased with that. The residential real estate, as you pointed out, is what it is. The corporate banking stuff, we're de minimus in the automotive and automotive supply side, so we kind of got out of that business for the most part a number of years ago. So that we're not very big in that.</p>
          <p>The one place that did show up with the nonperformers this quarter is that we're a large business credit lender. And so you would expect that in a recessionary environment, you would have more nonperforming loans coming from secured borrowers, if you will. I mean that's just kind of part of the business.</p>
          <p>But nonetheless, we have a much, much, much lower loss given default ratio there. And so the losses wouldn't &#x2013; and the business credit aren't anywhere indicative &#x2013; or aren't anywhere related to a great part by the nonperforming assets. So we have seen a little deterioration in that portfolio. But other than real estate, the residential portfolio, I would say the business credit's the only one that's shown any deterioration, quite frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just one final question on acquisitions. You guys over the years have done a number of acquisitions, of course. Is there any &#x2013; I know you're not going to specifically name names. I don't mean to ask that. But is there geographically a preference &#x2013; you've started to move into that Northern Virginia/DC market with the Riggs and the Mercantile acquisitions. Is your preference to move further into Virginia and south into the Carolinas, or would you go Midwest or mid-Atlantic up toward Boston? Any color there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, every acquisition is unique in its own right. And banks are sold, not bought. And you have to look at &#x2013; you have to look at how it would &#x2013; how it would fit you in many ways. I mean, I wouldn't have normally told you that &#x2013; that York, Pennsylvania was a place that we were interested, although Sterling fit particularly well, and we were able to take all the costs out and it fit kind of like a cog in the picture. I'll tell you that Washington, DC has been an unbelievable success.</p>
          <p>And the greater Washington, including the Mercantile acquisition, is 160% of plan this year in sales. And sales were up 100% last year. So the idea that we moved into that marketplace and said that it has the highest net income per household and the highest education per household, and the SMSA of Washington DC is now greater than Philadelphia, that's worked out extraordinarily well for us.</p>
          <p>So when you look at an acquisition, you've got to look at what the cost opportunity is, what the revenue opportunity, what the risk is, and you have to look at all of those things before you &#x2013; before you can make a decision. But in this environment, you just have to be very careful, because as you mentioned, Gerard, the economy's headed south and you don't want to catch that falling knife.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think with that, Jim, do you have any closing remarks before wrapping up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for joining us and supporting us. I think this was a very solid quarter for PNC. The items that we had given you guidance on with the net interest income, expenses, credit quality, I think came right in as we had expected. Market volatility in the quarter was extraordinary and I think that's true for everyone. We were &#x2013; as we said in the call in the second quarter and to many of you personally, we're not immune to those things. But quite frankly, I think a number of the things that we took this quarter, I think, will be managed better in the fourth quarter. Thank you very much.</p>
