          <p>Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brad.</p>
          <p>Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's fourth quarter 2011 teleconference. And I'm joined today by Jim Gallogly, our CEO; Karyn Ovelmen, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.</p>

          <p>Now, during today's call, we'll focus on fourth quarter and full year 2011 performance, the current environment and the near-term outlook.</p>
          <p>With that being said, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompany this call and are available on our website.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at page four and review a few financial highlights. 2011 was a strong year for LyondellBasell. We generated net income of $2.1 billion and EBITDA of $5.3 billion. If we take into account all of the items we don't believe reflect underlying business results, including the unique financing costs associated with our balance sheet restructuring, charges related to the suspension of operations at the Berre refinery and our European restructuring, the underlying net income would be $2.7 billion and EBITDA would be $5.4 billion. The corresponding earnings were $4.71 per share, excluding items of this nature.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, prices and margins in the Olefins chain and Refining declined from strong earlier levels. As a result of this and several charges, our fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $536 million or $675 million exclusive of charges. While the magnitude of the quarterly decline is significant, there is positive momentum building in a number of our businesses at present. I attribute most of the weakness in the fourth quarter to global economic conditions particularly in Europe, unusual crude pricing movements in refining and typical seasonal trends. However, the quarter was also impacted by other items including turnarounds in the Intermediates &amp; Derivatives segment.</p>
          <p>Karyn and I will discuss all the details later in the call. But first, I want to discuss some of our 2011 accomplishments. If you turn to page five of the presentation, I'll begin with our 2011 environmental health and safety performance. Our safety statistics have continued to improve. While we typically only speak to you regarding our employee and contractor safety performance, I would also like to highlight the improvement in our process safety and environmental performance. These are all indicators of focus and investment in our operations. I'm quite proud of our results and the continued improvement to levels that rival the best in the industry.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately though, I must report that in mid-January, we had an incident in one of our low density polyethylene lines in Wesseling, Germany. There were no injuries and the damage was limited to an older 130 million pound per year line. The line is currently out of service and we're still investigating the cause and associate damages.</p>
          <p>On page six, we have outlined some of the key accomplishments. I will highlight just a few of the many achievements. First, as a relatively young company, establishing strong governance has been an important focus. During the year, we expanded our supervisory board adding world-class expertise. We have always emphasized cost management and 2011 was not an exception. Our underlying fixed costs were flat compared to 2009. I'm also pleased to say that LyondellBasell shares outperformed the market, delivering a 10% return to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>In the financial area, we undertook an important balance sheet restructuring. This unlocked the value of our significant cash generation as we both reduced debt and paid a $2.6 billion special dividend. Operationally, our plans to establish 35 annual production records while increasing in ethane processing capabilities by approximately 5%.  We also improved operations at the Houston refinery, enabling us to increase throughput and benefit from strong early year margins. We advanced our investment program by completing major turnarounds at the refinery and two U.S. olefins plants. We also completed many quick payout high return projects.</p>
          <p>Further, we enjoyed significant commercial success. We advanced our growth plans. For example, we defined our U.S. olefins expansion projects and the restart of an existing methanol plant allowing us to further exploit the North American natural gas and ethane advantage.</p>
          <p>Working with Sinopec, we announced plans for a joint feasibility study for a PO/TBA plant in Ningbo, China. The Houston refinery crude purchasing program was another bright spot. This effort diversified our sourcing while yielding an estimated $150 million advantage in 2011 versus the industry benchmark.</p>
          <p>In contrast to these opportunities, the situation in European Olefins &amp; Polyolefins as well as European Refining was quite difficult. We addressed this as well. We initiated actions to restructure our European operations and on January 4, we ceased operations at the Berre refinery.  On the bottom of the page you can see the EBITDA results by segment. For the year, all segments did quite well improving from an already solid 2010 performance.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide seven and look at some of the metrics that drove the performance. On the left side of the chart, you can see that our ethylene production volumes were relatively unchanged versus 2010. This data reflects production after netting out our Channelview flex unit volumes. This tends to understate ethylene operating rates since we converted an increased percentage of our ethylene to higher value of propylene.</p>
          <p>The margin improvement is the more leveraging story. Our ethylene margins increase by 26% in North America. In Europe, ethylene margins also expanded but from a much smaller base and fell to a slight loss at year end. In both regions, the improvement in ethylene margins was partially offset by reduced polyethylene spreads. Overall, chain margins increased and were strong in North America.</p>
          <p>2011 was a difficult year for polypropylene. High polypropylene prices led to de-selection and soft demand which is reflected in the reduced sales volumes. The Intermediates &amp; Derivative segment had a very strong performance. We saw an increase in Intermediates product volumes. Ethylene glycol was particularly strong as operating and catalyst improvements led to record production. However, propylene oxide product volumes declined primarily in Europe.</p>
          <p>On the far right side of the slide, we show metrics for the Houston refinery. Crude throughput increased significantly averaging slightly less than full capacity. This coupled with the strong Maya 2-1-1 spread for most of the year and our crude purchasing strategy led to an excellent annual results. I'd like to turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim.</p>
          <p>Please to turn slide 8, which starts our fourth quarter and full year segment EBITDA.</p>
          <p>As Jim said, the fourth quarter experienced a significant decline from record third quarter performance. We will cover details a little later, but in general, each segment experienced year-end slowdowns.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the North American Olefins &amp; Polyolefins segment was impacted by price declines, particularly in ethylene co-products. The Olefins &amp; Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment experienced similar trends in co-products, causing European Olefins &amp; Polyolefins to operate at a small loss. The EBITDA generated within this segment came from polypropylene compounding and our joint ventures.</p>
          <p>The Intermediates &amp; Derivatives segment also generated lower fourth quarter profits. This is primarily related to planned maintenance downtime, typical slow year-end sales and weak sales into the aircraft de-icing end use.  The Refining &amp; Oxyfuels segment was impacted by very weak refining margins, while oxyfuels results, though weaker than third quarter, benefited from stronger-than-typical winter margins.</p>
          <p>The bar chart on the right depicts full-year EBITDA by segment. Notably, the North American Olefins &amp; Polyolefins segment delivered more than $2 billion of EBITDA. To put this in perspective, this was approximately $0.26 per pound of ethylene production. The other segments also performed well with each major segment generating EBITDA of approximately $1 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to slide nine and see how we deployed the cash. The first thing you might notice is that in fourth quarter, cash from operations, excluding changes in working capital, was negative $385 million. Let me point out that this includes approximately $400 million in premiums paid to refinance our balance sheet and a U.S. tax payment of approximately $200 million.</p>
          <p>On this chart, I want to highlight our debt repayment and dividends. During 2011, we reduced our debt by $2.1 billion and paid $2.9 billion in dividends while maintaining a comfortable $1 billion cash balance.</p>
          <p>The chart on the right provides a good picture of our overall performance since becoming public.  Excluding changes in working capital, we generated approximately $5.6 billion from operations and returned over $6 billon to our investors through dividends and debt reduction. Working capital was managed closely, generating approximately $200 million. During the 20 months, capital spending was $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 shows a little more detail on our working capital and liquidity. We finished the year with $3.2 billion of liquidity, consistent with our target, and our net debt was slightly below $3 billion.</p>
          <p>While discussing liquidity I want to point out that we have not yet received the majority of our anticipated tax refund. We have received all required government approvals in January of this year, and believe we will receive approximately $200 million shortly.</p>
          <p>This being the beginning of a new year, I expect that you have a few modeling questions. Regarding capital, we are planning to spend approximately $1.4 billion during 2012. As always, we <mark type="ph" /> will target to complete this work out of lower cost. (12:56) Interest expense, can be calculated based on approximately $4 billion of beginning debt and an average interest rate of approximately 9%. Additionally there will be an estimated $5 million to $10 million per quarter to amortize financing fees.</p>
          <p>Annual book depreciation should be relatively unchanged from 2011. We plan to contribute approximately $160 million to our pension and other social programs, and estimate an expense of approximately $80 million.</p>
          <p>Regarding taxes, we currently expect a book rate of approximately 30% to 32%, and after taking into consideration our refund and other tax attributes, we expect cash taxes to be significantly below book taxes.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Karyn.</p>
          <p>Let's discuss segment performance, beginning on slide number 11 with Olefins &amp; Polyolefins &#x2013; Americas. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $407 million a decline of $266 million versus the third quarter. For the full year, our segment EBITDA was $2.14 billion, an outstanding year given the generally weak global economy. The key driver of the quarterly decline was reduced ethylene co-product prices.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, propylene, butadiene and benzene benefited from very strong pricing, and the U.S. naphtha cracking was quite competitive with ethane. These prices declined during the fourth quarter, making naphtha cracking less competitive.</p>
          <p>Let's discuss a few metrics to put the quarterly results in perspective. Relative to the third quarter, our average ethylene price declined by approximately $0.02 per pound, while the cost of ethylene production metric increased by $0.11 per pound. The latter increase was primarily related to the cracking of non-ethane feedstock. In fact, our average cost of ethane feedstock was relatively unchanged as costs increases in the Gulf Coast were offset by decreases in the Midwest. Production volumes increased moderately as we continued to operate our ethylene plants near full capacity. However, characteristic of year-end buying patterns, our ethylene sales declined. During the quarter, we built some inventory in preparation for a upcoming turnaround.</p>
          <p>Polyethylene sales price declined by approximately $0.05 per pound versus the third quarter. The decline came early in the quarter and reversed in December when we realized a price increase. Polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.02 per pound as price declines outpaced the propylene monomer price decline.</p>
          <p>Polyolefins' sales volumes were relatively unchanged versus the third quarter.  Although fourth quarter results declined relative to the third quarter, exclusive of 2010 lower cost or market adjustments, they outpace the fourth quarter of 2010 by $65 million. For the full year, EBITDA exceeded 2010 by more than $400 million, primarily due to higher ethylene margins.</p>
          <p>Overall, it was a very good year for this segment, and the underlying fundamentals that supported the performance have remained intact. We still have cheap U.S. ethane as compared to heavier feedstocks.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we have been &#x2013; experienced positive price momentum in several products. We're also benefiting from lower ethane, propane and natural gas costs.</p>
          <p>During the first two quarters of 2012, the industry will have a very active maintenance schedule. I'll remind you that at the end of February, we'll began a turnaround at Channelview. This is a significant turnaround, and we expect to lose approximately seven weeks production from one olefins plant and half a month at the second plant. Although, we have taken many commercial actions to prepare for this, you should expect an impact on the first and second quarter results.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 12, and review performance in the Olefins &amp; Polyolefins &#x2013; Europe, Asia and International segment. The fourth quarter was very difficult, as we generated EBITDA of only $62 million, a decline of $199 million from the third quarter. For the full year, EBITDA was $931 million, 14% above 2010.</p>
          <p>Results in this segment followed the trends that we discussed during our recent investor day. Profitability in olefins and commodity polyolefins was slightly below breakeven. Profit was generated through differentiated products. During the fourth quarter, we maintained solid earnings in our polypropylene compounding business and received dividends from one of our Saudi Arabian joint ventures.</p>
          <p>In prior quarters, we benefited from substantial earnings in our butadiene operations. While butadiene recovery remained profitable during the fourth quarter, the average butadiene price declined by approximately $0.45 per pound. Versus the third quarter, lower co-product prices caused ethylene margins to decline by approximately $0.07 per pound. Ethylene production declined by 13% due in part to normal seasonal trends but also from the weak European economy.</p>
          <p>Polyolefin sales volumes also declined by approximately 13%. Polyethylene margins declined by approximately $0.02 per pound while polypropylene margins were generally unchanged. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, we experienced lower polyolefin margins and volumes. Results in polypropylene compounding were relatively unchanged and joint venture dividends increased.</p>
          <p>Throughout 2011, differentiated business areas performed well. The first three quarters benefited from co-product strength particularly butadiene. Polyolefin results were also relatively stronger in the first half of 2011. However, as the European economy weakened, results in these products declined.</p>
          <p>In summary, it was a respectable year for this segment but a difficult quarter primarily in European commodity products. We continue to aggressively pursue restructuring in this region. Over the past several years, we have shuttered European capacity while starting up advantaged joint venture assets elsewhere in the world.</p>
          <p>Most recently, we announced a planned closure of additional polypropylene capacity at our Wesseling site. Our commercial restructuring efforts are well underway. In the near term, we have seen some positive price moves within Europe, but economic uncertainty remains a key factor over the coming months. I would also remind you that this segment includes the Middle East and Asia which performed well during 2011. Thus far, this trend remains intact.</p>
          <p>Now, please turn to slide 13 for a discussion of our Intermediates &amp; Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $173 million, a decline from the prior quarter. However, for the full year, results were very strong generating record EBITDA of greater than $1 billion. This segment of our company has normally been very stable and the fourth quarter volatility is larger than we have typically experienced. The drivers of the decline are different than within our Olefins &amp; Polyolefins segment. The majority are either non-recurring or seasonal in nature. More than half of the quarterly decline occurred in propylene oxide and derivatives and most of the balance was in acetyls. Both of these areas executed significant turnaround during the fourth quarter and this was the major driver of the lower results.</p>
          <p>Having said that, other factors also contributed such as, seasonally slower year-end sales in the urethane industry, very weak propylene glycol sales into aircraft deicing due to warm weather in both the U.S and Europe, lower ethylene glycol prices and seasonal marginal declines in TBA chemicals. Absent the turnaround impacts underlying business results were somewhat stronger than the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>For the full year, EBITDA exceeded 2010 by approximately $200 million. Propylene oxide and derivative results were strong in both years. Acetyls and ethylene oxygenates experienced particularly good results in 2011. Acetyl strength was driven by low U.S. natural gas costs and competitor operational issues. Ethylene oxygenates benefited from a tight supply demand environment and strong production as we debottlenecked our plant and upgraded our catalyst system.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, year end maintenance activities are behind us. Temperatures have only recently cooled and as a result, deicing sales continued to lag. Additionally, Intermediates &amp; Derivatives product sales are often influenced by durable good end uses and therefore sales volumes can be susceptible to the global economic volatility.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide number 14 for a discussion of the Refining &amp; Oxyfuels segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA in this segment includes $136 million of charges related to the suspension of operations at the Berre refinery. Absent this, results were still very weak at $26 million. This decline of $493 million from the third quarter is primarily related to lower industry margins. In comparison to the fourth quarter of 2010, underlying results declined by approximately $50 million, this is attributed to weak November and December refining spreads.</p>
          <p>At our Houston refinery, quarterly EBITDA was slightly above breakeven. Margins declined as the quarter progressed. Additionally, crude purchasing advantages seen in prior quarters were temporarily lost when WTI crude pricing abruptly increased compared to other crudes like Brent due to the announcement of the Seaway Pipeline reversal. In general, this impacted some prior purchases which are based on a WTI crude index. The WTI-Brent spread has widened in recent weeks.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, the Houston refinery operated near full capacity consuming approximately 262,000 barrels of crude daily. The Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $13 per barrel during the quarter and only $9 per barrel during December. Our Berre refinery operated at 61,000 barrels per day while consuming existing crude inventories prior to ceasing operations on January 4.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITDA for the quarter declined by approximately $35 million versus the third quarter as the benchmark spread declined by $1 per barrel and throughput was reduced by a labor strike related to the anticipated closure.</p>
          <p>In oxyfuels, our results were influenced by seasonal margin declines. However, the declines were somewhat less than normally experienced during winter months. Excluding the $136 million of charges related to the Berre refinery, underlying segment EBITDA for 2011 was approximately $1.1 billion, an improvement of approximately $650 million versus 2010. This includes the Berre refinery EBITDA loss of approximately $150 million.</p>
          <p>Thus far in 2012, the Maya 2-1-1 spread has improved from its December low point averaging approximately $15 per barrel in January and near $20 per barrel during the first days of February. Although operations at the Berre refinery have been suspended, we continued to clear the unit and safely secured the equipment so that it can be mothballed. During the first and second quarters, we will continue to incur fixed costs at the refinery. Oxyfuels margins have been good for this time of year.</p>
          <p>I'd like to close with the few final thoughts on the past quarter and our near-term outlook. First, I want to be clear that the fourth quarter was disappointing. We had record earnings in the second quarter, again in the third quarter, and so we've set high expectations. Yes, we had some unusual charges in the quarter but clearly, macroeconomic conditions changed as we approached the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We always see seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter. But this year, global sentiment was negative as well. Our U.S. Olefins &amp; Polyolefins business weathered the storm reasonably well and the fundamentals that created outstanding full-year results are intact. Crude oil prices remained elevated while U.S. natural gas prices and NGL prices have continued to decline.</p>
          <p>As you can see on page 16, margins are already rebounding nicely. Our refinery results in the U.S. fell dramatically but margins have recently rebounded. We have stopped operations at the Berre refinery, have taken a significant charge to earnings in the quarter and will in the coming months eliminate this drag on earnings. Our Intermediates &amp; Derivatives business is a relatively steady performer but not immune to general market and seasonal impacts. This segment faired reasonably well but was impacted by two major turnarounds into fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our European Olefins &amp; Polyolefins business was significantly impacted by macroeconomic conditions. This segment appeared to be recovering from trough conditions earlier in the year but experienced very weak markets late in the year. We will remain vigilant and disciplined in our restructuring efforts and will push hard to regain profitability in this region.</p>
          <p>While we see some early indications, markets are improving particularly in the United States. We will always remained focused on a few key things, safety, operational reliability, reducing our costs including the cost of our debt, being disciplined stewards of our capital as we undertake growth plans and returning value to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We're now pleased to take questions, Brad.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On the U.S. ethane price situation, do you see those lower prices immediately or is there some sort of lag given your inventory situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ethane prices are usually seen almost immediately. The prices as you probably recognize are under $0.50. I believe they're $0.47 a gallon yesterday and of course even much cheaper in the Midwest. We see that the most immediately in our operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good.  And just could you comment on the advantage and benefit of both the Conway hub as well as your Corpus Christi cracker versus &#x2013; and their buying NGLs from the Eagle Ford versus Gulf Coast metrics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the Midwest is just dramatically advantaged at this point in time. Ethane is being priced kind of that price even below the value of natural gas which is incredibly low for February on the $2.50 Henry Hub range. So the Midwest has a terrific advantage, a couple of billion pounds of ethylene cracking there. Corpus Christi is a slightly heavier cracker although we have been moving significantly more ethane through that unit. The other thing that's happened as a result of the Eagle Ford production is we're taking in steeply discounted condensates into that unit. That's been helping our overall cost structure. So we saw that cracker move from a relatively high cost cracker to middle of the pack despite its being fairly heavy.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've seen some price increases already. January was reasonably weak but people have been committed to moving prices. There have been some pretty dramatic price increases, ethylene, propylene and pushing our various polymer prices pretty hard too. So we'll see how the quarter develops but there's a lot of activity around that.</p>
          <p>The other thing that you have to recognize is butadiene. It's moved up &#x20AC;235 a ton in February so as we pointed out at Investor Day, butadiene is a lot of where the value was extracted last year. We saw prices fall in December. They're increasing earlier in the year so that will help us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Jim, you guys have quite a few projects on tap to do some debottlenecks or brownfield expansion and get some more ethane consumption. Can you just talk a little bit about the mood of the producers, ethane producers in giving you some long-term confidence that you're going to see these low rates? It seems like there's quite a bit of contentious chatter on whether ethane's going to be long for a few years or tight for a few years. And then obviously, there's that giant balloon of ethane out on the horizon. So can you talk about negotiating for some security or stability in ethane? And then also what path do you see over the next few quarters as we get through the turnaround seasons and back into a more normal environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and those are very good questions Bob. If you look at where ethane was last quarter in the fourth quarter you saw some prices that we're above $0.90 and obviously today under $0.50 so that's a very dramatic shift. There was a lot of chatter in the markets about there being issues around transportation and all and as I said at Investor Day I think that probably was overstated. I personally think that the market is reasonably balanced.  As you know there's several turnarounds going on right now some unplanned outages. That puts tremendous pressure to move ethane and as result you see product move dramatically lower.</p>
          <p>That pressure is going to remain on ethane I believe in the first and second quarters at a minimum because of all the turnarounds.  There is a remarkable amount of work going on in the industry right now. Going into the third and fourth quarter we expect there are to be some NGL fractionation capacity coming on and we'll see how markets are going to react to that. But I personally I think ethane prices stay &#x2013; should stay fairly low for the year. I feel pretty good about that especially when we're sitting here in February with the prices where they are.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Knowing certainly the strips out there even through '13 of sub-45 cent ethane would validated that. But has there been any willingness of the producers, the suppliers of ethane to lock in long term contracts with you? Or are they still reluctant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there are some people that are out there looking for strips right now and as you said we could do a fair amount of stuff through the end of  this year at a minimum. There are people approaching this from the Marcellus; some other folks and other, these regions that are coming in and would like to know that they can move the product. We think ethane is going to go long and so we're hesitant to do that at this point in time. We have discussed it but at this point in time don't look to lock any of those margins.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jim. Given the excess <mark type="ph" /> that's in propane (34:33) in the U.S., with warm winter and all that? Can you shift some of your liquids to your European crackers to get them a little advantage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can, we've been historically buying some Algerian condensates. One of the things that people don't necessary recognize about the shutdown of the Berre refinery is that will allow us to change our feedstock slate into our cracker at Berre. We can look at some condensates. We can try to buy naphtha at a little better pricing. We think we'll have some benefit at the Berre cracker as a result of that, the ability to change the feedstock slate a bit. But in terms of the United States, obviously, ethane is very advantaged. The thing that people don't necessarily see is that last quarter we had real deterioration in co-product prices and propylene has come on pretty strong. And so we can go ahead and put some propane back in the furnaces and make some propylene and make some money again. That should help us quite a bit here in the first, second quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you also mentioned that you've been converting more ethylene into propylene. So can you help us understand what are the economics of the metathesis unit today and what are your thoughts about accelerating your metathesis &#x2013; new metathesis capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In the fourth quarter we lost some of that advantage. It just didn't make sense to go ahead given propylene prices to convert ethylene into propylene and so we were doing considerably less of that. That hurt our earnings. But at this moment in time, that makes sense again and we're running what we call double-dimer mode.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still working on that project, so nothing new from what we said at Investor Day.</p>
          <p>I think February propylene contract price is up over $0.16. So that's very, very significant. And that's why the sudden shift back to double-dimer.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Duffy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the turnarounds this year at Channelview, how should we think about that as being kind of a year-over-year impact on lost earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're going to have OP-1 down for that entire period of time. We'll start at the end of this month in that turnaround. And as a result of having a co-gen unit down that takes our steam down, we're having to also shutdown OP-2 for a short period of time.</p>
          <p>So remember, we did the turnaround of OP-2 last year. But unfortunately, with the way we have co-gen set up and the lack of steam, we just can't run OP-2 across that turnaround at the co-gen unit.</p>
          <p>So both will be down.</p>
          <p>We've been in the process of turning around our crackers in a significant way last year and this year. And then as you look forward into the year after that, the year after that, we're not going to have as much to do.</p>
          <p>Now in Europe, we have one of our big crackers down in the fall at Wesseling. But we're catching up with our turnarounds, and in the next few years, we'll be in pretty good shape on that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before I forget, Duffy, I also &#x2013; I've mentioned that we built some inventory in December, and we did take some commercial steps to try to mitigate the impacts of the big turnarounds at Chanellview.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just two kind of housecleaning questions. The inventory at Berre was supposed to be a nice cash flow inflow for you guys as you worked off that inventory when you shut it down. Has that already happened? Have we seen that cash come through the cash flow statement yet? Or is that still in the future?</p>
          <p>And then if you would, just touch on the remaining expensive debt you've got and what we should think about for plans for that over the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Karyn answer those questions, Duffy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. From a cash flow perspective, as it relates to Berre, approximately $100 million was liquidated in the fourth quarter. We do expect, given current pricing, another order of magnitude around $300 million or so in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>In terms of our current debt that we have outstanding, the remaining 2017 and '18 notes have their call date in May of 2013. Today, the market fundamentals and technicals are very strong, but I expect volatility will remain high.</p>
          <p>So there are windows of opportunities that exist in the market. If the market provides opportunities for the company to move towards its transformation to investment-grade-like capital structure, and also have a significant reductions in our weighted average coupon rate on our bonds, then we should, as we are, continuing to explore those opportunities.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to monitor the markets and balance market risks with tender costs and potential annual interest savings.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Ethane production really stepped up in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, in that I think gas plant production was 942,000 barrels per day in October and 985,000 in November. Do you think that gas plant production has increased since November or do you think it's about the same?</p>
          <p>And then earlier in your comments, you said that you expected more capacity, more ethane capacity to come on. So where do you think gas plant production might be by the end of 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that there were more NGLs produced at the end of the year. I think that trend line continues.</p>
          <p>I will tell you that there has been a slight reduction in the number of rigs that are running.  But having said that, they're looking at dry gas &#x2013; people are making their money on the liquids still.</p>
          <p>And so my best guess is that ethane is going to be long. And we believe that this is a continuing trend. There still are lots of rigs drilling for gas. When prices are $2.50 an m, that's not the best economics for the producers but having said that, a lot of them have obligations to continue to drill to earn their acreage.</p>
          <p>Generally, the ethane production trend is up and some of these transportation bottlenecks that people talked about are being fixed. The issues surrounding <mark type="ph" /> Bellevue related to Acquire (41:54) last year and some of the jumpers that need to be put in, a lot of that work is done. And so we're not seeing those same number of issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then lastly, there's a very positive 2-1-1 crack spread but there's been a negative Maya spread. Do you think you can do anything about the negative Maya spread, or is there a way to configure your feeds so that you can widen out your refinery margins over an intermediate period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that light/heavy differential is part of the crack. And there was new capacity that came on in the fourth quarter that caused that light/heavy differential to shrink. But then there was other capacity towards the very end that went offline that helped us again.</p>
          <p>Right now, that 2-1-1 crack is pretty good. We also see quite a widening of the WTI to Brent differential. And given how we price certain of our crudes, that's been helpful.</p>
          <p>Perhaps I didn't emphasize it enough on the call, but we got hurt when that collapse happened in WTI to Brent. That was overnight, and it had nothing to do with physical movement of oil. That was just a trader phenomena. And we had priced crude off of WTI, and so when it dropped over $10 a barrel, it hit us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Jim, are you able to do much in the way of opportunistic spot ethylene sales, similar to what you did back in March, April 2010 when margins were about $0.35? I think there's over $0.40 today. Or does your upcoming turnaround at OP-1 preclude you from taking advantage of these very attractive spot opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we always watch that, Don. And you properly point out that spot is very, very high. It's in the low to mid-$0.60 a pound right now. And compared to mid-$0.50s for contract. So there are opportunities to move spot pounds.</p>
          <p>Having said that, supply is pretty tight. And we are watching the turnaround schedule. We think that that tight supply is going to continue. And when you see that kind of a spread between contract and spot, that tells you where inventories are.</p>
          <p>And so we were building in December, ran really hard on our crackers, in anticipation of what might happen early in the year. Built some inventory. Put some cash to work doing that. And hopefully that'll pay out for our investors as we come into the end of the first, second quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you talk a bit about demand from some of your polymer customers, both in the U.S. and export business into Asia? There appears to be a bit of restocking going on, but is it continuing? And what's sort of your view of pipeline inventories after what seems like a lot of destocking in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the fourth quarter was really pretty weak in polymers, almost around the world. Less so in the United States probably than Europe.</p>
          <p>Asia definitely took a breather in the fourth quarter. I was on the phone with our sales team as late as yesterday talking about where Asia was coming out of the Chinese New Year. They tell me that there is some renewed activity. The traders are reentering the market. Those are all positive signs.</p>
          <p>But we're just out of the Chinese New Year, so we're going to have to see if that trend continues. Early days. Positive. We'll see where that goes.</p>
          <p>In the United States, we were able to get a price increase in December. That seldom happens. It was a nickel. We've got a couple of more price increases on the table. Things look reasonably tight, especially when you look like that where turnarounds are going. And so we're going to push those price increases real hard.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just hoping to dimensionalized a little bit more, Jim, your expectations for ethane pricing, particularly in the second half of the year. Just when we look at it we see a fair amount of incremental ethane demand coming from the BASF plant and some others as well. And then presumably all of the unplanned outages are back in the plant as well.</p>
          <p>But I just want to sort of get a sense of your comments that ethane prices were going to stay. I don't know if you meant they were going to stay about where they are, or if you just meant they're not going to go anywhere back near where they were in the second half of last year. But, so if you could just kind of try to make sense of those a little bit more, that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I thought ethane prices, when they got above $0.90, were exaggerated and certainly not market at the time. Although I did hear some expert say, well that's probably here to say, and I just disagreed with that. It was abnormal conditions.</p>
          <p>I think where we're at right now is a bit abnormal conditions, or very, very low. Having said that, when we look at ethane going forward, there's a fair amount of product you can buy on a strip for these kind of prices.  I think somebody commented on that before. So the market thinks that ethane stays a bit long through the year.</p>
          <p>A lot depends on how people operate. Whether everybody comes out of the turnarounds on time, those kinds of things. But there is an abnormal amount of turnaround activity in the United States at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Now coming out a lot of people are lightening up on their feed and some of the work that's going on in the turnaround is to accomplish that objective. So we'll see how the market settles out. But I still think we're in a very advantaged market condition.</p>
          <p>And we can't forget that natural gas prices in February were in the $2.50 range. And oil price &#x2013; Brent's at $118, $119. And we're sitting at just around $100 on WTI. So we can't forget that big spread, which is something that affects the minds of people trading ethane.</p>

But at this point in time, our philosophy is not to do that. We would just &#x2013; we're going to watch and see how the market goes.

          <p>Well, on the first part, on the midstream business, I can't really tell you if there's that big of a shift. I used to participate pretty heavily in that, in my old job.</p>
          <p>But the one thing that happens is those contracts don't change overnight. And so you're looking at new plants, and what producers are doing. And typically it's a basin-by-basin thing, and how much competition is there. So I'd hesitate to give you a general comment. You usually have to look basin-to-basin.</p>
          <p>On the second, on WTI pricing, some is priced off of Brent, some is priced off WTI. Just depends on how relevant one is compared to the other.</p>
          <p>Toward the second half of the year, people were generally trying to price off of Brent. But I'll still say that there are a fair amount of transactions done off of WTI.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, remember that that crude is available. WTI isn't that far away from us. And there's a pipeline connection that's going to happen mid-year that will bring some of that pricing down into the Gulf Coast. So it's still a relevant index.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then secondly, on the outages, if OP-1 and OP-2  will both be down at the same time, is a good bogey that it's about a $70 million to $80 million headwind for the quarter. In terms of a sequential bridge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we really don't give that number out. And remember, we've taken some commercial leverage to build some inventory. So we'd rather not publish a number on that. We gave you the basic timelines of how long we'll be down, and that's about as much as I'd like to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, Laurence, you know the capacity of those plants so you've got a pretty &#x2013; a reasonable picture of volume metric impacts and things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the &#x2013; what's your &#x2013; you mentioned that the cash tax rate would be significantly lower than the reported taxes. Do you have a rough sense for where the cash tax rate should come out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the expectations for 2012 we've got 30% to 32% on the booked tax, but somewhere around the range of 15% or lower for cash taxes going forward. Again you have take into consideration the receipt of the $200 million in cash tax refunds for 2012.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Hassan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was taking a look at page six of your slide presentation and you've listed a number of accomplishments in 2011, the increase in your ethane feedstock capabilities or wrapping up pre-maintenance turnarounds and the like. So now with those behind us just trying to get a sense of how we should we think about 2012 EBITDA improvement because of having these accomplishments behind you in '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we spent a fair amount of time talking about 2012 forward in our Investor Day. For instance, one of the things that we specifically mentioned about the European restructuring is we're looking to take a couple hundred million of dollars a year out of our cost structure there. We talked about the Berre refinery being shut down in the second half of the year; we won't have that earnings drag. We've talked about the ethane advantage that we've incorporated in the United States increasing by another 5%. Things like that help us on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>Further down the road after this year and then to the next few years, we've got expansion plans at La Porte, maybe a bit of Channelview methanol plant restart. We've got a butadiene unit that we're working on as we speak that's a lump sum turnkey contract in Germany that's got beautiful economics. So this is a growing company. The capital budget is up to $1.4 billion this year and so we feel very good about our future.</p>
          <p>Now, I will say that we are heavily dependent at this moment in time on U.S. Olefins &amp; Polyolefins. I mean that's where the key driver is and last year, we saw a really nice bump from Refining. Refining didn't come to us in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was a very, very tough fourth quarter in Refining but the fundamentals of our business are still intact. We're going to continue to drive very hard to improve our performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And a follow-up if I may. We've spent a fair bit of time on this call talking about the ethane side of things and ethylene, polyethylene and the like but where do you see &#x2013; propylene prices obviously came down tremendously through the second half of last year. Where do you see propylene prices directionally going through 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Propylene is a very short molecule at this point in time and I can't explain why it fell as fast as it did in the fourth quarter but we've had some pretty significant price increases early in the year. People are cracking lighter in the United States which should make that a more valuable molecule going forward into the chain.</p>
          <p>I did mention in the call today that polypropylene demand had been diminished as a result of high prices propylene and the polypropylene. So we have seen the market deterioration. On the other hand, there are other uses like the propylene oxide business. We feel pretty good about propylene prices going forward and we didn't have that benefit in the fourth quarter. We hope to see it the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very helpful. Thanks so much, Jim.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Kevin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if you comment on prospective demand in the propylene chain. If I look at slide number seven, it looks like polypropylene resin volumes were down half a billion pounds, PO/PG down as well. How much of that would you attribute to price elasticity? And to the extent that that was a factor, do you think it's mostly played out now so that we can resume growth in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My hope, Kevin, is that that did play out. Polypropylene prices were materially higher than polyethylene prices. Those who could switch fairly quickly did. And so, I think there are certain uses for polypropylene just makes a lot more sense, car parts and all of that. I mentioned that our polypropylene compound business was really good in '10 and stayed really good in '11. We still see that continuing. So a lot of the applications are still there, still solid and I think we've seen the adjustment in those volumes.</p>
          <p>Now, it also goes into things like our propylene oxide business. We always have a little bit of reduction in the fourth quarter, some of that in seasonal but pretty steady. We'll see where that goes but if we have a bit of improvement in the world economy, I expect that all of this gets better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Kevin. This is Doug. I mean, I would, as Jim just said, sort of separate the propylene oxide considerations from the polypropylene. I think some of that was our turnarounds year end, the deicing and things, not anything from really propylene pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And then Jim, at Investor Day, you talked a fair amount about earning the right to grow. I think the emphasis at the time was organic growth through the various projects that you've outlined. We continue to see quite a bit of M&amp;A activity across the chemical sector. Even with the special dividend, you're levered about half a turn right now. What is your current view on the outlook for M&amp;A for Lyondell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you've mentioned, the program that we put forward in Investor Day was organic oriented. We, like other companies look for opportunistic opportunities. We just have haven't seen something that we're interested in yet. A lot depends on pricing, those kinds of things. We'll pay a lot of attention. We do &#x2013; Sergey is sitting next to me on the left and he's nodding his head. He's always keeping track of everything out there. But we also will tell you that, if you pay too much at a wrong time, you hurt the company a great deal and we're interested in earnings, not being big.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from Gregg Goodnight of UBS. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, all. Jim, you mentioned the weak pricing in natural gas and there are some forecast out there that have gas even under more pressure. A couple questions in that area. Number one, is your acetyls business directly exposed to spot gas? And question number two is, could you sort of size your company's leverage to say a dollar reduction in natural gas either through BTUs per month type numbers or million dollars per $1.00 of gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The acetyls business does buy its gas on a spot basis. It's been very good for the business recently with this very, very cheap $2.50 in the heart of winter type price. On the kind of indexes, you might think of a dollar in MMBTU lowering our utility cost about $275 million a year. That includes the co-gen steam purchase impacts. And then if you think of it into the ethane chain, a dollar in MMBTU equals about $0.07 a gallon ethane, a cent a pound COE, something like that. Those are pretty good ratios, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, you mentioned the turnarounds you had in the fourth quarter in propylene oxide and acetyls. Could you size those up in terms of what the direct costs, the maintenance costs, were for those turnarounds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't usually talk to those direct costs and, of course, they get amortized over time on those large turnarounds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we're going to have to break out then the impact of the lower volumes versus the turnarounds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what you're seeing is what you see in the third to fourth quarter results, as Jim said in the prepared comments, was largely the turnaround impacts was one of the most significant effects between third and fourth quarter profitability. Acetyls, of course, we only have one acetyls unit in the system so when it's down, you have a pretty big impact. And then on the propylene oxide side, the site that was down is a propylene oxide, solvents, C4 chemicals and BDO site. So there's a combination of impacts on that site.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. How long was the acetyls area down in fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't remember the length of the turnaround. I think it was &#x2013; I'll have to get back to you because I just don't recall, Gregg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hey, thanks a lot, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're going to, I think, take one more question because I think we're running out of time here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from Ed Mally of Imperial Capital. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Just a quick follow up on the question about the debt and the capital structure. With respect to the high cost debt generally, would your priority be to refinance that into lower cost debt when the opportunity arises or would you look to put some priority on using excess cash flow to pay down debt outright? And then also within that context, you addressed the 2017, 2018 bonds as a target, any thoughts on the 2027 bonds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in terms of reducing those, the 2017 and '18 bonds, yeah, we'll look to the market here and see if there's opportunities to overall reduce the overall costs from a coupon perspective then we will look to tender those bonds and go into to the bond market and potentially extend the maturities on those bonds as well as an overall reduction in the cost.</p>
          <p>In terms of our overall leverage that we have, expectation is where we're at is appropriate for us. We are a commodity chemical; it's critical to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity. As previously discussed at our Investor Day, maintaining that $3 billion range is appropriate from a liquidity perspective. We are looking to reduce our weighted average cost of capital and I believe in this market it is an achievable goal.</p>
          <p>When you look at where our current market and where are our 6% $1 billion bonds are trading today, that would indicate the availability out there in the market and indicate a longer tendered maturity staggered capital structure with the current leverage profile that we have.</p>
          <p>Now, of course, the capital considerations would be different if there wasn't sufficient liquidity in the market. But given our current credit rating, the nature of our business, the global outlook for our business, our capital needs and our access to sufficient liquidity than the current leverage profile that we have today is appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And anything just with respect to the 2027 bonds at 8.1% similar to the other higher cost paper. Would you look to address those as well as the 2017, 2018?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ed, this is Doug. I mean, I think, you look back at the history of those bonds and it's a pretty small issue for us at $300 million; they've been out there and survived through quite a bit. It's something that's a pretty nice <mark type="ph" /> decent efforts. (63:36) Yes, the interest rate's a little higher than we can achieve right now, but with all the other considerations of going through this. So I think, as Karyn said, the focus is on those larger issues and what we could do with those particularly with the 2013 calls coming up and the opportunities that the market presents and we hope will present across this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, everyone, for your continued interest in our company. We did have a disappointing quarter, we recognize that. It was seasonally slower as we often see in the fourth quarter but in addition to that, we took a significant charge related to the Berre refinery, $400 plus million related to our refinancing efforts in the fourth quarter but I think those unlocked significant value. We had a very weak Maya 2-1-1 crack spread in the refining business, the collapse of WTI at a certain point in time.</p>
          <p>Europe has obviously been quite weak in the fourth quarter, seeing a little signs of life. But fundamentally, we have a very, very strong business. Ethane is a very cheap right now. There're lots of turnarounds on the horizon. We're going to continue to press on reducing our cost structure. We have a good business and we came off of record earnings in second quarter, record earnings in the third quarter. We're going to continue press.</p>
          <p>Again, thank you for interest and look forward to talking to you next quarter.</p>
