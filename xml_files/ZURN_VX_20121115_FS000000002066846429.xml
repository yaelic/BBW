          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to the Zurich Results Reporting for the Nine Months to September 13, 2012 Conference Call. I'm Goran, the Chorus Call operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will be in listen-only-mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.</p>
          <p>At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mrs. Debra Broek. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good day to everyone. And welcome to Zurich's nine months results reporting. It's a pleasure to have you join us. And we will start with a few opening remarks from Pierre, and then we will quickly turn to Q&amp;A. So Pierre, if you could please start us out with some remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Debra, and good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm not going to go over the presentation, but we had several calls and questions this morning so we thought it would be useful to perhaps clarify a few points upfront.</p>
          <p>One is with regard to General Insurance, and just to clarify that the strong underlying performance in GI was the underlying loss ratio of 61.6%, includes the crop losses of $50 million that we recorded in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The second point I would like to clarify also in General Insurance, we highlighted already last month the financial adjustment in Germany of $550 million, but the GI results also include $60 million of tax rulings. And if you adjust for both, the combined ratio would then be 94.7% for the nine months and 94.5% for the discrete quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Global Life, here I would also like to clarify that there are two key aspects to take into account; one is the FX impact, as well as the change in methodology for corporate life and pensions business. And if you adjust for those, the new business value would be flat compared to the prior period.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Farmers, I just would like to further &#x2013; one, emphasize, that on a third quarter discrete basis, the combined ratio for Farmers Re was $0.99, but also that the exchanges benefited from the Fogel settlement to the tune of near $200 million which had a positive impact on the surplus ratio of 1.3 point. The rest actually being due to underlying improvement.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to net income, the further clarification is the net income being lower is really due to the lower realized gains for the quarter as last year included over $700 million of gains in derivatives for hedging purposes, while this year actually the derivative position generated some losses. Also, keep in mind at the same time however that our shareholders' equity still increased to $34 billion and that both Swiss solvency and economic capital ratio both have been very strong with 178% and 110%, respectively. And as a result, our capital and solvency position is well within our AA range.</p>
          <p>So, I hope these clarifications are useful. And with that, let's open it to questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mr. Michael Klien from Nomura. Please go ahead, sir. Mr. Klien, your line is open, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Sorry about that. My first question would be on the new business value on the Life side, you mentioned that with the adjustments in the prior periods, that would've been flat. Considering that APE was up 12%, obviously the margin is still down year-over-year. Can you maybe provide us with some more granularity to the changed margin mix and also how we should expect this to change in the coming quarters, i.e., should we be expecting a return to the old margin or is this now the new level of profitability?</p>
          <p>And also in this regard, could you help me understand why in Switzerland you're again writing Life business with a negative new business margin in Q3 as you did in Q2?</p>
          <p>And my second question would be on asbestos actually. We saw at least three this quarter increasing reserves. Are you seeing any reason that you should look at asbestos reserves in the UK again? And also, can you maybe remind us what the timing is of your regular detailed reserve reviews on asbestos specifically? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Michael, thanks for your question. I'll try to summarize them. First, the first was on the new business margin being down and what should you make out of it. The second question was on Switzerland also in Life and why are we writing at negative margins but the margin year-to-date is positive. And then on reserves, if I understood it correctly, there were two questions; one was what should we think about the level of reserves and more specifically when will the reserve reviews occurring, and with that, what should we think about UK asbestos.</p>
          <p>So, let me take each of them in order. With regard to the new business margin, it's down 21%. This is essentially due to a very specific business which we wrote in Chile which is biennial business where the characteristics of this business is actually to have a new business margin. It's something therefore that is a one-off and has been influenced by this very specific business.</p>
          <p>I'd like to remind you that the way we look at the business is much more on a return on risk-based capital employed, and from that perspective, the business is exceeding our hurdle rate. So, we're very happy with the business. It's just that the new business margin doesn't reflect the risk return and, therefore, it has had an impact in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now this is a business that you write once, so it is recorded and therefore would not have an impact in the coming quarters, and we continue to write our business generally at the same levels of profitability that we are targeting.</p>
          <p>As I move on now to the second question which is Switzerland, now the new business value for Switzerland was still $4 million. Agreed, it's not very high. I think what you have to recognize is within the new business value, there are actually two parts; one is the business that we're truly developing which is more on the corporate life and pension side where the margin are satisfactory, but you also get some business, i.e., new premium paid from old business as well as distribution of still traditional products to the agent which put a downward pressure on the margin.</p>
          <p>If I move then on to the reserves, so just to point out that year-to-date, the development of reserve has been 2.9% positive or $617 million, and then of course this is reduced by the Germany adjustment which still keeps the reserve development positive for the year even after you include that. So from that perspective, the development is not as positive but it is still positive. As I mentioned in the webcast, the reserve margins are also unchanged.</p>
          <p>Finally, with regards to the reserve review, we perform a review on an ongoing basis, including of course other long-tail line of business. Specifically for the UK asbestos, we have continued of course to monitor it carefully and we see trends being in accordance with our expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Mr. Marc Thiele from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My first question is in the investment income in General Insurance, it seems to have fallen off the cliff if I look at the run rate compared with the previous quarters, and I'm referring to the $600 million on page 19 in your supplement. What's the underlying we should use for our forecast? Was there anything exceptional that we need to consider?</p>
          <p>And then, the second question is related to &#x2013; which may have to do with workers' council agreements, can you provide some guidance of what's still to come in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I didn't understand the second question. Is the impact of which charges exactly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The restructuring chargers, the $103 million in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, following investment income, well, there's nothing extraordinary happening this quarter. It's a &#x2013; if you &#x2013; clearly, what is happening is that we're reinvesting at lower yields. So as a result of that, in line with the entire industry, we're seeing a drop in our net investment income. If you look at how it has developed from last quarter to this quarter, our running yield has dropped by about 10 basis points to 15 basis points, depending on which business you're looking at. And then of course, on the new money, the impact is bigger as rates have fallen. So other than that, I don't think that there is any specific impact.</p>
          <p>With regards to GI, there is also the impact of capital repatriation to the group, which has had a negative impact on the capital base. But within the group, it's been capital that goes at the corporate center.</p>
          <p>Finally, there is also an impact on &#x2013; due to FX, especially as on average FX rate basis, there's been a weakening of pretty much all currencies against the dollar, particularly the euro.</p>
          <p>With regards to the restructuring charges, I mean, as you know, we have an expense program where we're reducing the cost. Part of that of course does involve restructuring charges as we review the business to be the most efficient as possible. If you compare these restructuring charges to last year, they're a little bit higher but relatively in line with what we have last year at the same time; $103 million versus $85 million to be precise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. It was $20 million the quarter before. I was just wondering if you have sort of taken more this quarter and then we should expect the drop back to the levels that you have before or would you suggest this will level off slowly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think you have to put it in the context of the efficiency program that we have put in place. As initiatives are implemented, some of them will generate some restructuring cost. And I'm sorry I cannot be more specific at this time, but we will provide an update on that at our Investor Day.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir. Mr. Huttner, your line is open, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry about that. Hello? Can you hear me? Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michael, we can hear you. Hello, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I beg your pardon. I am &#x2013; there's one &#x2013; I have two questions. One is &#x2013; and forgive me if it had been asked already. One is Zinszusatzreserve. I didn't quite understand if it's &#x2013; how much comes through to shareholders with $50 million in the quarter? I know you gave figures in the presentation of year-to-date, so you have $95-odd million after the total, about $150 million. But I wasn't sure what the net impact to shareholders is.</p>
          <p>And the other question is on &#x2013; it's a little bit obscure, I shouldn't have asked this, maybe offline, is -in Farmers Re, the capital of Farmers Re is used in the surplus ratio of Farmers, so I'm kind of wondering whether the capital here is being double counted. You see, if you think about kind of one of these mass diagrams in one circle, which is Farmers and the other which is Zurich, and the intersection seems to appear in both. And I just wondered am I right in this and how much does it double counting, if it's right. I mean I have no idea. Is there &#x2013; the question for the ZZR, I'm not bothered about $50 million, but I understand that the mechanism just keeps accelerating so you're soon looking at hundreds of millions and then the numbers do matter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first on the ZZR, and there is a little more detail provided on slide 48 of the investor presentation, what has been transferred so far in 2012 was $147 million. And of that, the impact to &#x2013; sorry, the impact to shareholders was $91 million &#x2013; sorry, it was $91 million. And of that within the third quarter, the impact was approximately $20 million of the $91 million.</p>
          <p>You have to keep in mind with regards to the ZZR that the addition to the ZZR is really as the 10-year average declines, we put up a reserve corresponding to the difference between the guaranteed rate and the average rate. As long as the rate of deceleration is the same, there is no reason to accelerate the provision to the ZZR. Actually, on the contrary, unless you fall into rates that become negative, the rate of deceleration should decline. So in theory, your ZZR will decline although you start to hit lower guaranteed rates. It's not that complicated...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I like your &#x2013; no, no, I'm not &#x2013; but my understanding was slightly different. It was to do with the cohorts, so the 4% and 3.5%, that's why I was worried you see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So clearly, as &#x2013; there's several things that are happening though. Indeed, as you go into a lower rate, you start to hit other guaranteed rates. But at the same time, you're having lower amount of reserves, as well as you're having some run-off. So you don't necessarily see an acceleration of that revision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to Farmers Re, there are several points. With regards to the way the surplus ratio is calculated in accordance with the NAIC grouping, the Farmers Re capital is included as part of the surplus ratio. However, the way the regulator and we also look at the capital and solvency of the exchanges is really individually at each of the exchanges' level which does not include Farmers Re. And it is the individual Farmer's exchanges that benefited from the Fogel settlement, and all three exchanges had very robust ratios in the third quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Brian Shea from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I just wanted to make sure I understand how your reinsurance program works with respect to the Sandy loss you're going to have. I appreciate that it's too early for you to give us any number about what your gross loss could be, but hopefully we could talk just kind of factually about how the reinsurance program will work.</p>
          <p>I'm looking at slide 41, it looks like you guys will eat the first $500 million. And I just wanted to confirm, that's &#x2013; does that include the loss that will come from Farmers Re? And then secondly, hopefully the loss would not be bigger than $500 million, but if it were, that first layer of co-participation, if you could give us an indication of how big your co-participation would be and maybe just if there's any general remarks you want to make that I've missed here, but just so how does the reinsurance work once you know your gross loss? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Brian, actually, your understanding is quite correct. So, the retention for the U.S. cat program, which is relevant here, is $500 million. After that, you have a co-participation, which on average is 36%. But perhaps I'd like to point out that the co-participation is lower at the beginning than at the end. So, the impact right after the $500 million, if you want, the Zurich portion would be lower.</p>
          <p>And it does not include Farmers Re. However, you may recall that in the whole account quota share there's actually a limit to the amount of cat which is $240 million and we have absorbed so far $185 million, if my memory serves me correctly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I've got everything except for the last bit. So the whole account is $240 million, and what was the final number you mentioned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What has been consumed so far that layer, which is around $180 million &#x2013; I can't guarantee you the $185 million but around $180 million is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, so the maximum that you could &#x2013; that Farmers Re could pick up would be $60 million roughly?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Thanks. I just wonder if you could give us a sense, Pierre, of the sort of cash flow for 2012. You've obviously &#x2013; you supplied a update and showed us what it was it was for 2011. You've talked about how the economic solvency ECM has increased year-to-date, I'm guessing it would've increased a bit more in Q3. But just gives us a sense because obviously we're trying to grapple with net income that's quite depressed. I appreciate there's a lot of non-cash items in that net income number, but can you just give us any sense of how you are thinking about group cash flow over the course of 2012?</p>
          <p>I guess the second question, just on the U.S. Non-Life pricing environment, I was interested &#x2013; maybe give us a sense of what's happening to your retention levels in the commercial lines operation? And what's happening on personal lines rate increases at Farmers? Obviously, your peers are obviously talking about accelerating personal lines rate increases, I'm just curious what Farmers is doing on that front. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andrew, happy to answer these questions. So cash flow 2012, actually that is another topic that we have planned for Investor Day. Just to put it into perspective though, the &#x2013; as you said, one, there are some items which are non-cash; second is if you look at the net income so far, it's already $2.7 billion, which by coincidence is about the dividend that we paid last year. And this other topic that I keep in mind with regards to the cash flow and how we look at it, we also look at what is the sustainable cash flow of the business. So, you really need to look at the cash flows in terms of underlying cash flows and how they could evolve.</p>
          <p>And then together, with regards to our capacity to pay cash, I think it's really a combination of [profit] and cash flow as well as the capital position which, as you know, is strong. And the third aspect would be the underlying business performance, which here again, is strong particularly in GI with the low underlying loss ratio. If I move now to the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to be clear, is that the same as saying, in your view, the underlying cash flow generation is more or less stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't say that. I believe I said that we were looking at the underlying cash flows but the cash flows are also influenced by what the statutory profits are in the local businesses and the fact that losses emerge even though it may not be an immediate cash flow will of course reduce the ability of the subsidiary to pay up the cash flow.</p>

          <p>Okay. It seems, on the other hand, you think the performance or the underlying performance is strong but there's going to be some statutory cash flow pressure, is that the message?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a fair summary, which is why &#x2013; the thing is, remember, actually on that very slide presentation, we have a central liquidity book which is there to absorb volatility in the cash flows year-on-year. So, that is another consideration we have together with the capital position and financial strength of the company.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to the pricing environment in U.S., we have continued to increase rates. And if you look in particular at comparable lines such as commercial lines, that is where we've had the strong increases in commercial markets in particular of around 7%. So, I think we're in-line with the market. Keep in mind also that we've been at it for quite a long time now, since 2009. So, we're continuing to increase rates, and then workers' comp continues to be in the double-digit environment at around 10%.</p>
          <p>With regards to Farmers now, we are indeed increasing rates with rate increases approved of over 6% in homeowners and close to 6% in auto, but the five increases are actually the double-digit range for homeowners and around 8% for auto. And what you're seeing actually in the results is that, in the third quarter, you just starting to see the impact on the rate increases. Therefore, we do expect indeed an acceleration of that in the coming quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions, in fact. The first one is on SST. You show like a six percentage point improvement for de-risking and can you maybe just elaborate on that? I didn't quite get what you have done here. And is that in relation with the duration gaps? Maybe, an update on that as well. And the second question, just a general update on the hedging structures, if you changed anything here or is that unchanged?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, I think there were two questions, one on the restructuring charges and the de-risking. Let me take the restructuring charges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, sorry, hedging, the hedging structure in place on equities and so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, okay, slightly different subject.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Slightly, yes. Sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on the hedging structure, it has stayed essentially unchanged. So we still have our equity books active and our swaption program is slightly altered but essentially unchanged as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've refined and improved it a little bit actually.</p>
          <p>With regards to the de-risking, if you looked in at slide 20, there are several things going on. The key one is really that the de-risk &#x2013; sorry, our internal model is calibrated at the AA level, which means 1-in-2,000, whereas the SST is calibrated more or less at a 1-in-200. And the de-risking has a much bigger impact in the tail and therefore had a bigger impact on the economic capital model as compared to the SST ratio. That's why you see the direction is the same, but the proportional impacts on the Z-ECM is more important than on the SST ratio.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just three questions, if I may. The first one, when I listened to your presentation this morning, you painted I thought of a bleak picture of the situation in Germany. I just wondered at a group governance level, how you feel Germany was able to get into quite the big league got into, I think not just on the GI side but I think what seem to be a bit surprise at Q1 with the ZZR charge as well, I think overall, it feels like that was a little bit disconcerting.</p>
          <p>So, just wondering whether notwithstanding the changes you made in Germany, more the control process at the group level overlooking the regions whether there have been any changes there or whether you felt the need to be any changes there. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, just a quick one on the dividend, following up a little but on Andrew's question earlier. The $1.5 billion capital release out of the non-core businesses, I think you're $1 billion through that at the end of last year. I might be wrong. I think it was $1 billion. Can you just remind me where you are with that? I think there was a fair chunk expected to come out this year, so I guess to some extent helped the cash flow, and therefore the dividend.</p>
          <p>And then the third question, just wanted to reconcile North America Commercial. I think you said there was a 4% increase in premiums. Yet, your price increases and your increased retention, and all the good news you seem to be referring to in that market would imply that that should be higher than 4%. I'm just wondering if there's something going the other way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me address these questions in order. Germany, how do we feel about it? Well, we are disappointed. I think you got to be very clear about that. I'd like to put this in perspective though, because there were issues that we had identified for some time now. And what you've been seeing in the disclosure of the $500 million was really the result of many corrective actions that had been initiated some time ago. For example, the creation of a Center of Excellence for Europe in order to improve the governance process, the standards, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And it's really &#x2013; all these initiatives take time. So in order to get the right data, you need to go into the systems. Sometimes you even need to reprogram in order to get the data. If you look also at the accounting, we decided also some time ago to move to a multi-standard accounting platform which is SAP-based, which is consistent with our group. There's a lot of reprogramming needed. That's when you review the processes. And as a result, moving it to the standard that we feel is right for the businesses.</p>
          <p>What happened is that as these initiatives started, they converged in the third quarter to being close to being finalized and that's where the results emerge. Where we are today is the bulk of these initiatives have or are in the process of being finalized, which is why we feel comfortable that the bulk of the issues have been addressed.</p>
          <p>And as you know, we also conducted a review outside of Germany in General Insurance. And that also gave us confidence that Germany was an isolated case, which goes back to my initial comment which is why we also did this review and initiated these initiatives some time ago, because Germany was a bit too much relying on manual processes and there was too much focus on statutory versus IFRS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, is it fair just to say then therefore, this is really a consequence of the work you put in and the consequence of maybe it's like a chicken and egg, I guess, maybe. But the number that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To a large extent, it is. Yes, it's the initiatives that we initiated that really gave us the level of granularity that we wanted in order to have a much better understanding of where we are. You should also &#x2013; it's not all of this. On the medical malpractice, there has been truly industry-wide, a clear trend in increasing cost, which has also been impacting the results. But it's really these two influences.</p>
          <p>If I move on now to the dividends. On the non-core businesses, we will again provide an update at the Investor Day. But we're making very good progress there as I'll be able to demonstrate. Just as a reminder, Zurich Specialty limit this. We put an <mark type="indiscernible" /> open cover that has further progressed. And we're making also further progress at Centre and at Eagle Star. But again, if you could wait for another two weeks, I'll give you more details about that.</p>
          <p>Finally, with regards to North America Commercial., the business has actually been growing 6% &#x2013; sorry, no, in global corporate, which includes North America. So, there's been good growth there. And then NAC is 4% indeed, which is a bit higher than the average rate increases. But you have to take into account that there are two things happening at the same time. One is the pure rate increases, but there's also re-underwriting happening at the same time. So, this will also have an impact on the premium growth as opposed to rate increase growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because you said the retention was getting better, that sounds like that's your own selective retention rather than total retention, if you're just getting business on re-underwriting.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions, one, I go back to General Insurance expenses, looking at slide 11 and some of them were structural changes going forward. To what extent are you still confident that we are going to see the $350 million cost savings that were once programmed? And secondly, I think on the U.S. side, I wonder when you think about these rate changes, workers comp and also other long-tail liability business in the U.S., is it already at a level that should allow to see a reversal of, let's say, lower reserve position we had on these lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, on the first question and slide 11. You have, excluding DAC, commission and tax items, a slight increase in the other underwriting expenses. If that includes, however, the impact of the IAS 19 pension cost as well as the growth in international markets. If you look more closely, for example, at North America Commercial, you would see actually an improvement in the expense ratio.</p>
          <p>And I think you would also find a similar trend in Europe except that as premiums are declining, you don't necessarily see that in the ratio itself. We're making good progress on our cost savings. And we will provide you with an update at the Investor Day and it seems that it will get a lot of attention. But we'll be happy to report on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you see, tax item, if I may jump in here, this is going to stay, the additional tax burden for example in premium tax in Germany.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax item is, to a very large extent, a one-off. The tax item is essentially a catch-up on a cumulative basis of several years. So, there will be a small portion or fraction of that, which indeed will be ongoing. But by and large, the 0.4 percentage points is a one-off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Were there changes in the U.S.?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, long-tail liabilities &#x2013; sorry, long-tail liabilities was your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the long-tail liabilities, I think there are &#x2013; these long-tail liabilities actually include lots of things. We feel comfortable about where the reserves are. And as I mentioned on the webcast, the reserve margin is unchanged. We're seeing some very benign developments in most of the lines of the business. I think the one that we're watching a little bit is asbestos and environmental where reviews are ongoing. But overall, I would say we feel comfortable with our long-tail line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was hoping sort of if you had a 10% rate increase in workers' comp, for example, that this would actually now again increase the part on workers' comp. But it is not yet the case I understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a few questions. If I can quickly come back to Germany and we've been hearing the comments, so I appreciate this. But if I go back, I think it was 2007 Investor Day, there was a mention of the German business model and a $135-million cost save from industrialization of processes. I'm just wondering if this problem actually began then or is that holding to that. And the reason I ask you because cost sales look good on the year they're announced. But is this something that you had talked about or is this is something that you see a link in?</p>
          <p>And then just on the global corporate, a very, very strong increase in third quarter volumes and rates, you mentioned the increasing exposure. But if you could just comment on retention level, because you mentioned increasing retentions even when pricing is going up. So, are these clients that you're facing with price increases not going away then because they can't go away or if you could give a little bit more granularity there?</p>
          <p>And lastly, a little bit more on the investment side. With this de-risking in the last few months, in Life and Non-Life, what is the reinvestment reads and what is the IRR you're making on the new Life business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Vinit. So 2007, is there a link to the cost savings? Look, there's no indication that there is, as far as we know. So, what we have established was a program to improve the German business, which is what we started, as I mentioned, a couple of years ago and have made very good progress there. There are many aspects to Germany and therefore, I would not make a link specifically to that.</p>
          <p>If I move on to the retention's rates going up even though we're increasing our pricing, well I think if you look at the U.S., what we've seen is that our competitors are also increasing rates. And therefore, we're not unlike them. As a result, I think that's what allows us to increase our retention across the most lines in this particular space. Europe, of course, is different. We are taking, in some cases, serious underwriting actions. And that has had an impact on our European premiums, which are down 2%. And then certainly in some areas, retentions are low. And as you know also, we focus on international market where we've seen very good increase.</p>
          <p>With regards to our reinvestment yields, we're currently reinvesting at an average rate of close to 2% in GI, and around 2.5%, 2.6% in Life insurance. And with regards to the IRR on our new business in Life, as you know, our focus on Life is unit-linked. And protection and fee-based business is therefore, it is by and large insensitive to interest rates. So, we keep writing our business at our target RBRMs as we call them, which are well in excess of our hurdle rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just if I can follow up. You mentioned in your video recording that the Life risk margin benefited from lower claims as well in third quarter or nine months, I can't be sure. But is there something there that happened which you would like to point out now or nothing really exceptional?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a clear trend that everyone was clearly going to lead a healthy life over the next days. I could you tell with certainty that yes, the claims is going to be better. But look, essentially what we're seeing is that the mortality developments have been a little more favorable than we expected, particularly in Switzerland, Germany and the UK. And as a result, it helped the margin. There is and has been an ongoing trend of improving mortality. Of course, we'll see if that develops. We're just recording what we see.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon to everybody. I have some questions left. First of all, on your capital position, I wonder which part of the annualized capital gain included in the AFS reserve in equity is used in your capital model if fully included or only the part of the GNI or nothing, given that there was a sharp increase in this reserve during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The second question regarding your agent program, if I had understood correctly by your financial statement, the hedging cost was around $168 million. Now, given the size of your put option on equity, is it correct to assume that the hedging cost in the next quarters could be quite non-material or even positive in the case of equity market decline?</p>
          <p>And the third and last question is on the German reserve in the Life business, the ZZR, what we can expect going forward in the next few years, given that it is very likely that the average 10 years yield would decline further in the next year. So, we can assume to see every year in this environment of low interest rate, every year a negative impact and which could be this impact. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, thank you very much. Which part of the capital gains are in equity? So, the shareholders' equity as well as our AFR take a mark-to-market approach. If you look at our shareholders' equity, the shareholders' portion of the unrealized gains is close to $4.7 billion based on gross unrealized gains of almost $10 billion. And that shareholders' portion is also reflected in our economic model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Totally included or maybe partially excluding the part which covers Life liability in order to not have all the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yes. The $4.7 billion is after Life policyholder share and after tax. The SST ratio, by the way, is on a pre-tax basis but after policyholder share portion as well as our economic model. That's what's included in the economic as well as in the shareholders' equity.</p>
          <p>With regard to the hedging program, by and large, your assumption is correct. So, we had a loss thanks to improving equity market, should be less important and then if indeed equity decline, then the hedge program or the puts that we have in place should increase in value. And thereby, since they're fair-valued, that would be reflected in the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And then finally on the ZZR, as I said, it's a smooth line going down as interest rates remain low. And therefore, the profile of what's happening to the ZZR provision should, broadly speaking, be similar. And of course, it depends on your outlook whether you consider that interest rates are flat or whether you look at a forward curve. Keep in mind, however, that over the time also, these reserves are declining.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I have three things. One is you mentioned in the video conference that in your General Insurance business, the rate increases which you are putting through are ahead of claims inflation. And I was wondering whether you would be able to give us some additional comments on that perhaps quantitatively that would be good or qualitatively, perhaps commenting on various lines of business, specifically commercial in the U.S. but also your businesses in Europe and how they perform according to this dynamic.</p>
          <p>The second question relates to Germany again, I'm afraid. You said on the conference call that the bulk of the issues was addressed and that you're hoping to finalize ongoing surveys and investigations into the business by year-end. Is that mostly going to be qualitative or can we expect an additional charge to be included in the full-year results? And the final one is just a point of detail. Would you be able to identify whether &#x2013; and if so, how much the claim was relating to Isaac. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Okay. So, Ralph, I'll start with your last question, which is the impact of Hurricane Isaac. I can tell you it was really small. I do not have the number in my head. Okay, but it is in the single-digit range, which is what I've got. With regard to rate increases, it's really very difficult to answer your question. Again, I'd say, by and large, the rate increases exceeded our claims cost. They vary by line of business. But, for example, we're seeing some pressure a little bit on the homeowners. That's why the rate increases will be stronger in that line of business to more than compensate for that. And I think it would be too long of a conversation over the phone. So, I'll keep it there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Rate increases are excluding claims and inflation. And we do look at it line by line, absolutely. Then I move on to your second question, I guess, which was Germany and other additional charges. We completed most of the analysis that we wanted to do. There is still some more detailed analysis that is still ongoing and will be completed by the time we report our year-end results. And at that time, we will give you an update.</p>
          <p>I think I cannot be more specific about that because that would be speculation. We need to do the work, but we wanted at the same time to give you the assurance that we feel comfortable that we've addressed the bulk of the issues. So, really from a reserve perspective, from an accounting process perspective, we feel comfortable at that stage. And what the outcome will be, I guess we'll see at the time. But certainly, we're not talking of something similar than what we announced last month, if there was one.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll take one more question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question for today is from Mr. Fabrizio Croce from Kepler Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>I have actually a very simple one. Before, you guided &#x2013; not really guided. You said actually that the running yield has decreased some 10, 15 basis points in the year. Now, if we entered a time machine and we go one year ahead from now, this would mean that next year, we should expect the running yield to be down some 40 to 60 basis points, which potentially is a little bit an overstretch. So, my question is if you could give us some figure on which base &#x2013; or that we could use as a base in order to model the running yield for next year in the nine months?</p>
          <p>Then the second question is about Sandy. Sorry, I know you don't disclose any figures. For me, it's only to understand if I get this right from a geographic point of view. Am I right assuming that actually, the region which was affected by Sandy is not exactly Farmers' land in terms of &#x2013; these are not the operation that normally are covered by &#x2013; sorry, this is not the geography which normally is covered by Farmers, but it's rather a region which is covered by Foremost and 21st Century potentially North American Commercial. And then last, simply to get it really straight to the point, shall we expect some dividend cut for next year or do you think that the CHF 17 are a reliable level still?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, three questions: one, the running yield; second, the impact of Sandy in a little more detail; and third, the dividends. With regards to running yield, let me give you a few points there. The average duration on GI book is about five years and the average duration on our Life book is around seven years. The running yield on GI is about 3.2% and on the Life is about 3.9%. And as I already mentioned, the new running yield in GI is slightly below 2%. And in Life insurance, it's slightly above 2.5%. So, I hope that will give you enough indication for you to model that.</p>
          <p>With regard to Sandy, there is impact to Farmers. You're right. It's essentially limited to or more prominent on 21st Century and Foremost because that's where we got the homeowners' property and then NAC. Keep in mind that you've got a national flood insurance program which will cover a lot of the losses. So, this is more about auto losses, to some extent, some home. And then on the commercial, it becomes more complex. There's business interruption, which is probably the most complex area of the whole catastrophe.</p>
          <p>And then finally, with regards to the dividend, as you know, this is a shareholder's approval of the board recommendation, which will take place in April. When we look at the dividend, we take a series of factors into account. One is the underlying performance of the business, the cash flows, the capital strength and solvency position, which combined together are the elements that we look at for making that decision. And I think if you look at all these criteria, you've got a strong underlying performance. You've got a strong capital position. It's got still good cash flows and these are all the elements that we'll take into account.</p>
