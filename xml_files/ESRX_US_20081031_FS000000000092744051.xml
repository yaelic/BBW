          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, instructions to be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host David Myers. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome everyone to our third quarter 2008 conference call. With me this morning are George Paz, our Chairman and CEO, and Jeff Hall, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to read the following statement.</p>
          <p>Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements, and may include, but are not necessarily limited to financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties.</p>
          <p>The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors which are discussed in detail in our SEC filings. In addition, the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income and to net cash provided by operating activities can be found in our earnings release, which is also posted on our website.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeff who will discuss our third quarter financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. As most of you already know Express Scripts had another strong quarter.  We attribute this success to the continued focus on our model of alignment that is we make money when our clients save money.  We are taking this model of alignment to the next level through our consumerology initiative, the application of human behavior and behavioral economics to the pharmacy benefit.</p>
          <p>By using technology to tailor our offerings and interactions to each individual, we can increase therapy adherence and lower cost of care, delivering lower costs and better health outcomes.  And in this economic environment, saving money is more important than ever to many of our clients.</p>
          <p>As I told you last quarter, as a result of the positive initial reaction to our consumerology effort, we have accelerated our programs and spending in these areas.  This trend continued in the third quarter and as a result we are excited about the prospects for client savings and profitability growth in 2009.  To that end, I'll spend a few minutes today reviewing the highlights of the quarter before providing a little more color on our outlook for 2009.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we enjoyed strong performance across all of our businesses.  Our industry leading generic fill rate reached a record 66.2% up 4 percentage points from last year.  This increase drove both savings for our client as well as contributing to our gross profit improvement of 18% from the prior year.  Home delivery claims were up both sequentially and versus prior year, and home delivery penetration in our PBM segment grew to 25.2%.</p>
          <p>By leveraging our consumer platform and tailoring our offerings to individual members, we believe we can create significant savings for our clients by driving home delivery penetration to 40% in the future.  In addition, better performance in our specialty business contributed to stronger results for the quarter as SAAS [Specialty and Ancillary Services] operating income increased 6% to 15.1 million.</p>
          <p>Our integrated PBM and specialty platform enhances cost effective single source solutions for our clients and it's beginning to drive stronger specialty growth and profits.  EBITDA was up 15% from last year and EBITDA per adjusted claim of $2.87, up 16% over last year.</p>
          <p>Early in the quarter we decided to halt our share repurchase program in order to build liquidity for what we felt at that time was a deteriorating credit market.  As a result, we ended the quarter with 274 million of cash and short term investments while paying down our debt balance by 60 million and completing the purchase of MSC [Medical Services Company] for 247 million in cash.</p>
          <p>As a result of this quarter's strong performance we are again increasing our guidance for 2008.  EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.10.  EBITDA per adjusted claim is expected to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.80 and we still expect adjusted scripts to be approximately flat with 2007.  While we delivered another good quarter, I'm sure you're interested in our 2009 guidance, so let me move on to that.</p>
          <p>For 2009 we expect diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $3.63 to $3.73.  Our outlook for 2009 continues our history of improving profitability by lowering costs for our clients as a result of higher generic utilization, lower drug procurement and network cost, increased home delivery penetration, and improved specialty performance.  We had a good selling season in 2008 with more than 95% of our EBIT retained or renewed for 2009.</p>
          <p>However, we are expecting the tough economic times to continue and as a result we expect utilization at existing clients to remain at current levels, which are below the historical average of 3 to 5%.  This low utilization in combination with the recent loss of a mail-only client, results in our forecast that claims will be down 2 to 3% in 2009.</p>
          <p>That said, the tough economy is also creating a catalyst for our consumerology efforts as consumers and plan sponsors seek lower-cost drugs, networks and channels, creating value for us as we save them money.</p>
          <p>Finally, although we do not provide quarterly guidance, consistent with prior years, first quarter EPS is expected to be slightly down from Q4 EPS.  SG&amp;A for 2009 is expected to be flat to slightly up as productivity gains are offset by increased investments.  Net interest expense is also expected to be approximately flat as higher interest rates are offset by lower debt levels.  And for the year EBITDA per adjusted script is expected to grow to $3.15 to $3.25.  We look forward to delivering another year of savings for our clients and earnings growth for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to George.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everyone.  The recent turbulence in the financial markets and the impact to the overall economic environment has been unprecedented.  In the first couple of months we talked with many of our clients and prospects in each of our market segments and we've learned that our plan sponsors need our approach to pharmacy benefit management now more than ever.  They need out help to drive out waste through the greater use of generics and low cost preferred brands.  They need our help to drive home delivery that's not just because of the enhanced economics, but because that's where we can best manage drug mix, therapy adherence and dispensing accuracy.  They require outstanding service, and our commitment to excellence in this area has not gone unnoticed.</p>
          <p>J.D. Power and Associates ranked home delivery from Express Scripts pharmacies second in customer satisfaction, surpassing our two largest PBM competitors. And more than ever, plan sponsors want satisfied members that are engaged and active about the decisions they're making in the pharmacy benefit.</p>
          <p>These are the reasons why our behavior-centric consumer platform is gaining so much traction with our plan sponsors.  Our clients agree that it's necessary to understand the behavioral science behind what works and what doesn't work in promoting better management of the pharmacy benefit.</p>
          <p>In partnership with our independent blue ribbon panel of experts, we're developing and deploying scientifically proven tools to bring about positive behavior changes at the level of the individual.  Our initiatives are on track, and I feel strongly that this strategy will be a key differentiator in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>We've had great energy around this initiative from our clients, as Jeff has mentioned.  We've seen aggressive demand for our involvement in several of our pilot programs.  These pilot programs are designed to achieve better pharmacy benefit management in several key areas.</p>
          <p>First, to facilitate a better understanding of member behavior we have our members in five distinct segments, and we have been testing the effectiveness of segment specific messaging across multiple channels.  Second, we have targeted improved therapy adherence in key disease classes including diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular and hypertension.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have developed innovative tools designed to drive the greater use of our cost effective home delivery services. We have rolled out plans which we believe will drive mail to mandatory like levels while maintaining member choice.  Early results from these pilots are promising and we plan to roll out additional programs effective 1/1/09.</p>
          <p>So as we look to the overall economic environment, we see a lot of opportunity.  Although we expect to see lower utilization next year than we have normally seen, the environment has made our services more important than ever in helping to eliminate waste and preserve the pharmacy benefit.  For example, while utilization has been lower in 2008, that trend is driven by a decrease in high cost non-preferred brands, while generic utilization continues to climb.  With the increased use of generics, average member co-pays have decreased by 2.3% this year to just under $13 per prescription.</p>
          <p>As plan sponsors and their members look for cost savings in this economic environment, consumerology is providing the right tools at the right time.  Even though we recently lost a large mail-only client and are experiencing the run-off of low margin claims, we partially offset that loss by the addition of fully integrated clients that will add significant value.  Our new consumer platform has been a contributing factor in these key wins.</p>
          <p>This year we have won 226 new accounts covering over 1.4 million lives.  We are excited about this highly behavior-centric approach of consumerology, our position in the PBM industry and the opportunity to deliver value to our clients and stockholders in the future.</p>
          <p>That concludes our prepared remarks and now we will be happy to answer any questions.  Operator?</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi I thanks very much.  Jeff, a question about your additional detail around your guidance for next year, what sort of a share buyback are you assuming behind the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, we don't like to specifically guide for share guidance &#x2013; for share buybacks but you know certainly within the guidance is the average buyback that we would see in a year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then, George, can you give us an update on as you discuss with your clients about plans for next year, is the uptake changing at all for the idea of restricted pharmacy networks and any additional comments on how the integrated retail PBM model is being accepted in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would tell you that clients now are face with significant demand.  We've seen over the last year even going up to the more recent downturn in the market through the first and second quarter, that clients were concerned about the economic environment in which they were operating whether it be a US company trying to compete globally or just trying to deal with the rising costs of healthcare in their financials.  And clients are &#x2013; need answers.  Obviously, the better answers we can provide that cause the least levels of disruption are the best answers for our clients.</p>
          <p>We work hard on several fronts, our sales and account management team, work hard to provide alternatives and answers for our clients in order to drive down costs and our product development people work hard so that when those choices are made that they can do it in a way that minimizes disruptions.</p>
          <p>With respect to narrowing networks, I would tell you as we go in into 2009, everything is on the table whether it's trying to drive mail order to generate the higher savings that we've seen mail order be able to provide, that's certainly something that clients are looking towards; generics never go out of vogue and those are very important measures as well; specialty pharmacy, taking care of those high cost patients are extremely important; and clearly from a pure network perspective, certain retailers aren't going to be competitive or they are not going to try to provide the incentives.  Why should a plan be willing to cover a network when the goods that they sell are being covered by every other pharmacy out there?  So I think that plans will be looking to figure out ways to drive down costs and optimize their savings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Kemp Doliver from Cowen and Company.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks.  This year looks like generic mix is going to be up around 300 basis points.  What kind of increase do you have embedded in the 2009 guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't like to get into those levels of specifics.  But if you just do the pure math, you're in the right range of what happens on conversions as generics go &#x2013; lose their &#x2013; as brands lose their patents. But I'll tell you, to us, if that's all we get &#x2013; if all we do is get the conversions from pure patent expiration, then we don't feel like we've done our job.</p>
          <p>Our job is to maximize and therapeutic interchange where appropriate, never putting a patient at risk and never compromising health outcomes and so that is our focus, is account management with our clinical pharmacists are in the field visiting with their clients and giving them, again, that whole list of opportunities.</p>
          <p>We sit down with our clients, our larger clients on a quarterly basis, some on a less frequent basis, but we actually take them through where their current trends are an what are the key levers they can pull in order to drive down their costs and many &#x2013; often those are by putting in step therapy programs, prior authorization programs and other opportunities to try to enforce those therapeutic interchanges to take advantage of the generics. So I would tell you that as you look at our guidance ranges to the extent that we're better and we can drive those generic rates higher, then that gives us an opportunity to go to the higher end of the ranges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great and my follow-up relates to the specialty business. That had been glitch prone for a while last year and at beginning of this year and you know for the last six months it seems to be on steadier footing. What do you anticipate for that business next year, particularly say uptake both inside &#x2013; in the client base and then with external clients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said on past calls, one of the revelations or interesting learnings for me over the last three to four years as we've been getting bigger in this space is the amount of time it takes for product to come to market. So there is always that issue. At the best, some of these products get tied up for quite awhile as they work their way through. We expect to see continued improvement in that segment as we continue to see specialty again with this tough economic times helping control the cost of these patients, those high cost patients is extremely important and it's a different model, as you know, from just a pure PBM here.</p>
          <p>It's really helping people navigate the myriad of prior authorization insurance programs that they have to work their way through just to get access to the drugs and helping those members stay on therapy. It's a very time-consuming, high-touch model and we don't want to get into segment specific guidance but I will tell you we expect that segment to continue to growth and us to continued to make sure we get our share of all the new products that are coming to market and we're excited about the space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Charles Boorady from Citi.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.  Can you tell us the mix of business between employers and health plan customers and is one more likely than the other to adopt some of your consumerology initiatives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a great question.  The managed care side of our business has held around 40% over the years.  And it's slightly &#x2013; probably be slightly down from that just because of the large losses we had in the mail-only client, but it should be in those ranges.  The &#x2013; it really is a bit of a mixed bag, because if it's a Medicaid type plan, then clearly those are going to be heavily favored towards retail.  Often the membership is transient in nature, so mail order isn't going to be as big of a pull through.  There is often mandatory generics in those programs.</p>
          <p>So, yeah, those mixes &#x2013; the mix of the type of client has an impact, because for many health plans though that are trying to compete in just the commercial marketplace.  We feel that when we do service our clients best, we allow our managed care providers to grow and we grow with their growth.  And that's why we've always taken the position we don't want to compete directly with those clients. That's why we weren't in the Medicare Part D space as a direct provider.</p>
          <p>And so we want to work through those &#x2013; our clients in order to help them grow.  So, if they are in the commercial marketplace competing in the commercial space, then yes, they are going to be more likely to buy-in, will very likely to buy into the generic programs, the step therapy programs and we have seen a much more aggressive approach towards mail in many of those plans as they see the savings that can be gained as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  And as you went through the selling season which was the first selling season post having a full year the combined CVS Caremark and they had their chance to make their pitch to customers, did you notice a change in what your customers were asking for in RFPs for example to do mail order to a retail location instead of to the home or anything else that was really different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I mean, clearly the CVS-Caremark approach and, you know, Tom Ryan is better to talk about this than I am, but I would tell you that they've got a distinct message in the marketplace and if you like that message, then you'll become their client. I think the whole idea of what they do has &#x2013; may have merit for certain clients. I think the real differentiator in space; we don't sell to consumers, we sell to businesses and businesses care about results.  And the real differentiation ultimately comes down to the bottom-line.</p>
          <p>So messaging, yeah, that gets you in the door, it has a little sizzle to it, it sounds great but the whole idea is what are you doing to the bottom line.  And for us we talk a lot about consumerology. Consumerology only matters if we drive generics, we drive low cost brands and we drive higher mail penetration and we also drive therapy adherence.  So if we do those things by communicating with those members each and every time, then our numbers speak for themselves.  So whether it's Medco's program or whether it's Caremark's program, everybody has got their own little schtick, but at the end of the day what really matters is results.  And we are very proud of the results we put in front of our clients each and every day and as we try to drive costs down. I think our leading generic fill rate is evidence of our commitment to driving customer costs down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Just to be clear, sounds like you're really differentiating us versus them.  Are there things that the customers like that they do that you can offer to do for your customers or are you sticking to our way or their way in the RFP approach?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think it's a &#x2013; if it's our way no way, then I think we lose business.  I think there are certain things we won't compromise.  We don't want to &#x2013; we'll never push brands ahead of generics.  We won't do certain things that we don't feel fits in our model.  But as far as using retail outlets to deliver mail-order scripts, yeah we can do that.  We've got clients, I'm sorry retailers that are willing to work with us.  We've got options that will allow us to address the marketplace in other ways.  I don't think it's ever our way or the highway or we'll find the highway.  So, we've got to be able to meet the market demands.</p>
          <p>I will tell you quite honestly though, I don't know that plan sponsors, we're talking about the people that are making the buying decisions.  What we've seen over the last three to four years is more of those buying decisions could be heavily influenced, if not totally influenced, by the purchasing department of big corporations.  And that takes a lot of the sizzle away and that's why I come back to it has to be about results.  You've got to be able to show you can drive generics, you can drive mail, you can drive PMPM cost down.  If you can do that, then you can win.</p>
          <p>And so I don't know that most purchasing managers, I don't believe that most purchasing managers are wed to any particular pharmacy.  We've got over 60,000 pharmacies in the United States.  So, if you're trying to promote one pharmacy over another the way you have to promote them is they have to be low cost, and they have to have quality, and they have to have accuracy, and they've got to comply with the different programs in the contract.  And if they do those things and they are a good contract, they are a good pharmacy for us to have, if they don't, then it doesn't work.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, George or Jeff, can you give us a sense of MSC's contribution in the quarter, if any, and just any anecdotal data on its selling season or future prospects, kind of where is that going to show up in the income statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  So, MSC is going to roll up into the core PBM segment for us.  It's in line with the rest of our workers comp business.  We don't break it out separately, but I'm happy to say we've now been through a big chunk of the integration and no surprises.  Integration is on track and it's meeting our expectations.  What we said was we expected it to be flat to slightly accretive in the first full year and we're certainly on track for that today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a selling season for that business or is it just opportunistic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is a year-round selling season for that business and it's certainly going well.  We're happy with our progress in that space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Robert, there is a interesting side here, in that workers comp is, as you know, is a growing concern for many, many employers.  What you've seen is the opportunity to cross-sell into some of our larger plans; we can also help them with their workers comp issues.  The HR department, often rightfully so, is worried about employee drug costs, and what's taking place here, but workers comp is becoming a larger and larger share of overall cost.  And so, we have a solution for that, a very strong solution.  And so that's also getting some uptick.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I ask, just with the cash you're going to generate over the next five years, you can probably do three or four MSCs a year and still not get it all deployed.  I don't expect that but that I guess is the magnitude of it, I mean, isn't the risk here, George, that you just can't earn a return as good as what you are currently seeing on any of the new cash that you do put to work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take a stab at this and I'll let Jeff speak to it.  But I think my shareholders pay me and my management team to make sure we deploy that capital in wise ways and maintain our returns.  I am, I don't fear for diminishing returns because of excess capital.  I think we can deploy them in a lot of different ways.  I think our job, especially when you look at the returns we've achieved over the last several years, is not to go off and just do something dumb to show growth.  We have to deploy the capital returns better than we would otherwise see by reinvesting the money or buying back our shares.  So that remains our key focus and we will continue down that path.</p>
          <p>We tried as you know, Robert, as we have done many acquisitions over the years to be very opportunistic in the marketplace and try to take care of inefficiencies that exist either with specific companies or in the market at large and that will remain our focus.  So we will continue to keep our focus of trying to grow ROIC.  As you know, as you've followed us for a lot of years, we are totally driven on ROIC.  I think the most important thing or one of the most important things a management team can do, is show that they are good stewards of the cash that they create and so to get there you had to create cash.  And I think you've got to be disciplined around earnings, you have to be disciplined around service and you have to be disciplined around continuing to focus on your core business.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree with all of that George.  I guess if I look at a year such as this where the Willoughby personal account has taken quite hit.  I'm wondering how you get away from offering a dividend that &#x2013; which may be the only return you might see in stocks this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that the way we've deployed our capital and therefore the returns that have been realized by our shareholders exceeds a dividend that we could put on top of the stock.  So we are not against anything at some point down in the future if that's the best answer but I don't feel any pressure.  I think obviously this last several months has been somewhat &#x2013; well, it's been terrible just to say it quite frankly, but that &#x2013; I like to believe if we continue to deliver 25% growth rate to the future, that's a pretty good deployment of capital and I think we are focused on that and we won't take anything off the table.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, George just a quick question on the pricing environment I mean we talked a lot about some of the contracts that have been moving around.  I'm not sure if you specifically mentioned who that mail order client you lost was but that would be helpful.  And I'm really more just kind of curious listening to Jeff's guidance on 2009, you're forecasting another 16% increase in EBITDA per adjusted script, maybe if you could just give us a sense for kind of what's going on in terms of pricing in the marketplace that would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, let me just discuss the client situation and then I'll turn it over to Jeff.  Our goal &#x2013; first of all, we would take on any business that we believe adds to our business model.  The hardest part is when it's mail-only sometimes we've got to make sure we are aligned with that client that's going to have a similar formulary and the same type of approaches to the market we have so that we actually get leverage out of the situation &#x2013; when it's just put in bottles and bottles in bags, we are not real excited about that if all we are going to do is get a small fee unless it really does help us promote our model and gains better economics for both us and that client.</p>
          <p>The situation in hand was one that we didn't feel was doing that for us and I am not going to mentions names. We've been at this for &#x2013; since 1992 and we try not to talk about client specific situations. That's not fair to the client that's made their own decisions and it's not a place I'm willing to go. But anyway, I think we are on right track for what we do. Jeff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah overall on pricing, this has been a competitive environment for many years and so we haven't really seen a significant change to the historical pricing environment. What I'd say overall to this is as long as we keep delivering value to our clients, they are going to keep paying us to deliver that value. I think the bottom line is we've got a year where again we're going to grow EBITDA per script at 16% and gross margin and gross profit is growing inside of that so we're happy with how we're getting paid for the value we're delivering at this point</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at it, let's say EBITDA per script is $3, I don't know, pick a number, by the time you apply D&amp;A and taxes to that, you're down to less than $1.50 and with interest, capital charges, everything else. So that's what we're charging to do all the things we do: drive generic fill rates to the highest level, take people and understand the right mix between mail and generics, it seems like the number is going up and it might seem like it's going up at a pretty fast clip. The realty is it's a pretty small price to pay for all the value we add to the equation. Go to the other side. What do the retailers make per prescription and what value do they actually deliver at the end of the day when it's more of a commoditized business? I think there when you are putting pills in bottles, anybody can put the pill in the bottle and so I believe the value we add into the equation really does pay for itself, and as Jeff says, as long as we continue that trend, as long as we continue to drive savings, clients are willing to pay us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks and good morning.  Just a quick clarification on the guidance and a question for you, George. Just, Jeff, on scripts you're saying down 2 to 3% which seems logical. Are you breaking that down between mail and retail at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, we're not breaking it down between mail and retail but what I'll tell you is mail is a key focus area for us and with everything we're seeing in consumerology, the uptake, the way the economy's going we expect to be able to grow mail but we're not breaking it down inside of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just I would assume cash flow from Ops for '09 if I'm using 1.2 billion, is that in the right ballpark or are you more specific at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not more specific at this point but given our guidance, I think it would &#x2013; I don't think it's going to be down year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right and then I would assume D&amp;A would be flat to slightly up so I guess &#x2013; I'm curious, it seems to me the interest guidance of being flat at say 70 is a little conservative given what seems to be free cash flow generation of over $1 billion. Is that just being conservative on rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think as we look at it, what we did for rates is we assumed the forward LIBOR curve because we are 100% floating at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  All right, George I guess just follow-up on the business model. I know you talked about sort of a longer period of time the model is kind of 3 to 6% script growth, 10 to 12% EBITDA per script growth per year and then sort of 4 to 6% capital structure. Obviously '09 you don't have the scripts so as you talked about your EBITDA per adjusted script goes up. Do you think of this as &#x2013; is that sort of business model still intact over say, the next five years, as you think about it?  And just to follow up with that, you guys have been excellent in your capital efficiency. Is there any reason to think that this business model is going to be any more capital intensive here in the next five years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, those are some really good questions.  I will tell you, we do &#x2013; our goal as a corporation is to grow script count and that will remain a focus of ours. Ed Ignaczak and his team are very focused first and foremost on retaining our current clients and helping them to meet the needs that they are faced with.  And then secondly being a presence in the marketplace and winning our share of the business.</p>
          <p>As you know, over the last several years, we've had some pretty large accounts that weren't providing much value to the bottom-line and that's getting to be a little bit of an old story quite honestly, but quite good.  But at the end of the day, we've had to work those off and as those have worked off, it's caused us not to be able to gain overall volume.  Having said that, we see the effect on EBITDA per script because I think what we've done is we've realigned our book to get clients that really do have a common interest with us, that is driving the generics, driving the mail, being progressive, using the step therapy programs and so the clients that we now have I think are fitting better. Longer term, I do believe we have to show you that the Rx growth, so that will remain a focus of ours.</p>
          <p>As far as capital intensity, the base business if you change no other variables, the cash intensity would not change.  But however as we grow mail, as you know there you have to buy the inventory, you have to have the inventory in house before you can mail out the script.  So that does have a little bit of a drag on capital as we grow mail order utilization but not to a huge degree.  But just to make sure you keep that point in mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then finally you know as you look out to sort of 2009 in a new administration etcetera, etcetera.  What's the biggest concern you have with running the business and do you feel like there is some obvious misunderstanding in the marketplace given your clear value proposition as you think about '09 and a new administration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really would hate to see my personal taxes go up.  But I'm not sure that's the purpose of the question.  I'll tell you that I think that the new administration is going to be exceptionally challenged.  I think that there is awful lot of speeches going on about solving healthcare.  So what?  I mean like you look at that all these plans and there are a lot of words there but I don't see a whole lot of meat on the bones and I think that the reality is there is not going to be a whole lot of money around.  We've got to &#x2013; we just, we're bailing out the banking system, rightfully so, but that's $1 trillion!  And then on top of that we've got to deal with this recessionary environment we're in.</p>
          <p>I just don't &#x2013; I think it's a tragedy, quite honestly, that so many children in the United States do not have coverage.  We as a country have to solve that problem.  Quite honestly we've got a lot of different issues though as we, you know, our military has to be supported, we've got to figure out what we're going to do in many different aspects of the economy and in the global environment.  I just &#x2013; I think that at least for the first several years of any administration healthcare can't be or won't be &#x2013; and there's going to be a lot of conversion but trying to fix it, that costs money and it's going to be extremely difficult.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen.  So sort of, on the heels of Larry's question about the next administration, there were some finalized e-Prescribing laws that came out yesterday from CMS.  How are you still sort of thinking about this opportunity and it eventually being a potential positive catalyst for your business and is there anything else sort of being discussed in the political arena that might also be something also of a positive? Maybe it's around biosimilars or something of the like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great.  And I probably really did shortchange Larry's question.  I really appreciate you bringing that up.  You're absolutely right.  Our e-prescribing situation is gaining greater and greater clarity and the savings and the accuracy that's attributable to e-prescribing speaks for itself, and I think that that is something that Congress will in fact continue to promote and &#x2013; well, they've already promoted through the bills.  But we will see further advancements in this space and we are excited about this.</p>
          <p>I think that at the end of the day, and I said this on several occasions, but if you look at the amount of money we spend in order to try to advance our programs: first you've got to get the client to buy in, then you've got to get the member to buy in, then you actually have to make it work, you've got to get a hold of the doctor.  If we can get more of that done through e-prescribing and get those members on the right medications the first time and keep them there, then we now have an annuity.  That annuity for us is worth a lot of money. So we spend lot of time and effort with individuals and people and technology to make this happen.  If we can get that into the hands of the doctor to work, it's huge.  It is very big for our industry and for the population at large &#x2013; it takes a lot of cost out of the equation probably &#x2013; it's costs that aren't good costs. If we end up with better outcomes at a lower price, that truly is advancement.  So, that's a very positive good thing.</p>
          <p>And the same thing with biosimilars. Although those bills have &#x2013; haven't come into existence yet, there's  been an awful lot of work; our Dr. Miller spends a lot of his time in Washington with different members of each house of Congress trying to promote that. I think that that is something that is gaining a tremendous amount of traction.  We'll continue to push for those bills and I think you will see that as well is both a big, big savings for the federal government, as they provide 50% of all the prescriptions in the United States, as well as for the commercial population.  So, we're excited about both of those aspects.  So that was a great question.  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also there was a lot of noise made this quarter around the new announcement from Wal-Mart, and it's probably gotten too much consideration relative to its importance, but I'm curious to hear if you think this is something similar to what noise was created a few years ago or do you think there is something actually to be gained from this in that they're going to make an increasing presence in sort of a market that they haven't had as much share in historically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's take a step back first of all.  A couple of years ago when all this stuff started and our PBM stocks were getting rocked because everybody thought that this was going to be a huge impact on our business, I was on the podium telling people I kind of like the idea. The whole idea of somebody of Wal-Mart's caliber and size talking about generics makes it easier for our plan sponsors to accept; and at the end of the day, generics are the biggest savings opportunities out there.  So, their promotion of generics is a good thing for our industry.</p>
          <p>As far as &#x2013; they are picking, quite frankly, the cheaper drugs and it's a fairly limited list and they are, I think going from 30 days to 90 days is probably a smart move on their part because that's probably the only way that I can see they can get to profitability on the program.  But it is what it is. I think that the reality though is, as you know, is that a lot of people want to get their prescriptions at their local drugstores or at their local supermarkets and some take advantage of the Wal-Mart situation.  I don't see this as a major problem to the PBM industry. I think the notoriety and the discussion on generics is always a good thing and we're a big promoter of that.  So we welcome that &#x2013; their aggression in this area.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci from Merrill Lynch.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.  Couple of questions; first I think just going back to your prepared remarks, you mentioned a goal of having 40% mail penetration or so in the future. Did you give a timeframe for that? And curious is there any limitation within sort of the customer mix that would either help you get there or limit you from getting there the way it is today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a good question.  We were looking out to 40% over the next two to three years, and I would tell you that there are limitations to that. Clearly, as I mentioned in my earlier comment, Medicaid clients, that's a pretty transient population and that probably is not going to be and won't be a heavy mail user. A lot of generics, mostly through the local drugstores since they don't pay &#x2013; or they pay a very small co-pay, there is not a lot of economic advantage in trying to drive mail in that population.  So that will always be a bit of the smaller.</p>
          <p>As you probably know, a lot of the large employer groups, big employers with large populations of employees, mail is a very good answer, because it does offer the convenience of the drugs being delivered to your home, and the cost savings for the employer and the employee.  So, that is &#x2013; there you can see 60, 65% mail penetration.  So the 40% we came up with was by looking at that mix. It's an aggressive target to be honest with you.  But we like aggressive targets at Express Scripts, and we think the savings to be had by our plan sponsors and our members is so big that it's a worthwhile goal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just looking at the '09 expectations, obviously generics are a driver of growth.  Can you tell us some of the other key variables in your view that get you that EBITDA per equivalent script growth up into the mid-teens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's the same things it has always been.  We continue to grow the generic fill rate, we continue to drive the home delivery penetration rate, operations team continues to drive efficiencies, we're driving efficiencies through SG&amp;A, in this case offset by some interesting growth things we're investing in.  It's constant re-negotiation with our network suppliers, constant re-negotiation with our drug suppliers.  It's basically the whole executive team here constantly focused on driving more profitability and driving more cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is specialty particularly important in the upcoming year, sort of given the turnaround that would be going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Specialty is a smaller part of our business, so it has a smaller impact, but specialty is clearly an important focus for us. I said it last quarter, I am still saying it.  I see specialty as a kind of stairway, right? We keep taking one step at a time.  We got the right team in place.  We cleaned it up.  We've started to integrate it with the core PBM where it makes sense.  We are working on strategy and as a result we are seeing the profitability step up, step up, step up, and that step &#x2013; those steps are just going to keep moving forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On some of the new generics next year, brands going off patent, I think are maybe second quarter and some may have exclusivity periods, some of the bigger ones.  So I know you won't give quarterly guidance but is there any relative growth expectations that we should have as we think about either the first half or second half of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean that's all included in our guidance as we look at &#x2013; we do very detailed models on when we think generics are going to hit and when they may or may not have exclusivity.  As George said earlier that's the baseline. Then we go out and beat those numbers by driving even higher generic fill rates through those numbers.  So everything that's out there we believe is in our guidance right now for next year and I did say in guidance per the normal pattern, we would expect Q1 to be down from Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But nothing particularly different about first half or second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then one final one if I could, on the selling season I think you mentioned winning almost 1.5 million lives but we do have the scripts being down 2 or 3%.  I guess the economy or you said the current trends you would expect to continue. So what's your baseline there for &#x2013; would it be like maybe 1% growth on volume and then the next selling season would get you down another 3 or 4% from there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't really want to get into that level of specificity.  I think we budget client-by-client and every client is different.  Some clients are doing layoffs and other clients are holding their own and so we go through, we get a pulse by, our sales and account management team sit down with each of their counterparts with each of the employers and health plans and get their best guesses as to what's going to happen over the next year.  It's important for us to be part of that process and then we budget client-by-client by looking at those specifics.</p>
          <p>As we said earlier trends are down, they are down below anything I have ever seen in my, since I've been in this industry, but we factored all that into our guidance. As I said in my comments though, the trend is deceiving because if what the trend is doing is putting extra economic pressure on top of the consumers and with our consumerology approach, the consumer doesn't necessarily want to go without their hypertensive drugs, or their cholesterol, their statins or their diabetes products, but they now need to look at ways to save money. So to the extent that we can roll out mail order and generics, then those are good solutions for those members.  And so, for moving people from third tier products into second tier product or into generics even though the trend may be down, profitability is up and that's an important combination.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, just a couple of follow-ups I guess on these questions about the economy.  You guys have been around for a while and seen, I guess, a couple of the recent recessions. Maybe those weren't as bad as what we are facing now, but are you thinking utilization declines more this time around, maybe because of more cost sharing?  And then second question I agree this Wal-Mart generic program really hasn't had much of an impact on you guys, but yesterday CVS announced something a little bit similar and then if I put that together with maybe a little more sensitivity to the price of drugs from consumers in 09', is it possible the impact could be a little bit greater in '09 and '10 than it has been over the last couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, as far as the economic situation, we have &#x2013; I personally went through interest rate escalations and internet bubbles popping and all kinds of other situations and, yeah, I would tell you that we've never budgeted utilization declines as we've seen this year.  But it's all in our numbers; it's in the guidance we've given.  And so, I would tell you yeah, this is a very tough economy.</p>
          <p>Again, I do believe that whatever the situation is, there is always opportunity for those companies that are smart and aggressive and we try to consider ourselves at least aggressive.  So, we go after those opportunities and try to make sure that we take advantage of those situations. And I think at the end of the day if we're providing those answers for our clients we will continue to do well and we bake that into our guidance.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Wal-Mart situation, at the end of the day we're talking about the lower cost drugs.  So, I don't &#x2013; we take a look at this all the time.  As you know Susan Lang is the head of our supply chain area and she actually monitors what's taking place with respect to all the different products in our book of business, whether it's third-tier brands, second-tier brands or generics.  And she also monitors it by retail drugstore chain.  So, we're looking as these programs go out, we're seeing what's happening at Wal-Mart, we're seeing what's happening at the other drug stores.  And clearly, there has been some shift from some of the other retailers to Wal-Mart when these things come in.</p>
          <p>But the 90-days thing, to the extent it's going towards people that don't have money, there has been a lot f studies and you're more than welcome to go take a look but there is a lot of studies out there that people will actually overpay and pay a lot more to be out less cash because, if you don't have cash and you can put out $4 versus $9, you may have 4, you may not have 9, and even though the 9's a much better economic deal, if you are living check-to-check that's not necessarily a good answer for you.  And so we measure all that. We monitor it. We look at it and keep in mind if you are talking $9 at Wal-Mart now for a 90 day supply of generics, that's not much off of what a plan sponsored member pays anyway for their generics.  So and then you get the advantage of getting it delivered to your home.  So I don't &#x2013; we don't see the big impact on our book of business, but we are certainly out there monitoring it.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think of the CVS 90 day generic program as something similar to Wal-Mart or could that be a different ball game?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that most people are trying to &#x2013; most retailers are trying to respond to the Wal-Mart situation because I think they have seen some erosion in their books over to the Wal-Mart Pharmacy.  And so they have got to step up and do what they have to do.  I think Ed Ignaczak in front of our clients through our plan sponsors &#x2013; I mean through our account managers and our sales people are pinging the market and understanding what's important. Susan Lang, as I said earlier, is certainly looking at what's happening in those trends and trying to figure out how best to put together products to meet the needs of our clients.  And so I think we are all focused on the right things and driving the right values.</p>
          <p>As far as CVS Caremark in particular I think it's a good company and its well run and I think if you want specifics about their situation, you ought to ask Tom.  I think he is better equipped to speak about it.  I don't &#x2013; in our book of business, I think people get mail order because it's delivered to their home and it's a good alternative. Whether it needs to be another alternative either because the individual doesn't live in a safe neighborhood or there is other problems, we can make arrangements to have those drugs delivered to the work or any other address they would like.  So a lot of this stuff isn't all that new, but it's certainly not a focus of ours in this regard, I don't see it as a huge driver for our book of business.</p>

          <p>I appreciate everybody getting on our call this morning and asking the questions and taking interest in Express Scripts.  I know the last several months have not been a lot of fun, but having said all that I really do believe our company is very uniquely positioned to continue to add value to our clients and our members and we will continue to drive the waste out of healthcare and that waste as we take that waste out it creates greater value for our clients and members.  So thank you all so much for your attention this morning and participation and have a great day.</p>
