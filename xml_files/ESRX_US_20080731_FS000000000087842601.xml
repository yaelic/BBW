          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>And with that being said, I would now like to introduce your opening speaker for today, Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Myers. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome everyone to our 2008 second quarter conference call. With me today are George Paz, our Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Hall, our CFO.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to read the following statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking and may include, but are not necessarily limited to, financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC.</p>
          <p>In addition, the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income and to net cash provided by operating activities can be found in our earnings release, which is posted on our web site.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Jeff to discuss our second quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. As I'm sure most of you already know from our press release and quarterly filings, Q2 was another strong quarter for Express Scripts. For the past few months, we've been telling you about how we're taking our business model of alignment to the next level of consumerology. Consumerology is the application of human behavior theory and behavioral economics to the pharmacy benefits. It's rooted in the clear success that we've enjoyed saving money for our clients by driving unprecedented market share shift from high cost products to lower cost generic and formulary brands.</p>
          <p>One of the key pillars of consumerology is that when it comes to effective interactions with members, one size does not fit all. As a result, by using technology to tailor our all offerings and interactions to each individual, we believe we will be able to increase therapy adherence and lower cost of care, delivering lower cost and better health outcomes to our client.</p>
          <p>Although we're still early in the rollout of these tools and programs and there is still a lot of hard work to do, I'm happy to say that the initial results are positive. Many of our clients are exited about using these tools and we have several pilot programs already in place. These pilot programs are already saving money for our clients by increasing generic fill rate, therapy adherence and home delivery penetration. This performance helped drive our overall generic fill rate in the quarter to 65.9%, up 4.8% percentage points from last year. We are also seeing strong interest in consumerology from new clients, and we have won many new accounts on the basis of the cost savings we can deliver for them and our model of alignment.</p>
          <p>In keeping with this model of alignment, that is, we make money when our clients save money, the cost savings our clients realize have also benefited us. Gross margin grew 10.7% or 504 million up 15% from last year in the quarter.</p>
          <p>EBITDA was 341.9 million, up 18% from the prior year. EBITDA per adjusted scripts was $2.57 up 17% from the prior year and earnings per share was $0.76, a 33% increase over $0.57 last year. As a result of the strong initial returns from our investments in consumerology, we have decided to accelerate our efforts and increase funding levels for these initiatives over the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>Moving on to cash flow. Cash from operations were 234.5 million in the quarter compared to 96.4 million last year as a result of our focus on driving cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow was 482.8 million or 73% of EBITDA. This strong cash flow allowed us to increase other purchases in the quarter and complete the acquisition of MSC while slightly reducing our debt levels.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares for a total of $373 million. And as a result of the confidence in our business model and our future performance, our Board authorized an increase in our share repurchase program by 15 million shares. We now have 21 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our guidance for the year. As a result of our strong performance and initial returns from our consumerology efforts, we are increasing our 2008 guidance for EPS, EBITDA per adjusted claim and cash flow.</p>
          <p>EPS for the year is expected to be $3.03 to $3.10. The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 29% over last year's EPS from continuing operations of $2.38. This guidance includes the MSC acquisition, which we expect to be neutral to EPS for the year. EBITDA per adjusted claim for 2008 is now expected to be between $2.65 and $2.75, and our estimate for cash flow from operations is 1 billion to 1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Before I turn it over to George, let me give you a few more items you should consider when modeling the rest of the year. Our forecast for claims for 2008 remains unchanged. We still expect that total adjusted claims for 2008 will be flat to slightly up compared to last year. And while adjusted claims were up 1% year-to-date, we expect retail claims in the second half to be approximately 2% below the same period in 2007, reflecting the mid year roll-off of lower margin claims we discussed with you last quarter and increased mail penetration. Home delivery claims for the second half of 2008 should be slightly above the second half of 2007.</p>
          <p>Last quarter we told you that we expect that SG&amp;A expenses for the remaining quarters in 2008 would remain approximately flat with Q2. The increase in SG&amp;A in Q3 was mainly the result of higher management incentive compensation, which is tied to corporate financial results.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect SG&amp;A to be down slightly in Q3 and trend up slightly in Q4 following the historical seasonality as we integrate MSC, accelerate investments in consumerology and prepare to bring on new clients in 2009.</p>
          <p>And as I told you last quarter, our best uses of cash are investing in internal growth platforms and good accretive acquisitions. Our investments in consumerology and the acquisition of MSC are good examples of how we are executing to this plan, and going forward we will continue to look for ways to invest and grow the company.</p>
          <p>Net interest expense for the quarter was 13.7 million and was below last quarter's guidance due to lower interest rates. Going forward, we expect that net interest costs will increase to approximately 15 million in Q3 and Q4, reflecting lower levels of cash due to the MSC acquisition and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>And at this point, I'll turn the call over to George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff and good morning everyone. Our last 30 days have been outstanding. During this period, we have renewed the DoD contract, our largest single client. We put the New York litigation behind us, and last night we released record earnings. Also importantly last night, in our lead ERISA class action case, the plaintiff's motion for class certification was denied and our motion for summary judgment was granted for all material issues.</p>
          <p>We remain bullish about our proven business model alignment and our next generation strategic platform of consumerology, a more advanced understanding of consumer behavior. Both of these differentiating qualities will enable better health and value for our clients and their members.</p>
          <p>Last quarter on our call, we focused on the rollout of our new strategic platform. This quarter, I want to share some of the feedback and broad applications of our offerings. Along with members of my senior staff, I have personally been in front of some of the nation's largest managed care plans and employers. The understanding that financial incentives and more education has its limits is well understood. In addition, the enthusiasm from plan sponsors around what science has taught us about decision making and behavior and the realization of what that means for healthcare quite frankly has exceeded our expectations.</p>
          <p>So where are we? We have hundreds of thousands of members involved in pilot studies and we continue to document the proof points and institutionalize the capabilities. The application of our learnings are far reaching. We'll begin to apply these strategies to a wide range of activities, including key levers such as generic utilization, the movement to lower cost brands, therapy adherence and greater use of home delivery.</p>
          <p>Our value proposition will be more robust than ever. Winning the DoD confirms our position in the marketplace. Our focus on innovation, execution and member satisfaction when combined with our proven business model alignment results in our strong financial performance. Our beneficiary satisfaction rating of more than 97% is the highest service rating for any contractor servicing the DoD.</p>
          <p>The DoD was an important win for us. First it is a great honor to continue servicing our men and women in uniform to work on their behalf making the use of prescription drugs safer and more affordable.</p>
          <p>Secondly, our new contract expands our relationship with the DoD and now includes specialty pharmacy, including CareLogic, our decease management platform for specialty therapies. The DoD has validated our clinical approach to managing health and value one consumer at a time.</p>
          <p>We are still in the process of working through the selling season. We have fewer clients up for renewal this year, and we're enjoying a strong renewal rate consistent with prior years. As you know, we focus on the middle market as well as the large plan sponsors.</p>
          <p>Since we're in the midst of the middle market selling season, we're not prepared to discuss sales at this time. We'll update you of our sales results when we provide 2009 guidance on our third quarter conference call.</p>
          <p>The uniting of the country's two leading health information networks, RxHub and SureScripts will form a single, secure nationwide network for e-prescribing. This combined network will accelerate the benefits to health plan sponsors and patients. This merger was important as we prepare for the broader adoption of e-prescribing, which continues to gain momentum with the passage of the Medicare Improvement Act and its provisions to drive greater electronic prescribing.</p>
          <p>We believe we are uniquely positioned to utilize the technological innovations that will be generated by e-prescribing. E-prescribing will allow us to take our modeled alignment to the next level. E-prescribing coupled with our concentrated approach with our clients will deliver value through higher mail penetration, formulary compliance and adherence and generic penetration.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the last few weeks we have disposed of a number of legal matters that had been pending for quite some time on terms favorable to the company. Our business model remains strong and the financial impact was immaterial. Just yesterday, we received an important ruling that we are not, in our core business functions, an ERISA fiduciary.</p>
          <p>So we're pleased to be putting these legal distractions behind us, allowing us to focus our full attention on serving our clients and members.</p>
          <p>It is clear our modeled alignment resonates with our plan sponsors as we continue to reduce their drug trends. Of course our model of alignment is important for our stockholders as well. The increased profits generated by our clients' saving activities results in higher cash flow to our stockholders. We're aligned with our stockholders by continuing to focus on our industry leading ROIC. Our focus has been and will continue to be on delivering superior total return to our stockholders by driving higher profitability, cash flow and return on invested capital.</p>
          <p>This concludes our prepared remarks and now we'll be happy to answer any questions. Operator?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much. George, could you give us an update on the SAAS segment and then how you feel about the various aspects of specialty these days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think it's a &#x2013; as we told you over the last several calls, it truly is a focus of ours. Specialty is an important component of our business. And at the end of the day, as you know, there are several components in our reported SAAS segment.</p>
          <p>The one that gets our biggest attention I think, the driver of our future, is our Specialty pharmacy. That business has done well. The acquisition on priority has rounded out our portfolio. And I believe we are as competitive as anyone in the industry, if not more, with respect to Specialty products in meeting the needs and demands of our patients and clients. So we continue to emphasize and focus that area of our business.</p>
          <p>As we said in the past, there's still two other businesses that are combined in that group. One's a distribution business where we provide oncology and other products to doctors' offices, that business is pretty &#x2013; it's got lower margins, higher use of capital. But it's a &#x2013; as a business itself is doing much better now that we've got our &#x2013; some receivable issues under control.</p>
          <p>Likewise, our PAP programs continue to be a bit of an issue for us from a growth perspective. Those businesses are doing fine. I think our pharma company clients are happy with the work we are doing. We like the mission internally because we believe it's important for those individuals who cannot otherwise afford medications to have access to drugs is an incredibly important mission. So it's an important business for us.</p>
          <p>But as you know, with the passage of the Medicare Part D program, that business is running off. And we continue to see more and more people as they turn 65, avail themselves of the Medicare program, that that business is under continuous pressure. The margins in that business are okay, but of course we are faced with the challenge of a declining revenues stream, which makes managing profitability much harder.</p>
          <p>But again, I think that the program on its face is a good program and we are going to continue to administer and just try to monitor it. Overall, I would tell you we are happy with the results we are gaining. We still have a ways to go and we'll absolutely keep you informed on our progress as the quarters unfold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Just one additional question, George. As you look across your membership base and the claims, statistics that you see on a daily basis. Do you, in your opinion, is there &#x2013; are you seeing any impact from the challenging economy on overall utilization or shifting to mail or generics? Any impact there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we see utilization down slightly for the year over what we had originally projected. But I'm not sure &#x2013; our team under Dr. Miller is studying this. And we're trying to get our arms around how much of it may be economy-related versus seasonality with the drugs and flu situation not being as strong as in some other prior years and other situations that are occurring. We haven't seen &#x2013; with a lot of people moving into Medicare Part D and the impact that has on the overall prescribing. We are trying to put all those pieces together. But we feel for the year that utilization will be slightly below what we have normally seen, but we're constantly monitoring it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question is from Charles Boorady with Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. I'm wondering if you could share with us what your customers are experiencing in their drug trend. And the reason I'm asking that is maybe you could also help me understand that you're reporting record profits while health insurers are pointing to higher drug trends as an issue contributing to worse results for them, including on Medicare prescription drug plans, where their loss ratios are significantly higher year-over-year. And so I'm wondering if you can comment on &#x2013; in light of your strong results versus their weak results, is this because you're better at managing drug trend than health plans are with their own internal PBMs? Or are we seeing a reflection of you profiting more at the expensive your health plan and other customers? And to help understand that, if you can share with us what the drug trend is that your customers are seeing, what are they paying for? That would be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, that's a great question. We've been focused on this business since our inception and certainly as a public company in 1992. And our focus has always been on managing drug trends.</p>
          <p>We're extremely proud that many of our clients have had zero to negative trends this year as they've gotten their arms around generic utilization, mail penetration. We've seen some of the best results in our specialty area where we are putting in our disease management programs to really execute on our specialty formularies and formulary execution to drive down overall trend. So those trends have been cut in half. We're seeing across the board zero trend in our book of business for our clients and I think that resonates well.</p>
          <p>Sometimes obviously will have a higher trend, those that still have two tier formularies, those that are not as proactive. But many, many of our clients are availing themselves of our thoughts around consumerology and driving higher generic utilization, step therapy programs and other avenues to control those trends and it's paying dividends.</p>
          <p>I would tell you we are not taking advantage of our clients. In fact with those trend levels, we do make more money obviously because our step therapy programs and our mail penetration programs, our formulated adherence programs are driving better health outcomes while at the same time driving lower cost for our clients and higher profitability for us.</p>
          <p>On your first point, I would tell you, you've been a proponent of, and I believe &#x2013; it is a good answer that the health plan should focus on the medical side. That's where 85 to 90% of the total costs are. And leave the drug trend management to the PBMs.</p>
          <p>And I like the idea of what those clients of ours that are managed care organizations, we work extremely well together and helping them to drive lower and lower trends for their clients. I think managing that overall drug cost is our specialty. We are well equipped to do it. We have people that are 100% focused on it and I think we are the right people to do that. So, I appreciate the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question then comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Congrats, congratulations guys. Hey George, just wondering on this whole consumerism push, it looks very promising. But I just wanted to hear your thoughts on where you think you can eventually take that strategy. I mean, what's the sort of endpoint strategy there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a great question. I'd tell you, it amazes me. I remember when we hired Dr. Miller and he really started digging through our results. I was shocked to see the level of non-compliance by diabetics. The level of non-compliance with people that fill one or two prescriptions with, they're very high potency cholesterol level drugs. I think it's more than just trying to drive earnings results. This is a whole process to drive better health outcomes. As a country, we need to help our patients stay adherent to their medications and get the right treatment.</p>
          <p>It's interesting, about one out of every four or roughly 23, 25% of all prescriptions never even get filled. Sometimes that's not such a bad situation. But often, it's a critically important situation. People go into denial. And the whole idea, if we can track those &#x2013; and that's why e-prescribing actually kicks in &#x2013; if we can actually see those prescriptions being written and then reach out to the member, help them cope with the denial aspect. Nobody wants to be a diabetic or find out that they've got heart disease or whatever. And so people go into complete denial, and they don't seek out the prevention, and of course then it costs our whole systems million and millions of dollars through emergency room visits and hospitalizations.</p>
          <p>And I really do believer Dr. Miller often makes the statement that drugs are the scalpel of the future as we've been able to push down invasive surgeries and instead improve the health outcomes through the use of drugs, which are a much cheaper alternative.</p>
          <p>I think the idea of consumerology again is to really help people drive to the best choice. Dollars are getting tighter and tighter, the economy is pointing to that. That doesn't mean people have to be non-compliant, it means they should spend their dollars smartly and then help take care of their overall healthcare cost by being compliant with those drugs that are in fact life sustaining. So, that is truly the focus of this program. And I think it has tremendous legs to run on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So how is that going to be integrated into your programs going forward? Is this going to be something that your clients are just going to see as part of your offering or is this going to be a separate offering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's part of our overall offering. At the end of the day, through our model of alignment as you know, we've positioned ourselves &#x2013; and I'm very open and focal (sic) [vocal] with our clients, that we make more money on generics, that we make more money on home delivery than we do at high priced third tier branded products through the retail.</p>
          <p>So the idea is that that's a money absorber, an inefficient use of the consumers' dollars and the clients' dollars. So the idea is what can we do to take our business model to a all new level of driving people from third tier to second tier and more appropriate to generic filled and then in the mail order. And it's especially important in specialty where the cost of treatment is so extremely high.</p>
          <p>So the idea here is to tailor messages. Some people are turned off. The whole idea of managed care speaking to an individual about cost; often people just shut down and they don't hear another word about it. And therefore, we can't drive the adoption of generics, or we can't drive things because they think we're putting our own interest first. The average person on the street doesn't &#x2013; has some negative views of managed care.</p>
          <p>And so our approach is to try to resonate a message to them that make senses. So in certain situations it's a clinical message. In other situations for me personally I am an accountant by education, I like money. So I focus on cash, so my messaging would be around cash.</p>
          <p>But everybody is driven by different messaging and this is well proven. You look at the big consumer companies, Coco-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, on and on, they know how to do this and they do it well. We think there is a tremendous opportunity to use that messaging with respect to healthcare and drive better results.</p>
          <p>So when you log into the web, if you have a certain profile, a certain personality type, your messaging may be completely different than the person sitting next to you has a different type. And the idea is to tailor the messaging to meet your needs. And then with constant study there are no end results. The idea is to measure what's happening and see how do we drive performance to the next level. Web utilization is a great tool, because we can constantly monitor what's working, what's not working by segment and tweak our offering to meet the needs of that segment to drive results. Therefore, we've taken the entire population 50 plus million members and broken it down into workable groups where we can measure results and then better refine our outcomes.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey George, how material can that workers' compensation opportunity be? Is this kind of another Canadian business here that we won't hear much from or will it get some airtime on the calls going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>First of all, go to Canada and you will hear a little bit more about it. In Canada that's not such a bad little business for us, that's pretty good. It's a different model up there as you know, because of the government setting a price on that, we don't need to go down that path.</p>
          <p>But I do believe workers' comp is an extremely important business because as you know, when somebody gets injured, there's often quite a bit &#x2013; especially pain medications and other medications are very costly to the overall benefit of the injured worker. This is an important aspect of ours that has been not really a focus of many. But it's certainly a focus of ours to be a leader in this space. We are a leader in this space. And I think it's a great business with great growth opportunities.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you size the market though George or give us something on profitability per claim or any of the unique attributes to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, we really don't do that. We don't speak to client profitability or profit per claim by client, obviously, they're all different. But the market is pretty big. There's a lot of big player out there. So I don't know that I'm prepared at this time to actually size the market for you. But let's take a look at that and see what we want to give you going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you &#x2013; just another question, George, could you hazard a guess ultimately, I mean you've consistently beaten our profit expectations. Where ultimately can a gross margin in your business level out? And are we five years away or &#x2013; how do we think about the ultimate potential of the Express Scripts model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say this, there's two ways to answer that question. The first one is &#x2013; and this was when I was interviewing Jeff for the job of CFO. He had the greatest response, because I asked him that question. Obviously I wanted a CFO that started with our company that was going to be focused on profitability and see the opportunities to grow our business to the next level.</p>
          <p>And so I asked him that question when I interviewed him and his comment was probably the best I ever heard, which is, you're never really at risk on your profitability until you quit adding value. So in other words, if the value creation to the client and the consumer is greater than what you extracted from the system, it's a model that should continue to work.</p>
          <p>And I think that's what you see in our results. The value that we derive by pushing somebody from the third tier branded product to a generic is so great to the client, that the profits we make are an afterthought. The EBITDA per script is so small relative to the savings, what we can do a therapeutic interchanges, switch somebody from a $300 drug to a $30 drug is dwarfed.</p>
          <p>And so as long as we can go in and show what the trends are in the nation and show that we're beating those trends, that working with Express Scripts is a better answer than just the evaluation of product going generic and all the other tenancies in the marketplace, then we will continue to derive value and I think that that model states intact.</p>
          <p>The second way I would answer that is keep in mind that what's driving a lot of the cost here, especially more recently is in the whole area of specialty drugs. Now you're talking about a whole new level.</p>
          <p>There's hemophiliacs out there unfortunately that are spending $500,000 a year on treatment. So the ability to manage those costs are huge again. And the savings that we can deliver to plan sponsors by proper diagnosis, proper treatment, proper levels of medication is so critically important that again, the amount of value we can extract from the system by driving down overall costs is paled by the savings we can deliver. So I don't &#x2013; I think there's a quite of bit of room to run.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess in terms of maintaining that value proposition and continuing to push that higher, I guess you're focused on the consumerism aspect of your near term and the specialty. But what will take the big capital &#x2013; what's the big capital commitment that you need to make over the next five years? Is there one? I don't know if I've seen it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's all relative, right? I mean it's &#x2013; our CapEx budget's not that great. So when we talk about increasing expenditures, it's all within <mark type="inaudible" /> those numbers.</p>
          <p>So what I would tell you is that we &#x2013; I think Jeff talked about 1 billion to 1.1 billion in operating cash flow performance. Those numbers are very bullish and very strong. And that will continue to be our focus. We will take some of those dollars though and invest.</p>
          <p>And the idea is building up the systems to meet the segmentation needs that we have, so that in fact when you go on to the website, we have the ability to segment our customers and for different people with different leanings to see different messaging.</p>
          <p>And that's &#x2013; again, we are talking millions not billions here. So it's to your point, there's going to be plenty of cash flow available for doing strategic opportunities in the marketplace as well as share repurchases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thanks, George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Then our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Two quick ones. One, wasn't sure first or maybe I missed it &#x2013; but where you stand with supply on Protonix, and if a greater supply of that had anything to do with either better numbers in the quarter or for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't like to get into drug specific conversations. And the reason is because keep in mind there's &#x2013; that's an authorized generic, but there's a plethora of generic and OTC options available. We have clients that don't cover any PPIs, but they help &#x2013; they give the OTCs at a reduced rate in order to drive down costs.</p>
          <p>So we don't have a one-size-fits-all here. We are truly focused on delivering the lowest cost acceptable to our clients and using the means and the tools to deliver that. Protonix, I don't want to speak to specifically, because I don't want to get into drug-specific discussions. But I will tell you that there's a whole plethora of opportunities out there that we avail ourselves of and we will continue to focus on those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. Then in &#x2013; another question was in the 10-Q, I noticed a line that I don't I've seen before, overall as positive in terms of trends. But it mentioned that the positive trends would offset &#x2013; I guess you said the negative impact of some forces affecting pricing and plan structure. So just sort of curious one, if you could expand on what you mean by that, particularly the plan structure piece I guess? And two, what was the impetus for putting that into the 10Q, I don't think I've seen it before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, obviously as background, 10-Qs have lots of review and lots of authors. I would say on top of that comment in and of itself not really meaningful overall. What we are trying to say is, there's lots of movements in what people are asking for and how we're doing business today. But net of all that, we still are incrementally positive on profitability in our business going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, there was nothing in terms of the current environment that's different the problems they are sort of putting that in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please go head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, George. I just had a follow up question on gross margins. I mean obviously your very strong gross margin in this quarter were probably driven a lot by generics. But are you seeing any change in the behavior of the manufacturers with respect to maybe the levels of price increases or their rebating practices that could be benefiting margins as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. That's the whole idea behind consumerology and the focus. As we move more and more people from third tier products to second tier products, in and of itself that creates higher rebates for our clients which drives their cost down. And so as we continue that focus, we hope to get higher levels of second tier formulary compliance, which also then increases our buying power and our clout when we go on an annual and semi-annual &#x2013; biannual basis to go and negotiate rebate contracts. So that's, yes, that's incredibly important.</p>
          <p>And as you might guess, when there's less products out there, then you have a better chance because if they want to be on formulary, they've got to have a quality product and got to compete. So it really is a win-win situation when you have a quality product and you're willing to help our clients control their costs. So it's a big piece of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the price inflation side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's running pretty much and it's &#x2013; go ahead, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's, this is Jeff. It's the same as it has always been.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so no real change there?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question then is from Larry Marsh with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and congrats really on the quarter and the TRICARE renewal. Just a couple of quick follow ups. First on specialty business, George, it sounds like you're communicating maybe turn the corner here after a couple of disappointing years. And I guess my question is, should we continue to see pretty steady improvement after 13.7 million you reported in the course of about a 1.5% margin? And Europe, a great bottom line guy, I mean where do you want this business to go in the next three to four years? I know there was some discussion about the opportunity at the analyst meeting last year. But from a margin standpoint, what would you be satisfied with to look at in the next three to five years in the Specialty business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to take a stab at this and I'll let Jeff chime in as well. I think part of which you will see is that the winter months, because of certain drugs, are heavier utilized, there are specialty categories than the summer months, just in particular in some other situations. So there is some seasonality that has to be contented with that you won't see in the third quarter, but you'll see in the fourth and first quarter. Jeff, do you have anything to add there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think we've got a new team place in Specialty and they know what they are out there trying to achieve. We're happy with some of the progress they've made. It's not a business that's going to turnaround immediately and jump to where we want it. But good positive progress in the quarter. I'd call it kind of one step along the way. There are a lot more steps on that staircase. It's going to take certainly several more quarters. How high can it go? I certainly don't want to put any limits on what they can do, I have incredibly high expectations of what they can do and when they get there, we'll raise expectations again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, I think it's important to remember that &#x2013; not important to remember &#x2013; but when we talked about last year was that one of the things that's been a bit of a revelation to me when we got into this business through the CuraScript acquisition was that we looked at the incredible pipeline of drugs, and we were used to working on the oral solids space. So we could actually &#x2013; we were pretty good at measuring drugs as they worked their way through the clinical trials, ultimately to market.</p>
          <p>I will tell you that the learning we've had over the last three years is that we're not as good as predicting on the specialty side. Many of those drugs never make it to market. And there's a whole host of reasons for that. But we plan a lot better, under Dr. Miller's team we've brought in some specialists in this area. We are monitoring the pipeline and we are making sure that we are first in line to make sure we get our share of allocation and assist the manufacturers in coming to market.</p>
          <p>So this is a big focus of ours and I think that this business is very much evolving. And we shouldn't lose sight of all the work we're also doing from a biosimilar perspective as we're looking to try to get some generics into this space. And I think at the end of the day, the introduction of both new products and biosimilars could put whole new opportunities in this space for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I can certainly see <mark type="inaudible" /> Specialty problems getting worse not better for your customer, which obviously creates a need. On the TRICARE specialty addition, how big of a deal is that? And how was that being serviced previously, have you sized that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of it was going through retail in the past. So the cost for that as you know is very high. So the government is going to work with us in trying to push some more of that into the home delivery aspects of the contract as well as where appropriate using the proper disease management tools to help people stay compliant and meet their needs. So we haven't sized specific components of this, but it's a huge opportunity for us as we look out in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now on the Part D, I &#x2013; maybe get you to reflect, under what circumstances would you be willing to really accelerate your involvement in Part D? And can you remind us again some of the issues you talked about and the challenges of being in that business, not to say I told you so, but can you talk about some of the issues that you've highlighted before that had made you hesitant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When I was answering Charles' question earlier, I said that I thought that the other managed care players should let us do what we do best. I also believe that we shouldn't do what managed care players are out there to do, and that's actually &#x2013; be an insurer. I'm not interested in that component of the business. I think that the, that's just not our specialty. So I &#x2013; we do have a really large Part D presence, and that's done by helping our clients.</p>
          <p>So we have many, many clients who are managed care players, who are big in this space, and we're the back office for them. So we help them to stay competitive and deliver the lowest cost and lowest &#x2013; and the best trends that they can price their products appropriately.</p>
          <p>That's where I like our space. That's where I think we do our best work, it's what we are accustomed to and I think it's a great opportunity for us to add value to the entire system by driving down trends so that the managed care players can then in fact offer a competitive product.</p>
          <p>So that's where we like to be and it's been &#x2013; to be honest with you, it's been a great space for us because of our ability to help our clients grow their business. So as our clients grow, we grow, and you are seeing the profits of that coming through our financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally just a quick clarification on the consumerology roll out, I know in the past you talked excitedly about the &#x2013; I think it's, David Lathson and his study about studying consumer behavior. Is that going to be a big deal in sort of opening people's eyes and when do you hope that study would be out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're doing a lot of work here. We're using our &#x2013; part of the idea of having the center for &#x2013; where we bring in all of these specialists is that they're very interested in understanding how consumer behavior works with healthcare. And so part of the deal is that we're using their expertise in this space and through that, we hope to ultimately through Dr. Miller's group do some publishing with these people as we find results and we'll keep you posted on that as we go forward.</p>
          <p>We have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. That next question then will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's actually Mike Michecken for Lisa. Just a couple of questions. First, you talked about it a little earlier in response to a question regarding the impact of the economy. But can you talk about the mail business specifically in terms of what you're seeing as the organic volume growth there, if we were to exclude some of the contract shifts that we've had? And then secondly, the increase to the cash flow guidance was a little greater than what we saw in the EPS line, and maybe just wondering if you could talk about anything specific you're doing to drive the improvement there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Jeff talk about the last piece, and let me just quickly address the first piece. The reason we are so bullish on mail and we think it works so well is that when we are the mail provider. We're in constant communication with our membership, so we are following their adherence. We're following their compliance. And that give us a great opportunity and it gives us opportunity to drive the lowest net cost products for them.</p>
          <p>So mail is an incredibly important component. And when people do get squeezed, things do have to come off the table. And one of the things we want is to try to work with our plan sponsors to make sure is that people on life sustaining drugs don't let that drop, because the overall cost of our economy and into that health plan or to that plan sponsor is going to be so much higher in the long run. And so we work in partnership with those clients to make sure that we in fact can help them, those members stay compliant and stay on top of the regimen. So mail's incredibly important for us and we continue to focus on that.</p>
          <p>Do you want to talk to the cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, <mark type="inaudible" /> we are seeing organic growth in mail sequentially and year-over-year. On cash flow, we're up, our guidance on EPS has gone up $0.23 since we first f gave guidance and our cash flow at the midpoint has gone up about 120 million. So certainly, there's a little bit of catching up in the increase in guidance this quarter.</p>
          <p>But the other thing I'll say is that certainly, the more finance team and lot of the operations team comes in everyday thinking about cash flow. It's one of the things that we think is really important to total shareholder return. And a lot of things we do were just focused on getting the cash flow in. In a business like ours, cash flow can certainly be lumpy, and we spend a lot of efforts trying to make sure the lumps fall in our favor.</p>
