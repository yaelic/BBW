        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Susan. I'm very pleased with our progress during the second quarter. In addition to solid financial results, we advanced a number of programs across our therapeutic areas, achieved several anticipated milestones, and presented study results that set the stage for key events during the second half of this year and in 2012.</p>
          <p>On the HIV front, two important milestones occurred since our last earnings call that put us another step closer to the introduction of our next single-tablet regimens. First in May our partner, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, announced the FDA's approval for Rilpivirin, their non-nucleocide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Rilpivirin indications for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV in treatment-na&#xEF;ve adults.</p>
          <p>As you're most likely aware, we partnered with Tibotec in July of 2009 to develop a single-tablet regimen combining Truvada with Rilpivirin. This potential product is currently under review by U.S. and E.U. regulatory authorities. We anticipate action by the authorities in both geographies in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>The second major milestone was the late breaker presentation of the 48-week data from our pivotal Phase III study number 145 at the International AIDS Society meeting in Rome. The data demonstrated that elvitegravir, our oral HIV integrase inhibitor was not inferior to the integrase inhibitor raltegravir given BID in treatment-experienced patients.</p>
          <p>And at 48 weeks of treatment, 59% of patients receiving elvitegravir achieved and maintained HIV RNA levels less than 50 copies per milliliter compared to 58% of patients receiving raltegravir. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events and safety and resistant profiles were comparable in both arms of the study. This is an important result and is the first from the four Phase III studies supporting our Quad, elvitegravir, and cobicistat programs.</p>
          <p>Continuing our vision of bringing additional fix dose and single-tablet regimens forward to meet the individual needs of HIV patients, we announced in June that we entered into a license agreement with Tibotec for the development and commercialization of a new fixed-dose antiretroviral combination product containing cobicistat, our boosting agent, and their protease inhibitor darunavir.</p>
          <p>In connection with this agreement, we announced our current negotiations for the development and commercialization of a future single-tablet regimen combining darunavir with Emtriva, cobicistat, and our investigational next-generation NRTI, GS 7340. Because it is a substantially lower dose than Viread at 300 milligrams, GS 7340 allows for fixed-dose formulations not possible with Viread. And in this case, it would allow for the co-formulation of the first single-tablet regimen containing a protease inhibitor.</p>
          <p>As we stated at the time of the announcement, the agreement to develop the fixed-dose combination of cobicistat and darunavir is contingent upon the signing of the agreement to develop the GS 7340 containing single-tablet regimen. We will continue to keep you posted on our progress.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, there were also a number of external releases that contributed to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of Viread and Truvada for the prevention of HIV infection. The first was the release of results in May from the HPTN 052 study, which defined treatment as a method of preventing new HIV infections.</p>
          <p>HPTN 052 is an NIH-sponsored study designed to determine if treatment can prevent HIV transmission between HIV discordant couples. The study was performed in performed in Botswana, Brazil, India, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Thailand, and Zimbabwe. More than 1,750 HIV-positive individuals were assigned to either begin taking a combination of antiretroviral drugs immediately or delay the initiation of therapy until their CD4 counts fell below 250 or they were diagnosed with an HIV-related illness.</p>
          <p>The results demonstrated that earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy led to a 96% reduction in HIV transmission to the uninfected partner. Based on this finding, the study's Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended that the study be stopped early &#x2013; four years ahead of schedule. These data were also the subject of a late breaker presentation at IAS, which garnered significant interest from the medical community. The results add powerful evidence that treatment benefits the individual and also has a public health benefit in reducing further infections.</p>
          <p>Another trial known as Partners PrEP was sponsored by the University of Washington and involved 4,758 heterosexual couples in which one partner was infected with HIV and the other was not. In this Phase III study conducted at nine sites in Kenya and Uganda, daily use of either oral Viread or oral Truvada by the HIV-negative participants reduced their risk of acquiring HIV by 62% and 73% respectively. Due to the strong HIV prevention effect seen, the DSMB recommended that the results be made public and the placebo arm of the study discontinued. The difference between Viread and Truvada was not statistically significant, but this blinded comparison continues.</p>
          <p>The other trial known as TDF2 was sponsored by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and involved 1,200 HIV-negative heterosexual men and women. Data collected on this smaller cohort through the end of the trial indicated that daily use of oral Truvada significantly reduced HIV acquisition by 63%. In both studies the safety and tolerability was similar to patients taking Viread, Truvada, or placebo.</p>
          <p>As previously indicated, we intend to file for inclusion of the prevention data in our Truvada label and continue our discussions with U.S. FDA to define the content and the timing of the submission.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to our efforts in hepatitis C, we initiated the first all-oral antiviral study in HCV-infected patients during the quarter. This Phase IIa study is comparing two doses of GS 5885 in combination with GS 9451, GS 9190, and ribavirin for 12 and 24 weeks in genotype 1 infected patients. Before the end of the year, we will have started multiple Phase II studies in hepatitis C evaluating different combinations of compounds in over 2,000 patients. We are evaluating multiple regimens that reduce or eliminate the use of pegylated interferon in both treatment-na&#xEF;ve and treatment-experienced patients.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Robin to discuss our financial results for the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. During the second quarter, we delivered record product revenues and EPS while continuing our share repurchase program and investing in our potential future growth drivers. We posted total revenues of $2.1 billion for the quarter, with net product revenues surpassing the $2 billion mark for the first time, up 13% over the same quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $1.00 per share, an increase of 18% compared to the same quarter of 2010, and generated cash flow from operations of $943 million. Under our $5 billion share repurchase program authorized in May of last year, we continue to return value to shareholders by retiring more than $723 million in common stock during the second quarter and $4.2 billion since the current program began in May 2010.</p>
          <p>Our revenue growth was fueled by strong performances in our antiviral and cardiovascular franchises, with revenues of $1.9 billion for the second quarter and $3.7 billion for the year to date.</p>
          <p>The U.S. contributed $943 million to our antiviral product sales, increasing 6% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by healthy underlying patient demand.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:37) total prescription growth for both Atripla and Truvada were 3% and 4% respectively in the second quarter, with total NRTI prescription share exceeding 70% at the end of the quarter. Our major wholesaler inventory levels remained constant with levels at the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>As we shared with you last quarter in early April, HRSA, an administrative arm of the Department of Health and Human Services, announced the federal fiscal 2011 budget for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program of $885 million or 6% or $50 million increase over the previous year's funding of $835 million. To date only a portion of the full year budget, $418 million, was provided to the states which, as expected, resulted in measured purchasing by individual states during the quarter. We expect a second allocation of $417 million to be disbursed to the states shortly.</p>
          <p>The final $50 million has now been earmarked as emergency funding and will be allocated to the states that have applied for and qualified to receive a portion of these funds based on need. The deadline for the states to apply for a portion of the $50 million is August 5.</p>
          <p>Europe ended the quarter with more than $697 million in antiviral product sales, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Growth was 7% sequentially, driven primarily by underlying patient demand and, to a lesser degree, product buy-in typical of the second quarter in advance of the summer holidays.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, our cardiovascular franchise continued to expand. Letairis, which had the black box warning for a liver toxicity removed by the FDA earlier this year, demonstrated strong year-over-year growth of 22% in the second quarter and 18% sequentially. Additionally, Ranexa grew 42% in the second quarter year-over-year and 26% sequentially. Excluding the benefit of a one-time returns reserve adjustment of approximately $8 million for Ranexa, growth was 29% year-over-year and 14% sequentially.</p>
          <p>And finally, we are reiterating the full year 2011 guidance provided to you first in January and reiterated in April. This guidance can be found on slide 33 of the earnings call deck, which is available on our corporate website.</p>
          <p>Though all guidance parameters remain unchanged, we believe, based on our recent acquisitions and collaborations in addition to further clarity on the calculation of the health care reform excise tax, that our R&amp;D and SG&amp;A results are trending toward the high end of the range.</p>
          <p>In summary, our second quarter results are reflective of continued commercial execution and key investment in potential future growth drivers. Additionally, our strong balance sheet and operating cash flow provides us with the ability to continue our share repurchase program while retaining the flexibility for opportunistic investments.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to John Milligan to discuss upcoming pipeline milestones.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin. As we head onto the second half of this year and on into 2012, we look forward to several important clinical milestones and potential product launches, all of which will contribute to the long-term vision for our antiviral portfolio. First, as John mentioned earlier, we are approaching the U.S. PDUFA date for the Truvada/Rilpivirin single-table regimen, which is August 10. Pending approval, our commercial organization will be ready to launch the product immediately. All of our HIV field-based staff will support the launch and promote the product as a first priority detail, and we will be joined in this effort by the Tibotec sales team. This will be only the second single-table regimen available, extending the options currently available to treatment-na&#xEF;ve patients and particularly to women of child-bearing potential.</p>
          <p>As previously stated, we expect a decision by EU regulatory authorities on the Truvada/Rilpivirin single-tablet regimen prior to the end of this year. And if approved, we will be prepared to begin launching the product with the first introductions in the UK and Germany.</p>
          <p>For the Quad, the two pivotal studies will reach their 48-week endpoint this quarter. The first study compares Quad to Atripla, and the second compares Quad to the combination of atazanavir, ritonavir, and Truvada. Both are non-inferiority studies with approximately 700 treatment-na&#xEF;ve patients randomized 1:1. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA levels of less than 50 copies per milliliter at week 48. We look forward to sharing these data sets with you as they become available and, pending positive outcomes, to submitting regulatory filings for the Quad in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>For cobicistat and elvitegravir, data from the final study, cobicistat versus ritonavir in a regimen of atazanavir and Truvada, will be available in the fourth quarter of this year. As a result, the elvitegravir and cobicistat NDA filings will follow the Quad filings in the second quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>This summer marks the five-year anniversary of the launch of Atripla in the U.S. In that short time, Atripla has become the most widely prescribed regimen and the number two brand, second only to Truvada. In the second quarter, Atripla had total sales of over $800 million, helping lead Gilead to record product sales of over $2 billion. It is clear that doctors and patients recognize the benefits of single-tablet regimens, and as you can tell from our R&amp;D activities, Gilead is committed to providing even more options for patients for the future.</p>
          <p>As we've outlined on many occasions, we remain committed to effectively leveraging a strong cash flow &#x2013; $943 million this quarter alone to enable a disciplined balance of continued investment in our growing pipeline, selective licensing, opportunistic M&amp;A, and returning value to shareholders via share repurchases.</p>
          <p>I am pleased by the numerous opportunities we've been able to execute upon in the last year, broadening Gilead's R&amp;D opportunities of potentially providing future products to patients in categories outside of HIV. And I'm confident that for the future Gilead has the people and the skills to move forward aggressively and rapidly in all our commercial, R&amp;D, and business development efforts.</p>
          <p>We look forward to the many exciting milestones we have ahead of us and to sharing these results with you. We'll now open the call to your questions. Operator?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A question for you on the Quad filing for the first quarter of '12 &#x2013; beyond the Phase IIIs, what are the other gating factors for the filing? Has the PK and the tox work been done, and do you guys have to wait for cobicistat final data prior to submitting the Quad NDA? If you just help us out with that, that'd be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff, it's Norbert. No, Geoff, no, the data that's included in the NDA is essentially the two Phase III studies, Quad versus Atripla and Quad versus atazanavir/ritonavir/Truvada, plus all the supporting PK and preclinical information tox and biology, etc. And that will all be ready. The gating factor is really only getting the &#x2013; taking the Phase III data unblinded, analyzed, and written up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there are no new analyses that you have to do by way of the metabolism &#x2013; the issue that you had that was a short-term delay to the Rilpivirin filing?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, no, I know that's what you're after. No, so the issue is exactly the same. And by the way, all the emtricitabine degradation product essentially is contained in all products where emtricitabine is co-formulated with Viread. So it affects Truvada, Atripla, Rilpivirin, fixed-dose <mark type="ph" /> combination (20:44), and Quad. And we have to submit those data &#x2013; it's actually the same data package that's been submitted to multiple NDAs, and we've initiated that in various territories four months ago.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. And I didn't know &#x2013; is Kevin around today, or I guess maybe John can answer this. But I was just looking at the ex-U.S. patient data that you've provided in your slides for the last quarters. And it looks like patients on drug in Europe, at least according to the data that you guys have provided, has been roughly flat for the last three quarters &#x2013; patients on Gilead drug. Yet you've clearly reported nice increases sequentially over the last three quarters in European sales. And by my math, that all can't be explained by FX. So (a) can you just perhaps explain the discrepancy between the patient numbers and the reported? And maybe to simplify the question, if you'd give us just volume growth in Europe sequentially, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Mark, it's Kevin. Unfortunately, they didn't give me the afternoon off, so I am here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good to get your question. First of all, just to step back, I'd like to say how pleased I was with the overall quarter. I think both my U.S. team and the European team did a heck of a job &#x2013; not just HIV, but Letairis coming now hard on stream. And just across the products across the geography, this was a great quarter.</p>
          <p>So specifically on Europe, please bear in mind that the data that we supply is the big five European countries. And of course Europe, when we look at actual revenues, is a collection of more countries than just the big five. So when we supply Synovate, it's based on the big five countries.</p>
          <p>I can certainly reassure you that we have had both growth in Atripla and Truvada. It's always mixed because, number one, we don't have a first line label for Atripla, so we're never going to get the Atripla type of shares in Europe. And of course there's a mixture of third agents across Europe which continue to keep the popularity of Truvada as the backbone.</p>
          <p>So if we talk specifically about Q2, we had a 7% increase in our revenues. About 1% of that was FX; you'll see that in our slides. And probably around about 2% &#x2013; 2% to 3% was the pre-summer buy-in that was referred to by Robin. With European sales, Q2 and Q4 are always your strongest quarters. That's because people are buying in ahead of holiday periods. Particularly countries like France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal &#x2013; the Southern European markets still tend to take those big three-week holidays during August and into September. So typically in June you get a very strong month, which ups your second quarter.</p>
          <p>So, if you like, in real demand terms, we probably had about a 3% to 4% increase in our European numbers, so continue to see good progress. There was not a price effect, so that was reassuring. We don't have a crystal ball for the rest of the year in terms of European pricing, but there was not a discernible big change in any of our prices Q1-on-Q2 in Europe.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on the last one. Can you just confirm that you will be seeking and expect to gain a label for treatment-na&#xEF;ve patients in Europe for both the Rilpivirin fixed-dose combination, as well as the Quad?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is, Kevin, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about what you were seeing in the U.S. market this quarter. I think, Robin, you talked a little bit about some of the dynamics in terms of the disbursement of funds. But can you help us with any of the intra-quarter trends that &#x2013; I don't know, was there anything different as you exited the quarter that can maybe be a leading indicator for what we should expect in the quarter? Thanks a lot.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, I'll answer your first question. The answer is yes, we will seek a na&#xEF;ve indication for both Rilpivirin fixed-dose combination and the Quad. And the reason is very simple. Both of these products are supported by two Phase III studies each in treatment-na&#xEF;ve patients. So it follows the clinical Phase III studies. And Kevin will absence the other question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Matt. Yeah, let me take you through the U.S. results for HIV. The first thing &#x2013; again we mentioned this; Robin had it in her commentary. Q2 was not an inventory story. Our major wholesalers where we have IMA agreements held their inventory at the low end of the range where we ended Q1.</p>
          <p>That was not unexpected. I think the sense out there is that the large wholesalers are very carefully now managing their inventory from a financial point of view. And I think our expectation is that it's going to stay at that bottom end of our contractual range likely in the remainder of 2011. So it wasn't a quarter-on-quarter inventory effect.</p>
          <p>Second part of it was we had good underlying TRx growth. Atripla was 3% and Truvada was 4%. And when you put Q2 on the back of Q1, that's some of the best back-to-back quarters that we had over the last two years in terms of prescription growth. So that bodes well for our underlying business.</p>
          <p>So the story again is, of course, nonretail. The growth in nonretail was not as high as the TRx growth; we pointed that out. But it was higher than Q1 &#x2013; not by a lot, but it was higher than Q1.</p>
          <p>So let me give you some granularity on the nonretail. The first thing to say is that Q2, the calendar Q2, which is the first quarter for the ADAP fiscal year, is always the weakest. If I look back at the past four years of ADAP purchase, Q2 calendar is always the weakest &#x2013; has been for every one of the previous four years. Q3, Q4, and Q1 have always been sort of varied over the years, but Q2 has always been the poorest of the quarters. And that's because ADAPs have always been in a situation where they're waiting for confirmation of their budgets.</p>
          <p>In terms of the major purchases, direct purchases for ADAP, Florida routinely ordered during Q2, Texas ordered from the middle of Q2, and we saw some very healthy orders from Puerto Rico. So that's the third largest, the fourth largest, and the fifth largest of the ADAPs were repurchasing. I think our sense was they weren't building inventory, but they certainly were back on stream.</p>
          <p>And it has to be pointed out that they have not had the remainder of the $835 million core budget allocated yet. I checked today with my people; they've still not gone out, although we do expect them in the next few weeks. And then there's got to be this extra $50 million of emergency funds allocated, and ADAP are going to go through a process on that.</p>
          <p>So I think the long and short of it is that ADAP is nicely coming back on stream. Even with not having their final numbers, we saw the ADAPs that had previously had the challenges in the first quarter, Florida and Texas, back repurchasing. So I think that bodes well for us going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks so much for taking my question. I really appreciate it. And also congrats on a nice quarter. So just want &#x2013; Kevin, a follow-up on the last question. Just help us understand maybe a little bit kind of two things. Number one, when you look at ADAP in general, Florida is by far &#x2013; as you guys pointed out many times and it's evidenced from the data, Florida is definitely the outlier relative to everybody else in terms of the tightness of their budget and how big their wait lists are. And given that some of these ADAP budgets are so sort of outdated when they originally are sent to the government and sort of projected, what's the likelihood that they can get some kind of a decent share out of that $50 million since the state of Florida didn't really sort of boost their own budget that much?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, help us just put into context &#x2013; we're getting a lot of questions on the ADAP wait list, the patient wait list. What does that mean? Does that mean that Gilead or other companies have to provide free drug to these patients until they go on an ADAP? And at what point would you think the budget is really going to increase for ADAP in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me try and do them in order for you, Yaron. Good questions. So actually I'll take the second question first. So in terms of wait lists, yes, wait lists continue to go up. It's almost 9,000 patients. I do think that some ADAPs will use that as a bit of a kind of a safety valve. The one that obviously has got the biggest is Florida. And as you pointed out, they've had the biggest challenges around their budgeting. Yes, we &#x2013; as long as they hit the Gilead criteria, we do take them into our own patient assistance program. We think that's the right thing to do. And ultimately we hope that they transition out at some point in time to go on normal prescribed ADAP drug.</p>
          <p>Just to point out &#x2013; and I think this is very important. We still are incredibly helped by the overall ADAP program. If you work out &#x2013; if you look at 9,000 patients on the wait list versus the 499,000 Gilead patients, that's just over 1%. So in relative terms, it still is a very, very small number of people on these wait lists. We'd like to see it come down. But in the big context, it's still a very, very, very small percentage.</p>
          <p>Coming to the allocation of the $50 million, as we understand it, they're going to do it very similar to the $25 million emergency fund that they gave out in fiscal year 2010. So they are now getting the ADAP programs to submit a justification for funding.</p>
          <p>But we have heard that, unlike last year, that they will cap the amount, any one &#x2013; amount of dollars. There'll be a maximum amount that they would give to any one ADAP. So if you remember, there was the interesting situation in 2010 where 25% of that $25 million went to Florida. We are told, and led to believe, that any one ADAP will not be able to get that type of very, very significant portion &#x2013; that they will put in caps that no one ADAP will be able to go over. We also are told that it is for the clearance of wait lists or to address the wait list situation. So that's deliberately what this $50 million is for.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I just wanted to better understand the expense guidance. Robin, I think you mentioned you'd be towards the upper end. But it looks like the first half trajectory actually leads to a higher overall number than your guidance. So is there anything one-time in the first half that we should be thinking about kind of in that second half decline?</p>
          <p>And if I could sneak in a quick HCV question, is there anything at AASLD that we should be looking at? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Rachel, so I'll take the first, and I think Norbert will take the second. Relative to our guidance, the only one-time I think you'll probably see &#x2013; and it's not atypical &#x2013; is on the SG&amp;A side, Rachel, where typically promotion and some of our marketing expenses, particularly with our upcoming and pending launches, are a bit higher. You also have the seasonality in Europe that also drives SG&amp;A up to the higher end in the first half.</p>
          <p>One of the things that we're looking at is just the ramp relative to the collaborations and acquisitions I mentioned on the R&amp;D side. And as we continue to rationalize that pipeline and work through it, we anticipate expenses continue to go up.</p>
          <p>On the SG&amp;A side, as mentioned, it's primarily driven by the fact that we now have a preliminary bill on the excise tax and believe we are now &#x2013; expect our overall expense for excise tax to be at the high end.</p>
          <p>Also we are cognizant of Southern European bad debt and want to be sure that we appropriately think about bad debt expense. We also have some legal expenses associated with <mark type="ph" /> ANDOZ (35:24) and DOJ that we're working through as well.</p>

So they won't be at a point for AASLD for any presentation. We've allowed a number of preclinical things to talk about.</p>
          <p>But something I'd want to point out is on hepatitis B front, we will have some very interesting five-year data on Viread where we have seen dramatic reversals of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis after five years of treatment. This is supported by paired biopsies from patients in our two pivotal studies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. Had a question on the Tibotec deal, the one &#x2013; not the one that you signed, but the one you're negotiating right now for the single-tablet regimen. What will be the regulatory path for that combination? And as you negotiate a deal with Tibotec, is the starting point the deal that you signed for Rilpivirin, or is this a completely new process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ian, it's Norbert. I'm going to answer the regulatory question. So this fixed single-tablet regimen will contain four components. So it's darunavir, cobicistat, elvitegravir, and 7340. 7340 is the only compound that is not approved currently. So we obviously have to support this filing with safety and efficacy data showing the safety and efficacy of 7340. And one way how that could be done, although we haven't finally decided &#x2013; you could simply compare that single-tablet regimen that contains 7340 to the base standard of care at that time, which may be the Quad; it may be Atripla. So that's kind of a pathway. It's fairly straightforward. And John will answer the other questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for the question, Ian. And so with regard to the collaboration, obviously we're still negotiating it, and so it's in progress. So I think you mean is the Rilpivirin deal the basis for that probably from an economic standpoint. And I would point out that unlike &#x2013; the deals are quite different because, with Rilpivirin, that was an unapproved study in which we invested money in the Phase III studies, as you recall, whereas this would be a different kind of program where darunavir is already approved &#x2013; not experimental as it was with Rilpivirin. And we will have the experimental agent in there.</p>
          <p>So we are negotiating from a different basis of understanding about who brings what to the table, and that will help determine the final economics. And once we're able to conclude that, we'll be happy to share it with you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. A question for Kevin on the Truvada/Edurant single-table regimen &#x2013; in the past few months we've seen both the 96-week Phase III data for the regimen, as well as your partner's announcement of Edurant's pricing at a premium to Sustiva. I was just wondering how these two developments influence your commercial approach. And then what's the plant for incorporating the 96-week data into the label? Is this being provided now to the FDA and EMA, and could it potentially push back the respective action dates? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Brian, I'll let Norbert take the very last part of your question. But in terms of our preparations for launch, no big change in terms of sort of what we're seeing out to the 96-week or indeed the pricing. To date, the uptake of Edurant as a single-tablet has been modest, as you probably see. That didn't surprise us. I don't think that surprises Tibotec. It was always going to be a product in combination and exactly why they wanted a single-tablet regimen together with Gilead.</p>
          <p>We've been doing a lot of preparation. In fact, I'm going down to see my sales organization. We're finishing a training this very week. I think the enthusiasm is very, very high. We'll share with you, once we get into a launch, a bit more of what we've done around patient targeting. But clearly I think in the larger, more general HIV clinics, because of the benefits of CNS, I think we have an opportunity with this single tablet.</p>
          <p>In terms of reimbursement, Tibotec have made good progress. The information that we have is that the major ADAP programs, places like Florida and California, are all listing Edurant, state Medicaid programs are, and we're now in the 90-day window of working through the <mark type="ph" /> formaries (40:53) for Medicare. And we don't see any great hurdles or barriers with managed care. We will still have to do our own reimbursement work because there's a separate NDC code for the single tablet. But we think that will go relatively quickly, and the pricing and the reimbursement won't be a barrier to uptake.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Brian, regarding your question about pathway for the 96-week data, this would not delay approval of the single-tablet regimen or of Rilpivirin in the EU. There's really no regulatory path to submitting further efficacy data to an ongoing NDA. The way this would be done &#x2013; you wait for approval for the NDA and MAA, and submit it then as an SNDA in the U.S. And there's a Type II variation in the EU.</p>

          <p>Thank you for taking my question. On Letairis, could you give us any more color on where you're pulling patients from, presumably the label change having a kick-in? Is it really from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:14) failure patients, or are you having an impact on new patients?</p>
          <p>And perhaps I could sneak a very quick second one in for Robin. You're obviously towards the end of your $5 billion share buyback program. Can you presume that you'll move straight on to the further $5 billion program that you announced in Q4? And has your view on capital allocation changed recently? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi, Ravi, it's Kevin. Thanks for the question. We're delighted with the takeoff for the &#x2013; uptick in Letairis since the label change. Our revenues were up 18%. It's important to stress that that's not representative of the uptick in enrollments. Unfortunately I can't share that with you because that's something that is proprietary. But I can certainly reinforce that our enrollment increases are far in excess of the 18%. So we've been delighted with the way Letairis has gone.</p>
          <p>As you can see from slide 23 in our web deck, we've done a lot of educational work because not only is this a &#x2013; is a practical benefit for patients and for PH centers; it clearly is a scientific difference between the label for Letairis and the competitor.</p>
          <p>In terms of patient makeup, it is listed on slide 23. About 40% of the patients coming out of Letairis in Q2 were on monotherapy &#x2013; completely new but on monotherapy Letairis. 29% are monotherapy but have switched; they've come from a switch from Tracleer. And 31% are combination, so that is typically Letairis with a PDE-5 or a prostanoid. So we have broken out for you as a new data point in this quarter.</p>

          <p>I'll quickly talk about it. Overall our view on capital allocation has not changed. We do fairly &#x2013; we've done a fairly aggressive job relative to our valuation of returning value via our program to date based on how aggressive we've been at completing the first program.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and apologies for one more on ADAP, but just a little different way of looking at it. I know it's complex, but if you're able to say, what do you see as the year-over-year growth this year in the national ADAP budget across all funding sources, not just federal, and also across the states. And then given your dominant share, is that growth in the overall ADAP budget a good proxy for your growth potential in that segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult for us, Tom, to actually know the total, total percentage growths. The obviously one that we do know is the 6% growth in the federal budget. We've put that on a slide and the way it's passed out to our best knowledge, so we've inserted that in the deck this time.</p>
          <p>The other components of course are states; states are on different fiscal timelines. Federal is April to April. Some come in July; some come in the August/September timeframe. From what we have seen so far &#x2013; and again the best of our knowledge because some of this is not that transparent &#x2013; the states' year-over-year HIV ADAP budgets seem to be flat, 2011 versus 2010.</p>
          <p>Now of course you never know quite what happens in potential top-ups or anything else during the year. But from what we understand, two big ones, Florida and California, were actually flat. Now that's not a bad situation when you think of all the haircuts that have been taking place in state budgets in 2010 and 2011. So relatively that's not a bad place to be.</p>
          <p>So we'll probably never quite know the full picture here. We're always well in arrears when we get kind of a year complete and have that sort of totality of percentage year-on-year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>Well, Ryan White will be running through 2013, Tom, so it still has two more years to go. So we're hopeful that we're going to continue to have &#x2013; there's going to be funding there because actually there's legislation in place for Ryan White. Thereafter we start to see on the horizon the new Medicaid program for 2014.</p>
          <p>So we did, I think, well this year when some people thought that it would be flat <mark type="ph" /> funded or (47:54) perhaps even some risk there, I think to come out with a plus 6% was a good place. And HIV is still very much at the forefront of people's minds. The world AIDS meeting will be in Washington, D.C. in 2012. So we know Washington, D.C. has in some ways been the epicenter of late for HIV. So again I think that's going to put HIV in the U.S. again front and center in people's minds.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Sapna, you asked are there any issues with regards the fact that the Quad contains two new chemical entities. And answer to that is no. We actually talked to FDA about all the requirements for the filing. We will of course file both products with regards to the preclinical talk studies, the PK studies, the micro-support. And we also have it supported by the two Phase III studies. In addition, we will also submit the elvitegravir 48-week data to the NDA. So there is support independently for elvitegravir as well.</p>
          <p>With regards to the issue of statistics in our Quad versus Atripla study, let me just give you the numbers. So the study we assumed an 80% response rate. So that means 80% of the people involved in the study are below 50 copies per mil at week 48. Then the study with 700 patients has a 95% power to assess non-inferiority with <mark type="ph" /> a two-sided p (51:31) confidence interval, and the lower bound of the delta being 12.</p>
          <p>Now you asked how much different would the two arms have to be, and roughly about 6%. So in other words, if we would see overall response rate 80%, the Atripla arm would be 77% and the Quad arm would be a little bit more than 83%, then we would have statistically a possibility of having the lower bound of the confidence interval mapped cross zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to add something there, we are very close now, so it wouldn't be appropriate to throw out sort of market share capture or anything like that. But it is clear that physicians like integration from the point of view of tolerability. Initially I think, while elvitegravir did very well, I think there's been some flattening recently because of some of the studies that were halted and its inability to be a once-daily product. So I think if we are successful with non-inferiority and have our single tablet, then I think that becomes a very attractive proposition for HIV physicians.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Thanks for letting me get on the call. Just regarding the TMC278/Rilpivirin combination, could you talk a little bit about, first the significance of the higher rate of viral breakthrough there and whether that's going to be a liability for you either in the final stages, presumably not only the regulatory process but also in the market?</p>
          <p>And then, Kevin, could you talk a little bit about how this is going to fit in over the next 18 months and then beyond that? Is this really just a bridge to the Quad, or do you think it's going to have an ongoing role as part of the portfolio of those combinations? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Geoff, I'll take it, and maybe Norbert wants to come in and just talk about the data a little bit. I don't think the 96-week had a great bearing on the physicians that we spoke to coming out of IAS in Rome. We did our normal discussions; we've had our advisory board since then. So I don't think that really has changed anything.</p>
          <p>I think we know the type of patients who are going to be applicable here, particularly people who don't want the CNS side effects of Sustiva &#x2013; people with high acuity in their jobs and the kind of people working with mechanical equipment. Certainly the 20% of patients &#x2013; the women of child-bearing potential, this is going to be, if all goes well, a Category B compared to Category D that we have for Atripla. So I think we kind of know the patients that this is going to be applicable.</p>
          <p>Certainly I think if I was to say to my team, who are getting ready this week, that we were halfhearted about this, I think they would probably give me a very big scowl because we are working the team extremely hard. So this is not a dry run; this is not a practice. This is not a halfhearted kind of kick-around for the launch of the Quad. We want to be successful with Truvada/Rilpivirin. We think it's got a role to play.</p>
          <p>Of course we're very excited about quad. But I don't believe in going into a launch of a product with some form of kind of semi-launch. You launch a product, and hopefully you get it right from the point of view of how the product profile will fit the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff, if I may add, I think with regards to significance, a good thing to look at is the U.S. label. That actually gives you a lot of information, how to think about it. It's broadly indicated for the treatment of HIV infection in treatment-na&#xEF;ve adults. But then it says consideration should be given to higher viral load failures, and we talk about the resistance.</p>
          <p>And then in the clinical section, it clearly outlines that &#x2013; first of all, I want to remind you that, <mark type="ph" /> over a numerically in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:14) study, Rilpivirin was actually better numerically to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:23). But it does then say in the label that more virological failures occurred in patients that had at baseline about a load above 100,000 or above 500,000.</p>
          <p>So would I say as, Kevin point it out, it's going to be a good drug for certain patients, but it's not for everybody, particularly where high viral load people will think about whether to use this compound or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Kevin, how would it fit with the Quad when you say three years from now then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, all I'll say right now, Geoff, is that, yeah, Quad will likely be top of the detail list in terms of our emphasis and what we'll do in terms of incentive compensation plan. But the Truvada/278 will be very much still part of the detail, and we have contractual obligations to our partner, Tibotec. So both products will very much be promoted.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I had a follow-up on TMC278. So as you mentioned, the prescription data have been very modest. So we're seven weeks into data now, and it's running at less than 200 prescriptions a week. And it looks like a little bit like the old CCR 5 launch. So just to play devil's advocate here, you highlight that there's a big clinical advantage on CNS side effects and the ability to use the drug in women of child-bearing age. Is that by itself not sufficient to get usage of the drug in a na&#xEF;ve population, especially when doctors I think generally are of the belief that the fixed-dose combination is coming so soon? Or is there some other factor here? Like has J&amp;J been in semi-launch mode with 278 as a single pill? Can you help me understand that a little bit better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Thomas, I don't think it would be right of Gilead to sort of be commenting on the sort of qualitative performance of Tibotec. Please bear in mind that, as of our Q1 data from Synovate, 55% of new patients began on Atripla; 55% began on a single-tablet regimen. So as John Milligan said, single tablets have been transformational. They're not a nice-to-have; they are part and parcel of delivering HIV care.</p>
          <p>And I think Edurant/Rilpivirin, what is profiled, where it's got a specific profile has not been pointed out. It was just probably going to be modest, as a divided-dose drug. And honestly, we have not been shocked; we have not been sort of sideswiped by what has happened. It's entirely explainable. And we have always known that it would be all about the single tablet. And I think Tibotec always knew it'd be about the single tablet; hence their reasons for coming to produce the fixed-dose combination in the first place.</p>
          <p>So I think it's kind of what we expected. The pricing reimbursement has gone well, but they're still working through that process. With Medicare programs &#x2013; with Medicare Part D, there is a 90-day window that they've got to react in, but it's 90 days. So there's always a little bit of a drag on uptake of products. But I think it's really the profile and the need for having Rilpivirin in a single tablet. That's what this is all about.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. As you prepare to launch these new drugs in the next coming months and years, I'm just wondering what your long-term philosophy is on pricing because, as I see it, you could price higher to reflect the new agents in the combination, or you could price it on the lower end to maintain your market-leading share and create a better value proposition versus generics and other companies with new drugs coming out. I'm wondering if you can &#x2013; I know you can't tell us what the pricing would be, but just general philosophy on that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hey, Joel, it's John Milligan. Yeah, you're right; it's very difficult to talk about these things. I do want to remind you of a couple things. So contractually for example with the Rilpivirin/Truvada combination, Johnson &amp; Johnson/Tibotec is responsible in all jurisdictions for the pricing of Rilpivirin, and we simply follow that with the addition of the price of Truvada. So we have no flexibility in that pricing.</p>
          <p>Obviously with regard to the Quad, we have choices to make in how we're going to price that for the future. And I think that will depend somewhat on how the data sets turn out and somewhat how we feel the environment will be in the future. But I think it's too early to speculate, and I certainly &#x2013; until we have further work done on our own and to figure out exactly where we're going to come out on pricing, I think it's just not right to speculate on a call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. A macro-themed question &#x2013; what in the U.S. does your work in Washington suggest could happen with dual eligibles, and remind me your exposure impact there for dual eligibles.</p>
          <p>And then in Europe macro question &#x2013; with regards to pricing, specifically in Germany and other nations we've heard about a lot of price concessions. So can you just comment on European pricing trends either last quarter or first half of this year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Michael, I'll take a couple. And John Milligan does an awful lot of work in Washington, so I'll let John talk about kind of the landscape as he sees it.</p>
          <p>FYI in terms of dual eligible, the slide that had been previously in our deck, if you remember, 9% by volume of our payer mix is the Medicare Part D dual eligibles. So that's as per the previous slides we had for Q1.</p>
          <p>As you know, there were significant price decreases that were administered by governments in Spain and Germany. Spain was 7.5%, and Germany was 10%. That was as a rebate that were given out in 2010.</p>
          <p>To be honest, Michael, I don't think you can make any bets on what governments might do coming forward. We all know that there are still countries in difficulties. We continue to watch the situation very carefully. I think that tends to be the Portugals, Islands, Greece, Spains. There's also been significant, in the past sort of 18 months, price actions also in Turkey. So we just have to be like the rest of the pharmaceutical industry and see what we can do to influence and to try and keep our prices there.</p>
          <p>I have to say I think HIV can do well. Number one, we are a hospital product, and of course we're a very specialist product. We had some discussions in Portugal over last year where I actually think they were very attracted to Atripla because it's much more economical than a boosted protease. So there are advantages that sometimes come out of these very difficult situations.</p>
          <p>John, on Washington?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, Michael, as you know, there are certain members of Congress who are still upset with what happened when Medicare Part D was put in. As you can recall, in years past when those patients went from Medicaid to Medicare, Gilead and other companies got a change in the net price that was favorable to the industry. And there are still certain members of Congress who are quite sore about that.</p>
          <p>But it was really a legal issue. There is no way to discount into that segment legally for a company like Gilead. And so they are agitating for a return to the Medicaid-type rebate, which would be about 23% of those products. And as Kevin mentioned, it's about 9% of our volume overall, but clearly some of the higher priced patients who would come down. So that's as far as I can quantitate it for you here today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I was just wondering maybe if you can comment a little bit about how you see the PI market evolving and how important is it for you to capture some of this market with new STRs and maybe the potential for the Quad and your new darunavir STR with this &#x2013; the ability to capture this bucket of patients. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Robyn, I'll chip in to start with. The regimen's number 2 and number 3 after Atripla &#x2013; a long way back; that has to be said &#x2013; is Truvada plus boosted Reyataz and Truvada plus boosted Prezista. So you've got Atripla at 37% of all treated patients. And you drop down quite significantly where you drop down to Truvada plus Reyataz at 12%, and Truvada plus Prezista about 8%. So it's about 20% of all treated patients. And if you then add in Truvada plus Kaletra, that's another 5%.</p>
          <p>So you've got 25% of patients currently on a protease inhibitor, most of which are in a boosted situation. So that opens up a very nice, I think, opportunity for us, which we've never been able to do because of just the bulk of a potential tablet of Truvada plus a Prezista. So I think we could have a very nice small tablet. And we give the option where there are strong supporters in some quarters of physicians who like a protease inhibitor as their third agent. And of course I should also say that in European countries like France and in Italy, they've always been protease inhibitor markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for sneaking in my question. My question's actually on generic Epivir. Coming into 2011, there seemed to be chatter that generic Epivir could be launched in the first half of the year. I don't believe that's happened. So I was wondering if you could, one, give us an update on when that could come and then, second, let us know if you've had any conversations with payers, particularly ADAPs, to see how they would use generic Epivir, should it come, to reduce their budgetary constraints?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Phil, it's Kevin. No, we have not seen any sight or sound of generic 3tc in the United States &#x2013; nothing whatsoever. I think we were always considering that the impact would be very, very small indeed. Bear in mind there's only 11,000 patients on branded Epivir today and only 39,000 on Combivir.</p>
          <p>So due to our success and the preference in guidelines, preference in clinical practice to Truvada-based regimens, either Truvada plus something or of course with our very, very great success with Atripla, as a result of that, other products have contracted. So really the attractiveness of introducing a single generic compound just to exchange with the branded is, well, less than modest.</p>
          <p>So I don't think it's something that a generic company's going to chase. I think going forward, perhaps sometime in 2012, we may well see a Combivir come to market. But we've always said that that's probably again impact limited to the high control areas such as corrections in the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess on the generic Epivir, what I was wondering &#x2013; some of our physicians, especially the ADAPs, may try to force therapeutic substitution onto Epivir in order to save, basically, a third of the price of an HIV regimen. Is that something that you've heard in any of your discussions with the ADAPs, and is that even possible or practical?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Phil, no, not at all &#x2013; categorically not at all. We don't hear that from ADAPs and certainly don't hear it from managed care. Don't forget that ADAP is still in the business of access. They want to try to keep the clinical choice in the hands of the physician. And 3tc in the United States is not part of preferred regimens. So physicians want to use the preferred regimens. Obviously they want to have their patients on drug. And whilst wait lists in some areas go up, we have our patient assistance programs, and we have extremely good coverage elsewhere in managed care. So that is not a pressure point that ADAPs, to our knowledge in any shape or form, are bringing to bear.</p>
