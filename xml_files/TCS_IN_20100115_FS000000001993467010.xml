          <p>Chandra and Maha will give a brief overview of the company's performance, followed by a Q&amp;A session. As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance. Anything said on this call, which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be concluded as forward-looking statement must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces and we have outlined these risks in the second slide of the results presentation that was e-mailed to you earlier this evening, and which is also available on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Chandra to begin the proceedings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kedar, and thank you all for joining the call. To summarize, I think we have had what I consider as another very fine quarter from a TCS point of view. If you really look at the key parameters, we have had very credible and excellent volume growth of 6.57%. And growth in terms of rupee terms, about 2.9% and dollar terms, 6.34%, and we have done very well on the margins. At the gross margin level, we've improved 68 basis points, and at the operating margin level, 103 basis points, and at the net margin level, over 146 basis points. So it's been a good quarter from -- both from a revenue point of view -- 164 basis points at the net margin level -- and also from the margin point of view.</p>
          <p>The highlights are, the growth has come across the board. While the BFSI sector has led the growth in terms of the momentum, for the first quarter and last several quarters, we have seen an absolute revenue increase in every single vertical. In some verticals, it's small, but nevertheless it is growth.</p>
          <p>The second is that we have also grown and delivered absolute growth in every single market in which we operate, be it the U.S., the U.K., Continental Europe or Asia-Pacific, India or Latin America. And we have had to manage a significant headwind in terms of the currency exchange, which, I'm pretty sure, Maha will explain shortly.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the deals, we have won 10 large deals. And again, the deal wins have come across sectors; two of them from retail, two of them from media, two of them from government, and one each from BFS, travel, manufacturing and licenses and healthcare.</p>
          <p>The number of deals that we are pursuing is also very healthy. We see the deal cycles coming to normalcy, and <mark type="inaudible" /> new clients have been added. We have added seven new clients in the 5 million-revenue bracket. So I think overall it's a very holistic performance and delivering excellent results on the business parameters. And our teams have been able to operationally ramp up to the volume demand by leveraging the utilization to a significantly high number. So overall, we are pretty happy and we look quite positive towards the future.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I'll turn it over to Maha, and then later on we can take questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chandra. As he has said, it will be the most satisfying quarter with a strong broad-based growth recovery and the largest sequential volume growth in the last eight quarters. We posted a revenue growth of 2.9% in INR terms, and 6.3% in U.S. dollar terms. The currency, of course, played spoilsport, the rupee appreciated against every major currency, posting a strong headwind on the topline and on our margin.</p>
          <p>Now, let me give you details of how each of the revenue drivers played out this quarter. Volume was 6.6% plus, pricing flat, exchange movement minus 2.5%, effort mix minus 1.2% and therefore the total is a plus 2.9% on revenue in rupee terms. In U.S. dollar terms, all the drivers remained the same except currency, instead of a negative impact to that, we had a positive currency benefit of 0.9%, positive cross-currency benefit.</p>
          <p>The stronger rupee impacted our margins as well. In the past, I've often said that a 1% movement of the INR against USD results in 35 to 40 basis point impact on operating margin, other currencies remaining static. But unlike earlier when cross-currency movements softened the blow, it works against us this time. So, while INR moved 3.2% against U.S. dollar, overall impact on our EBIT margin this quarter was 157 basis points negative. Despite this headwind, we expanded both our gross margin and operating margin by better leveraging our existing cost base to deliver higher revenues and through, of course, our continued rigor in cost management.</p>
          <p>Operating margin expanded by 103 basis points this quarter on a quarter-on-quarter basis to 27.30%. I already spoke of the currency impact; let me now share with you the impact from the other margin drivers at the EBIT level. Offshore shift gave us a positive 17 basis points, rate productivity change gave us 217 basis point positive, SG&amp;A efficiencies gave us 36 basis points positive and overall after considering the negative 167 basis points of exchange, the overall increase was 103 basis points.</p>
          <p>In the other income, the rupee appreciation and the ever-goodly amount of hedges, all hedges, meant a much smaller ForEx loss of 355 million rupees compared to 1.1 billion rupees in the previous quarter. Our net margin was 23.5%, an increase of 154 basis points on a sequential basis.</p>
          <p>Lastly, our DSO stood at 75 and we hold 75 billion rupees in cash and liquid funds.</p>
          <p>With that, we can open the lines to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question is from the line of Mr. Moshe Katri of Cowen &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah thanks, and congratulations for a strong quarter. Maybe Chandra can talk a bit about the client IT budgets for calendar year 2010. Are we getting to a point where predominantly the majority of them are all set? What sort of spending are we talking about directionally, up or down or flat? And then what sort of projects are they willing to fund? Are we still kind of in a cost take-out mode or are we also talking about transformational projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we still don't have all the information yet. We will need a little more time. I think probably in another month we should have all the information about all the clients. But having said that, based on the clients for whom we know the data, it's a mixed bag. Many of them have flat budgets. There are some situations in which they are definitely increasing the budget. But in most cases, they are looking to save money in running the business so that they can create some funds for investing in new developmental work. So that's the trend we are seeing, but we don't have all the information yet to give you a very clear picture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you also talk a bit about your head count addition plans for the next six to 12 months? And then, again, you had a very strong quarter with strong margins. Can you talk a bit about the various levers that's going to -- that will let you sustain those margins down the road? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, in terms of the head count, there are two comments I want to make. First is that for the next fiscal year, we are still going through the planning cycle. So we're not going to give you a firm number in terms of how many people we are going to hire yet. But having said that, the hiring this quarter has been pretty strong. It's more than what we projected at the end of the last quarter and in the call. We've seen the demand recovery, so we have not only taken on board the trainees to whom we have made the offers, we have recruited laterally about 3,000 and odd people this quarter and we're continuing to recruit in the current environment. In fact, we have started going to the campuses and started making offers. Probably Ajoy, at some point in the call can give you more color. Then with regard to the margin levers, there we continue to execute very well. I think if you really look at the numbers, the gross margin improvement has purely come because of better execution of engagements. And we will continue to look at that as an important lever on how better to execute our fixed-price projects and how can we get better productivity and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>The pricing, I think, will remain stable in near term. The pricing power will return, but it's a few quarters away in my opinion.</p>
          <p>Then, in terms of the utilization, we have always said that if required we will be willing to ramp up the utilization, because we are no longer a company with a small base, with 150,000 people, even at 80%, we see opportunities. That's what we have done this quarter. And currently, we are actively recruiting to create a bench so that we're able to take advantage of the demand that may come in the next fiscal. But having said that, we will continue to exercise utilization as a lever and we are pretty good at it and we will continue to do better.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of the SG&amp;A, we have not been shying away in terms of making investments. Even in this quarter, if you really see, there are marketing-related costs, whether it is in terms of travel or communication expenses, et cetera, we have gone ahead and then made the investment. Those numbers have gone up. So we will look at those numbers and continue to focus. And the offshore leverage is a drive that we have put on course. And even in this quarter, I think, as Maha explained a few minutes ago, almost 121 basis points was the negative impact on the revenues because of the movement of work offshore. So we are not stopping that drive, so that drive will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have mentioned that they have already done a significant margin improvement in this year, in the nine months, 350 basis points. And we have exercised on the levers and so on. And so I think, going forward, definitely our cost ratio there should be capable of delivering more revenue on an SG&amp;A basis. But the other levers and so on we'll be cautiously exercising them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. My first question is just around growth. I wonder if you could talk about what sort of drove it this quarter? I know, we can see that BFSI was very strong, but maybe you could talk about in reference to clients, and if it's just &#x2013; is this -- it was a bit of a flush here in the quarter? Was there any particular change in their mood or confidence that took place, and do you think that's going to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the things we like about this quarter is that there is no one-off, there is no one single client, which is delivering -- which has delivered a huge volume or impacted the growth in any material way. The growth has come from across clients and across verticals, and we have, on a constant currency basis, delivered very good growth, not only in BFSI, but also in telecom, retail, manufacturing and licenses, high tech.</p>
          <p>So -- manufacturing is little less, much less than compared to others, but still it delivered little growth, and energy and utilities has particularly done very, very well this quarter. So I think we have seen a broad-based growth in every vertical. And from a market point of view also, as I said, we have grown in every market. So there is no one-off from any client.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, the troubled verticals from our point of view were always manufacturing, telecom and high tech, and last three or four quarters we have been extremely cautious about it. I'm not saying that those verticals are delivering significant ramp-ups, but they definitely have turned the corner. And in our opinion they will deliver incremental growth, albeit, the volume will be low.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would you say that the confidence on part of most of your client base is, they've to start spending again? Do you expect that to be the trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only way I can answer is that answer to this question, between the October 16 call and today, it is more positive today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just kind of looking at margins, have you guys talked about wage increases for next year and any possible impacts on that? And then just maybe you could talk a little bit about, if you've prepared for the rupee to appreciate and any changes to your hedging policy in that regard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will probably make one statement then I'll leave it for Maha to elaborate. There is definitely going to be a wage increase and we are discussing it at this point in time and that will definitely have an impact on margins, because that will come, but we don't know yet. But I'll leave Maha to elaborate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the wage, let me answer as far as this increase is concerned, as Chandra talked about, it's for the next year. As far as this year is concerned, we are consistently following the policy of adding to the variable allowance. Even this quarter we have given increase of the same level as the last quarter, at the end of this quarter based on the good performance and so on. So that is the lever that we will continue to use and as far as this year is concerned.</p>
          <p>In terms of the exchange rate, all indications are that the rupee will appreciate. Most of the modeling that is going on at this moment in time takes the rupee rate to somewhere between around 44.5 as far as next year is concerned, not in this quarter, but next year is concerned. We have to keep a watch on it, as we finalize our budget for FY '11, keeping with the policy that we have, we would take a provision as far as the rate is concerned and protect that rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, could you -- just one last question. Is there any way we could put any kind of numerical basis point impacts on what wages will do? Is it a 100 basis point impact, any numbers you could furnish on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not still done the rate calculations yet, so it's too early for us to give you a feel for it. And in any case, we don't give guidance. But in another six weeks or eight weeks, we'll have a very clear picture in terms of the impact it's going to have. So at the same time, I think we are going to be continuing to focus on the margin levers so that we can minimize any impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Foresi. Our next question is from the line of Rishi Maheshwari of Enam Asset Management. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. I also wanted to understand, when you said that there has not been one particular client who has contributed, but my calculation says the top client has actually grown by about 27%. Now is there something over there or is that -- has that been a one-off or can you throw some color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, that metric is calculated on a EM basis. And the Citigroup acquisition we did is now counted for all the four quarters for the client, whereas in the previous quarter, it would have got counted only for three quarters. So it's not an incremental growth, it's just that on a EM basis that client looks higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I also wanted to understand your headway in banks as a product. What is happening over there? <mark type="inaudible" /> just released about 6% license sales growth. How are we placed over there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is doing well. In fact, we have had a few wins even in this quarter, very credible wins. So banks have started growing, delivering growth. In fact, they delivered growth for the first time last quarter. And again, on the back of that, it has delivered growth this quarter. So banks is on growth, both in terms of license and -- license revenue as well as overall system integration revenues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a constant currency basis, it will be around -- somewhere around 4%. 3.5 to 4, 3.5% or so.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. Terrific quarter. Congratulations. I have a question on the quality of revenue growth. Obviously, as you also highlighted it's been a very good and broad based. Just wanted to get some clarification on whether this is -- how sustainable it is, and it will be very helpful if you can take us through some of the demand generators in the non-BFSI clients or the non-BFSI segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think the way to look at it is that we did a very good Q1 this year and then when we did the Q1 commentary we said we feel positive at the end of Q1 than Q4. And we had a better Q2 and we said the same thing at the end of Q2. And now again Q3, we feel the recovery process has improved further. But having said that, I would really caution you and ask you to take a look more on a four to six quarter perspective rather than immediate quarter perspective. The volumes are beginning to show in many verticals. So we generally feel that it's going to be a growth quarter going forward and we see most of the verticals delivering growth, but some of them will grow in small measures. So that's what I can tell you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for taking my question. This is with regards to offshore leverage. How much more leverage do we have there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, this is a program that we put in place several quarters ago, but in the last three or four quarters, we have done a significant movement and jump, as you can see. But we'll continue to do that. There is still more leverage, but you should not expect miracles in terms of a huge movement in any given quarter. But I think directionally going forward for the future quarters, you will see improvement and also leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And the second one, would -- if you could just throw some light or some update in terms of Diligenta and also in terms of how CGSL is progressing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Diligenta, I think we have already said that the transformation program is going to be completed in April 2010. So from -- that will give them a lot of leverage in the marketplace. So our belief is that beyond that date they will be in a much better position to bring deals and add new clients, not only bring additional volume, but also do transformation for booking volumes. That's how it is. And in terms of CGSL I think it is ahead of the business case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And just to clarify, the growth in BFSI, the top client, the contribution will not be as high as it seems to because of the 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> . No, no -- very, very -- in fact, the top client's growth is not that significant on a quarterly basis. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, congratulations <mark type="inaudible" /> on a great quarter. Couple of questions. You have seen huge growth in global consulting service line, so if you can throw some color on that? Have you &#x2013; do you ramp up or --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I think I mentioned in the last analyst call saying that since the end of September we are seeing consulting projects coming back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we had the downturn, the consulting was most affected. In fact, we went down very badly in terms of share of revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All you're seeing is that those engagements are coming back. So consulting will always be a niche play, it will never be a volume play. So it's coming back 2 or 3% share. It used to be at towards the 3.5% share and we went back to 2.5% share and then it's coming back now. So we're happy, but I think it's going to grow from here, but you shouldn't expect huge volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on India in particular, we have seen superb growth. We've added almost like 27 million to our topline. Now, it is also not from CNC as we can see from the numbers. So just wondering is this growth sort of sustainable, because India is mostly -- traditionally has been more project-based. So do you have some color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In India we have grown. When you say 27 million, it is not $27 million of incremental growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So India is at 8% sequential growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I mean it is a very good quarter for India and it has done well, but in terms of incremental revenue, it is not <mark type="inaudible" />. Overall, we are close to $98 million in incremental revenue. On that India's share is not the kind of numbers you are talking about, but it's been -- it's been a very good quarter for the Indian geography, the team has done well, and we're seeing positive signs. The problem with our Indian revenues, India revenues has always been the volatility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have been saying in the call that we are working towards getting the business mix right so that we do not have huge ups and downs. We're still working on it. I wouldn't say that we have got -- we got it in the perfect place. So we are very positive about India and we expect to see incremental revenues to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, you know, just one data point if you can share, on the topline on a like-to-like basis what will be the growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis, because you follow that LTM percentage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I said, it is very minimal. It is less than the company average growth rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Thank you, sir. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Pal. Our next question is from the line of Kunal Sangoi of Edelweiss Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations, strong quarter. Actually my question is with regards to, if you look at the trend of enterprise solutions, it's the same quarter-on-quarter growth and even some of your other peers have already reported, it seems that discretionary spend seems to be reviving. Would you agree to that reading, or it's more of a pent-up or, you know, whether it can sustain going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question and I am at the very same place as you are. I am quite happy to note that we have been able to grow the consulting revenues as well as the enterprise solutions revenues this quarter, a good share. This is a positive indication for us to think that the discretionary spend will come back, but I don't have any other proof points to say that we are going to have a good discretionary spending in Q4 or in Q1, we are watching.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question relates regarding the pricing on the larger deals. I think we have once again signed 10 large deals. Could you comment on what are the -- what are the engagement models and how is the pricing for those deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The engagement models are pretty much standard engagement models, <mark type="inaudible" /> office space. There's no fancy structures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as I said, the pricing is pretty much of a company average track. So there is no significant increase and we are maintaining our pricing, we are not talking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Sangoi. Our next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah of ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just in terms of utilization, if you look at the percentage increase in the employee base as well as the volume growth, it's not much of a difference, but the spike in the utilization seems very high. Can you elaborate more on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the utilization, if you look at the utilization excluding trainees that we have pushed up to 81.1% and utilization including trainees have gone up to about 77.2%. So during this quarter, from a discount addition point of view, at a consolidated level we have done 12,600 plus, but which included a significant portion of trainees as well, as Chandra mentioned in the beginning. So the focus has been to meet the demand, business demand, meet the demand through the existing people that we have and that is the reason for utilization to go up to that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also even the -- including utilization was high. So much of the addition has happened in the later part of the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And how do you believe this trend line, even in the fourth quarter we are adding significant amount of employees. So even that addition will be staggered at the later part of the Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Q4 will be slightly more uniform as far as everything is concerned, and yes -- but overall the portion towards the end of the quarter, yes that will be slightly higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, at least, Maha, in media channels, you mentioned that for the next quarter, we are covered at 45.7. So is there any hedging, incremental hedging which we have taken which will expire in the fourth quarter itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had -- our original hedge is only $39 million and we have taken another $380 million during this quarter. And these were taken at various levels and so on. And so as a matter of policy right now, I mean, as a factor we are essentially covering the dollar exposure, because we find that both pound and euro are going to be remaining steady at the present place. And therefore against the dollar exposure of a little over $500 million, I'm talking about the next exposure, because we also have payments in dollars. We are substantially covered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just, there is a reclassification in terms of North American revenue to India revenue. Any reason for that -- for those <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was during -- in one of the specific elimination rounds last quarter, there was a slight issue and that was corrected as part of the software concerned. There was nothing -- it was from a subsidiary to the faring company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe some thoughts on the tax rate going forward, do you think there is an opportunity for the STPI to be extended again, particularly since it's been more difficult for you to capture SEZ benefits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax rate as far as this quarter is concerned, was 15.5% and next year in Europe, some of the STPI is going out and so on. We have been essentially talking in terms of 18% to 19%. And that is the STPI is going after 10 years. The question of STPI extension overall is still a debatable question. I don't think we can take any firm view at this moment in time given that we are not getting very strong indications from the government people on that.</p>
          <p>We would hope for that, but that's not taken as -- given in all our planning. Actually on SEZ, we have picked up all the expansions in the last three or four years when it comes through SEZ. So as a percentage, SEZ revenue continues to go up within the organization, and therefore we will take some benefit, which is the reason why we are talking about 18 to 19% as the figure for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And can you discuss a little bit what you're hearing on the protectionism front coming out of the United States, the United Kingdom, given that unemployment remains so high in both geographies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on protectionism front, as far as the U.S. is concerned, it is basically that Immigration Reform Bill, that is -- that will be picked up and at this stage, it is not very clear which is the way it's going to take. So we'll have to wait and watch. But so far, as far as our operations are concerned, at this point in time, we have not seen any impact whatsoever. As far as U.K. is concerned, the MAC has submitted its recommendation and these have been accepted. I think there has been a slight increase as far as the minimum wages are concerned, but we are above that, it has no impact on TCS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question, you talked about when you adjust the top account, it's no change, but if you adjust the BFSI number to look at just the quarter, what kind of increase did that have on a sort of a organic basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On an organic basis, the BFSI volume growth is about 7.3%. But the revenue growth is small because the offshore movement in BFSI was higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Hi. Congrats on a good quarter. I think some form of it has been already asked.

          <p>I think we are very happy with where we are. I think we are not saying that we won't increase it from here. The intent is to create a bench from here. We are doing that, but if there is a demand pickup and we have to ramp up, we'll ramp up <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>No, we are very comfortable as far as the supply side is concerned. We're not finding any problem whatsoever. And hiring is also inclusive of trainees who will come in. So we're not finding any concern as far as availability on the supply of talent pool is concerned.</p>

          <p>Hello, good evening, and congrats on a great quarter. Just a couple of questions. You said you won 10 large deals, new deals. Can you tell us what deals are you seeing and now what kind of services are these mostly? Is there a pattern across the deals that you have won?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are different types of deals. There are deals in the assurance space or deals in ADM or application management and also think there is -- there are deals in the infrastructure space. There are lots of opportunities that we are winning in the e-commerce in the retail sector, a number of e-commerce deals we have won during the quarter. Then remote infrastructure management is another area we are seeing a lot of traction. So I think the deals are of different kinds, we're getting a mixed type of deals and the deals vary from 50 million to 100 million and on a multi-year basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, all I can tell you is that the number of deals we won this quarter is very healthy compared to the last two quarters. Even though we announced deals in last few quarters, here we announced more deals and across multiple sectors and hybridly healthier. I feel that the deal decision cycles are also becoming normal. And so I would just say that it's more positive than last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My next question is on your revenue from new clients. I've seen that has increased over the last two quarters. Do you see a case of -- most of your incremental growth coming from new clients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think every year the initializing at the beginning of the quarter, so you will always find the revenue from the new clients going up successfully in every quarter and as you think of Q4 and that's the way the metric was -- metric as reported. So I think nothing unusual about it. So revenues will come from both existing clients as well as new clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I just wanted to get your comments on how is the demand, especially for services like BPO and IMS from BFSI segment, because a lot of them are doing integration deals now. Do you see them going out and start doling out BPO and IMS contracts to ensure cut OpEx cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is definitely opportunities in the BFSI space for the BPO contracts. In fact, we have won few deals in the BFSI sector in the BPO space. And the infrastructure management contracts are coming across verticals. Definitely -- see, as I said, customers are definitely looking to get more bang for the buck in terms of running the business, driving the efficiency is the number one priority for all corporations across industry, definitely in the financial services sector. So it may translate into more of medium work, it may translate into BPO work or integrated infrastructure and ADM or infrastructure and BPO work. So all these things, trends, you will see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, my next question is, Engineering and Industrial Services, because that service line has been more or less flat except for this quarter, we've been seeing it there. How was the deal flow or deal closures in that particular service line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, the minimum demand that you have &#x2013; that was for &#x2013; the comment you are making is primarily because it is totally linked to the manufacturing industry. And the manufacturing revenues were having difficult time for the last several quarters and definitely when such a situation occurs the engineering spend will be cut and it was very hugely impacted. And we are trying to &#x2013; we are happy that the recovery is coming into that sector. So it will be a slow recovery, as I said in the manufacturing space, but definitely the recovery is happening and we're seeing incremental revenues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Hi, congrats to the management on the great set of numbers. I just had a couple of questions. Firstly, on the discretionary spend part, we have seen a lot of services, most the discretionary <mark type="inaudible" />. Just wanted to understand which are the verticals, which are &#x2013; I mean which are the verticals where you're seeing this uptick?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the Enterprise Solutions side, just wanted to get your perspective on SAP's recent move where they have offered a choice to their customers between a full range enterprise support and a low price standard package. So could this &#x2013; this might have an impact on SAP support and maintenance revenues, and I mean, how do you read this? I mean, how would this affect your maintenance revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of verticals, definitely BFSI, retail, utilities, these are sectors we are seeing higher level of traction, and pharma, compared to the other verticals. And in terms of the SAP's announcement, I don't think that will have a direct impact on our support and maintenance revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks. That was helpful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I want to know this operating margin and your EBIT margin, is &#x2013; has it gone up mainly because of telecom has seen better margins this quarter on a sequential basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It is all over, Ranjit. We have shown improvement in gross margin because we have delivered, and one of the things that we did talk about was utilization that was also the efficient execution and so on. So there is not &#x2013; no question of why a single sector is growing in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am looking at the EBIT numbers, which you have given in the Indian GAAP. And as per that, your EBIT margin for telecom is 8.5% sequentially up, and while most of the others are maybe either negative or maybe flat or marginally up.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Shinde. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. I just had a follow-up question on the utilization, I think it went up to 77% this quarter, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, including trainees, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I was wondering, as we kind of move up a little bit further, how high do you think you can raise utilization rates if, for example, you have to take in wage increase <mark type="inaudible" /> correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I think we have always said that excluding trainees, 78, 79% is good, including trainees 73 to 75% is good. So in a sense that the current utilization levels are a little higher than normally what we put as our ideal utilization. Having said that, as the scale increases, we feel that we should be able to be increase utilization. So I think &#x2013; the only way I can say &#x2013; I can explain &#x2013; I can answer your question is that we are not going to put a higher target at this point in time, but should there be a need, then we will be able to do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so just to run through the levers, margin levers you have right now, do you think that there is maybe some more room, a little bit more room on utilization. What are some of the other ones that you think you have left in the model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Offshore leverage and also more execution &#x2013; productivity and execution and then --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>SG&amp;A efficiency.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>SG&amp;A efficiency as we look at it. Then finally I think when the pricing power returns, pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one last question on offshore leverage, how much do you think &#x2013; how much more you think you can move offshore or is there just no stopping to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean there is scope for moving more for next several quarters, but it will be driven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it will be like maybe 1 or 2%?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Foresi. Our next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan of Centrum Broking. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just had a follow-up question. See, I think we have been surprised with the pullback in the way volume growth has really returned, and I just wanted your comments on what is your reading into how you'd like to see &#x2013; how you'd probably see that going forward? Is it that it could be stronger, could it be at the same pace, how do you read into it? Second was with regard to, I think, you have won a government deal. I think when there is this whole talk of protectionism and things like that, there seems to be, I think, Cardiff of the UK countries. So I just wanted your thoughts on how are those deals different, is it more onsite, how are we really being able to break that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of volumes, see some of this is pent-up demand also. So you have to be cautious in terms of putting a graph to extrapolate huge growth, volume growth to recover. So I would really request you to exercise some caution in terms of projections. But we're quite positive about the future. It has been incrementally improving every quarter and today we are in a better position than we were last &#x2013; a quarter before or two quarters before.</p>
          <p>Then, with respect to the government contracts, I mean, in many of these contracts, it depends on the value proposition. So there are deals where we use their intellectual properties, there are deals in which you kind of meet all the criteria. It is not necessarily all of it is to be executed onsite. So there is no straightforward answer to you saying that this is how all the government deals are to be done. The government deals are different and each deal is different. So you've got to work on it. So very difficult to give a standard formula.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is it safe to say that the overall traction in the government space with regard to Indian vendors has significantly increased as compared to what it was probably couple of quarters earlier or a year back in terms of --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I mean, we're still doing very little in the government sector outside India. So I think that will be a very broad-brush statement, which I'll not make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And lastly was with regard to telecom, is it that telecom, I think, we're seeing a comeback, is that likely to be a sustainable thing going forward or is --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Telecom will grow, but it will be at a very low rate...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Fair enough. And finally with manufacturing per se, I think manufacturing, high tech, I think we were a little cautious earlier on these sectors. Is it that these have come back --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, my comments for all the three sectors is that we have turned the corner, but the growth rate is going to be pretty slow, low volumes, but there is going to be positive growth. That's the way I look at it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What I meant to say is the BFSI growth visibility will continue being in strong for the coming quarters?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, it's doing well, it's definitely doing well. But if you see the deals we have won, so out of the 10 deals, only one we've announced in BFSI. So it is not skewed towards BFSI, but BFSI's deal pipeline is healthy, quite good and also ramp-ups are happening. But it won't be -- I think, we should look for more customer broad based growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Yeah, I think, we have very sufficient sales strength and we are well invested in every market.

So the primary cuts in G&amp;A was not in &#x2013; on the sales and marketing and that journey has been completed or there will be some improvements, but by and large, that was the cost that we took.

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine. And one more question on, like, what was the impact of utilization improvement on EBITDA margins this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said, basically the point that we were making was that if you remove the exchange effect, if you remove the onsite/offshore mix all the others have really come out of these factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot, and congrats on a great quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, sir, congrats on a very good quarter. I just wanted some color on the kind of deals we have seen in the Indian context. Where are we actually seeing a ramp up in the revenues or are we having some large deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were the deals that we have been hiding for the past several quarters, both in the government sector and the private sector, energy sector, banking sector, across sectors we have been doing projects and we've been winning engagements and those are playing out now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sir. And just wanted one more comment on the kind of onshore and nearshore hiring you're planning, you're planning to add some more over there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the next quarter, yes, we have. Even in this quarter, we have done gross addition, both at onshore as well as near-shore and it will be very similar to that in the next quarter as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, sir. Thank you and congrats again on another great quarter.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Bhardwaj. Our last question is from the line of Abhijit Gora of Sharekhan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sir, my question is if you can just throw light on the <mark type="inaudible" /> on that point, it will be of a great help to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the margin lever is concerned, the exchange rate in fact we said 1.67% negative, offshore leverage was 17 basis point positive and bad debt provision gave us a 62 bps -- basis point positive, and all the others put together gave us 1.91%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Gora. Ladies and gentlemen that was the last question. I'll now hand the conference over to Mr. Kedar Shirali and the management for their closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rachelle. I'll now request Chandra to deliver the conference's closing comments for tonight.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, in summary, I'd like to leave a few messages. It has been a fine quarter from our point of view. And we've seen the different markets and the different industries showing recovery and showing incremental revenues across the board. We remain positive about the future and outlook. However, on the volume front, I would just ask all of you not to extrapolate, because some of the demand that's coming is front-end demand as well. Those will be my summary comments. And, thank you all very much, and wish you a very great 2010.</p>
