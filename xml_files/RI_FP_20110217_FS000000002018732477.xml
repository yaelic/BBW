          <p>So thank you for joining us this morning. Pierre Pringuet and Gilles Bogaert will be commenting Pernod Ricard Group's Interim Results for the 2010/2011 period from the 1st of July to the 31st of December 2010; our first half year.</p>
          <p>This presentation has been available on our website since 7.30 this morning. And the presentation that you'll hear will last about half an hour. We'll have another half hour for questions after that.</p>
          <p>Just to remind you that you introduce yourselves, the name of the company you represent, and no more than three questions to ensure everybody has the opportunity to ask questions.</p>
          <p>So we have a busy schedule, and so I give the floor without further ado to Pierre Pringuet, who is about to start.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Denis Fi&#xE9;vet. Good morning, everybody. You are all familiar with the Chinese calendar, so this is now the year of the Rabbit. I think we can say that in Pernod Ricard's zodiac, 2010/2011 will be the year of the recovery. And of course, this is reflected in the sharp increase in sales and results, strong deleveraging, and we've decided to revise our annual guidance upwards, with an objective of 7% growth. We'll be looking at all of this of course in detail.</p>
          <p>First of all, the key figures. Revenue of almost &#x20AC;4.3 billion; that's 13% growth, or organic growth of 7%. This has been driven by our Top 14 brands, our 14 strategic brands, with the sales volume up 8% and organic sales growth of 13%. So the very positive price effect here. It has also been driven by the emerging markets, with sales of 16%. But the really good news is that the economies in the West have recovered, particularly in Europe and North America, where sales were up 2%.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, you will see that, as we announced, we have reinforced our investment in A&amp;P, advertising and promotional expenditure; up 11%. The A&amp;P to sales ratio now rising from 17% to 17.9%. So our results have improved. Profit from recurring operations of &#x20AC;1.21 billion; that's 14% growth, or organic growth of 8%.</p>
          <p>The Group share of net profit from recurring operations was &#x20AC;726 million; that's up 12%. And the Group share of net profit was &#x20AC;666 million; that's a 10% increase. I told you that we've delivered rapidly. We've reduced our debt by almost &#x20AC;900 million, &#x20AC;864 million, to be more precise, as a result of which our gearing is now 4.5, or was 4.5 at the end of December 2010. Six months prior to that, the gearing ratio was 4.9. So, yes, global recovery.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to review all these figures for you, but even though the recovery is relatively rapid, more or less depending on where we're looking at, there is nonetheless a very high volatility in the foreign exchange market. We will of course bear in mind the euro/dollar exchange rate, but we have a lot of other currencies we deal in, a lot of other currencies that we have an impact on our accounts, should I say, but Gilles will talk you about that at greater length. And of course, there was inevitably an increase in long-term interest rates, but you will see that we are pretty well hedged, given the hedging instruments and the structure of our debt.</p>
          <p>So sales analysis now. Sales were up a nominal 13% and organic 7%. The currency effect was plus 9%, largely due to the strengthening of the dollar but also to the Chinese yuan, the Indian rupee, the Australian dollar, the Mexican peso and so on, so forth. As for the effects of scope of consolidation, that was a minus 3% as a result of the disposal of a number of businesses in Spain and the Scandinavian countries; disposals that we talked to you about last year, and on which I think there is no reason to dwell.</p>
          <p>So what about our sources of growth? Well, our growth drivers are now more diversified. This is first of all true of our brands. First of all, our premium brands have seen their growth accelerate. Remember, that is one of the cornerstones of our strategy because we have always believed that it was the premium brands that would pick up when the economy recovered.</p>
          <p>This has been shown to be the case. Very strong growth of brands that have remained buoyant throughout the crisis. But Absolut is now posting growth again in the U.S.; we'll tell you more about that later on. And of course a marked rebound of Scotch whiskey, as well as champagne and Wine brands. As you know with champagnes, we're already talking about allocations if growth continues on the current trend.</p>
          <p>So they're the effects of brands and driving growth, but there's also the markets. And of course, continued strong growth in Asia and Latin American markets; there's strong recovery in Eastern Europe and Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere. But North America has also being recovering gradually at the U.S. and Canada, as has Western Europe.</p>
          <p>A few technical aspects now that have had an impact on our sales for the half year. In Venezuela, the difficulty is access to foreign currency. As a result, we have had to limit ourselves to the currencies we can take out of the country. This has had a limited impact on our performance. We corrected the currency effect in the accounts that we presented last summer. It's already reflected in our accounts here. We are looking at an impact in the region of &#x20AC;6 million in terms of profit from recurring operations.</p>
          <p>This brings us to France, where the latter part of the year was sluggish. Last year's sales were up; they weren't this year, not in the first half of 2010/2011. And of course you will remember that weather was not very favorable.</p>
          <p>As for China, this is one of the positive technical effects. Well, in China, first of all the Chinese New Year took place earlier this year, as result of which our shipments were in December. Secondly, our wholesalers started replenishing their inventories of Martell in the first quarter. This has a positive effect on the first half.</p>
          <p>Similarly, in Germany, the favorable impact was due to a price increase that had a negative impact on Q1 sales in the previous periods. And of course for Chivas, which I already mentioned previously, we did not make any sales to Japan in the first quarter a year ago, so far as we transferred the distribution of Chivas to our Japanese subsidiary. It's also the fact that the U.S. Duty Free shipments were impacted by the difficult economic climate and credit crunch.</p>
          <p>So they're the technical aspects that had an impact on sales in the first half year. You may have questions on these aspects, but we're commenting them now straight away.</p>
          <p>If we now fast-forward to the second quarter, figures are very similar. Nominal growth of 12%; 6% organic growth. And of course the organic growth, ForEx impact groups which are very similar to the first half figures.</p>
          <p>If we now look at the category, the product categories. And here, we've compared organic sales growth for the previous financial period; that's the first half of '09, '10, and the first half of '10, '11.</p>
          <p>First of all, with the exception of local spirit brands, the Top 14 Spirits and champagnes rose from plus 4% to plus 13%, and Priority Premium Wines rose from minus 2% to plus 3%. The local spirit brands fell from plus 4% to plus 2%, and other brands and activities improved from minus 3% to minus 1%. The total was plus 2% in '09, '10; plus 7% in the first half of '10, '11. Very favorable growth mixture. Just a quick word about the premium brands which represented 71% of our sales in the first half of the year; up three percentage points from the first half of the previous period.</p>
          <p>We are now going to review the Top 14. Volumes rose 8%, revenue rose 13%. Now, a new indicator for you now. The proportional Group sales: we've geared that before, but the current percentage of Group sales is 59%. What is new is the proportion of advertising and promotional expenditure, which we'll be giving you for all the other categories, by the way. We devote 76% of our advertising and promotional expenditure to the Top 14. The Group average is 18% of sales, if we round it off, but for the Top 14, the proportion of sales is much, much higher.</p>
          <p>So accelerated growth in the first half year, with a very positive price mix effect with 8% in volume and was 13% in revenue; that's a 5% improvement due to the price mix effect, with eight brands reporting double-digit organic sales growth. Need to remind you that Scotch whiskeys and champagne recovered impressively.</p>
          <p>Let's now review the various brands, beginning with Absolut. Volumes rose 8%, revenue rose 7%. And the seven &#x2013; the figures I'm giving are all organic growth. And speaking with the U.S., the improvement was confirmed, and we will give you three indicators to confirm that, or three successive periods: that's the first half of the year '09, '10; the second half year; and the first half year of the current financial year.</p>
          <p>Depletions were minus 5% in the first half a year ago; plus 2% in the second half of the previous period, that's January to June, 2010; and plus 4% in the first half of the current year, that's July to December. If we look at the Nielsen and NABCA figures, I won't list them off; these also reflect that strong improvement.</p>
          <p>So Absolut is now on course for the type of growth we wanted in the U.S. That is, between 2% and 4%. So we are now on course. As for the other markets, we have also got strong &#x2013; the strong double-digit growth we wanted to achieve; some plus 15% with the positive price mix effect. Very strong growth in France, Canada and Brazil, Asia and Middle East. We had a strong recovery in Germany, the U.K. and Poland, where prices were adjusted, or readjusted, to reposition the pricing of Absolut. Even in a difficult market like Spain, the Group &#x2013; the brand Absolut progressed, with the only exception being Greece. I think we're all familiar with the situation of Greece and will understand that effect.</p>
          <p>Number of slides on that as well showing you &#x2013; a number of photographs, should I say, on the slide showing some of the reasons for our strong success.</p>
          <p>So there have been a lot of marketing initiatives taken, particularly with Absolut Glimmer, or Glimmer should I say, which is this limited edition brought out last Christmas. Very solid performance of Absolut Berry Acai and Absolut Wild Tea. This is the ongoing brand. We also produced a limited edition of Absolut Watkins; Watkins is a famous designer. And we are conducting pilot tests on a number of markets with a super premium vodka called Absolut Elyx. But we will have opportunities to talk to you about that in the future.</p>
          <p>Chivas; volume was up 11%, revenue up 11%. I told you about the strong recovery of Scotch whiskies. Double-digit growth in Asia, particularly in China, India, Vietnam and the Duty Free markets. In China, in fact, we have bolstered our leadership in the Whisky market with the Chivas and Ballantine's. Our market share in China has improved considerably.</p>
          <p>Double-digit growth in the Americas, particularly in Latin America, Mexico, Brazil and the Duty Free markets. In the U.S., remember that our policy was to reinvest in the brand. Well, our depletions were positive at plus 2% and the Nielsen and NABCA figures were also positive.</p>
          <p>Chivas sales were stable in Europe; hiding in contrast, that includes very strong growth in Russia, France and the Duty Free markets, but a sharp fall in Greece and a marked decline in Spain. Africa and the Middle East posted strong growth. And as for the premium versions, Chivas 18-year-old has improved much better than the standard Chivas. The 18-year-old version rose 24% and the 25-year-old version, smaller volumes, almost doubled at plus 90%. We've also rolled out our Live with Chivalry platform, and I believe we have a short video on the last, or the most recent...</p>
          <p>[Video Presentation]</p>
          <p>There, you see the appeasing virtues of Chivas.</p>
          <p>Now, this is a very different type of spot that has a remarkable effect. This is the spot that we've launched on all our markets. First of all, it's been very instrumental in brand recognition.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the bottom right-hand side, you see this spectacular livery on that by Lacroix, Christian Lacroix. You may recall that we produced a special edition for the 12-year-old &#x2013; 12-year version of Chivas; this is the 18-year-old version, which is of course much more luxurious than its 12-year-old counterpart.</p>
          <p>Ballantine's; volumes up 9%, revenue up 13%. As I told you, the Scotch whiskies improved rapidly. Ballantine's Finest grow 7% with the strong growth in the numerous markets; more particularly, Africa and Middle East, Poland, Latin America, Asia and the Duty Free markets. However, the sales were down in Spain and Greece, but in Spain, might I add, we fared well. Certainly outperformed the market and took a number of excellent digital marketing initiatives with Carlos Jean, a music producer and &#x2013; famous music producer and disk jockey, which is very good evidence, very strong evidence, of our presence in the digital markets.</p>
          <p>Very strong progress of the premium versions of Ballantine's, the 12, particularly the 15, 17 and 20 and older brands, driven largely by Asia and Latin America. 17-year-old Ballantine's has been included in Jim Murray's Whisky Bible; one of the &#x2013; well, in fact it was named the World Whisky of the Year.</p>
          <p>I won't come back to what I've said about digital advertising, which is becoming increasingly important for taking up an increasingly large chunk of our A&amp;P expenditure. I might also mention our sponsorship of a golf tournament in Asia, which is part of the official tour; that's the Ballantine's Korean Golf Tournament.</p>
          <p>Martell. Sales volume up 20%, revenue up 32%. I think these figures are very, very eloquent. Our premiumization policy has been very successful. VS was down 4%, but Noblige up 48%, XO up 46% and Extra were up 65%, which are all a good reflection of the price increase &#x2013; sharp price increase in Asia.</p>
          <p>In China, we are modest. We say we're number two, but with a market share of 41% in terms of volume, we're very close to the market leader. And in the sales value, we're the clear leader, given our dominant position with the XO, Extra and other premium versions.</p>
          <p>A number of other markets grew very strongly in Asia; Malaysia, Singapore and so on. But maybe I should mention that the brands' growth was largely in the second half for a number of technical reasons I won't recall about China, but we also have to manage our replenishment over the long term. Remember that Martell is a cognac with original ingredients. With the Scotch whiskies, you need to distill and age the whiskies in Scotland, but you don't necessarily have to buy the barley in Scotland. Here, you have to distill grapes grown in the Charentes region, on the Atlantic Coast of France.</p>
          <p>As I said about champagnes earlier on, cognac is going to start allocating volumes. So we really have to manage our growth over the long term now. Because of that, we have achieved sales growth of 20% volumes, despite the fact that 32% was revenue growth. We have a new TV commercial with the video on Cordon Bleu that we'll now look at straight away.</p>
          <p>[Video Presentation]</p>
          <p>So, a beautiful video that we use in China and elsewhere, which of course really emphasizes the idea that Cordon Bleu is for connoisseurs, but we also have a Martell arts prize for &#x2013; specifically for Chinese artists, and this is a major event every year in China. So we've now established a tie between events and advertising.</p>
          <p>Finally, we mentioned this boutique special Cognac Experience store in the Hong Kong airport, but we've just opened a second such store in the Kuala Lumpur airport. It is we who invest, but to obtain this type of space, the Duty Free operators must ask us to do so. That means that they feel that Martell is absolutely indispensable to their own airport development.</p>
          <p>Jameson has now exceeded the 3 million cases mark over a sliding 12 months. So 1 million cases in the U.S. alone. So these two landmarks have been reached and exceeded in the second quarter of our current year. Excellent performance; 27% growth in the U.S.; Nielsen plus 29%; NABCA plus 26%. So clearly, Jameson has been recognized and is performing extremely well in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>We've also fared very well in Europe: in Ireland, not always the case; in France; in the Duty Free markets; in Russia; the Ukraine; not overlooking Africa and the Middle East. We have rolled out our campaign that we called Easygoing Irish that we use in digital advertising, the press and posters, and have continued to premiumize Jameson with the Jameson Select Reserve. The price is approximately twice the Standard Premium Jameson.</p>
          <p>Ricard; no need to say anything about the new bottle that we introduced last January. This new bottle will be on store shelves in about a week's time. Now, in France, we do not have a new bottle, but we have performed well because Ricard growth has been positive in a market that has been declining. So plus 1% in a market that was down 3%. There's been a decline on the Spanish border with France, but broadly speaking, French people are less inclined to go to buy tobacco, alcohols and other products on the Spanish border because these products are less attractive these days.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have issued a number of limited additions over the festive period with the number of well-known artists.</p>
          <p>Brands posting very strong performance, such as Havana Club; volume up 17%, revenues up 10%. I'll tell you why; very strong growth in Cuba and Germany. Cuba, it's A&#xF1;ejo blanco; in Germany, it's the three-year-old version, which is why sales have fared so well. These are two categories that sell at a lower price in the specials or the seven-year-old version. This is negative mix price effect. Broadly speaking, the market is posting double-digit growth in terms of sales and in terms of profits.</p>
          <p>We have launched two new packagings for the three-year-old version, for instance, but also a new product; the Maestros Selection. This is a product that retails at approximately $50 and that is of excellent quality.</p>
          <p>Beefeater; sales volume up 4%, revenue up 6%, which by comparison with the rest of the Gin category is an excellent performance. The Gin market is either flat or down at the moment, but if you look at Spain, the sales were up 6% in the first half year. In the U.S., our shipments were down, but more importantly, depletions were up 1%, and Nielsen was up 1%, and NABCA up 3%.</p>
          <p>So our endeavors with Beefeater have paid off, and the launch of the Forever London campaign, which has been used extensively in the markets I've mentioned, has now been rolled out in Moscow.</p>
          <p>The Glenlivet. Now, there are two brands on the day that are going to be given; Royal Salute, which saw its volumes up 33% and revenue up 31%. So the Royal Salute is mainly sold in the Asian markets, but nonetheless, we have made strong inroads in Europe and America. We've also extended our polo sponsorship &#x2013; our sponsorship of the polo events in Dubai and elsewhere. In fact, the British Royal Family is quite happy to take part in these events, but do not, of course, wear the Royal Salute logo on their polo shirts.</p>
          <p>Finally, with Royal Salute, we have launched the 62 Gun Salute. Now, this is the 62 Gun Salute that is given from the Tower of London every year to celebrate the Queen's birthday. Just as importantly, this is the first whisky to be sold in this ultra-prestigious category, which has only had cognac so far. This is bottles at over US$2,000. And this isn't a special series, by the way. This is the top of the range and retails in the Duty Free markets at $2,200.</p>
          <p>The Glenlivet. Again, double-digit growth; volumes up 12%, revenue up 12% as well. Excellent performance in the U.S. You have the figures in front of you, so I won't read them off. But strong growth in Asia, in the Duty Free markets, and indeed in Europe as well.</p>
          <p>By the way, when we purchased The Glenlivet from Seagrams, volumes were 80% in the U.S., 20% in the Rest of the World. It's now 50-50; 50% in the U.S., 50% in the Rest of the World, which is clear evidence of the fact that the brand has become increasingly international, and world volumes have been increasing strongly.</p>
          <p>Of course, we also have the launch of The Glenlivet Founder's Reserve launched in the U.S. in November, last November 2010.</p>
          <p>Kahlua and Malibu. With Malibu, volume up 4%, sales up 1%; that's revenue of 1%. We are currently in the middle of our launch of a marketing platform call Summer State of Mind. This has mainly been deployed in the U.S., where it's going very well. The depletion, NABCA, Nielsen figures are all positive. So Summer State of Mind is a communications policy, of course. It's also an event, or series of events, launching a whole series of new products, particularly the Malibu Cocktails that were so successful.</p>
          <p>This has a slightly negative effect on the mix price combination, but these are equally profitable products. We've also launched a new product called Malibu Winter Edition, or Snowflakes. If you look at the record, you will see there are a little &#x2013; like little flakes of snow in there that are actually coconut flakes in the liquid.</p>
          <p>A number of new products in the offing as well, but unfortunately, I am too shy to talk to you about them just now. Let's wait until they are ready to be launched on the market. So as I said, a number of new products in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>Kahlua. We also have a new strategic platform for Kahlua with focus on the brand's origin; that's the town of Veracruz, where both coffee and rum come from. These are the two main ingredients in Kahlua; coffee and rum.</p>
          <p>We also launched a campaign that was &#x2013; received coverage in the New York Times, a campaign called Delicioso, that I'm now going to show you a short video on Delicioso.</p>
          <p>[Video Presentation]</p>
          <p>Now, this campaign has also been very well-received. Great brand recognition as well. This is step one in our repositioning of Kahlua.</p>
          <p>Now, the figures for the U.S. may not seem very encouraging when you look at the slide. However, the figures over the last two months have all become positive; that was as soon as we launched this new Delicioso campaign.</p>
          <p>Champagnes now. Yes, champagnes are posting growth again. The 2010 calendar year was a year of recovery for champagnes. And we have every reason to believe that this trend will continue throughout 2011. This is true of Mumm and Perrier Jou&#xEB;t. In the case of Mumm sales, volume was up 8%, revenue up 9%. Perrier Jou&#xEB;t; volume and revenue up 16% and 21% respectively, with strong growth in virtually all markets. The good news is that this is volume, not just &#x2013; growth not just in volume, but also in revenue.</p>
          <p>Premium and Top. Our Premium Wines are four wine brands that come under the same umbrella. Our subsidiary in the Pacific covers not just Australia and New Zealand, but Campo Viejo in Spain and our Argentinean wine Graffigna, so volumes up 3%. We also have shown you the percentage of Group sales, that's 5%, and the proportion of A&amp;P expenditure, 3%. Though generally speaking, we invest less in wines than we do in spirits.</p>
          <p>So under the auspices of Premium Wine brands, we have rolled out a very clear strategy with a focus on the customer; a multi-origin, multi-market approach. Premium positioning, reinforced and selective distribution with the allocation of resources to our high-potential markets, and operations that we have optimized. That means flexibility with costs and cost reduction in order to increase the profitability or return on capital employed. That's our strategy in the Wines business.</p>
          <p>Let's finish with the 18 key local brands. Volumes are up 5%, revenue up 2%. The key local brands account for 17% of Group sales and 13% of our A&amp;P expenditure. The situation is somewhat contrasted with the exponential growth of our whiskies. In India, Royal Stag and Blender's Pride have quite simply doubled over a four-year period. Annual growth continues to be in the region of 20% to 25%. Imperial was once again posting growth in South Korea, as was Ramazzotti in Germany, and our tequila, Olmeca, in Russia.</p>
          <p>We had difficulties with a certain number of brands that were declining, or continue to decline, such as Seagram's Gin in the U.S., Wyborowa in Poland, Montilla in Brazil, Becherovka in Czech Republic, largely due to an increase in excise duties since January 1, 2010.</p>
          <p>Finally, concerning Venezuela, I'm not going to dwell on this. Sales have been limited because of the currency impact. This had an impact on Something Special. As for the situation in Thailand, the political and economic situation has led to a decline in sales of 100 Pipers.</p>
          <p>I think that I am now about to pass the floor to Gilles, who will give you the good news from the financial point of view.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pierre. I have fewer films than Pierre to show you. I'd like start off with our income statement. Here, you see that there was strong organic growth in profit from recurring operations; 8%, driven first and foremost by sales, the improvement in the mix. Also, the increase I can describe to higher A&amp;P expenditure, and the stability of our structure cost and sales ratio. And we had very favorable foreign exchange. Over the half year, the dollar was &#x2013; well, the euro was worth $1.33 against $1.45 at the beginning of the half year.</p>
          <p>So, let's take a look at the main impacts on profit. You see the minus 3% in scope. You see ForEx. ForEx is very favorable, plus 9%, &#x20AC;98 million; essentially ascribable to the dollar and many currencies that are more or less pegged to the dollar, namely the currencies of emerging countries.</p>
          <p>For the full 2010-11 financial year, we believe that the ForEx impact will be close to &#x20AC;15 million. So it would be significantly positive indeed. Nevertheless, it would be negative in the second half. As you know, last year's average rate was $1.33; now we're at $1.36 to the euro. So we will have less favorable comparatives than in the first half. The scope effect for the full year should amount to minus &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
          <p>Gross margin after logistics costs, now. As a percentage of sales, there is an increase of 110 basis points. This is due to a positive price mix effect. And it's also due to the strengthening of the dollar over the period, and this of course has a positive impact on gross margin rate. The average gross margin on the Top 14 remained in excess of 71%, and we controlled cost efficiently, with an increase that was below 1%. In spite of the rise in quite a few raw material prices, we believe that the impact will be somewhat minimal for the whole fiscal year.</p>
          <p>So this improvement in our gross margin rate reflects the impacts of our premiumization strategy and our strict price discipline that we have applied since the outbreak of the crisis.</p>
          <p>Advertising expenditure is up, up 90 basis point from 17.0% to 17.9%; up 11% organically. It makes sense. It's in line with our strategy, which consists in growing our premium brands while focusing on sustainable growth in value. The expenditure of the Top 14 remained at 23% of sales, in line with the first half of 2009, 2010, but it is the &#x2013; increasing the weight of the Top 14 in the Group sales that has an impact on the ratio here. Also, you can see that 87% of the expense goes on premium brands and 51% focuses on emerging markets, which account for 37%. So we're investing more heavily in these categories and on these markets that are essential for the Group's future growth. We're going to continue in that direction. And for the full year, we are looking at an increase in our advertising and promotional expenditure over sales ratio.</p>
          <p>Structure costs. They are flat as a percentage of sales, which means that there is 6% organic growth. First of all, you need to understand that we have beefed up our sales force. We have invested there on high-growth potential markets, notably the case in Asia, where we have beefed up our structures in China, India and Vietnam, in Asia. We wish to confirm our leadership in the Americas with three priority markets; the U.S., Brazil and Mexico. There, we need to accelerate growth and gain market share. And in Eastern Europe, which is clearly the region in Europe that has the highest potential. And in Africa, as you know, we've created an African region for our business and now we wish to tap into medium- or long-term potential. And in Western Europe, we've somewhat alleviated our structure costs.</p>
          <p>All this gives us profit from recurring operations that was up 14%, reported 8% organically. And you see the operating margin of 28.3%, which is the consequence of everything we've just seen.</p>
          <p>So I'd suggest we look at the regions' performance as for our portfolio here. We compared the organic sales growth of the full year 2009, 2010 with the organic growth of the first half of the fiscal year. Overall, you can see that all the regions have contributed to acceleration of growth. Asia and the Rest of the World remains the most dynamic engine here; 17% growth against 9% last year. In Europe, we were at minus 5% last year, now we're at plus 2%. And there's also a rise in France. In the Americas, as you can see, things were flat; we're plus 4%, just as last year. And excluding Venezuela, the Americas grew 6%.</p>
          <p> SPS adjusted. We have more and more sales growth sources; there are more and more countries that generate growth. On the upper bar chart here, you have the breakdown according to the various categories; those that are on the decline, those that are on the rise. And on the bottom bar chart, you have the same thing, but for the first half only. So we're comparing the breakdown of sales by category with last year with that of the first half. As you can see, there is more green on the bottom chart than on the upper chart, because 85% of the sales achieved in the first half was achieved in growth countries, whereas that number was 46% for the full year.</p>
          <p>And there are two developments that I'd like to draw your attention to. First of all, regarding double-digit growth, you see there are far more countries. China and India performed during the crisis and they are still performing, quite strongly as a matter of fact, but there were other countries that enjoyed double-digit growth. Germany and Russia Duty Free, South Korea, Brazil and Africa. And I think the other major development that needs to be highlighted here is the shift of countries that were slightly declining, anywhere between flat and minus 5%, last year. So they've shifted to the green area to flat-to-plus 5%. You see that we had 32% of our business that was in that red category there, and now 43% shifted to the green. We have a remaining 7% slightly declining.</p>
          <p>The U.S. and France are growing, quite clearly. Spain increased over the half year, although it was at minus 7% last year. Mexico is in that category. And the U.K. also rebounded with a vengeance; it was at minus 7% last year, and it's slightly up in the half year. And as you can see, in more difficult countries in the half year, 7% of sales in there. That includes Greece, obviously, Venezuela, and &#x2013; but there is far more green on the bottom bar chart.</p>
          <p>So contribution by region to PRO growth, essentially driven by Asia. Lots of vitality there. And all the regions, as you can see, have a provided a contribution to organic growth and they gave us profit from recurring operations. Asia and the Rest of the World continued very buoyant growth. So you see the PRO, the gross margin. This is driven by business, 17% rise in sales, as you can see. Also, there's a better mix and price hikes. Gross margin increased 21% there. And of course we are still moving in that direction, so we're investing in A&amp;P as well as sales forces on most markets.</p>
          <p>In Asia and ROW, this very buoyant growth is essentially driven by China, whether it be Martell or our Scotch whisky, Ballantine's, Chivas and Royal Salute, with a favorable price mix for both categories and with market share gains in both categories. India, as Pierre said, with our three local whiskies, premium whiskies. Then there are the fast-expanding emerging markets that are starting to weigh somewhat more heavily: Vietnam, Africa and Turkey. Also, we have markets whose performance was lackluster during the crisis and they are coming back with a vengeance: Taiwan and Duty Free are two cases in point. And there is renewed growth in South Korea in the half year.</p>
          <p>Situations remain difficult in Thailand; the political situation, local whisky competing with us. And in Australia, where we had commercial disputes. As Pierre suggested, in the half year we had a few favorable impacts, namely in China. So for the full year in China, you should expect organic sales growth of 20% for the full year, whereas 30% for the half year.</p>
          <p>The Americas. Well, there's an improved trend in the Americas. As I was saying, excluding Venezuela, the organic growth in sales was plus 6% and PRO has grown 3%. The Top 14 sales growth is more dynamic, plus 8%, driven by Absolut, Chivas, Jameson and Ballantine's. But sales were negatively hit by the sharp decline of certain local brands; Seagram's Gin in the U.S. and Something Special in Venezuela, for example. The Americas is our strategic region and we're beefing up our A&amp;P and sales force investments in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil.</p>
          <p>So you see the Nielsens, you see the NABCAs that show that the market is recovering; faster growth of the premium brands. The promotional intensity of some competitors has petered or is somewhat flagging, and all the indications we have with our on-train business are looking very good, which shows that the consumer trend is improving.</p>
          <p>Pernod Ricard's performance has improved over the past three half years. You have depletions wholesaler sales, the Nielsens and the NABCA findings. You see that we're from minus 2% to plus 2% for the depletions; the Nielsen is minus 4% to plus 2%; and the NABCA is from 4% to plus 7%, so you see things are moving in the right direction. Our strategic brands are up 3%. They were flat last year. Absolut improved its performance quite markedly. Depletions are at plus 4% over the half year versus minus 2% over the same period last year. Jameson is still growing strong; so is The Glenlivet, Malibu. Malibu is bolstered by innovation. And Perrier Jou&#xEB;t is coming back. But there are some local brands that are still declining; Seagram's Gin, I mentioned that, and Hiram Walker in the liqueur category.</p>
          <p>In other countries in the same region, in Canada, there is moderate sales growth. The strategic brands are performing better than the rest of the portfolio. This is also true for our Priority Premium Wine brands. In Mexico, there was a moderate growth over the half year as well, essentially driven by Scotch whiskies, Chivas, Passport and, to a lesser extent, because we're developing these brands, Ballantine's and Jameson. But local brandies are suffering from some erosion here.</p>
          <p>And in Central and South America, things are doing well. Strong growth on most markets; Brazil, Argentina, the Andes, Cuba, Central America. But as you've noted, there's a sharp decline in Venezuela. Europe, excluding France; strong recovery in the half year. Where we are at minus 5% last year, we're at plus 2% for the half year with 4% growth. You have to consider the disposals of the Scandinavian assets here. So you see there is quite a strong recovery and Western Europe sales are up. Germany, double-digit growth there. It's true that there are favorable comparatives, but the underlying trends are very encouraging indeed.</p>
          <p>Spain and the U.K. have turned around their performance; slightly up in the half year in spite of a tough economic context. Strong growth in Benelux. Slight decline in Scandinavia. There are two tough spots: Ireland, which is not going in the right direction; and Greece, with a 34% drop there, which is consistent with the trend observed in Q4. But Greece accounts for under 1% of Pernod Ricard's sales.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, growth is far more buoyant, such as the case in Russia and Ukraine; double-digit growth there with a vigorous sales recovery. Poland, well, our imported brands have grown significantly; true for Scotch whiskies, Ballantine's, first and foremost. Ballantine's turned around in that market, but the local vodkas, the Polish vodkas, are still suffering. In the Czech Republic, Becherovka slipped, but there was an increase in duties on the 1st of January.</p>
          <p>France; performance remains good in France, and France did well in the crisis. The Top 14 brands are driving growth in France with the Ricard, Absolut, Chivas, Mumm, Ballantine's and Havana Club.</p>
          <p>These are the pie charts that show you the breakdown in sales and PRO, with Asia stronger and stronger at 34% of our sales. But overall, you can see quite a balanced breakdown of our business by region.</p>
          <p>The emerging markets are still weighing heavily, and even more so than in the recent past. What is noteworthy for the half year is the renewed growth on mature markets; a 3% growth on mature markets over the half year. This is the first time since the second half of 2007, 2008. A very good piece of news indeed.</p>
          <p>I'm still walking you through the income statement, so let's start off with the financial income and expenses from recurring operations. You see that net financing costs are near &#x20AC;13 million up. So it was 4.2% in the period last, now its 4.6%; that's a negative impact that is due to the March 2010 bond issue. As you know, our bond refinancing has a cost that's higher than our banking loan cost.</p>
          <p>ForEx was favorable on PRO, but it's untoward on financial interest. But there is an &#x20AC;8 million positive effect due to our deleveraging. Also, there's a &#x20AC;16 million reduction in other financial income and expenses from recurring operations, primarily due to the favorable impact of pension funds. Here, you have the number with the &#x2013; what we're expecting from the asset yield versus the discounting of the assets. And we had very good performance of our hedging there. So the yield increased over the half, over the period.</p>
          <p>Based on current interest rates, we are confirming our target to maintain the average cost of borrowing below 5% over the full fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Net debt now. Well, it dropped starkly over the half year by &#x20AC;864 million, due to strong free cash flow generation, &#x20AC;639 million. Disposals; Spanish Wines, Lindauer, which raised more than &#x20AC;100 million in cash. Obviously, we had to pay out &#x20AC;355 million in dividend. We're back to our dividend payout policy; 100% of the dividend paid in the fiscal year there.</p>
          <p>And unlike in late June, as announced this time around, we have favorable translation adjustment to the tune of &#x20AC;533 million. We mentioned we were at $1.23 to the euro. We closed at $1.34 to the euro. So this is a favorable translation adjustment. And this time, the closing and the average rate are similar. There is not this distortion that we had late last June.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, as I was saying, is up. It's up from last year from &#x20AC;605 million to &#x20AC;716 million, due to organic growth in PRO and sales. Also, there was a favorable ForEx impact and we controlled our working capital quite efficiently. You can see the numbers here. There's a negative variation here from &#x20AC;202 million to &#x20AC;158 million, even in spite of growing sales. We did better than last year in our &#x2013; where we have a requirement. With management, our stocks of finished product have diminished and we did better in managing receivables.</p>
          <p>We're at &#x20AC;60 million in terms of the taxes in terms of the acquisition of non-financial assets; should be up by &#x20AC;30 million or so for the full year. And the tax-related cash is up due to stronger business. And we had a number of tax disputes, and anyway, as you can see, &#x20AC;76 million decline in free cash flow from non-recurring operations, primarily due to cash outflows relating to tax disputes and restructuring costs.</p>
          <p>So, with all that, we can significantly push down our net debt over EBITDA ratio. We're at &#x2013; we dropped from 4.9 to 4.5. It's even more spectacular if you take a look at the closing rate, but you have to look at the average rate. It's more sensible from an economic standpoint. 4.5. The very good news is that our syndicated loan is going to cost us less, because we're going through two thresholds, the 5 threshold and the 4.5 threshold, in two half years. So we're going to go from 130 basis points to 100 basis points as far as our syndicated loan spreads are concerned.</p>
          <p>On the 31st of December, we had &#x20AC;1 billion in cash, &#x20AC;2.2 billion in undrawn credit lines, which means that repayments are covered until the 2013 fiscal year. As you know, we have repayments of various bond programs. We will finance them with our cash and with our undrawn credit lines.</p>
          <p>We have set up two bilateral facilities amounting to &#x20AC;300 million altogether. This allows us to extend the debt maturity. And volume debt represents 37% of our debt, as we speak. As we said, Pernod Ricard intends to continue to rebalance its financing between bond debt and bank debt, and we want bond debt to capture at least half of our debt by 2013. And also, as you know, the market is favorable. On the bond market, you can see that the spreads of our bonds have narrowed on the secondary market.</p>
          <p>Gross debt structure by currency and type of rate. 53% of our debt is in dollars; 47% in euros. We think that is consistent with the breakdown of our EBITDA by currency. One-third of the debt is on variable rate basis on average, which is a good proportion.</p>
          <p>Given the context also, our fixed euro rates and collars are secured until at least mid-2013, which means that we should be sitting pretty comfortably on &#x2013; in the face of rise in long-term euro rates over 2011 and '12.</p>
          <p>Income tax. The income tax rate has risen. It is now 23% over the half year. It was 19.3% last year over the same period, half year, '09, '10. This is due to faster growth in countries with higher tax rates in the half year, and there is a mix of growth between H1 and H2 as well. And there's some technical items that had been favorable last year for the income tax rate. Effective would be &#x2013; we should have roughly 23% for the full year, but whereas it was nearly 21% last year.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring items. We had deferred tax liabilities following the disposal of Tia Maria. Can't do that again. This time around, we have &#x20AC;39 million to payout during &#x2013; owing to currency exchange gains. Minority interests and other; &#x20AC;10 million last year, &#x20AC;18 million this year. Business is growing, of course. Havana Club, Corby and JBC in South Korea, the increase in minority interests and others resulted from a growth in net profit of JVs.</p>
          <p>So you see our Group share of net profit from recurring operation is quite in line with what I've been saying. Regarding non-recurring items, they're, well, minimal over the half year. You see minus &#x20AC;29 million there with a &#x20AC;10 million impact from disposals with capital gains from Renault and Spanish assets, and capital losses from New Zealand assets and plus 8% for non-recurring financial. So we end up with a 10% increase altogether.</p>
          <p>So, I give the floor to Pierre for the conclusion and the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gilles. I think we can say that these results are extraordinarily robust in terms of the profit growth in view of the fact that we have posted growth in virtually all our markets. And of course, the fact that we have &#x2013; with the benefits of our premiumization strategy, thanks to a price mix effect, which of course we have upheld with our A&amp;P expenditure, not to mention the deleveraging that Gilles has recounted at some length.</p>
          <p>Given all that, we've decided to increase our guidance for our organic growth and profit from recurring operations. We are now giving you guidance of close to 7% compared with the former guidance of close to 6% organic growth that we gave you in the past.</p>
          <p>We also confirm our target of net debt to EBITDA that's gearing close to four at the end of June 2012. So not at the end of the current year, but at the end of the next financial period. I think we can say that we're on the right track.</p>
          <p>As for our communications, you may recall that we have decided to communicate over and beyond our full year and interim results. We've decided to communicate about innovation in January. Now we've organized the three call conferences, or conference calls rather, on the Asia region on the 21st of March, 2011 with Pierre Copp&#xE9;r&#xE9;, who is Head of the Asia region; another conference call on Europe on 16th of June with Laurent Lacassagne, who is also in charge of Europe; and the Americas, we will have a conference call with Philippe Dr&#xE9;ano on December 15, 2011. We will also be giving you the sales figure for the third quarter on 5 May, and there you have it.</p>
          <p>I think that brings us to the end of our presentation. You have the floor for questions. Now, I told you it would take an hour for the presentation; it's taken exactly an hour. As always, we will take question &#x2013; we'll be alternating questions from the amphitheatre here with questions over the phone. First question.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sophie Dargnies from HSBC. I have three questions. The first question concerns your structure costs. When do you feel that these structure costs can be leveraged? Are they stable now? And is there any pressure from industry whereby they can't be reduced any more?</p>
          <p>My second question concerns the U.S. and France, where the gross margin is down slightly, despite substantial investments in these two regions. Could you comment that, please?</p>
          <p>My third question is the price mix, which is up 5%. Can we expect that same price mix effect in the second half year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gilles, would you like to take the question on structure costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the structure costs are stable in terms of &#x2013; as a percentage of sale. They may have been up 6%, but as we said earlier on, what we try to do is to invest in markets where there's potential; the Asian markets, for instance, the major markets in America and Eastern Europe. But we've no hesitations in recruiting commercial staff, merchandising people, product managers to increase our clout in these markets. So this is a proactive approach.</p>
          <p>In less &#x2013; markets that are less of a priority, we plan to reduce costs. In Europe and in France, generally speaking, you'll see that we have reduced our structural costs. So we are keeping a close eye on structural costs as a percentage of sales, but it's nonetheless important to grasp opportunities by reinforcing our position where appropriate.</p>
          <p>Concerning the gross margin, well, just a brief reminder about what's at stake here in France; it's down from 73.3% to 73.1%, which is a very small decline and on an extraordinarily high figure. So admittedly, I feel that one of the reasons is that the aniseed-based drinks, that is Ricard, which have a very high gross margin, did not post growth as strong as that of whiskies or rums in the French market. As for the Americas, this is strictly because of the country mix. This can be strictly attributed to the country mix, which explains variations such as 62.1% was down to 61.9%. This is a homeopathic decrease <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>On the price mix effect, yes. For several years now, the price mix effect has been positive. I can't tell you exactly in what proportion, but we plan to continue to work on the mix to ensure that the price mix effect continues to be positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So my second question was really on the fact that A&amp;P expenditure was up sharply in the U.S. That's really what I was getting at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're quite right. In the U.S., our strategy is to invest in our brands because we believe that the recovery is just around the corner in the U.S. market. In fact, it's already started to show signs of recovery. Furthermore, you will remember that regarding brands like Malibu, Kahlua or Chivas, we are in the middle of an investment phase either to strategically reposition these products with new campaigns and platforms, or with Chivas, with a view to the longer term in order to achieve long-term growth in the U.S. market. So yes, these are strategic concerns and very deliberate initiatives on our part to invest in the U.S., yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Xavier Croquez from Cheuvreux. I have three questions. My first two questions are technical. The interest rate, you set at 23% for this financial period. In the medium to long term, can we expect this to continue or run beyond the end of this current year?</p>
          <p>My second question is the fact that the Chinese New Year, well, that gave you somewhere in the region of 250 bps growth. We're all eager to know what the effect would be on your third quarter. But if you could answer that, that might help us in our modeling.</p>
          <p>My final question, if I look at the sales chart, 20% of your sales come from what we call 'other brands'. And of the 18 local key brands, you have brands in the emerging countries and brands in the mature countries. What are the long-term trends regarding the 20% of sales that you don't usually comment? Are we looking at structural erosion of 1% to 2% and no more? And what about the 18 local key brands under mature market brands? Are they growing? Are they not? What do you expect to keep? What can we expect in the medium to long term, due to the tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the tax rate of 23%, as you know, there are lot of components in tax, if only the growth mix from one country to another. But broadly speaking, we believe that if the tax rate changes, it would only change to a small extent. If anything, it might increase slightly, but it would be a small increase; 23%, 24% is the type of rate of taxation we can expect, with some small fluctuations from one year to another.</p>
          <p>As for the Chinese New Year, I have to admit that I haven't calculated the impact what we probably have. I think we've given you indications about China, which include more than just a New Year, to give you some idea of the &#x2013; we told you that sales growth in the first half year in China was 30%. I think over the full year, we can expect 20% growth, which means that yes, growth will be weaker in the second half year, of course, but you know how much of our sales in China, what the impact of the Chinese sales on the Group's total, which will enable you to calculate the impact of the Chinese New Year.</p>
          <p>I think we've actually broadened that to the management of cognac shipments. It was crucial to lay in sufficient supplies of cognac for the Chinese year, which is a very important festive event. However, we put a cap on our shipments to China, not because of availabilities, but because of our medium-term vision of what growth should be in China.</p>
          <p>So I haven't done a very accurate calculation of the impact on the impact of the New Year in China, but we were pleasantly surprised about &#x2013; by the good performance of the Chinese markets. So the Chinese New Year is behind us now, but the effect is still ongoing. But let's keep our feet on the ground.</p>
          <p>As for the other products, the 20% of our sales you referred to, well, I think they are very contrasting situations. On the one hand, there are a number of activities that we are winding down because the profitability is very, very low; for instance, bag-in-box wines or bulk wines from Australia or from Spain. So we are gradually winding down and disposing of this type of asset.</p>
          <p>In fact, we had, I think it was 18 brands of Aquavit. There were 18 brands in the Vin &amp; Sprit portfolio that we disposed of. So yes, there are a number of activities that we will either intentionally wind down or dispose of. But these will have a very, very minor impact, nominal impact, on our profits.</p>
          <p>As for the 18 key local brands, which we track individually because they are, as we say, key brands, that means that the main market is a market in which they play a key role; Ramazzotti in Germany, for instance. Ramazzotti was the biggest seller of all imported spirits, all categories combined. Of course, there are a few German brands that sell more, but that gives you some idea of the significance of Ramazzotti in Germany. But I think the trends we've commented for the first half year show that key local brands are growing 2%, 3%, 4% in volume on an annual basis. Admittedly, the trends may vary somewhat from one market to another, but on the whole, they are on a positive trend.</p>

          <p>A question on Internet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Regarding the A&amp;P, I would like to point out one key factor, is that when you look at the Group overall, we have around 18% of our net sales invested into A&amp;P. When you look at the Top 14 brands, the strategic brands, the ratio is in the range of 25% of net sales. And we saw earlier that the Top 14 grew a lot faster, basically twice the pace of the Group, in term of growth of the sales level. So mechanically, it is impacting the average ratio of the Group. So it doesn't mean that we are investing more; it just for &#x2013; the main reason is this mix of product with the weight of the Top 14.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on A&amp;P if I can add a comment. Last year, we had a strong increase, but it was following second half of the previous year, which was just at the beginning of the crisis when we had decreased the A&amp;P by, if I remember well, 23%. So we had increased dramatically the year after, but just to come back to a normal level. So we grew our ratio A&amp;P in the second half based on the ratio of last year which was, I would say, back to normal. So I think it's important to have that in mind.</p>
          <p>In terms of ForEx, speaking about last &#x2013; next year, obviously, many moving pieces again. But last year, the average rate was $1.39 between euro and dollar, if I remember well, for the full year. This year, we had $1.33 for the first half. The current rate is around $1.36, so if it remains at that level, we could have a rate which would be around $1.35, I would say, for the future, for the full year. So it means that if the rates remain at that level, you could expect not to have a big ForEx impact the year after, just based on the parity euro/dollar. Obviously, there are many other currency, Australian dollar, sterling pound and so on, which can have also an impact.</p>
          <p>And on Venezuela, as we said, we have restricted our business and our sales to take into account the fact that we had a limited access to dollar, and so we don't want to sell too much we then cannot pay in cash to supplier. There are new possibilities maybe to be able to improve that in the future, but I think it's still under investigation and it's too early, I would say, to speak about that.</p>
          <p>I would say that in Venezuela, you see that the negative impact is very limited this year because we had the big hit last year with the ForEx devaluation. I would say that in the future, the statistical scenario would be same as this year.  There could be a positive evolution if you can have access to more dollars, and we are working on that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding Western Europe, no, I don't think there is any major discrepancy between the first and the second quarter. And again, that's the trend which we commented earlier, which is the trend toward improvement of the situation, in most countries; of course with exception, Greece being one of them.</p>
          <p>So I think it's pretty balanced between the two quarter. The trends for the markets is different from market to market. Obviously, we do not expect volume growth in either U.K. or Spain, for instance. In Spain, definitely the market is still negatively oriented, but we did outperform the market. I think that if my recollection is correct, the Nielson shows some &#x2013; the decline, which was in the range of minus 3%, I think, for this first half. And our sales were basically in the range of plus 1%.</p>
          <p>So we either will perform the market, and I think this is the result of the strategic decision which we made, which was first to maintain a relatively high level of A&amp;P behind the brand. Second, to remain focused on the on-trade because yes, there is a shift from on-trade to off-trade in Spain, definitely. But the Spaniards still consume 60% of the spirits in the on-trade. I think it's a clear difference with many other markets; that is, it's the specificity of this Mediterranean market. So to remain present with significant organization in the on-trade was clearly a choice which we made, and I think it was the right one.</p>
          <p>Regarding the U.K., I must say that I don't have the detail between categories. Can you comment that, Gilles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that the improvement in performance in the U.K. comes basically from the spirits and mainly the Top 14. We had very a good gross on Absolut, and the year before, we had the decline because we had increased the price by 15%. Now, we grew on the sum basis at the right price. And I think that the brand is doing well, in particular, in the on-trade. Chivas have enjoyed a double-digit gross in net sales in the first half. And globally, we had a gross, a mid single-digit gross, of the net sales for the Top 14 in the U.K. for the first half.</p>
          <p>Wine was slightly declining, although at a lower pace than before. You saw before that Premium Wines are growing again. U.K. is not the most buoyant market for Premium Wines, but that said, we'd say that there is still some decline on some brands like Jacob's Creek during the semester in U.K., but it has been a lower decline than the year before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer to the second question and let Gilles comment on the first one. Well, we do consider that there is still room for increasing our prices in China, particularly for Martell. The decision has not yet been made. By the way, it will be primarily the responsibility of our management in the country to decide when and how much. But I think it's a reasonable assumption to say that yes, in the context of limited supply and falling demand, there will be room for further price increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, on your specific questions on Thailand, we were down 10% during the first half. And net sales upside, and I would say are &#x2013; represent maybe around 6% of the total of net sales of Asia, to give you an indication. We extend the reason for that &#x2013; that's for mainly in Thailand, and it's largely due to 100 Pipers suffering the strong competition from some local whiskies.</p>
          <p>In Australia, we had a double-digit decline in the semester. There are different reasons for that. We had some commercial conflicts with some of our clients that have been sold since. The strong rise in the Australian dollar also makes some clients buy products from other &#x2013; sources in other countries, so there'll be some decline in the sale in Australia.</p>
          <p>And as Gilles mentioned, in low-priced wines, we are on purpose reducing our activity, and so it has also a negative impact on the net sales. So we &#x2013; there are elements there which won't be repeated. That said, as you know, Australia has been recently affected by a big flood, and those floods will &#x2013; may have an impact on the second half. So I would say that globally in the full year, Australia should still be declining.</p>

      <speaker type="a">

          <p>If I may add, we never hesitate to have conflicts with customers sometimes, because short term, you may lose some business; medium term, you protect your margins.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in China, I think we improved both our sales and volumes. No negative price mix, in fact, at all in China. And some &#x2013; as I said earlier, maybe we comforted our leadership and we gained market share with the two brands, I mean both Chivas and Ballantine's. As you know, there are no panel in China, but we use our different sources of information. We estimate that our market share was in the range of 54%, I think.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... in the last year for the full Scotch portfolio. And as Pierre said, the price and mix impact on Chivas, for instance, was positive by 3% in China in the first half. I'm sorry, I do not remind the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't understand it at all.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe you repeat the second question and I will then answer to the third one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Chivas globally, because we &#x2013; yes, I understood the question as being linked to China. I think, yes, it's definitely the country mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The strong rebound in the Duty Free that we had on Scotch drink for Chivas had a slightly negative impact on the price mix because obviously that's the case in that channel are lower than in domestic markets.</p>
          <p>And on your third question, yes, we'll have &#x2013; we have good news on the bank debt, because we'll have the selling of 30 basis points on that bank debt. You saw very clearly that we still stick to our objective of having a cost of debt lower than 5%. So it means that it could increase in the second half. I think we also made clear that we would like to increase the part of the bond financing in our global financing. As you know, the bond financing is a bit more expensive than the bank debt to date, so that may be an explanation for your points.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first half, it was around &#x2013; I have it on the full Group net sales. It was a bit between 2% and 3% on Group net sales for Australia. And Thailand, the 6% I mentioned is on <mark type="inaudible" />, Asia being the largest area for Asia/Rest of the World.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question on capital markets. I imagine the negative price mix effect was because you implemented price decreases in the U.S. last year. In the &#x2013; an improving promotional environment in the U.S., could you expect the price mix effect to be positive for Absolut in the second half of the year, thereby producing a positive impact on the gross margin in the U.S.? Or would that be a little premature to envisage this type of development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two different things here. Firstly, in the U.S., the price decrease is now up and running and will have no impact on the future. It's been fully implemented. Now, you quite rightly pointed out that we have decreased our MP expenditure in the market, which is good news, and should improve our performance in the U.S. Well, I like to believe that in the not-too-distant future, we could possibly even consider a price increase maybe a little early this year. It may be a little premature, but this is something that the industry is beginning to consider.</p>
          <p>However, regarding Absolut, you must bear in mind that the country mix has a negative effect on prices, because retail prices in the U.S. are, on average, higher than in other markets. And as Absolut has half its sales in the U.S. and half its sales outside of the U.S., this has a slightly adverse effect. That doesn't mean that we're decreasing prices; on the contrary, we've increased our prices in most markets. But in the country mix, this has had that impact. Not overlooking Duty Free market where prices are lower; offset of course by the fact that we have a very little A&amp;P expenditure in Duty Free, because the A&amp;P expenditure is in the domestic markets and not so really in the Duty Free markets. So they're the two comments I'd make about Absolut.</p>
          <p>Very simply, concerning Absolut, I will tell you that we are on track for the hypothesis we built into our business plan; that's growth of between 2% and 4% in the U.S. and double-digit growth elsewhere in the world.</p>
          <p>Okay. We've come through a crisis which has given the model a very rough time in 2008 and 2009, but I think since the start of 2010, I think we can say that we are on course, on par, if you prefer. And when I refer to this chart of 2010, I'm even talking about the second &#x2013; our second half year of fiscal '09, '10, or the first half of the calendar year 2010. So very, very satisfactory growth on the whole.</p>
          <p>ForEx. Gilles?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are very happy that the RMB is getting stronger for Sterling, it tends to follows the dollar. Hopefully one day it will increase at a higher pace versus the euro. It's obviously good news, and you know it doesn't change. I would say our policy, I mean, we keep the same price policy in RMB and so the direct consequence when &#x2013; if the RMB gets stronger, is that we have a higher operating profit in China and at the Group level. So that's obviously a positive evolution for the future if the RMB is getting stronger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your second question on cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. I mean, the impact will be limited this year. It could higher next year, especially because of the increase of the cost of grain, for instance, or some dry goods which could increase. But that said, it could be few percentage of growth.</p>
          <p>First point, we have many of the grain we buy which is for Scotch, which means that it's a negative cash impact, but it does not impact our profitability before years and years. And second, we have &#x2013; we are in a high margin business, and so even potentially significant increase in the cost of raw materials can be compensated through price increases on the different markets. So we are not so sensitive to the evolution of COGS. We believe that's something which could be manageable next year for Pernod Ricard.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could add that, for instance on glass, we have long-term contracts with of course some index in connection with the price of energy, gas, but it's pretty modest. And it's clearly defined really in the frame of the contract, so it's no fear about strong increases for the price of glass.</p>
