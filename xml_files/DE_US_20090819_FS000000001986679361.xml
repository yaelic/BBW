        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marie. All things considered, John Deere's third quarter was good one. The company reported another solidly profitable performance at a time when overall global market conditions remained challenging. That being said, the market for large farm machinery in the U.S. and Canada has held up reasonably well to the benefit of our Ag &amp; Turf operations. Our Construction &amp; Forestry business despite a small loss showed impressive resilience in one of the worst market environment in memory. Our credit operation had good results while maintaining sound portfolio quality and access to the credit markets. In addition Deere continued to demonstrate sound execution and real discipline throughout the company curbing expenses, curtailing factory product and shrinking inventories and trade receivables in response to conditions in the retail marketplace.</p>
          <p>As a result of these factors beginning with slide three, Deere reported net income for the quarter of $420 million on third-quarter net sales and revenues of $5.9 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were $5.3 billion, down 25% in the quarter versus third quarter 2008. Currency translation on net sales was negative by approximately four points with about six points of positive price realization. Both divisions had positive price realization in the quarter. Our disciplined approach to asset management has helped support pricing in some extremely tough markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide five, worldwide production tonnage was down 24% in the quarter reflecting continuing weak conditions in many of our markets and our focus on managing inventories and trade receivables. Worldwide production tonnage is expected to decrease about 43% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and be down about 22% for the full year. As you'll note on slide five, we have provided fourth-quarter tonnage by division and region due to the magnitude of the projected decreases. In absolute terms we haven't seen such a low level of tonnage produced since the fourth quarter of 2002. The fourth quarter reductions in tonnage will allow us to keep inventories in line with retail markets and provide the necessary flexibility to rapidly respond to customer requirements when markets recover.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the company outlook on slide six. Fourth quarter net sales are expected to be down about 34% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. Currency translation on net sales is negative by about a point with about three points of positive price realization. The three points of price realization is against a very tough comparison. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reported about three points for the company worldwide and even more for U.S. and Canada Ag &amp; Turf as a result of some interim price increases.</p>
          <p>For the full year net equipment sales are now forecast to be down about 21% compared with fiscal year 2008. This includes about four points of negative currency translation on net sales and about five points of positive price realization. The change in price realization since our last forecast is accounted for by lower price realization in landscapes, now a part of the Ag &amp; Turf division, as fertilizer prices have declined in the range of 50% and market conditions in Construction &amp; Forestry. Net income for the year is forecast to be about $1.1 billion unchanged from our previous forecast despite lowering our sales guidance by three points excluding currency or approximately $775 million.</p>
          <p>Our net income guidance implies breakeven performance in the fourth quarter, which will see extensive production cutbacks as well as some reorganizational charges. Those charges are spelled out on slide seven. They include a pre-tax charge of about $100 million related to the Ag &amp; Turf combination. This reflects the approximately 800 salaried employees who elected to participate in the voluntary separation program. The charge in the fourth quarter is about $85 million. Also included for the full year is a pre-tax charge of about $44 million associated with the closure of our Welland, Ontario, Canada facility. The fourth quarter charge for Welland is about $27 million.</p>
          <p>Since these charging are occurring over multiple reporting periods, I'd like to point out that the total projected pre-tax cost of the Welland closure is approximately $97 million. Going forward, in 2010 projected annual savings due to the Ag &amp; Turf voluntary separations are 50 to $60 million. In subsequent years projected savings are about $75 million. The projected savings from the factory closure in Canada is about $40 million annually beginning in 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to review of our individual businesses let's start with Agriculture &amp; Turf on slide 8. In the quarter net sales were down 21% mostly attributable to lower volume. Operating profit was $480 million down 34% for the quarter resulting in a decremental margin of about 20%. Tonnage in the quarter was down 19%.</p>
          <p>Before we review the sales outlook let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the ag business starting on slide 9. Relative to consumption corn and wheat stocks have increased in the current marketing year. But global commodities stocks-to-use remain relatively low by historical standards. The 2009, 2010 crop year should see a slight recovery in wheat and soybean stocks, while corn stocks will draw down.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide 10, let's take a look at commodity prices. Corn prices have moderated in recent weeks as concerns of an impact of a difficult spring planting season have abated. With corn yields expected at about 160 million bushels per harvested acre supplies are adequate, keeping prices at moderate levels. For soybeans, tight stocks will keep prices relatively high. Exports from the U.S. are expected to remain strong due to low South American production and robust Chinese demand.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 11, forecast prices as you can see are below the very high levels of last year but they remain at historically very strong levels. On slide 12, U.S. farm cash receipts are forecast to be down in 2009 but 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are expected to increase about 4% from 2009 levels. Slide 13 highlights the step changes that have taken place in U.S. farm cash receipts; 2009 receipts although down from the historically high level of 2008 are at extremely attractive levels.</p>
          <p>On slide 14, ethanol margins have improved since May being driven by lower corn prices. Even including interest tax depreciation and amortization, margins are comfortably positive. Our forecast currently calls for ethanol to consume 4.15 million  bushels or about 33% of this year's &#x2013; I am sorry, billion bushels or about 33% of this year's anticipated corn production.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide 15 where net income prospects for 2010 are improving for both Brazil and Argentina. Positive factors include above average commodity price projections, lower production costs, currency rates and a forecast for normal weather for Argentina. An El Nino weather pattern already in place should bring better weather condition for the upcoming summer crops there.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 16, we have outlined the encouraging agriculture support program put in place by the Brazilian government. China incidentally has also significantly increased its support of agriculture. We have included a slide in the appendix, slide 43, summarizing its programs. Both are exciting developments and will support our growing business in those regions.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to slide 17 and the outlook for the Ag &amp; Turf division. Net sales are expected to be down about 15% this year with negative currency translation of about 5 points. Implied in this full year guidance is an operating margin in the high single-digits for the division. We expect A&amp;T to have a decremental margin of about 30% for the year.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, industry sales of ag equipment in the U.S. and Canada are now projected to be down slightly for the year. We continue to expect Western European ag to be down 10 to 15% with the Central Europe and the CIS countries down sharply.</p>
          <p>Moving to South America on slide 19, the outlook for the ag equipment industry continues to be down 20 to 30% in fiscal 2009. Finally, we expect industry turf equipment and compact utility tractors in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 20% for the full year.</p>
          <p>Let's focus now on Construction &amp; Forestry on slide 20. With continuing weak markets in the U.S. and abroad, net sales were down 47% in the quarter. Production tonnage was down even more, 52%, leading to an operating loss of $28 million. That resulted in a decremental margin of about 22%, which is pretty impressive in one of the worst construction downturns in history.</p>
          <p>Although production levels and sales were extremely low, C&amp;F has continued to aggressively manage inventories. At the end of July, Deere construction dealers in the U.S. and Canada were carrying less than half as much inventory as the rest of the industry based on percent of days on hand. This further highlights the success of our efforts to align production with demand.</p>
          <p>On slide 21, Construction &amp; Forestry markets have further deteriorated since our last forecast. We now expect Construction &amp; Forestry net sales to be down about 47% in 2009. On an industry basis, construction sales in the U.S. and Canada are now expected to be down 45 to 50% and global forestry sales to be down about 55% from last year.</p>
          <p>On the construction side, as you can see from the chart, U.S. economic indicators for 2009 remain bleak. Among other things, government spending showed little impact from the U.S. government stimulus package. While some indicators do show some recovery beginning in 2010, note the very modest improvement in government spending; this reflects cutbacks in state and local government budgets which offset the positive but slow flow of stimulus money. Implied in the full year guidance is a negative operating margin for C&amp;F in the mid single-digits and we expect the division to have a decremental margin in the range of 25 to 30% for the year.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to our credit operations. Slide 22 shows the provisions for credit losses as a percent of the total portfolio. As you can see in the footnote the current annualized percentage is about the same as anticipated in April.</p>
          <p>On slide 23, past dues and write-offs in Ag &amp; Turf which represents the majority of the portfolio are still extremely low. What you see in the C&amp;F and revolving charge portfolios is reflective of current economic conditions.</p>
          <p>The table on slide 24 illustrates the non-performing receivables for our worldwide credit operations. Although the A&amp;T portfolio overall continues to be in excellent health you will notice a large increase in this number year-over-year relating to a timing issue in Brazil. Much of the borrowing in Brazil is done under a government program called FINAMI. Most of the annual principal payments under FINAMI are due on the 15th of May. You may recall that last year's payment was postponed resulting in the 2008 and 2009 payments both due on May 15 of this year. In Brazil, when a payment become 60 days past due we classify the receivable as non-performing. At the end of the quarter July 31, some of the payments due on May 15 had not yet been collected; that resulted in the 1.59% non-performing receivables in Ag &amp; Turf.</p>
          <p>To put this into perspective at the end of July Brazil non-performing receivables accounted for 1.25% of the total worldwide Ag &amp; Turf portfolio and represented 0.65% of the worldwide credit operations portfolio. 80% of the customers accounting for 77% of the dollars due have paid their FINAMI installments. The credit company has recently updated its ongoing analysis of our customer base in Brazil. Although we do have some customers experiencing financial difficulty, many have the ability to make their payments. We are optimistic about our ability to collect the majority of the outstanding payments, since customers who are behind on their payments are ineligible to receive additional FINAMI funding. Additionally, we continue to believe that we are adequately reserved for potential credit losses. As further evidence of the excellent conditions of the Ag &amp; Turf portfolio, slide 25 shows non-performing receivables for John Deere Capital Corporation only. As you see non-performing receivables for the entire portfolio are very low.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 26, this slide illustrates our credit operations continued access to global credit markets. In the quarter, we completed several funding transactions, one of which was an approximately $700 million TALF-eligible term ABS deal. We have been very successful funding our credit operations and now have all maturities funded through the third quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 27, the credit operations had net income in the quarter of about $99 million versus about 80 million in the third quarter of 2008. In the quarter, investment tax credits associated with our wind energy projects helped results. These were part of the federal stimulus package which also extended the production tax credit. The net tax benefit in the quarter was about $30 million with the total net tax benefit for the year projected to be about $75 million. This is included in the net income guidance for the year which is forecast to be about $270 million.</p>
          <p>Looking now at receivables and inventory on slide 28, for the company as a whole receivables and inventories are forecast to be down about $870 million for the year in line with the cuts in production discussed earlier.</p>
          <p>Slide 29 shows that receivables and inventories remain well aligned with sales. This reflects our ongoing commitment to Deere's operating model, which includes disciplined asset management.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales. Slide 30 presents the product category detail for the month of July expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were down 29%; Deere was down in line with the industry. Row-crop industry sales were up 8%; Deere was up double-digits. Four-wheel drive tractor industry sales were up 29%; Deere was up strong double-digits, more than the industry. Combine industry sales were up 25%, Deere was up more than the industry.</p>
          <p>On slide 31, you see that for row-crop tractors, Deere ended July with inventories at 22% of trailing 12-month sales. Combine inventories were at 17% of sales.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 32, in Western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors and combines were down double-digits in July. And on slide 33, Deere's retail sales of selected Turf and Utility equipment in the US and Canada, were down double-digits in the month. Construction &amp; Forestry sales in the US and Canada on both the First-in-the-Dirt and Settlement basis were down double-digits for the month.</p>
          <p>Slide 34 shows raw material and logistics costs were flat in the quarter for both divisions. Consistent with last quarter's forecast, we expect material cost increases to be approximately $300 million for the year. This implies a benefit of about $150 million in the fourth quarter of the year versus 2008.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. Slide 35 illustrates the year-over-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to most foreign currencies. Currency movements both translation and transaction or trade flows, reduced operating profit by about $75 million in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at R&amp;D expense on slide 36, R&amp;D increased about 2% in the third quarter and is expected to be up about 5% for the year, with the increase coming from Tier 4 emission spending.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 37, SA&amp;G expense for the Equipment operations was down about 18% in the quarter. The two-point increase associated with global growth initiatives is virtually all due to two water acquisitions made in the latter half of 2008. This was more than offset by a decrease in variable incentive compensation expense of about nine points, consistent with our incentive performance plans. Currency translation accounted for another three points or so of the reduction. The balance of the decline about eight points is the result of expense reduction throughout the company. For the year, we project SA&amp;G to be down about nine points.</p>
          <p>Moving to the tax rate on slide 38, during the third quarter, the effective tax rate was approximately 22% due to discrete items. The full-year effective tax rate is now expected to be about 27%.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 39, for fiscal 2009, we anticipate capital expenditures running about $800 million, consistent with the previous forecast. The depreciation and amortization forecast is about 525 million. Our forecast currently includes about 150 million for pension and OPEB contributions in the fourth quarter. Capital spending for financial services is forecast around $80 million in 2009, primarily for wind projects.</p>
          <p>Slide 41 in the appendix provides supplemental information on net sales and operating profits for the newly formed A&amp;T division. Slide 42 outlines our current projections for U.S. net farm cash income. The China government supported agriculture referred to earlier is highlighted on slide 43.</p>
          <p>Finally, on slide 44, you see that actual shares outstanding on July 31 were 422.9 million.</p>
          <p>In closing, John Deere is in the home stretch of another solid year. The company as we just saw is projected to earn over $1 billion in spite of what is likely to be its largest single year sales decline in at least 50 years. What's more, we've shown real progress creating a more flexible cost and asset structure that can adjust to changes in the retail marketplace.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the year, we'll keep on curbing production and inventories in response to day's weak conditions. But as we do we'll also be setting the stage to fully capitalize on any future upturn. And we'll be preparing for a very promising future based on the world's prospects for population and economic growth over time. To that end, we're continuing to bring advanced new products to a growing customer base and making selective investments designed to produce strong returns for investors well into the future.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. It's Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Meredith.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm hoping that you can talk a little bit about how we should think about margins in the fourth quarter in the Ag &amp; Turf business. You talked a little about the 30% decremental for the year which suggests about 25% in the fourth quarter. Clearly, the costs associated with the consolidation is the drag there, but then how should we think about the drag from underproduction in that business and then from the boost to pension guidance, what the split is between Ag &amp; Turf and Construction &amp; Forestry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, let me address your second question. Pension guidance is a funding issue. It does not affect our accruals, which are basically unchanged in our guidance. So, that's a funding decision.</p>
          <p>Regarding the drag from the change in inventories, it is fairly significant in the fourth quarter, but maybe a better way just to help everyone kind of cut to the chase here, we are expecting our Ag division will remain profitable, but that that operating margin and it's implied in our guidance is something around 1%. So it's fairly low.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But are there other issues other than the underproduction that I should be thinking about in terms of drag there? I mean is there a mix issue at stake as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, there's always lots of nits and nats; the clear, the most significant item is very clearly the production changes versus last year when we were really in a very strong production mode and then you correctly cited earlier the restructuring, re-positioning charges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might just add, Marie, when you think about the production for the Ag division in the fourth quarter of the year, they're going to be shut down basically about a third of the available production days, just to give you sort of a order of magnitude. These are some pretty significant shutdowns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe if you could talk &#x2013; I appreciated the color that you gave in terms of U.S. and Canada versus rest of world, but maybe if you could just give a little bit more color specific to the U.S., how much of a factor the transition to the new 8000 Series tractor is in terms of the underproduction in the U.S. And then globally I'd appreciate it if you could give a little bit more color on how we should think about Latin America versus Russia versus Europe and just how to think about some of the geographies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the change in production to the new 8000 R, we actually are already in production. It's a very limited factor frankly in the fourth quarter. We actually did a &#x2013; went back and double checked on that, so, basically no factor.</p>
          <p>Regarding the outlook for some of our newer emerging markets, you may have noticed that our outlook for production tonnage outside the U.S. and Canada actually increased if you will from being down 28 to being down 24%. And that really reflects strength in markets in India and in China, which admittedly are a smaller part of our business but are very encouraging and a little bit of improvement at the margin in Brazil and so, we were actually able to improve our tonnage there. Market outlook for Russia as we talked about continues to be very cautious and it's down significantly from where it was last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's good. I wonder if you could clarify just on the slides 30, 32 and 33: double-digits; it covers everything from 10 to 99%. Can you just give us a little teens or 20s or something to help clarify that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that's not typically been our practice and so I'm going to not be able to respond any more definitively than what we've already said. I think though it's pretty implicit when you're talking about Construction &amp; Forestry given where our sales guidance is for the full year that those are still looking at pretty significant year-over-year declines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one other question, the inventories where you expect to be at the end of the year, is that pretty much going to be where you need to be for 2010 or do you feel like it's more of an ongoing process or are you going to need to rebuild a little bit, as we work into 2010? Can you just give us a sense of where you feel like you are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with construction equipment and I am going preface it with obviously we don't have our guidance for 2010 yet and we are not being cute externally; we're still obviously developing that picture ourselves inside as well. But in construction given where our inventories are ending, we believe that we will be able to increase our production next year, even if the retail market does not change because we believe we will be in very good position.</p>
          <p>At this time we would say the same for our Agricultural &amp; Turf division, although it covers many, many countries but it, we &#x2013; it is our intention to end the year with our inventories positioned where we think they need to be.</p>
          <p>As you think about ending inventories, do remember that we had a very different set of circumstances, this time a year ago regarding the Soviet Union and that did &#x2013; should say the former Soviet Union, excuse me, and that did have an impact on what we felt we needed to have in terms of work-in-process and raw material inventories, specifically in the U.S. and to some degree even in Western Europe, because we sold in 2008 approximately $1.9 billion into Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. We were expecting to see fairly significant gains in 2009. In order to get those units into the region, in time for the spring planting season, you really have to be in production in the late fall and over the early part of the winter. So, we had our inventories and production plans accordingly.</p>
          <p>Now, as you know the liquidity crisis hit, we had very strong demand out of the U.S. and Canadian markets and Australia for example, so we were able to reposition some of that that planned production into other markets, but so we're really looking at a different set of factors so bear that in mind as you're thinking about that change. A lot of it really relates to the former Soviet Union.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one other thing, Joel, as we look at where we're planning to end the inventories, the other issue that we've got is we brought on capacity in 2009 at Waterloo, we brought on capacity at Harvester and we brought on capacity in Brazil, which gives us some sort of optionality because we can turn up the production and react to upticks in the demand quicker than we could before.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the fourth quarter production, I believe &#x2013; correct me if I'm wrong &#x2013; the guidance used to be 28% of available production days will be shut down; now it's 33. Can you please help us understand where the increase is coming, is it the larger equipment East Moline Waterloo and maybe dovetail that into any comments you may have on the order book for Ag particularly the big tractors and combines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, David, there is no single factory that would stand out in terms of a dramatic change one way or the other and in fact versus our previous expectation we increased production for our big tractors &#x2013; both for the 8R and for the 9000; the 8R introduction gone very well. That has actually had a little bit of positive benefit in fourth quarter, but it's really just a series of adjustments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And did I hear correctly? You mentioned construction of retail was flat. Deere believes they can increase their production and then you made a comment about Ag &amp; Turf in the same regard, obviously the assumption about retail flat makes sense --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't suggest that they could necessarily increase production, I am sorry for interrupting, but rather we believe that our inventories will be correctly positioned there. The markets are so diverse it's hard to make that general observation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Ag division's benefit a lot this year from pricing, some of the carryover from last year. What's the early indication on pricing being put out in the field for '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have actually announced for two products. The early order program on combines in the U.S. we took price increases in the range of about 3.5%. On the new 8R Series the indicated increases on &#x2013; and admittedly that's one tractor family, but that's 4 to 6%. Now, as you think about that 4 to 6% do bear in mind that there are feature improvements, new cab that's phenomenal, better suspension system on our track models, and some higher horse power. So, some of that 4 to 6% and we actually do our prices realization calculation will end up in reclassified into volume, because we try to account for that as volume.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Jim, I am wondering if you can discuss some of the initiatives that you and Sam [Allen, President and CEO] plan to focus on over your first year at the helm here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I think, I think one thing that's important to note is that very early on that Sam took the reins he sent out a message about what was not going to change. And what's not going to change is our commitment to the SVA model and our commitment to the OROA model. And so in that regard one of the big initiatives really that we're focused on right now is basically running this company and producing SVA in this environment. The other thing that Sam mentioned is not going to change is our commitment to how we do business in terms of the integrity and the ethics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Jim, can you talk about now that you have construction joint ventures in China and India, have you reached your targeted scale in the business or are you still looking for additional opportunities; also can you talk about if you see potential for increased consolidation among your competitors at this point in the cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Marie. Actually, we would not talk about any of our competitor's prospects for consolidation. We would tell you that we see global infrastructure as an opportunity for us and to that end you are aware we made an investment in a joint venture in China in excavators and we just about a month ago announced that we had formed a joint venture with....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...Ashok Leyland in India; but clearly the prospects for the global infrastructure growth are very, very encouraging in a very powerful macroeconomic tailwind that we have our eyes on.</p>

        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I should maybe just clarify that last year in the fourth quarter we also had charges for Welland and they were roughly &#x2013; actually I think 49 million exactly pre-tax. So, bear that in mind as you look at your numbers. Next question please.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Ingalls &amp; Snyder. Just a clarification first, Marie. When you talk about decremental margins throughout the call on the slides, is that on the gross margin line or the operating line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operating margin line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the operating margin line, okay. And secondly, on those fourth quarter charges, do you have the per share amounts, because it obviously depends on the tax rate you're assuming for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we actually have &#x2013; we don't even give our guidance based on per share amounts. So, no, I don't have it calculated that way, Alex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, what tax rate then should we assume for the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did not calculate the math. Our tax rate for the full year works out to 27%.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, one Marie, I don't think you ever answered David's question unless I missed it on just the order book this year. I don't think we ever got the granularity and I guess can you just remind us how that compares to last year. And then I guess my follow-up question is on capital allocation. How do you think about capital allocation going forward? I mean, the way I look at it your inventory levels are pretty good even in a flat market. I would assume next year, your earnings should be up so that should mean &#x2013; and you should probably generate some pretty good cash flow. How should we think about that and could we &#x2013; would you think about reinitiating share repurchase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take your first question then have Jim answer the second one. In terms of early order programs, if you look at it on an absolute basis, yes our numbers would be down versus last year, which was an extraordinary year. On combines in particular last year we would have been about 70%; that is very atypical, we would normally be 1 or 2% at this time and typically the bulk of the orders come in actually in the month of January. This year we are at about 20% so we are actually comfortably ahead of where we would have expected to be and certainly any time that previous five years. That would be true for early order programs that we have on spring tillage, planters, air seeding et cetera. So we are in very good shape there.</p>
          <p>In terms of the tractors I mentioned the fact that we'd actually added some additional production in the fourth quarter for both the new 8Rs and the 9000 Series tractors. Effective availability on 9000 Series is now into February of 2010 and for the 8Rs it would be &#x2013; again this is a product that you understand we are not even done introducing into the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you can still get a product yet for this &#x2013; yet in this fiscal year like in the last week of October, but that one is harder to call because again of the product transition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of capital allocation and that general question, I'm not going to get into the business of providing any sort of forecast as to when we might do repurchases or anything like that, but clearly providing a stream of steady cash returns to our shareholders is something that's very, very important to us and clearly share repurchase is a tool to do that and one that we've looked at in the past and we'll continue to look at as a tool in the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our accountants have gotten back to us correctly pointing out that our guidance is implying a breakeven fourth quarter. So, tax rate would be not meaningful to calculate in the quarter. Alex, that gets back to your question. Thanks Jamie.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our practice has long been not to comment about our customer's (sic) pricing practices. I would observe that we did not change our price guidance for the company, for the full year as a result of anything in the farm equipment market. Specifically, we talked about tougher conditions in our landscape operation because of what's happened with fertilizer prices and then the Construction &amp; Forestry. So, we did not make any changes in guidance because of that. But Henry, that's as far as I will go.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, JPMorgan. Hi guys. Marie just a line item that people don't often focus on but, your income from equity and equity and affiliates has turned significantly negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Relevant to last year. Can you just give us some color on what's going on there and how we should think about forecasting that line item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of that income is picked up from some primarily construction related activities that we would have and as you know market is very difficult in construction and so I would be very cautious as you go forward and look at that line item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up is on Brazil, you did a nice job of presenting all the positives down there with government funding et cetera. Would you expect repossessions of Ag equipment in Brazil to accelerate next month given that the court injunction preventing repossession is set to expire at the end of the August?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, that injunction only related to one province and with regard to our activity, in many cases we have collateral other than just the underlying equipment. So, we've taken other collateral beyond the equipment. We think we'll continue with our normal collection procedures and in any event we do not anticipate any significant movement in our reserves one way or the other right now because we think we're adequately reserved and our reserve calculations contemplate being able to get our hands on collateral and recover collateral.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but that one state is Mato Grosso which is the most important state...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, yes, which is &#x2013; that's correct, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We might note that we actually have had very good collection experiences in Mato Grosso...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>My first question, you've touched on new product introductions but can you give us some more color on the 8Rs and the 9000 say relative to other large new rollouts that you've seen in the past? Does this &#x2013; I mean do we need a drum roll here? Is this really exciting stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 8R is very exciting. The 9000s to be clear Charlie are not a new product. That is an existing product, but on the 8Rs the &#x2013; we are very excited about the product with brand new cab, much better visibility, lots more glass, a much improved suspension system &#x2013; Jim has actually got the list, hold up &#x2013; Jim, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have the basically the smoothest ride in the industry with our linked suspension, our independent suspension. We've had a great transmission in there with PowerShift and IVT; got the nine liter PowerTech engine in there. We're very, very excited about this product and we're in the middle of a product show in Omaha and we're having about I think 4,500 or so professionals from our dealerships are getting to look at this tractor and the feedback is extremely encouraging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My follow-up question, you said that you saw a very modest improvement in government spending in 2010, but could that change and what could bring about the change there. I mean we all read about Congress passing all this stuff, but what would it take, is there any hope that funds will really start to flow at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We really need to differentiate; the funds are flowing from the federal stimulus package. In fact we were reviewing yesterday with our government affairs folks and they were talking about the fact that the actual spend rate is starting to accelerate as had been anticipated. And so as you look into 2010, we had originally said that we expected of the infrastructure portion of the bill that you would have about 10 billion in appropriations in 2009 and then maybe 25 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>The challenge Charlie is that while the states are benefiting from the federal money that is starting to flow and expected to increase in 2010, their own rather precarious financial situation is causing them to pullback on their expenditures. And so what you have, is that the, basically the two are a wash.</p>
          <p>We would note that the spending has helped slow the decline or the loss of jobs in the construction industry and so there is some benefit from that although, there are still job losses occurring. If you go over the winter months and really into the spring, we were losing jobs at a rate of about 117,000 a month. That rate seems to be slowing over the last three months to more like 73,000. And again that is an indication that you are starting to see the benefits of some of the stimulus money. It's just unfortunate that because of the state and local budget situations they are not able to &#x2013; you are not able to see a bigger pop from the monies that are being spend on government level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I sneak in another quick question?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I wondered how the integration of the ag and consumer and commercial business is going. I mean we know about the head count reduction but how's that transition happening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That transition also occurred concurrently with the rollout of something that we call the new global operating model, which allows us to provide &#x2013; or it's a design to enable us to provide a much crisper focus on the customers and the products and I would say in general that integration of the former commercial and consumer equipment division as well as the rollout of the global operating model is occurring in line with our expectations.</p>

          <p>Hi, Cleveland Research. Good morning.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Question on some of the upcoming off-highway emission standards Tier 4a due in 2011. So, I know you're not offering anything regarding 2010, but should we be expecting any kind of material pick up in R&amp;D or new product development costs or SG&amp;A or anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a pretty significant increase in R&amp;D last year, and so I think you saw pretty much the major step function really occurred last year. We will &#x2013; we saw some increase even in our guidance yet this year on R&amp;D. Regarding capital expenditures, again the big increase is really already behind us where our run rate is about 800 million. So, we think we're pretty much where we need to be there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we're kind of at a run rate is what we're saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a question with regard to pension outlook, if you were to run the test today, what would be any kind of change to your accrual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not really done &#x2013; we've not really completed the full actuarial analysis. So, we wouldn't necessarily be in a position to answer that question. Having said that, I would offer that last year we closed at October 31 and interest rates had spiked, and the discount rate is a big factor in the calculation of both the pension and the OPEB expense. And we would anticipate if interest rates hold where they are today that we would see a pretty significant decline in the discount rate which intuitively would tell you we'd have some sort of increase in our benefit cost going into next year but we do not have any sort of finite number that we'd be willing to share at this point.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to talk about the decrementals that you're guiding to for Q4, so your volume decline is bigger in Q4 than you have for Q3 and that's not surprising, then, that your decrementals are supposed to be higher than they are in Q3. At the same time you have about $150 million material input cost benefit; is that 150 million included in your calculation of the decrementals or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it is. Again, the fact that we have very low levels of production has just a very significant impact on our ability to absorb overhead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's important when you think about those decremental margins, those are all-in decremental margins. So those also include the impact of these reorganizational costs. So to the extent we have $150 million material good guide, we have a significant amount of reorganizational cost that are going the opposite way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think your plant managers think the risk to the decremental margins is to the up side or the down side?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would not be able to speculate on that. Our forecast is our best estimate, our best judgment at this time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Is there anything other than the charges and obviously there is a lot of complexity going on; is there anything specific that you're doing in the plants that is different this quarter compared to last quarter or recently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just say that you're looking at a much bigger swing year-over-year. Remember last year you had pretty high levels of production and so you really &#x2013; the issue is overhead absorption and that's just profoundly different in terms of the environment this fourth quarter versus where we were a year ago. I don't have to say anything else to add. Just volume.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is on the C&amp;F margin which was better sequentially this quarter versus last and you had a little bit more volume but I don't that was it. So, I wonder if you can explain, whether that was price materials cost or structural cuts that you are continuing to do in that division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is &#x2013; it would be a little bit of benefit certainly from material cost that they had. I would also observe that we were starting to pull in some in the third quarter of last year. So you've got a little bit of compare there. Pricing, you do get a benefit from pricing in the third quarter as we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Though we're also seeing the effects clearly of our reductions or our efforts to restrain cost in both the SA&amp;G line and in the cost of sales line as we go after the factory overheads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and as a follow-up Marie you've actually talked a lot about production tonnage but I just want to make sure I understand it. You cut a little bit less than you expected in this quarter and that was on demand in India and a couple of other areas. The full year your production tonnage is down about the same; does that mean that basically the upside from those markets is offset by the downside in C&amp;F basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's probably it in a nutshell, yeah. That's fair.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Am I to understand there was actually an improvement, your annual net charge-offs in the second quarter were about 0.67% and they fell in the third quarter to 0.58 and as well there was really no deterioration in provisions for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. In the second quarter it was 0.75% and now it's only 0.73?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you're far enough into the year you'll probably get a little bit of rounding making noise. But no, we really have not seen further deterioration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And heard that your TLGP application was denied and you do have a $4 billion funding shortfall in fourth quarter '10. Are you going to do some sort of large TALF eligible ABS or something to plug that gap?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're certainly looking at alternatives and as you know the TALF program was extended through March, but we are looking at alternatives and when we might come to market with a transaction and that's likely a vehicle we would take advantage of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would observe though that the &#x2013; we have not had or not issued any money or done any of our funding with the effectively the FDIC guarantee since the transaction in December. We've raised a very significant amount of money and so we anticipate this will have absolutely no effect on our funding our ability to raise money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's important to note too that the note that we have out there retains the guarantee.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the $2 billion TLGP, MTN in Q1 '09 was really just because it was advantageous at the time, it's not something that you had counted on to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had applied for it. So I don't want to put that to say that we haven't counted on it. But, we've been able to fund ourselves. You've seen that we've got a host of transactions on that liquidity slide that indicate we've been very successful on funding ourselves.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the bottom line is, we've been able to tap into the market in many, many different ways throughout the course of the crisis. And actually, we've found the results to be very, very encouraging.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Just a question and I apologize if you've answered that already but as I look at SG&amp;A expense and if I look at R&amp;D, you seem to have taken guidance up for those expenses for the full year. What drove the decision to increase these expenses I guess in the second half of the year versus your previous guidance?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, as &#x2013; in the case of SA&amp;G, it's really just a change in the currency. So there is &#x2013; actually the absolute amount is not increasing. In the case of R&amp;D, R&amp;D is also affected by the currency so that inflated it a little bit. And then at the margin a little bit higher spending on IT4 which as you know you really have no choice about it you choose to be in the engine business in 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how discretionary was the increase in the D&amp;A expense for the year?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The D&amp;A going up, that's not discretionary, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's just a result of the property plant and equipment that's gone on and I suspect currency has a little bit of play here as well.</p>
