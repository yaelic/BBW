      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for joining the Merck call and webcast. Our presentation will focus on the factors driving our outstanding results of the first quarter and our guidance for 2008. I will take you through the quarterly highlights and Group financials, then Elmar will discuss the formal results and provide updates on the Merck Serono and CHC, and I will return to review Liquid Crystals and PLS and as well as our guidance.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide four, the Merck Group turned in strong results on the top- and bottom-line. Organic revenues for the Group increased 14%. The relative strength of the euro against other currency, most notably the U.S. dollar, resulted in a negative 5.4% currency impact.</p>
          <p>Core operating result increased almost 30% to over &#x20AC;0.5 billion, providing return on sales over 27%. I would like to remind you, core measures of operating result and EPS exclude amortization of Merck Serono's intangible assets and Serono integration cost, and refer you to slide 34 for our reconciliation.</p>
          <p>Core EPS jumped 44% to &#x20AC;1.68, free cash flow before acquisitions and divestitures was 271 million. These are excellent results during a period of economic turmoil that demonstrate Merck is on track for 2008.</p>
          <p>Moody's raised its outlook on Merck to positive after reported year-end results and provided guidance in February, another signal of Merck's prospects for financial stability in these turbulent times.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the key figures for this quarter. Our focus is on quality growth, which means delivering revenue growth with cost of sales and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than the top-line, leading to higher operating margin and profitability.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide six, this is exactly what Merck again delivered in Q1. Quarterly revenues were at 1.86 billion, up 8.3%. Cost of sales grew at a slower pace, mainly due to Merck Serono product mix, resulting in 10% growth in gross margin. A product mix means that we grow our high margin products faster than lower margin products.  Marketing and selling expenses and R&amp;D investment grew 6.5%, while administration costs were down over 2% as a result of integration synergies. This translated into core operating result growth of 28% to 503 million.</p>
          <p>So, our quality profit growth concept is on track and all divisions contributed to higher revenue and operating results as you can see on slide 7. We will discuss these divisions in details later.</p>
          <p>You may remember the negative currency effect we saw throughout 2007, and we stated in February that we expect further currency headwinds in 2008. In Q1 of this year, the Group had its strongest organic revenue growth since the Serono integration but it also experienced the largest quarterly currency impact at negative 5.4%, and almost negative 12% in Liquid Crystals.</p>
          <p>The U.S. dollar remains the biggest driver for this result. As you see on slide 9, the average dollar-to-euro rate in Q1 was over $1.51 compared to $1.37 for full year 2007. Translation of revenues in other currencies to Euros reduced our top-line by more than &#x20AC;90 million.</p>
          <p>Liquid Crystals has almost no natural hedge.  About 90% of any translation loss on revenue falls to the bottom line. The other divisions are some &#x2013; to some extent also affected, but not to this extreme level because they have euro revenues and more non-euro costs. And I think we should bear in mind that our strength in Liquid Crystal to weather this 90% of the translation loss on revenues is mitigated by our good cost development.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, I would like to highlight three figures.  First, the underlying tax rate for the quarter was 26.4%. We continue to expect the underlying tax rate for 2008 to decrease modestly from the 2007 level of 28.2%. Second, free cash flow before acquisitions and divestitures was down 13% compared to last year's quarter. You may recall that in Q1 2007 Merck included the one-time effect, disposal of Generics shares resulting in a cash inflow of about &#x20AC;120 million. In Q1 2008, we also terminated the factoring or collateralization of receivables within the Italian operations of the Merck Serono division, which reduced free cash flow by almost 40 million. So, when we compare like-to-like, this is really an excellent free cash flow in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Third, the financial result, for the quarter was minus 31 million compared to minus 80 million last year. Our interest expenses dropped 80% due to lower net debt levels compared to last year. The debt added in Q1 '07 to finance the Serono acquisition was fully paid off in Q4 with the proceeds of the Mylan divestiture, the Mylan sale.</p>
          <p>We foresee an increase in interest expenses resulting from hedging activities of U.S.-denominated debt. This is due to the increased spread between European and U.S. interest rates outlined on slide 11.  The impact is expected to increase interest expenses by about 15 million for the year.</p>
          <p>I should explain that the hedging for the debt is because the U.S. affiliates have investments in dollar. This is towards the mother company, which acts as an in-house bank and where the hedging takes place. And these costs relate to this effect I just explained.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 then summarizes the adjustments related to the core EPS of 1.68 for the quarter. Last year this quarter included 196 million in exceptional expenses that were primarily raised related to the purchase price allocation in Serono inventories, which were reported throughout the quarters of 2007.</p>
          <p>The inventory-related exceptions are gone in 2008, resulting in higher reported net profit after tax in 2008. The amortization of intangible assets associated with Merck Serono will remain with us at a level around 139 million per quarter going forward. Both these expenses, along with any Serono-related integration of future impairment costs related to the Serono asset revaluation, are backed out of the core operating result in EPS calculations.</p>
          <p>Please note that in the period there was a very small profit from discontinued operations in Q1 because there were still some small regions of businesses in Eastern Europe and Latin America that were not yet transferred to Mylan. We have said Merck Serono is lifting Merck into a new league.  That is again confirmed in its results for this quarter.</p>
          <p>Elmar Schnee, our Head of Pharma Divisions, will now review Merck Serono and CHC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Michael, and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. We are on slide 14. I'm very pleased that we remained on a solid growth trend for Q1 and remain excited about the prospect for 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Organic revenue growth for Merck Serono exceeded 14%, a strong sales performance across our portfolios. I will explain the product details momentarily. In spite of a negative 4.5% currency effect, reported revenues of &#x20AC;1.2 billion were up almost 10%. More impressive was our 36% improvement in core OR and core return on sales of 27.5%, compared to the 22.2 last year.</p>
          <p>Cost. Selling costs and R&amp;D increased slightly more than 7%. Marketing and selling increased to support key brands such as Rebif, new formulation launch and regional initiatives. And the preparation for Erbitux label expansion and our Japanese launch. R&amp;D spend of &#x20AC;249 million is related to the ongoing pipeline programs, collaborations, and basic research. R&amp;D expenses for the year should approach &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>Merck Serono is in a new league, not only in term of profitability but also in terms of more therapeutic areas and growth opportunities. The product sales of each therapeutic area are summarized on slide 15.</p>
          <p>Our most important brands all contribute to the division's excellent performance. Organic sales growth for Rebif was 17%, driven by our ongoing lifecycle management programs and regional selling efforts. The new formulation of Rebif has been introduced in all EU countries and Canada, helping drive European growth up to a healthy 10%, while in the U.S. sales growth grew 26% on double-digit growth with Rebif unit demand.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we are adding patients on treatment and not charge for growing sales on the back of price increases. I would like to remind you that the two-year data of the new formulation of Rebif show that it offers a three-fold improvement in injection tolerability and reduced its immunogenicity compared with historical data.</p>
          <p>Erbitux continues to grow at a steady rate based in its approved indications. We believe hospital budgetary cycles in some countries, including Italy, delayed some demand from late Q4 into 2008. Another positive development was the first reimbursement recommendation for Erbitux from NICE in the UK for head and neck cancer.</p>
          <p>Gonal-f sales showed strong organic growth on some increased demand in Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The larger, more mature markets remains stable thanks in part to the introduction of a next generation pen. This improved dose style capabilities. It has been introduced in several large European countries and the U.S. so far, with further introductions anticipated in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Coming to slide 17, Raptiva is continuing to grow rapidly based on long- term efficacy data and marketing efforts, while we are seeing an increase in new patients for the growth hormone Saizen based on the success of the Easypod device. Most of these patients are young and treated at low dose levels, but they are expected to improve future Saizen sales growth as these patients mature and require higher treatment doses.</p>
          <p>The classic products have remained strong growth contributors. The strong increase in Concor was a pleasant surprise, as we were expecting some increased competition in France and other countries during Q1.  That has been delayed into this quarter. In the UK we've received the approval for a new dose of Glucophage, demonstrating our continuous efforts to extend the life of this mature, off-patent product.</p>
          <p>So, overall we can say that Merck Serono has had a good start in 2008.  While we have focused on consolidating our pipeline in 2007, we are now being focused on moving our pipeline forward. And I would like to use my participation today, to briefly outline some future developments in the division.</p>
          <p>Slide 18, we continue to build our R&amp;D organization. On April 16, we have announced the planned expansion of EMD Serono's U.S. presence with an anticipated investment of $50 million at our Billerica facility northwest of Boston. The investment will support the construction of a center of excellence in discovery. The co-location of expanded discovery together with technical operations at one site creates critical mass in research within our U.S. operation, with the common goal of finding new treatments for unmet medical needs focusing on oncology and fertility.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that this investment will create more than 100 new jobs in Massachusetts, with construction beginning early 2009 and expected to be completed in 2010. Once complete, this U.S. research center will accommodate approximately 200 scientists with expertise in many disciplines, including biology and protein engineering.</p>
          <p>We will harness the power of our scientific expertise and understanding of disease biology, and leverage the tremendous amount of academic and healthcare resources available to us in nearby Boston, to further strengthen our dedication to finding new and innovative treatments that improve the quality of life for people living with serious diseases.</p>
          <p>It has been said that 2008 will be the year of Erbitux for Merck. We expect the response on our European filing for an expanded labeling of colorectal cancer this quarter. And we are looking forward to that &#x2013; the presentation at ASCO, where we will also host an investor event.</p>
          <p>ASCO recently issued a press release outlining its press program for the annual meeting. This confirms that two plenary sessions will feature topics related to Erbitux: the FLEX study data in non-small lung cancer, and how KRAS tumor cells might be used to predict how patient with metastatic colorectal cancer would respond to Erbitux. Please understand that Merck cannot comment any further on this data today, or prior to this presentation at the ASCO.</p>
          <p>In the second half of the year, we anticipate the regulatory response to our Japanese filing, and we plan to submit for additional label expansions in Europe, 1st line, you will see non-small cell lung cancer as well as head and neck cancer.</p>
          <p>Coming to slide 20. As we are focusing on <mark type="inaudible" /> building our neurodegenerative disease portfolio, I am very pleased to report that we are very well on track to submit the registration files for cladribine tablets in 2009 to FDA and EMEA regulatory authorities.</p>
          <p>Cladribine tablets, we were granted first track registration by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 2006, and are potentially the first oral treatment for patients living with multiple sclerosis. Due to our unique mechanism of action, cladribine tablets are the only therapy designed to have a short-course oral intermittent dosing regime, five day of once daily dosing, twice a year.</p>
          <p>All patients enrolled in the CLARITY trial, the Phase III two-year randomized double-blind placebo control international trial, have now received their final course of treatment. Key end points include clinical relapses, disability progression, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Study results are expected by early 2009.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we are also initiating Phase II trials with atacicept in multiple sclerosis. The first trial, ATA-MS, atacicept in multiple sclerosis evaluates the safety and efficacy of atacicept in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>The second trial, ATA-ON, is an exploratory Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atacicept in patients with optic neuritis, which involves inflammation of the optic nerve and is a condition often experienced as an early clinical manifestation by patients with multiple sclerosis. Both trials are about to be initiated.</p>
          <p>To further advance our pipeline of molecules targeting out new inflammatory conditions, we will be initiating during the second half of 2008, the phase II/III trial of atacicept in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atacicept for the treatment of patients with general &#x2013; active general SLE, and will be conducted under a special protocol assessment agreed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  A second phase II/III study in Lupus Nephritis &#x2013; that's the severe form of LSE in which the kidneys are affected &#x2013; was initiated in December 2007, and together the two studies are intended to support worldwide applications for marketing authorization.</p>
          <p>Additionally we are initiating an additional phase II trial of atacicept in patient in Rheumatoid Arthritis, evaluating the safety and efficacy of atacicept in combination with rituximab. In pre-clinical studies, atacicept and rituximab were found to be synergistic in targeting B cells, and we believe the combination could be beneficial for patients. The study will explore the combination as part of the search for better ways treat patients with autoimmune disease.</p>
          <p>Moving to our fertility portfolio: Following the Phase II clinical trials of hyperglycosylated FSH and ART, which we initiated in 2007, we have also initiated the Phase II trial of these molecules in the indication of ovulation induction. We are convinced that our proof-of-concept R&amp;D model, together with our focused portfolio and targeted investments into R&amp;D, will continue to drive molecules for our pipeline to further build our portfolio in existing and new specialist therapeutic areas.</p>
          <p>Let's now move over to CHC on slide 22. I will conclude with the results for CHC, which reported strong organic revenue growth of 16%, driven by performance of strategic brands within our four key themes; everyday health protection, women and children's heath, cough and cold, and mobility.</p>
          <p>Results include an 11 million gain on the sale of a dietary supplement line in Spain.  Excluding this, the OR came to 20% due to, mainly to revenue growth and modestly growing operating costs. The underlying cash flow includes disposal gain, will be reinvested in the division.  Eliminating this gain, the division's cash flow doubled. Underlying ROS of 9.1% is below our expectations for the year, but usually some costs are front-loaded in the division. Our underlying free cash flow is positively affected by one-time effect, too.</p>
          <p>Dr. Becker, will now conclude his comment on the chemical business and the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you Elmar. We are now on slide 24, and Liquid Crystals.  On a reported basis, Liquid Crystals revenue increased by 13% to 234 million. Excluding the adverse currency effects of 12%, organic revenue growth exceeded 25%. This is a strong revenue increase, but quite frankly against a weak quarter last year. Gross margin in percent of total revenues for the division decreased compared to Q1 last year, but was consistent with the last three quarters of 2007. This led to a 5.6% increase in the operating result, and an EBIT margin of about 51%.</p>
          <p>Coming to slide 25, where we show the many market dynamics at play that can influence future LCD market. While we hear from the capital market increasing worries about the U.S. economy and demand for new TVs in that region, it is important to note that according to market research, Asia and Europe are expected to be the largest drivers of new liquid crystal TVs over the next few years. This is due to the higher market penetration of flat panel TVs in the US.</p>
          <p>Our customers are still claiming tight capacity for 2008, and moving ahead with a capital investment in additional capacity for 2009 and '10 to prepare for increased demand expected from higher definition TVs.</p>
          <p>As expected, we see our Japanese key competitors gaining a foothold in supply materials for VA TVs at individual panel manufacturers. There are no surprises in the development so far. We are staying focused on providing new solutions and superior services for our customers while managing our cost structure. We have received important customer awards, including a Best Supplier Award at LG Philips, which demonstrate our close customer relationships and the success of our customer intimacy strategy.</p>
          <p>Slide 26 on PLS. The PLS division showed some good improvement in the quarter, reporting 5.1% organic revenue growth as a result of continued sales performance in application niches, such as Pigments, food and environmental analytics, as well as strong demand in Asia.  Reported revenue was up less than 1% compared with Q1 '07 but increased 10.1% compared to Q4 '07. The operating result increased 12% compared to Q1 of last year, and more than doubled compared to Q4. This was due to gross margin improvement and lower selling and research expenses, leading to ROS improvement to 16.5%, actually ahead of our own expectations.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the end of the outlook for the 2008, shown on slide 27. With three quarters to go the outlook for 2008 remains unchanged from our 2007 results announcement of February.  While it is clear that it has become a lot easier to achieve these targets, we think it's prudent to keep them unchanged because we will continue to face currency headwinds and we also can't ignore that we live in a time where financial crises leave their traces deep around us. But we are certainly well on track to deliver.</p>
          <p>For Merck Serono, Q1 operating result was above the guidance range but we remain comfortable with this operating result guidance as we anticipate additional marketing costs as we prepare to launch new indications for Erbitux and other new products by keeping our research and development spend on track to &#x20AC;1 billion. Liquid Crystals performance, we continue to fight adverse currency effects on the top and bottom line and I am confident that we will weather that storm during the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>For the Group, we expect to achieve revenue growth of 5 to 9% and adjusted operating margin, namely core ROS between 23 and 27%. So generally, in line of slightly better than 2007.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, at Merck 2008 is off to an excellent start, and we remain optimistic about our ability to compete strongly in a dynamic market. And we are now happy and ready to take the questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Amit Roy with Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you. Just three questions, please. Firstly, on Rebif's new formulation. Can you give an indication of what the new prescription rate is, of Rebif's new formulation in Europe? And what percentage of patients are you capturing without drawing off the other interferon therapies out there? And also just an update on the FDA status for the new formulation? Secondly, on the VA mode thing, am I right then, in understanding that you have now seen a competition from other manufacturers of VA mode IC, like Chiso? And if so, have their sales impacted your Q1 numbers or are we to see that impact in later quarters? And lastly, on Erbitux. Obviously, we have lung cancer data with the VC chemotherapy. You also have faced two data with gemcitabine which showed I think 2.7 months of overall survival. Will you be putting both of those together to try to get a label for a platinum-based chemotherapy, or would you think it will be just restricted to vinorelbine-based chemo? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can start with the VA first because to me it sounds easier than, very complicated to others. It is quite clear that especially Chiso has been qualified for lines in the, in some manufacturers. But we are unable to gauge how much that meant for our first quarter. And we are also not in a position to predict whether this is now already "it" or whether it's going to intensify. We are prepared to compete with Chiso. We think we showed in the first quarter that we are able to do so, and we are not in the least harmed in our confidence that we will deliver our growth guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's come to the questions concerning Pharma, your question about Rebif's new formulation. As we have much less data in Europe than available in the U.S. regarding tracking of 'scrips, we cannot tell you where the 'scrips are coming from currently. However, anecdotally we poll our patients and we have some very good feedback from physicians and patients. That's what I know, and as far as I can go, and I think the growth rates which I've seen also in Europe would actually support these statements.</p>
          <p>Regarding the new formulation for the FDA, we did file it and we await the response.  And that will come whenever it comes, and you know how the FDA works.  Hopefully soon. Regarding the non-small lung cancer, we will file the indications when we get approval of the colorectal. As you know we cannot file two at the, as &#x2013; behind each other before end result of the first one, unfortunately. And I will not comment on our strategy, how we do file, because I do not want to help my competition what I am doing.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I've got a couple of questions. First of all I'm just curious, when will you start hedging against the U.S. dollar again to protect some of that exposure in Liquid Crystals? Secondly, regarding Erbitux sales in the first quarter. I think Sascha had mentioned &#x2013; Sascha Becker had mentioned that there is a new formulation that was helping increase the sales regarding a vial &#x2013; an increase to vial size. Does this mean that there has been some wastage of the product or &#x2013; will that then be corrected later in the year? I just want to understand the background to the Erbitux growth and whether it's a one-off or not? And thirdly, you just mentioned that you need to await for the decision on &#x2013; in Europe on 1st line colorectal cancer for Erbitux, before filing for other indications. Can you tell me, if you don't get approval will that delay the filing at all while &#x2013; if you put in an appeal or you have to provide more data, or is it just when the decision happens, whatever it is, then you can file the follow-on indications? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I start with the hedging. Unfortunately, I can't tell you how we are going to act on hedging because our hedging policy and our hedging activities is a continuous effort. So, if the dollar falls to 180 then we will start certainly hedging at 160, but as long as it at 160 we will not hedge at 160, just as an example.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we hedge the dollar when we think that it's going to weaken. At the moment we hesitate to have so little confidence in the dollar that it is going to weaken further significantly. We may be right or we may be wrong, at the moment we are not hedging at 160.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, regarding the Erbitux question. We did indeed allow a new formulation, which makes it easier in the hospital to use the drug because they do not need anymore a filter when you do the infusion, which you needed before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that helps, the application makes it easier, faster and makes it further cost savings for the hospitals. And this new formulation was launched and there are some effects on the margin because it's a slightly more efficient production cycle which we have there. And we introduced now this formulation country-by-country. I think there was a small affect that we loaded the pipeline, and in trying to <mark type="inaudible" /> and as already alluded in my talk, there might have been also in Italy some carry-over effects because the hospital budgets were running out in December or November, and there might be a catch-up. But I'm very happy with the performance and I think Erbitux will perform strongly this year. Regarding the filing, actually I'm not thinking about not getting an approval because we will get an approval.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello, Holger Blum, Deutsche Bank. Just two quick questions. One on LCD, could you share with us how much of your revenues are coming from TV applications, versus others, at that point in time? And secondly, just a minor question on the interest number, I had something like 100 million for the full year in line, first quarter would have been above that run rate, so what would be a good guidance for the full year on the interest or financial results line? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Liquid Crystals, we have a history of not going into further segmentation than the Liquid Crystals, and I think we have used to refer to display research and I think we are continuing with that. I think we have more important aspects to our LCD performance than what is the monthly change of our product mix. There was in the first quarter no negative influence from product mix on revenues end-result. I think that is something, I can give you to take with you.</p>
          <p>On the interest rate, the effect that I explained, that we have a widening gap between interest rates on dollar and euro and therefore we have an additional burden from hedging when our American colleagues give us their dollars, which for us has been a debt. We have I think said in the presentation, that it will be a 15 million, if it goes on like this, and if you would assume that the interest rate gap between euro and dollar stays the same then you should add 15 million.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I've got two questions, two pharma questions. On outlook you mentioned strong growth in Brazil and China.  And I know you don't disclose sales by countries, but is there any sort of color you can give us, to give us an idea how important these countries are for your Erbitux franchise? And the second question is, you said R&amp;D for the full year is approaching 1 billion, and I wonder whether that's just semantics or whether it doesn't quite reach that? I would interpret this comment as, it doesn't quite reach the 1 billion.  And also on the R&amp;D investment you have been speaking on in the US, does that in any way affect your R&amp;D ratio going forward?  Or do you stick to your 20% target range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Regarding Erbitux sales in Brazil and China, you're very right, we don't give data per country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, what I'm trying to get here is some flavor of how the ex-European part &#x2013; how large a proportion that ex-European part is, if you can give us any indication?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Let me try this one. As you can read in all over the paper, Brazil's economy is doing exceedingly well at the moment. And so there is money to [indiscernible} which could have an effect on Erbitux performance, because it's not the most inexpensive product.  The very same is true for China. And so we are seeing both countries have potential, and I believe actually that so-called BRIC countries, which they too belong to it, have really potential, and we invest in those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is it something like, right now, 5% of your sales, or something like a more respectable proportion?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Regarding the 1 billion R&amp;D investment, we do everything to reach 1 billion. Our plan set out 1 billion. Now, R&amp;D as you know is depending on milestones reaching, and if you have bad luck you might have a negative outcome, and then you cannot move forward and reassign the money as fast as possible to against the end of the year. Our intention is 1 billion which is 20%, currently actually 22%, but 20% is the 1 billion, or 20%, whatever is bigger.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Billerica, the investment actually number one, gives us access to a fantastic hub in the U.S.A. Number two, the additional head count which I mentioned, 100 people, maybe they can come from a site disposal in Chile but direct you remember we give up diabetes research. And actually what we do is, we use head count on diabetes which are not the same people, so we sell to, hopefully, the size and then we use these people head count and filled up our research facility in the USA. So there is not to be expected a additional hit on our R&amp;D expenditure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions, if I may. Firstly on KRAS, which you mention is one of the plenary sessions at ASCO.  On the assumption that you do get approved, and you do get approved for the KRAS population, how are you thinking about building the infrastructure to facilitate KRAS testing? What cost associates with that? Are you already in discussions, is this going to be online by the time that potentially you receive approval?  So that will be the first question. Second question is, perhaps, you could update us on your hunt for further targets for diversification, in both the chemical and the consumer segments, which you referred to previously?  And just remind us what kind of size you anticipate and what opportunities you see, given the economic conditions? And then finally, on the long-term tax rate evolution, you alluded to the fact that this year it's going to be declining a little. Could you give us some sense of where you think it's going to go over the next three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start with the KRAS question. Yes, you're right, it will presented at ASCO and actually we have two Erbitux presentations.  Which never happens in the history of ASCO that one product get two plenary sessions, which should already show, actually, that I think it will really be an Erbitux year at ASCO, again. Regarding the testing, there are currently tests available on the market. Actually there are three tests available, a test is around 100 to &#x20AC;120. And they are standardized, they are used in clinical trials, they have been used by Amgen, so there is absolutely no problem to get this done. And also from a financial point view &#x20AC;120 is not a huge amount in whole scheme of treating oncology. There should be no issue with this.</p>
          <p>The question regarding consumer health care, if I understood correctly. As I mentioned we have four health schemes.  And we would like to be true in these health schemes because we have already brands in these health schemes. And as already alluded earlier, our strategy is actually to focus on cost strategic brands. Hence we sold off, in Spain, these non-strategic brands to have the power to reinvest in these four health schemes in our six to seven strategic brands. And that's our strategy and that's we keep doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the chemicals M&amp;A, there is nothing new. We have the same situation as published before, and it remains the same, the limit for acquisitions in that area is our managerial capacity and our financial capacity. As to the tax rate, also no new guidance, our guidance longer-term is that, we are moving towards 25, maybe 24% if the sales holds true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just have one follow-up on the first question. Assuming that we're going down this KRAS route, and the product does get approved in first line colorectal. Presumably your sales force is going to need some retooling in the conversations with oncologists. At what point do you actually start that process, or have you actually started already in terms of educating them, so they can educate physicians?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, as you know, in two congresses, there were some small studies presented. Obviously, in the community of physicians, mainly the opinion leaders, the discussion started, and the results were actually pretty staggering off the small studies. And no, our sales force did not stop because we don't have the indication, we cannot go off-label, we cannot do something which is not in our label. And...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Just one Erbiutux of question. In which major European markets do you find current Erbitux use in colorectal cancer stays very, very close, or use in reimbursement stays very close to the label, regarding for example urinary T-count, and in which European markets do you find doctors are somewhat more liberal in their interpretation as label?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Hello. One question on oral cladribine. Do you &#x2013; what levels of intellectual property protection do you have on that, and what sort of period of exclusivity would you expect to get on that drug, given that you didn't develop the molecule itself?  Is there formulation protection or use of pharma protection, could you give a little detail on that, please?</p>

          <p>Hi everybody. I have a follow up question on Erbitux. The crystal study and the EMEA filing dossier, did the EMEA actually have the chance to look at any premature survival data?  Then on Erbitux in lung cancer, are there any other trials ongoing with different regiments?  And also a follow up on Liquid Crystals, there's some volatility in demand being observed in the past and I just wonder whether there is something like inventory stocking in that business?  Maybe you can touch upon the phasing of the revenues going forward.  Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Liquid crystals, of course we had a very strong first quarter and the seasonality suggests that there may be a slowdown in the next quarter. As a matter of principle, we don't bother too much about quarter-to-quarter development. If there is a stock problem then we have a trough and then we will cover after that. But from our point of view at the moment there is no overstocking at the customer.</p>

          <p>Hey, good afternoon. Just a quick question if I may. With regards to the Merck Serono Pharma margin. It's obviously very strong in the first quarter. And I'm just trying to understand how you expect that to progress during the quarter here in context to your comments on guidance? And in particular, can you just maybe break out a little bit more detail on what exactly has driven the strong improvement in the Pharma margin? Are we finally starting to see some of the Erbitux profitability coming through?  And I guess what relates to that, is this a sustainable level of profitability?  And it clearly has had a very positive effect on the gross margin. I am just wondering whether you think that will persist for the rest of the year?</p>

          <p>Okay, regarding gross margin of Merck Serono. Obviously, number one we did it very great job, right? Number two, the gross margin had some positive influence from product mix, which we have seen for example, the new formulation of Erbitux, which we did mention. And the reason why we are close is that the classic products for example under heavy competition, new price regulations by authorities, and the force and that's the reason why we think the guidance given to you by my colleague is the right guidance. And the currency of course has also an effect because, obviously, when we do sales and we do them in dollars, the sales have less worth in Europe, as this previous exchange rate, that has a negative impact on the gross margins too. This is okay for you?</p>
