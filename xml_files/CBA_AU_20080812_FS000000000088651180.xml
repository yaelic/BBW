          <p>Good day, everybody, and on behalf of the Commonwealth Bank, a warm welcome to this presentation of our results for the 12 months ended 30 June, 2008. As is our normal practice, our Chief Executive, Ralph Norris, will give us an overview of the result and talk about progress on our strategic priorities and finish with some comments on the outlook.</p>
          <p>He will then hand over to Chief Financial Officer, David Craig, who will run us through the numbers in greater detail. On the conclusion of David's presentation, both he and Ralph would be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>So to get proceedings under way, I'd welcome Ralph to the stage. Thanks, Ralph.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks very much, Warwick, and good morning everyone. Commonwealth Bank today has reported a very solid operating result. In an environment where many banks have announced significant losses and write-downs, for the Group to be able to deliver a 7% increase in underlying net profit is a good achievement. This result reflects the underlying strength of our core franchise.</p>
          <p>Our capital and funding positions remain very strong and continue to be key cornerstones for us in navigating the headwinds created by the volatility in global credit markets. A disciplined approach to the management of credit and market risk has ensured that credit quality in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios is sound.</p>
          <p>CBA was one of the first banks in the world to be granted "advanced" accreditation under Basel II, which is a testimony to the strength of our capital position and the sophistication of our risk measurement and management.</p>
          <p>Given the uncertain outlook and continuing volatility in global markets, we've taken the decision to prudently increase our level of provisioning. However, at this stage, we are not seeing any significant systemic credit quality issues in our lending books.</p>
          <p>Over the past 12 months, the Group has been able to maintain and strengthen its competitive position. We've recorded strong volume growth across our businesses and have grown market share in segments of the market, which satisfy our risk and value criteria.</p>
          <p>We continue to make substantial progress against our five strategic priorities and on delivering on our vision of becoming Australia's finest financial services organization through excelling in customer service.</p>
          <p>We're more confident than ever that this strategy is the right one, and we continue to invest in initiatives, which will deliver long-term benefits for our people, our customers and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>As is our usual practice, I will leave it to David Craig to run you through the financial results in detail a little later. But by way of summary, I'd like to call out some key features of the result. Operating income was up 10%, a very good outcome, given the significant increase in funding costs incurred during the year.</p>
          <p>Headline cash NPAT was up 5%. However, excluding the impact of lower shareholder investment returns, underlying net profit was up 7% on last year. Cash earnings per share increased by 3% to $3.569. And we've declared a full year dividend, which is fully franked, of $1.53, taking total dividends for the year to $2.66, an increase of 4%.</p>
          <p>One of the most pleasing aspects of today's results is the strong volume growth in market share gains we've achieved over the past 12 months. This reflects a continued focus on our core business at a time when many of our competitors are being distracted by external issues.</p>
          <p>In home lending we've now grown a share in each of the last 15 months. The strong volume growth has helped to partially offset the higher cost of funding, which adversely impacted home loan margins during this period. Most importantly, the turnaround in our retail branch network has continued and we are now consistently achieving above system growth in this channel in both home loans and deposits.</p>
          <p>In an environment where wholesale funding has become constrained and increasingly expensive, the strong growth we have achieved in both retail and business deposits over the past 12 months has been very important. As a result, the proportion of the Group's funding from these sources has increased to 58% and we continue to hold by far the largest proportion of household deposits in the country.</p>
          <p>The past six months have been difficult for the funds management sector, with investment returns adversely impacted by the downturn in global and domestic equity markets. Nevertheless the group has performed very well relative to its main competitors with net inflows remaining positive and our flagship retail platform FirstChoice continuing to gain market share.</p>
          <p>In business lending, the past six months have seen many corporate customers turning back to banks to help with funding, given the disruption in global funding markets. While, growing market share in this environment would be relatively easy the group has taken a very cautious approach built around the application of stringent lending guidelines, tight risk parameters and its hurdle rates. Even though lending market share has fallen marginally, we remain very comfortable with our overall position in business banking, particularly given our very strong deposits growth and good lending outcomes in the more profitable segments, such as local business banking.</p>
          <p>During the year the Group launched a new advertising campaign under the theme determined to be different. We choose this theme as we firmly believe we are significantly repositioning the Group in each segment of its business. In these volatile times, the Group offers a combination of strengths which mean we are well placed to navigate these difficult market conditions and these strengths include a very strong capital base, in fact the strongest in the industry, strong liquidity, a firm double A credit rating and a globally respected funding team, conservative risk management practices and a very strong domestic banking franchise.</p>
          <p>Our strategy remains primarily focused on our core domestic financial services operations, and we're continuing to invest in a range of initiatives that will help us achieve our vision of becoming Australia's finest financial service organization through excelling in customer service. Despite the challenges arising from the difficult environment, we have made significant progress over the past 12 months on our strategic agenda with a number of highlights in each of our five strategic priorities. In customer service, our retail customer satisfaction ratings reached a 10-year high during the year and we were recently named Money magazine's Bank of the Year for 2008.</p>
          <p>Our business banking strategy remains on course, highlighted this period by strong volume growth, particularly in deposits, where balances grew by 24%. Our local business banking strategy is delivering stronger results with the reintroduction of over 160 business bankers into our branch network continuing to drive strong new sales growth. In corporate financial services, we've opened a further eight new business banking centers, adding to the eight centers established last financial year. Our technology and operational excellence strategy is continuing to deliver targeted cost and efficiency savings, enabling us to invest more into the business. Our IT efficiency ratio stands at 13.7%, which is down from around 20% three years ago and is now within the global best practice range of 13 to 15%.</p>
          <p>In April, the group announced a $580 million investment in core banking modernization which will provide us with the platform to make a step change improvement in customer service, efficiency and productivity, and I'll talk more on this in a moment.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, our people remain the single greatest determinant of our success. From a cultural perspective, it's been pleasing to note some significant progress over the past 12 months highlighted by the most recent survey of staff satisfaction, which places the Group in the top quartile of the Gallup Organization's worldwide database.</p>
          <p>I've also been pleased with the good progress we've made with regards to the safety of our staff, which has resulted in another significant reduction in our lost time injury frequency rate. In the area of profitable growth, in an environment where conditions increasingly favor larger banks, this has perhaps become more important than ever.</p>
          <p>Whilst our primary focus remains very much on the domestic Australian market, we are continuing to pursue selective growth opportunities in Asia. Our Indonesian and Chinese businesses, while still relatively small as a proportion of the Group's overall business, are all performing extremely well, and we continue to look for further opportunities to invest in these and other attractive Asian markets.</p>
          <p>While generating profitable growth is a priority, the management of risk is of paramount importance. As part of an organizational capability improvement program initiated soon after I arrived at CBA, we undertook an extensive review of our risk functions. This included a global best practice study led by Rob Nimmo and First Manhattan Consulting Group. As a result, we have introduced more sophisticated risk-reward methodologies and made a number of organizational changes to better align our risk function with the needs of the business.</p>
          <p>From an organizational perspective, a key outcome was the creation of a new role of Group Executive Risk Management, reporting directly to me and the recent appointment of Alden Toevs to fill that role. Prior to Alden's appointment, he was head of First Manhattan Consulting Group's global risk management practice, based in New York.</p>
          <p>Commonwealth Bank's objective is to be ranked number one in customer satisfaction by June 2010. This is clearly an ambitious target, but one which I'm confident we can achieve, given the tremendous commitment and hard work of our people. Over the past two years, we have established a strong platform from which to further target improvement, and it's particularly pleasing to finally see that our achievements are being widely acknowledged with accolades like Money magazine's Bank of the Year Award. During this period, we've closed the gap to the top rated peer bank from 12.5% as of June 2006 to 7.8% as at June 2008.</p>
          <p>In business banking over the past 12 months, the Group has recorded the strongest gains of all the major banks in customer satisfaction amongst businesses with annual turnover up to $100 million. Our institutional banking business has been recognized as the industry leader; once again receiving the highest satisfaction rating in the most recent Eastern Partners biannual survey. FirstChoice was rated number one platform by financial advisors as measured by investment trends and number one for service by Wealth Insights. ASB bank again won the Banker's Bank of The Year award for New Zealand and maintained its position as leader of the major domestic banks in recent customer service surveys.</p>
          <p>A key driver of improved customer satisfaction is better meeting the full financial service needs of our customers. And in this regard, we continue to make very encouraging progress in improving the right of converted referrals between our various business units. And I would stress that these are converted referrals; they do end up in additional business. So this improvement is translating directly into stronger volumes. And it's particularly pleasing to see that our improved performance and better customer service scores are being widely recognized across all of our businesses.</p>
          <p>In April, the Group announced a $580 million investment in our core banking systems. The aim of this investment is to deliver the systems and process changes which will enable us to make a step change improvement in our customer service, efficiency and productivity levels. This investment is a key example of our ongoing commitment to our core domestic banking franchise and our determination to reach number one in customer satisfaction. This is obviously the right time for such an investment.</p>
          <p>Over recent years, we have focused our energies and attention on improving the frontline interfaces with our customers, which has delivered market-leading frontline customer systems, such as CommSee, NetBank, CommSec, CommBiz and FirstChoice.</p>
          <p>For the Group to make the next step change improvement in customer service, the significant impediments are in our backend systems and processes, which now need to be addressed. The Group has spent two years in analysis and development work to get to the point where we are confident in our ability to successfully execute on this initiative. And we have, in fact, already built and tested some of the key capability components with encouraging results.</p>
          <p>The combination of background development, technical expertise and organizational commitment is not easily replicated and gives us a significant first-mover advantage.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the outlook. The issues and challenges, which dominated the global financial services industry during the 2008 financial year, will continue to dictate the outlook for the Australian banking sector for some time.</p>
          <p>The disruption to global credit markets, higher wholesale funding costs, and slowing economic growth will continue to have a significant impact for Australian banks through calendar 2009 and potentially beyond.</p>
          <p>While the domestic economy remains reasonably resilient, credit growth is expected to moderate, and slowing in the economy impacts our customers. While these broad trends are clearly evident, the duration and extent of the slowdown is more difficult to predict.</p>
          <p>While there are clearly a number of negatives at work in the Australian economy, there are some balancing factors. These include: the huge income boost from rising commodity prices, respectable growth in the economies of our major Asian trading partners, tax cuts, continuing strong immigration growth and robust business and infrastructure spending. The balance of these opposing forces favors continued modest economic and credit growth, not too far below the average of the past decade. Given current circumstances however, we intend to maintain a cautious and conservative stance going into the new financial year and while conditions will remain challenging, our expectation is that we will continue to perform well relative to our peers, given our strong capital position, our commitment to maintaining high risk management standards, the high levels of liquidity and retail funding and the underlying strength of our core franchises.</p>
          <p>While it is clearly a time to be cautious, the current environment does present well managed and strongly capitalized banks like the Commonwealth Bank with growth opportunities and options not generally available in buoyant markets. Nevertheless, our focus will be on maintaining the momentum in our core businesses and to further advance our low risk strategic agenda. I'll now hand you over to David Craig, who'll provide you with a more detailed analysis of the results and the financials. Thank you. David?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to address you on a chilly morning like this with such a solid result. As Ralph has mentioned to you, our operating income is up10% on the prior year. Of course, this has been a year of turbulence and as you expected, our loan impairment expenses up to $930 million, after we've provided management and economic overlays of $212 million during the year. That has led to our underlying profit being up 7% and then one should take into account the turbulence in the market and the impact on shareholder investment returns. We've delivered a cash net profit after tax up 5% at 4.733 billion.</p>
          <p>If we just have a look at the difference between the cash net profit and the statutory net profit, there are the usual things like treasury shares and AIFRS volatility and so on. But I want to call out two particular matters for you. The first is that we have booked a gain on the sale of our VISA shares of $295 million after tax, and this is a conservative accounting and we've still got baked into the book, obviously, for the shares to sell, which at down state, had an unrealized profit of about $100 million before tax.</p>
          <p>As we flagged at the time we announced the VISA profit, we've chosen to use the majority of this for the future and we've established an investment and restructuring provision of 264 million after tax, using most of that profit.</p>
          <p>We've been able to maintain positive "jaws", that is, income has grown at a faster rate than our expenses in every one of our businesses as you can see and that's pleasing. It's always been our target to ensure that we grow faster than our expenses, so that our cost to income ratio in each of our businesses continues to decline.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, we have grown expenses by 9% and that's largely as a result of the impact of investments and they come in two categories. Firstly, we've bought or rolled out a number of new businesses and new initiatives, which have been &#x2013; had a full impact this year of $224 million. So that's the cost base of IWL, the stock &#x2013; wholesale stockbroker we bought; the rollout or the acquisition, I should say, of Bank ANK in Indonesia; our Business Banking Growth Strategy; branch redesigns; and so on.</p>
          <p>And as well as that, we increased our investment for the future during the year by $89 million in terms of expense impact. That takes our total investment in this year to over $1 billion, up 30% on the prior year. As we mentioned at the half year, that growth in investment has been substantially funded by using the GST credits that we &#x2013; of 64 million that we recorded in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Clearly, a 9% increase in expenses is high. Fortunately, we had a 10% increase in income. But we are conscious that markets are moderating, and it's unlikely that income will grow as strongly next year as this year.</p>
          <p>And so we have had a very thorough look at all expenses and costs this year and have instituted a cost management program, and we're confident that we will continue to be able to deliver positive "jaws" in our businesses next year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the NIM, and the underlying NIM is down seven basis points for the half year. But I call out that four of those are due to the decision to hold extra liquid assets for the year, because of the volatility.</p>
          <p>Because of the impact of funding, our NIM on asset pricing has declined particularly on home loans. The decline in home loan NIM of eight basis points across the Group, obviously, accounts for a significant chunk and that's been offset to a significant degree by improvements on deposit pricing, bringing up six.</p>
          <p>Now I know that you're all interested in the loan impairment expense, and this is a reasonably complex chart, but I think it tells quite a story. If you look at the left hand chart, the left hand chart shows the six monthly annualized basis points over the last four periods, last two years. The gray bars at the bottom are our individually assessed provisions, so the bottom gray bars, the darker ones, are our consumer individually assessed provisions. And you'll see that our consumer provisions have actually declined from 11 to 12 basis points last year to nine to 10 basis points this year, eight to 10 basis points this year.</p>
          <p>And that's because of the improvement in the quality of our consumer book, largely off the back of not competing in zero rate transfer credit cards. In contrast and as was expected, our corporate impaired loans have increased from three basis points last year to eight basis points this year. Now if you look at the total of impaired loans, you will see that over this four period &#x2013; period &#x2013; four period follow-ups of six months, we have increased from 14 points to 15 points to 16 points and in most recent six months to 18 points. So there has been a slow deterioration in the quality of our book, but that 18 points is still well below the long-term expected loss average.</p>
          <p>What we have done in this period is significantly increase our collective provisions and primarily that is in management and economic overlays, where you see in the last six months we have added 11 basis points for that. So if we look at the full year result on the right hand chart which is in dollars, you can see that we've added $212 million for management and economic overlay, and as well as that the significant growth in our asset book that Ralph talked about, has led to a need just for straight volume increase in the provision of $69 million.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the credit quality in a bit more detail, starting with the consumer book. On the graph in the top right hand corner there shows you arrears on home loans. And as you can see, the arrears are running in a consistent basis with the last three years with a slight uptick only in the final month of the year, but still a very comfortably low level.</p>
          <p>70% of our home loans are paid at least one month in advance and in fact the average of that payment in advance is 7 to 8 months. We have a portfolio average loan to value ratio of 40% and we have no subprime or non-recourse loans. This is an extremely high quality book. In the unsecured lending, it's very pleased to see that our arrears are actually running at a lower rate than in any of the prior years &#x2013; any of the last three years. And you'll see in the chart above on the notes page, you'll see the 30 day arrears for both unsecured lending and credit cards, that dark purpley line below those of the prior years. And as I mentioned, that's because we are not participating in zero rate card transfers. So our 90 day arrears and our 30 day arrears have actually dropped and that's led to a reduction in the collective provision for that area.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the commercial book, the first pleasing thing is that we have no new large accounts that have caused us problems in this period &#x2013; in this six month period. There are no systematic issues as Ralph mentioned, evident across the portfolio. We have lower impaired assets than any of our large peers. 71% of our accounts are investment grade and indeed if you look at the top right hand chart, you'll see that that 71% has seen an improvement in the average quality of the portfolio with the AAA to AA minus increasing its share from 32% to 36% during the period.</p>
          <p>We have no exposure to foreign subprime or Alt-A. We have very minimal exposure to CDOs and CLOs of less than 50 million unit. A high quality margin lending book and no exposure to stock lending. So, on the whole, it's still a pretty good book in the commercial side.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look at the aggregate provisioning and ask ourselves do we have enough? I think first, it's worth remembering and this is what the top left hand chart shows you, that the Commonwealth Bank historically has a much lower loss rate than its competitors and that's been continuing.</p>
          <p>If you look at the bottom left hand graph, you see that new impaired loans have actually reduced in the last six months from the prior six months. The top right hand graph shows you that our net impaired loans, or indeed, gross impaired loans are lower than our three main competitors and that our provision against those loans is higher than any of our competitors as a percentage of the impaired assets. Now, the other question I get asked is about the collective provision, why is it that we seem to have a lower collective provision as a percentage of gross lines and advances. And there are two very simple answers to that. The first one evident from what I have already said, the overall quality of our book is better, but the other one is mix and I have put together a chart, bottom right hand corner just to explain a little bit about that.</p>
          <p>The first point here is if you have a look at home loans, Australian home loans make up 46% of our asset base compared to 33% on average for our competitors. Now home loans as you would have seen from the earlier slide are a very safe portfolio. Our expected loss over a prolonged period is only six basis points and our recent losses are in fact only one basis point.</p>
          <p>So very high proportion of our book in low risk categories. Similarly, margin lending, a low risk category where we have a much larger market share than our competitors. In contrast, we've a relatively lower share in unsecured retail, which is credit cards and personal loans and they carry 222 basis point expected loss over a prolonged period for us, probably higher for some of our competitors. And finally in the Australian commercial book, which again you would expect to see higher losses in, we average over a prolonged period about 30 basis points. Again we're under market share, 20% of our book is Australian commercial, compared to 23%. So as you can see, it's to do with mix and it's to do with quality.</p>
          <p>So let's turn to the performance of the businesses as a whole and it's very pleasing to see that every one of the businesses has contributed to this year's profit by increasing its profit. And even the corporate center, you may recall that at the half year, we chose to retain a $100 million of funding costs in the center in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, the corporate center has also increased its profits.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the retail bank to start with and I guess it's pretty blatant that our profit on home loans has actually decreased by 5% during the year.</p>
          <p>Now, that's despite a 15% volume growth, and as Ralph pointed out, a significant gain in market share. Why is that? That's because the funding costs that we haven't been able to fully pass on to our customers have cost 16 basis points during the year. So our margins have dropped faster than volume has gone up.</p>
          <p>In consumer finance, you may wonder why that net income appears to be down. Well, it is down 3%. The good news in this space is that when you then take off the loan impairment expense, our profit on credit cards, for example, which is the chunk here, is actually up 17% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>So while our volume is down a little bit, the quality of the portfolio has improved, and we're making more profits out of credit cards than we did this time last year. And of course, the real story behind the result is retail deposits, where we've seen a dramatic flight to quality, with the volumes up 18% and profits up 12%.</p>
          <p>The final point to make on this slide is very prudent cost management in the retail book. Ross McEwan and his team have done a sensational job, delivering a reduced expense to income ratio of 45.2%.</p>
          <p>If we just have a look at a quick scorecard for the retail bank, in line with customer satisfaction going up, it's pleasing to see a 60% year-on-year increase in compliments. Also, I think, another area that we've been weak historically was just in sales through our branch network. And it's very pleasing to see that our branch network has delivered above system growth sales during the year, with balanced growth increasing by 5.9% compared to the market of 4.7.</p>
          <p>And finally on the bottom right hand corner, you can see a continuation of the steady trend a very low and stable consumer arrears.</p>
          <p>If we turn to premium business services, the headline institutional profit is up 14% but when you take out last year we saw Loy Yang was included in the profit in institutional banking. The profit &#x2013; underlying profit is up 19%. It's very pleasing to be able to report to you that business banking, which is of course a key strategy, has seen for the first time in my time, double-digit profit growth with income up 14%. Deposit balances as Ralph mentioned, are up 24% across premium business services, margins are stable. The IWL acquisition has been successfully bedded down. So on the whole, with the exception obviously of loan impairment, a strong result from premium business services.</p>
          <p>And again, if we have a look at the score card for this business, you can see that we've been thoughtful about how we attack the market. The top left hand graph shows you our growth compared to that of the market and you see that on business deposits we have outperformed the market by 5.2% and on corporate banking which is the business banking pace, we've outperformed by 1.9 on volume. But you will see that there is a decline in institutional and markets and you may wonder why that it is. Well again it's about profitable growth, it's about using the profit after capital charge methodologies to target and ensure that we are maintaining our profitable relationships but where there are less profitable relationships we're moving them off balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Customer complaints are down. The CommBiz migration now sees 93% of our customers on CommBiz and CommSec continues to grow strongly on volumes.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the Wealth Management business, in a turbulent market, 18% up for Wealth Management is a sensational result. CFS Global Asset Management grew 38% on its profit with funds under management up nine percent to $153 billion. And I'm pleased to say that 84% of Anglia Water has now been sold down with the balance to be sold down this year.</p>
          <p>Colonial First State, which clearly is very impacted by market movements, has still been able to increase its profit by 5% with positive net flows in all quarters and FirstChoice now the second largest platform in the market. And CommonShare has had a more difficult year as has the insurance market, in general, impacted by weather events, but nonetheless extremely strong revenue growth.</p>
          <p>If we have a look at our scorecard for this business, you see funds under managed, under administration, I should say, up 10%; FirstChoice with its positive net flows; 63% of our funds performing above benchmark, and a 22% increase in insurance premiums.</p>
          <p>Turning to International Financial Services, and again, headline 23% growth in International; Six ASP was up 16%, and when you take out the favorable hedging that we had in New Zealand dollars, the profit in that business was up 11%. And you can see that the growth from our Asian businesses is up very significantly on prior years.</p>
          <p>Sovereign Insurance in New Zealand is continuing to capture significant market share with 35% of all new business being won, and as you would expect, loan impairment expense is up $23 million on New Zealand economic slowdown, but we're very confident about the level of provisioning in that business.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to funding, obviously a topic of great interest and this time last year, we would have shown you that 55 &#x2013; 54-55% of our funding came from retail deposits, well that's now 58% as there has been a flight to quality, leaving the balance obviously to be funded by wholesale.</p>
          <p>We've been reaffirmed with a AA credit rating and a stable outlook. We've a highly diversified wholesale funding base and in particular no reliance on securitization and our long term maturity duration is three and one-half years. The bottom right hand chart shows you the liquids that we're holding and you can see how significantly they have increased, which had that impact of four basis points down as you know for the last half, but we're holding $10 billion more liquid assets than we're required, as well as that we've this medallion RMBS that we can repost with the Reserve Bank that would provide a further 13, giving us a total of $50 billion of accessible liquid assets.</p>
          <p>And our capital remains extremely strong. Sitting at the 30th of June at Tier 1 at 8.17% and total capital at 11.58, now that 8.17 is substantially above our target range of 6.5 to 7, but we've chosen to be prudent in these times. Let's have a look at that compared to our competitors. And the graph on the top right shows that 8.17% against each of our competitors most recently reported numbers.</p>
          <p>It's interesting to note too that the APRA interpretation of Basel II is reasonably conservative compared to overseas. And one of the questions that I get, when I travel, is "8.17%, that seems all right, but it's not that stellar compared to some European banks."</p>
          <p>Well, the reason for that is just different guidelines and different interpretations. So, for example, interest rate risk in the banking book is a Pillar 3 disclosure requirement in the rest of the world. But in Australia, as you know, we're going to take a deduction from capital for it.</p>
          <p>When you back out all of that &#x2013; all of those differences, you find that our Tier 1 capital leaps up to 10.1%, which is what the bottom right-hand graph shows you, and that compares to just 8.7% for the top 20 European banks. So on any international or local comparison, we're extremely well capitalized.</p>
          <p>Let me just summarize the key messages for you. By a solid operating result, I mean a record profit and a record dividend in turbulent times. This has been a great year for the Bank from a strategic standpoint.</p>
          <p>While most of my presentation to you has been about a few hundred seasoned professionals in credit risk, market risk, funding and liquidity, 39,000 staff have been extremely focused on delivering on the Ralph five key initiatives. And we have made measurable progress on each and every one of those. And this has been typified by the good market share growth across the board, particularly in deposits.</p>
          <p>We have very sound risk management, and that has &#x2013; and we always have done, and that has delivered very good credit quality. Nevertheless, we have chosen to set aside a further 212 million of management and economic overlays to give us extremely conservative provisioning under the rules. And we have strong capital funding in liquidity. Now, let me tell you what that means, because we could have delivered a higher profit, we could have delivered a higher earnings per share, if we'd chosen to reduce our capital levels, if we'd chosen to go short on our funding, or if we'd chosen not to have so much liquid surpluses. But we chose to be conservative, because we are determined to offer strengths to our shareholders and to our customers in these uncertain times.</p>
          <p>I'll now be happy to take questions with Ralph.</p>

          <p>Thanks, David. Just before we move on to questions, just a couple of housekeeping matters. Could we just keep the number of questions to two initially given the time constraint. Can you wait for the microphone and can you please identify yourself. I'll start with questions from the floor and then move on to the phones. I'm also conscious that we have possibly some media people here and on the phones. We have a media conference on at two o'clock this afternoon, so I'd appreciate it if media could hold off on their questions until then. So, Jarrod?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin from ABN Amro, I think still. Question for Ralph, or David, just difference in your &#x2013; in what you're saying between retail banking services and some on the institutional side in terms of pursuing profitable growth versus home loan margin decline of 16 basis points and the loss in home lending, it looks as if you're writing uneconomic business on the home lending side and willing to actually pursue that, but then on the flip side you're talking about pursuing profitable growth, and therefore, you're getting market share losses on some of the other side. Seems to be a disconnect there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jarrod, it's not a disconnect. We are obviously also driven by our profit after capital charge numbers to make sure that we are actually delivering on a risk adjusted basis, good quality returns. Now, if you look at the home loan environment, certainly our pricing is a little sharper than our competitors, basically around 4 or 5 basis points. I think it's fair to say that the work that we did earlier in the year in regard to moderating commissions for brokers has had a reduction in the cost of the broker channel, so we've picked up a benefit there. I think it's fair to say that where we currently sit on pricing is not where we would like to sit in the future. It's fair to say that over time we would expect that the margin on home loans will revert to a level which is consistent with where it was say 12, 13 months ago.</p>
          <p>In regard to the reduction on loans that we've had in regard to the corporate institutional bank, we've looked very closely at that portfolio, in particularly where there have been loans that we have seen as being suboptimal from a return and value perspective. We have either sold down or reduced our exposure to those types of facilities. So, there is a balance in what we're doing, but we see that we are building a business for long-term value, and we believe that the approach that we've taken with our new risk methodologies and new pricing matrices, and working very clearly using a profit after capital charge methodology, will result in better-quality returns going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a second question, seeing Mark's out the door on that, notwithstanding your comment that you expect to maintain positive revenue and expense ratios in FY '09, what's the Board's view that over a short period of time that they're happy for that to be negative or your ability to actually pull back on expenses in the short-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well certainly we're obviously aware of the fact that the outlook for the next 12 months is probably going to be softer from the revenue perspective, and we've got to make sure that our cost management is sufficient in order to make sure that we maintain our positive "jaws" and certainly we've got a number of initiatives and have had a number of initiatives under way for the last several months to make sure that we can wind back some of those costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would that potentially &#x2013; is that either a full year '09? Could you see first half '09 having a negative outcome there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point, I'm still reasonably &#x2013; I'm reasonably positive that we will see a positive "jaws" from the first half of '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. James Freeman, Goldman Sachs JBWere. Ralph, I just wanted to get a little bit more of a comment around the margin, if I could, just what the actual incremental margin is doing? We've heard some of the other banks suggesting that the margins have stabilized in recent months, whereas we're looking at quite a big decline from CBA. And just within that context, I just noticed on your deposit mix, there's been a big shift out of some of the low cost accounts into what looks to be the higher-cost investment accounts. I'm just wondering if you could wrap those two together? And just &#x2013; my last question, thanks to Warwick, the 212 million of economic overlay, just wanting a overview of what you've actually included in there. Is it a movement in unemployment or are we just looking at rates and oil as the main drivers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If we look at the deposit margin, certainly there has been a reduction in the transaction balances that have seen some migration into the high-cost term deposit end of the market. You'd expect to see that in a market that has rising interest rates and a high degree of sensitivity around rates.</p>
          <p>Certainly, over time, we've expected to see a reduction in the level of those balances and as a proportion of the book. We have had very good growth in the overall book, obviously, with significant market share gain over the period.</p>
          <p>All in all, I think, from our perspective, having a higher reliance on retail funding in this type of environment is not a bad situation to have, seeing how that moved from 54% of our book to 58% of our book. So all in all, we always have factored in, in that 10-basis-point reduction that we would see on a year-on-year basis, a reduction in those transaction balances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the 212 million economic overlay, as you know, international accounting standards require that we use a modeled collective provision, which is based on more recent years of performance. So, roughly, the last five years of results are included in that model.</p>
          <p>And we've taken the view that the last five years may not be 100% representative of the next six to 12 months as to what's likely to happen to what's baked in the book at the moment. So we've done a range of stress tests and modeling around that and have concluded that a further 200-odd million will go to cover that problem.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Jon Mott from UBS. A question also on the collective provision. If you look at the tier 1 deduction, you've got to take for the APRA expected loss in excess of your collective provision, despite the top up you've taken and the additional growth in the book, you're seeing that deductions up continue to rise, which would suggest that using APRA stress tests, it's actually seen a deterioration of the book, worse than what you're suggesting? Can you just reconcile those comments? And the second one would be, if we continue, from an economic point of view, what would we need to see for further top up to the collective provision, from a management and economic overlay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we'd need to see a further substantial deterioration in the Australian economy, to answer the second part first. But on the question of APRA versus ours, as you know APRA uses a highly stressed model, whereas we are providing based on current economic conditions, and so by definition they're two different stress tests, two different scenarios. And so you would expect that the higher stress model would move further than the current economic conditions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the APRA assumptions have changed more than yours, or is it just a change in how bad it could get from APRA? It's a large movement despite...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Well, there's been significant volume growth in the business, don't forget, so, in part it reflects the increase in volume.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ralph, it's James Ellis from Credit Suisse. Just revisiting the question on the reinvestment agenda and the desire to have positive "jaws," if we move into a very slow revenue environment where the cost management programs don't give you the reinvestment headroom which you've alluded to, how do you respond to that? Do you just play on with reinvestments or do you curb that to have positive" jaws"? And then sort of within that, how much of your current reinvestment has been effectively pre-funded because you've got this large restructuring provision you've taken against Visa? Does that sort of pre-fund a lot of your current initiatives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That obviously does have an impact on that future investment program, but I think it's fair to say that where we are currently, we have made a significant number of investments which are in the process now of delivering. We're in a situation where obviously we have made commitments in regard to our core banking modernization program, and so that is effectively baked in going forward. But we don't see &#x2013; and we always saw that that would be part and parcel of our ongoing investment program and not a special charge per se. I think it's fair to say that we're obviously looking at the cost situation very closely. And certainly, our investment range of new investment initiatives is certainly being reduced, given the fact that we can see that going forward, over the next 12 months, we are likely to see, as I said at the outset, a more moderate level of growth, and obviously that has an impact on revenue. So, we are very cognizant of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. David, a question on provisioning. On one slide you said that the individually assessed provision on the corporate portfolio is 8 basis points for the full year, and then on another slide you say the expected loss on the Australian commercial portfolio is 30 basis points. Firstly, are they comparable numbers? Secondly, do you expect the actual charge to trend towards the expected charge in 2009? And if that happens, do you think Commonwealth Bank can actually grow its cash profit next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Goodness, multiple questions. As you know there's a significant difference between individually assessed provisions which are known problems, identified &#x2013; probably companies in default, we are able to calculate a definable provision based on a particular point in time. Whereas the expected loss which we have disclosed this year is the long-term, ten years through a cycle, average loss over a very prolonged period. Clearly, as I have mentioned, the individually assessed provisions are trending up slowly but they're still well short of the very long term average expected loss. I don't expect that we're going to leap to that long-term average in any time short, but over &#x2013; but to look at a total loan impairment expense which the long-term expected loss on the whole book is about 24 basis points, that's probably a conservative guideline. If I had one at the moment that'd be the sort of conservative guideline I'd be looking at for next year, and at 24 basis points, we'll be a very profitable bank next year.</p>

          <p>Craig Williams from Citi. Within your outlook statements, you note that you look to further strengthen core businesses with attractive on-strategy investment &#x2013; if attractive on strategy investments arise. So, do we take from that that ABN Amro was now considered off-strategy, perhaps a matter of pricing between the two parties, or perhaps a view on the quality of assets? And secondly, with respect to credit growth outlook, particularly business lending, that looks to be relatively optimistic versus current run rates over the past three or four months. So why has the bank held its optimism, given business confidences continuing to trend down, business conditions looks like they are still deteriorating and tough global economic outlook?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig, firstly, in regard to ABN AMRO, situation changed over the last couple of weeks with, obviously, the impact of stipends that came out of Melbourne in regard to a couple of banks in their respected positions, which has had some impact internationally on reputation of Australian banks and ability to access international funding markets. Obviously in undertaking an acquisition at this time, it was a requirement or would be a requirement to raise significant funds to &#x2013; for the book that we would be taking over from ABS. And we came to conclusion as of yesterday given where markets are that it would be prudent at this point not to go ahead any further with the due diligence process that we were really involved with. So I have to say that really what happened in the last couple of weeks has had an -</p>

          <p>There's obviously been a decline in credit cards in the very short term in the very recent past. I think that's substantially &#x2013; that immediate decline is substantially a reaction to what we've had, very high oil prices and sharply rising interest rates and people just got sticker shock, both oil prices and probably interest rates appear to be easing back a bit. And I think that there will be a recovery in credit growth. The underlying, as Ralph said, we believe the underlying drive in the economy is still there and that that we'll still see reasonable credit growth.</p>

          <p>Brett Le Mesurier, Wilson HTM. A question in relation to the yield, which excluding securitization has gone up 49 points in the last six months, which is 10 points less than the increase in the average. Cash rate, you've also been increasing mortgage rates in addition to the cash rate. How come the increase is materially below the increase in the average cash rate?</p>

          <p>Well, there are lags in cash rate rises. I can assure you that we have passed on, as we have said, increases. And whether you're looking at average balance sheets, I'm not quite sure, but you need to look at the average balance sheet, and I can &#x2013; we've got some analysis for you on all those averages and all those rates that we can share with you afterwards.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I am looking at the average balance rate. So, it's rather odd because you talked about a large decline in your margin, and it seems to be at the revenue line.</p>

          <p>You talked about a large decline in your margins and it seems to be on the revenue, being the &#x2013; what you're charging your customers, that's different to the pricing that we see in the market. So you don't have a comment on that?</p>

And as I said, it all depends &#x2013; don't forget in the first half, there were all sorts of things to do with the costs in the first half of the year. The costs went up, passed on to the retail bank in the second half of the year they were.

      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good answer. The second question is in relation to the collective provisioning adequacy and you referred to mix differences between the banks. But on the Basel II risk assets, if you use that as the denominator adjust for risk differences across books and let me direct your collective provisions still looks low relative to P's. Do you have another good answer for that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are using the APRA credit risk weighted numbers between the Basel II, which in turn uses the APRA. So you will be aware that the APRA guidelines, which is what we have to use for that, have quite different loss rates particularly for home loans than is our expectation so it's &#x2013; and I think all the other banks have called out that they are normally. So because we have such a large home loan portfolio you get different numbers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. Matt Davidson from Merrill Lynch. A couple of questions on capital, slide 59 you've shown a stable target Tier 1 range. Should we take that as a grade with APRA and one to carry forward? And the second question was relating to the adjustment for interest rate risk in the banking book, looks like it's about 60 basis points. One of your peers last week talked about 25 basis points, could you just highlight some of the differences that might be affecting your number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it comes down to the fact that the competitor that's talking about 25 basis points effectively carries the risk in the traded market book and we haven't done that to this point. So based on that difference in treatment we end up in a situation where our numbers are around 59 basis points. We believe that that's high given the fact that, we have taken what we take few as a very prudent position in the way that we have managed the tenure of our funding and duration.</p>
          <p>So as you would have seen from David's presentation, we have an average duration of 3.5 years. Now, if we were to have shortened that we would end up in a situation where we would have a lower number. But we don't see that as being particularly prudent and so we probably have a difference of view with APRA as to how that should be treated from the point of view that, my view is that a match duration over time, is a better situation than having a short end front-loaded book. So anyway, that's the reason for that differential at this point. We will obviously look at whether or not we should move to treat our interest rate risk in a similar manner to other competitors if it means that we get a lower level of attribution for the point of view of the amount of capital that would be attributed to that. So that's where we currently stand from. Want to add anything more to that, David?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Not on that point. On the question of the target range, we haven't shifted that as you know for some time for three reasons, one because it's turbulent times and although we think that target range is conservative, we've in fact gotten to a capital level above that because of the times. Secondly, because we've been waiting for APRA to formally notify us of their PCI ratio, which we in fact got just the other day. And thirdly because Standards and Poor's and the other rating agencies are still working through how they should be measuring banks now that Basel II is in place and we're waiting to hear from them. So for those three reasons we haven't shifted the target range, but we think that target range is very conservative and certainly don't think that it will go up, but we'll probably over the next six months formalize the Basel II target range.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. My question is related to what Craig Williams asked earlier on ABN AMRO. Your answer was seemingly withdrawn because Australian banks currently might have difficulty raising funds into the international market for the acquisition. So the withdrawal has nothing to do with any price disagreements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we didn't get to the point of discussing or negotiating price any further than the indicative offer that we had bid some two or three weeks ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And CBA has no concern in terms of strategy or cultural fits so far with the due diligence process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's fair to say that any acquisition of this type is going to have potential difficulties, and obviously there is going to be issues around cultural issues. It's a reasonably complex business, not large, but it has a lot of moving parts. And so on balance given as I said the issues in regard to the fact that it wasn't the actually the funding of the purchase price, it's actually the funding of the liabilities that, that will be the assets that are in the business that we came to the view that in the current market, it probably wasn't a wise situation for us to continue.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just regarding the seed assets in the book, you mentioned there's $108 million profit for the sales of the seed assets, just wondering what's left once we sell down the rest of AWG in the '09 year &#x2013; any more seed assets on balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's obviously the 16% residual of AWG. We also have UUE, the lines company in the UK, there is about 300...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, 66% which is about 300 million 350 million in that, and then we have the Sonic music catalogs, which was around 100 million on the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we'll see Sonic move off the balance sheet sometime during the first half. And as far UUE is concerned, that's likely to move into our European Diversified Infrastructure Fund, as is the balance AWG, during the balance of '09.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very clean. Yes. We've had minimal write-offs on the margin lending book. We had a very low level of loan to valuation ratio, and we also had a situation where we only lent against selected blue chip stocks. So from that perspective, we've seen our book hold up extremely well.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's William from Credit Suisse. Maybe, on the other side of that question, where are the opportunities here? If we look at this opportunistically and putting your outlook statement a bit to the side, where do you see the opportunities for CBA to leverage its advantages and take advantage of, perhaps, some other competitors, who may not be in such a strong space, including the non-banks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's no doubt that the non-bank lenders have largely left the market at this point. So it's offering a great opportunity for us to increase our position in the retail market, particularly in the home loan market. Certainly we're seeing a significant opportunity to increase our retail deposits, and we've performed very strongly in the last half as far as that's concerned.</p>
          <p>We see also in the small to medium size part of the business market opportunities going forward in that regard, and particularly when you get a situation occurring where obviously there will be some dislocation with the potential merger that's likely to take place later on in the year.</p>
          <p>So, I think from our perspective we see a situation where we're in a good position, very strong capital wise. We have a number of competitors that obviously have different issues on their plate and different degrees of appetite caused by that. So, we think that all in all, we've got a very good business. All of our businesses are quality businesses. Our capital position is pristine. I think we are very well provisioned. And certainly, when we look at our book across the board systemically they are all in very good shape.</p>
          <p>So, I think that there are a number of opportunities for us going forward. I'm not going to be overly specific, because obviously we are working on strategies and tactical initiatives in various parts of the market.</p>
          <p>And you're obviously seeing some of those like the roll out of the new banking capability with CommSec, which has been tremendously successful, after only two or three months, being well above any projections we had for that business, and with well over 70% of those CommSec customers not being banking customers with Commonwealth Bank Group. It has given us a very good market of potential customers to grow into, high quality customers at that.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Time for two more questions, Scott, do you have one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, very briefly on the tax to lower &#x2013; tax rate you referred to, the satisfactory resolution of a long outstanding issue with tax authorities? Just provide a bit more detail on that and if there are any other outstanding items that may come to a satisfactory conclusion in the future? And secondly, just on the trading income, very little commentary around that. I noticed the replicating portfolio chart made another appearance in the pack, that was absent on the VAL limits in utilization thereof, so just a bit commentary around how you saw the trading performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Happy to answer both of those questions for you. First on the tax, I think this is pretty good evidence of the prudent approach we always take to provisioning, so if we ever have any sort of discussion or issue on anything, we provide for that upfront, or at least provide a conservative amount for it and what's happened is a couple of issues during this year, have been resolved in our favor which has led to a reduction or reversal of provisions that we were carrying. We always have provisions for other issues, we are not going to discuss our tax relationships globally in this meeting, but clearly we believe we are very conservatively provided. Our ongoing guidance, you didn't ask for it, but I will give it anyway. Our tax rate is 27 to 28% on an ongoing basis. On the question of trading income, I think there was a lot of speculation 12 months ago, as we sat here, of people saying, you have lost great traders, your trading income is going to crash through the floor. So it's obviously very pleasing to see that it's very strong, higher than last year and we think that it's always been an ongoing and steady source of income for us. So...</p>

          <p>The VAR limits, yes, you would have noticed last week with one of the other banks reporting as well on that our VAR has gone up, both in the trading and non-trading book, and that's a reflection more than anything of the significantly increased volatility. So you got to apply today's market volatility to the same sort of book and suddenly you find the VAR price goes up. But it's still from our point of view well within our limits and still producing good results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Susie Fenton from Lone Star. We always hear about, how competitive the New Zealand banking market is, and obviously the economies doing pretty tough, but CBA is able to be report a 11% profit growth in that market, which is a great result. Could you just walk us through, how that was attained and what's happening with the competitive dynamics within that marketplace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that the ASB operation in New Zealand is a very good operation. It performs very, very well. It has productivity advantages over its competitors with a very low cost to income ratio, and it's able to operate very competitively. So I think its strategies and the way that it accesses the market. The quality of its branch network, the quality of its services, the quality of its products give it a very strong position in the New Zealand market and this had a consistency strategy over an extended period of time, whereas most of our competitors there seem to chop and change, have lots of change in senior management and I think that we are very fortunate that our New Zealand operations for long time have had a very good management team there, that knows the market very well, whereas most of our competitors continue to transplant new executives there on a regular basis, who don't seem to consistently get to know the market and establish the linkages and the relationships that the ASB Bank team has over what is probably the best part of 20 years.</p>
