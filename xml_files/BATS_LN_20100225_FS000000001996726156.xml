        <plist>
          <p>Well good morning, everyone. I'm Paul Adams, Chief Executive of British American Tobacco. With me this morning are Nicandro Durante, Chief Operating Officer and Ben Stevens, Finance Director. Thank you all for coming. And a warm welcome to those of you who maybe listening on the conference call or watching via our website, bat.com. After taking you through the results there will as always be an opportunity for people in the audience to ask questions.</p>
          <p>In 2009, the world found itself in the grip of the deepest global recession since the 1930s. Tough times, indeed, with investors and consumers alike looking for stability amid the turmoil of financial uncertainty and rising unemployment. That's why when you look at the headline numbers I am delighted once more to be presenting another excellent year for British American Tobacco, one that has capped off a highly successful decade in the group's history.</p>
          <p>Each one of these metrics showed growth in the face of the recession and underlines the importance of the consistent business strategy that delivers in bad times as well as good. It has also enabled us to reward shareholders over the years and the group's dividend policy of paying out 65% of adjusted diluted earnings per share means a 19% boost in dividends to 99.5 pence per share.</p>
          <p>Now this chart illustrates exactly what we mean by consistency. Adjusted earnings per share and dividends per share over the past decade have grown every year without exception to achieve a cumulative annual growth rate of almost 12% for earnings and almost 15% for dividends.</p>
          <p>Our strategy continues to focus on four key areas: growth, productivity, responsibility and winning organization. This, along with our balanced brand portfolio covering all the key consumer segments and price points, together with our geographic spread has helped us to achieve sustainable growth in bad times as well as good.</p>
          <p>And of course, that sustainable growth has been reflected in share price appreciation and total shareholder return of 26% per annum over the last decade, compared to an annual return of less than 1% from the FTSE 100. That translates into a return of 880% over the 10 years.</p>
          <p>So those are the headlines. I will now go into some of the details behind today's announcement.</p>
          <p>Group volumes rose 1.3% to 724 billion. Acquired volume accounted for 4.6% of the growth and is reflected in the higher volumes recorded in the Asia-Pacific, Western Europe and Africa and Middle East regions. Share loss in Russia and some Asia-Pacific markets impacted volume by around 0.5%. We estimate that lower industry volumes due to rising levels of unemployment, excise increases and rising illicit trade negatively impacted volumes by approximately 2.8%. As you can see from this chart, it was the Americas and Eastern Europe volumes that were affected most by lower industry volumes. Organic volume was down 3% in 2009.</p>
          <p>While most commentators are forecasting improving economic conditions in 2010, unemployment is likely to worsen in developed countries and we would expect volumes to be under pressure in these markets. However, some developing markets have been less affected by the global recession and are likely to see a measure of economic recovery and lower levels of unemployment in the year ahead.</p>
          <p>Revenue grew strongly in all regions at both current and constant rates of exchange. Revenue growth was principally driven by pricing, which contributed around 8% of revenue growth. Mix was broadly neutral and the effect of exchange rates benefited revenue by almost 8% to give an overall increase of 17% at current rates of exchange.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting that the sales of our premium brands remained relatively resilient in 2009. Our volume is still split one-third in each of the premium, mid price, and low price segments. It is also worth noting that some two-thirds of our revenue comes from developing markets, which bodes well as some of the key developing markets now appear to be emerging from the recession.</p>
          <p>Profit rose 10% at constant rates and 20% at current rates of exchange. Each region achieved strong profit growth with the exception of Eastern Europe, which saw profit growth 7% lower at constant rates of exchange. Across that region, the dramatic consequences of the economic crisis through reduced purchasing power and significant excise and price increases has triggered changes in consumer behavior, such as lower consumption and downtrading and has fueled the increase of illicit trade. We estimate the duty paid market to be down around 5% across that region.</p>
          <p>Profit was affected also by currency devaluation and large transactional FX hits on costs of around &#xA3;150 million. The full impact of these costs were partly offset by savings in the supply chain and indirects.</p>
          <p>Eastern Europe was tough, but the geographic spread of the Group, effectiveness of our strategy and strength of the brands have enabled us to deliver another year of excellent results against the backdrop of one of the most difficult business conditions seen for decades.</p>
          <p>We've seen strong growth. Adjusted profit has grown almost 50% since 2007. Our productivity strategy has delivered annualized cost savings of &#xA3;484 million in two years and that has driven profit growth. Responsibility is important. We remain focused on our sustainability agenda. We will be reporting on that in more detail in May with our sustainability report.</p>
          <p>The organization is focused and energized. It is delivering its target and we are making good progress on our global integration program which will be an important part in delivering our target of &#xA3;800 million of annual savings by 2012.</p>
          <p>This is a strategy designed to deliver shareholder value. It has enabled us to grow dividends per share by 50% in two years and that has underpinned the share price during some very volatile times. Moreover, the strategy gives us the confidence that we can continue to deliver in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>Nicandro will now tell you what's been happening in the business.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul. Good morning everyone.</p>
          <p>Paul has just described the revenue and profit growth as shown in the income statement. But let me start by preempting a question that we'll almost certainly be asked later on. During 2009, we were sometime asked to provide a figure for organic revenue and profit growth.</p>
          <p>To give a definitive answer is very difficult, because we had integrated the Tekel and ST businesses by this time last year. However, if you take the revenue and profit contributions of Tekel and ST in the second half of 2008, and add those contributions to the first half of 2008, we get an estimated full year contribution from the acquired businesses.</p>
          <p>Using that assumption, we estimate that the organic constant currency turnover grew by 5% and operating profit by 7%. We also estimate transaction of foreign exchange to have hit product cost by around 150 million in 2009. Adding this back would give an underlying organic profit increase of 11%.</p>
          <p>Turning first to the Global Drive Brands, despite the severity of the recession, the Global Drive Brands still grew 4% to 195 billion. Migrations accounted for approximately half of that growth. Although it was down 4%, Kent performed well in the majority of its key markets increasing volume, sales and improving both market share and brand image.</p>
          <p>Volume growth in the AME [Africa/Middle East] region was particularly strong. However, volumes in Japan and Eastern Europe, notably Russia, were impacted as economic downturn in these markets is squeezed consumer spending power. Kent's leading role in innovation continued to deliver positive results with Nanotek growing by 24% in 2009.</p>
          <p>Dunhill enjoyed a consistent growth in 2009. Market share increased in both established and new markets, indicating the growing relevance of the brand to consumers. Innovation continues to be a feature. The re-lock pack was launched in most core markets, driving gains in market share. The brand migration from Carlton to Dunhill in Brazil was also very successful.</p>
          <p>Lucky Strike delivered another year of solid growth, up 4%. Market share grew or was maintained in 9 out of its top 10 markets, the one exception being Indonesia due to a change in excise. The brand is particularly successful among under 30, and the segment accounts for more than 60% of its consumers.</p>
          <p>Pall Mall delivered an excellent performance in 2009, up 10% as well as market share increase across its key markets. Consumers' perception of the brand has improved globally due to new packaging and communication. We continue to migrate from smaller, local value for money brands as well as reducing complexity and increasing productivity.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to invest in the global drive brands through innovation, migrations, rollouts into new markets. It's our aim to ensure that we come out of this recession stronger than we went in.</p>
          <p>Turning to the regions, in Asia-Pacific, revenue and profit were both up over 20%, mainly as a result of favorable exchange, good performance in Australia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Taiwan and Vietnam, as well as the contribution from the acquisition of Bentoel at the end of Q2. At constant rates, profit would have been up 10%.</p>
          <p>Australia delivered a strong profit growth due to higher pricing and continued cost savings initiatives. Volumes were in line with last year. In Malaysia, profits rose and Dunhill achieved a record share. However, volumes were affected by the growth in illicit trades following steep excise increases over the last two years. Illicit trade now represents 37% of the total consumption.</p>
          <p>In Japan, favorable exchange mix and productivity savings helped the strong profit growth. However, volumes were affected by declines across the industry. Volumes and market share grew in South Korea but profit was lower due to an unfavorable exchange rate which also affected transactional costs.</p>
          <p>In the Americas, the region delivered a 13% increase in profit despite a 6% decline in volumes. Volumes were impacted by decreases across most markets despite some market share gains. Brazil saw strong growth in profit due to a price increase following an excise increase, coupled with a better premium mix and improved margins on leaf. Overall, industry volumes declined but market share improved in the legal market. Dunhill is performing well following its migration from Carlton.</p>
          <p>In Canada, profit increased due to a favorable exchange rate. Market share and volumes decline is likely, although there is some evidence of a light reduction in illicit rates. Industry volumes were affected in Mexico, following excise-driven price increases at the end of 2008, leading to lower profits.</p>
          <p>Western Europe had a strong year with profits up 31% at current rates and 16% at constant. Italy, Germany, Poland and the Netherlands all contributed to this good performance as well as the acquisition of ST in 2008.</p>
          <p>Volumes were also helped by the acquisition in Greece, French and in Spain, offsetting declines in Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Pricing, mix and productivity savings helped to increase profits in Italy, but volumes dropped as the total market contracted.</p>
          <p>Volumes in Germany were in line with last year, benefiting from lower illicit rates and stable consumption. Market share improved driven by good performances from Pall Mall and Lucky Strike. The integration of ST business is now complete and profit was in line with expectation.</p>
          <p>Paul has already discussed the impact of the financial crisis on the Eastern European region where profit fell 13%, or 7% in constant terms, and volumes were 4% lower. In Russia, volumes were hit by the decline in the overall market and down trading following the 2008 price increases.</p>
          <p>Profits fell due to lower volumes, higher marketing costs, and adverse exchange rates. The Group's market share fell, although Dunhill and Kent maintained share. In Romania Kent, Dunhill and Vogue all performed well. Volumes were lower due to large price &#x2013; excise price increase and increased elicit rates. Profits were affected by higher market investments, higher product costs together with reduced volumes.</p>
          <p>In Ukraine, trading conditions were particularly difficult although Kent grew share and volume. There were strong volumes and market share performance in the Caucasus through the growth of Kent, Pall Mall and Viceroy. In Uzbekistan, profit increased significantly.</p>
          <p>The African/Middle East region had an outstanding year with good performances from many of its key markets. Profits grew 41%, or 28% at constant rates, mainly driven by South Africa, Nigeria, the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] and the benefit of the Tekel acquisition during 2008. In South Africa, volumes declined as the overall market contracted together with reductions in trade inventories and an increase in illicit rates.</p>
          <p>However, market share increased and Dunhill and Kent both delivered good performances. Profit was up, benefiting from lower costs and price increases. Nigeria increased profit, market share and volumes. Profit grew significantly due to lower costs and increased volumes, with good volume growth from both Dunhill and Pall Mall.</p>
          <p>In Turkey, the Tekel business was successfully integrated. Kent, Pall Mall and Viceroy all performed well, although the decline of the Tekel local brands led to a fall in total market share.</p>
          <p>Ben will now take you through the remainder of the presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nicandro, and good morning everyone. Each year with the preliminary results, we report on the progress we've made with our productivity programs. The first five-year productivity program ended in 2007, achieving annual savings of just over &#xA3;1 billion. The new five-year target of &#xA3;800 million was announced two years ago. With &#xA3;245 million delivered in year one and with a further &#xA3;239 million in year two, we're on track to achieve the target by 2012.</p>
          <p>The areas we are focusing on are supply chain efficiencies, back office integration and management structures. The group's operating margin in 2007 was 30%. I've stated that the current cost savings program should produce a margin of 34% by 2012.</p>
          <p>Year one of the productivity program saw the operating margin rise to 30.7%, and in year two it rose to 31.4% so we're on track to achieve the 34% target. This improvement in margin was particularly pleasing in a year when the group's margin was under pressure from the effect of adverse foreign exchange transactional impacts on our costs. The region particularly affected by this was Eastern Europe, where transactional effects resulted in that region's margin deteriorating by four percentage points. Clearly, our productivity program has allowed us to mitigate some of these higher costs.</p>
          <p>Turning to the income statement, adjusted profit from operations grew 20% to &#xA3;4461 million and Nicandro and Paul have already taken you through the regional results. Restructuring costs were &#xA3;304 million for the period and mainly related to initiatives to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the group, together with costs relating to the restructurings following the Bentoel, Tekel and ST acquisitions. There was also an amortization charge of &#xA3;58 million in relation to trademarks acquired with Tekel, ST and Bentoel and this will be a feature of future reporting.</p>
          <p>The small gain on disposal of &#xA3;2 million rose from the disposal of some trademarks in Scandinavia to meet competition issues. The prior year figure of &#xA3;141 million related to the group's disposal of its 32% interest in the non-cigarette and snuffs business of ST. I'll cover the increases in finance costs on the next slide.</p>
          <p>For the purposes of the adjusted earnings per share calculation, the adjusted contribution from associates is &#xA3;64 million higher at &#xA3;541 million after adjusting items of &#xA3;58 million. The contribution from Reynolds American was 19% higher at &#xA3;388 million; at constant rates, the increased was 1%.</p>
          <p>ITC continued its strong profit growth and its contribution rose by &#xA3;27 million to &#xA3;144 million. At constant rates, the contribution was 17% higher than last year. Profit before tax was 11% higher at &#xA3;4080 million.</p>
          <p>Net finance cost were &#xA3;113 million higher at &#xA3;504 million, reflecting the full year cost of financing the ST and Tekel acquisitions as well as the effect of adverse foreign exchange. Gross interest cover remains strong at 8.6 times.</p>
          <p>The tax charge for the Group's subsidiaries rose from 1025 million to 1124 million, resulting in a lower underlying tax rate of 30.3%. The underlying tax rate was higher than the guidance of 29% and 28% seen during the first half of the year. This higher tax rate arose from adverse decision by the Australian courts in December. It was in respect of a tax case pursued by the Australian Tax Office concerning the utilization of capital losses. The judgment has been appealed, but without this tax case the underlying tax rate would have been 0.7 percentage points lower, equivalent to earnings per share being at about &#xA3;0.01 higher. Our guidance for the current year is from underlying tax rate of around 30%.</p>
          <p>Profit for the year rose 11% to &#xA3;2956 million and the minorities charge rose 20% to &#xA3;243 million, reflecting higher profit in Brazil and the effect of exchange. The adjusted earnings per share is &#xA3;1.53 per share which is up 19% over 2008.</p>
          <p>Here are the drivers of adjusted earnings per share growth; profit from subsidiaries at constant rates of exchange drove earnings by 10%. Net finance costs from the higher levels of debt for a negative 2%. The combined movements of associates, tax and the higher charge for minorities were neutral. The share buyback program in 2008 benefited adjusted EPS by 1%. However, it was the strong underlying profit performance and favorable exchange rates that accounted for most of the 19% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share.</p>
          <p>Moving on to cash flow, net cash from operating activities after tax rose &#xA3;316 million to 4065 million, reflecting the growth in underlying operating performance. Restructuring costs were 11% lower than the prior year. Higher net interest payments, net capital expenditure and dividends to minority shareholders resulted in free cash flow being slightly ahead of last year at &#xA3;2630 million.</p>
          <p>We target the ratio of free cash flow per share to adjusted EPS to be somewhere around the mid 80 percents. At a ratio of 86%, we're in line with expectations. I'd remind you that free cash flow is after adjusting items in dividends from associates, whereas adjusted earnings is before these items and includes profits from associates.</p>
          <p>The share buyback program is suspended in 200 &#x2013; in 2009; nevertheless, dividends paid to shareholders rose 29% to &#xA3;1.8 billion, equal to the total cash including the share buyback returned to shareholders in 2008. The acquisition of Bentoel is reflected by the 370 million outflow.</p>
          <p>And finally, net debt which at the start of the year was 9.9 billion and was &#xA3;1 billion lower at the end of December, the principal movements being foreign exchange and positive net cash flow of &#xA3;433 million.</p>
          <p>That's the end of the presentation so I'll hand over to Paul, who will start the Q&amp;A session. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ben. Okay. Kicking off the Q&amp;A session, could I ask you to give your name and firm and I'll repeat the question, I'm afraid, for the benefit of the microphones. Yeah, Jonathan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. Pricing was obviously really good for you last year and I had a few conversations with people the last month or so who are worried that because PMI is not facing strong currency headwinds for this year the pricing environment might deteriorate. Have you seen any evidence to support that feeling and what is your outlook for pricing in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Question is around the pricing environment and whether we think the pricing environment will deteriorate given that Philip Morris may not have the same currency problems in 2010 as they had in 2009. Do you want to grab that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. What I can see is that the pricing environment is still benign such as was last year, so we don't see anything on the horizon changing that. So we had some price increases already mainly in Western Europe at the end of last year, beginning of this year. So from our point of view, we don't see any change up to now. And I don't foresee the changing; but we have to wait and see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question for Philip Morris. Let us know the answer. Hi, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David Hayes from Nomura. Just first on Japan, I want to talk about the changes going on there. Philip Morris last week talked about asking for a manufacturing taking price rise in June. Just wondering if you'd talk about what you're expecting in Japan and whether you'll be following them in terms of requesting a price rise? And then secondly on transactional FX, you talked about the numbers for this year, can you give us kind of an outlook as what that look likes given the current rates to stay the same for 2010? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two questions, one around Japan and what's happening with the price rises is given the Philip Morris announced application for price increase in Japan and presumably you're interested in what's going to happen in October. And also talking about transactional FX on costs in 2010; Nicandro takes Japan and Ben takes the transactional FX question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding the price in Japan, we do not comment on pricing until it happens so I cannot talk anything about the next couple of months. But I can tell you is that yes, it has been announced that we will have an excise increase in Japan and a big one, &#xA5;70 in the second half and these will trigger, of course, a price increase. We have to consider two things here. First, the prices in Japan are still very low, in relative terms, to the Japanese income. But on the other hand, it will be an unprecedented price increase in Japan. So the consequences in the market, we'll have to wait and see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On transactional FX, transactional FX hit our cost base by about &#xA3;150 million this year. Difficult to say, it's only in February, looking at FX for 2010; but as it currently stands, if FX stays the same way, it will be about line ball this year, so it will be zero impact on transactional FX.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me come back on Japan. You talk to JT&amp;P they seem to be quite pessimistic about the elasticity about the volume drops. Have you guys got a view on that in terms of what you would expect alasist to be? Would it be higher than standard 0.4 or lower? What are the dynamics of that or is it just an unknown phenomenon because it's such a rarity in Japan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to say I don't have the Japanese price elasticity in my head. I think our view is that the excise increase and any possible price rises that get attached to that is going to have quite an impact on the Japanese volume. We saw last year that the Japanese volume was down, what, 5% so it's not a robust market in terms of consumer fragility. And if you suddenly get a huge excise and price hike, I think you're going to get a whack. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Chas Manso from Evolution. Two questions, one on, could you give a comment on your outlook for your margin drivers? You've got the target of 34% for 2012, you've been delivering 240 million of cost savings, getting 70 bps a year. You need more than 70 bps per year to get to 34 and yet with no upgrade to the savings target implies margin needs to be driven by other components. Could you comment on how you see that the drivers of that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the question is, what our outlook is for the margin drivers going forward, given that 0.7 percentage points per year doesn't really get us to 34. Ben, do you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean the 34% target is not rocket science; it's basically 800 million of savings around 50% dropping through to the bottom line, coming off of 30% operating margin back in 2007. So that takes you to the 34% number.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; that's that 0.8% increase a year; excluding Bentoel we'd be bang on that, actually, for the first two years of the saving programs. So I wouldn't think too much in terms of the cost savings in terms of the headline numbers that are announced. The important thing is how much drops through to the bottom line and what happens to the operating margin. And in those terms, we are bang on track for the 34%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are anticipating price being a greater driver of margin than it has been in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Price has been a pretty big driver of margin this year. I mean, you've got to remember that we offset &#xA3;154 million worth of transactional FX this year. So the cost savings have delivered us on target increases in operating margin despite that 154 million. If you add that 154 million back to the profit, that's another whole percentage point on top of our margin. So it's been a combination of good pricing, combination of the innovation strategy, persuading customers to take those price pass-ons as excise increase goes up. And good cost savings coming through the bottom line.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The second question was on your volumes splits. Previously, you've said your premium segment growth in mid and low value; could you give that for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The question is the volume split between premium, mid price and low, the growth. The decline? I love to talk about the growth. I mean, our overall organic volume decline was 3.3%. We saw around 3% for premium and then between value for money mid price and low price, we saw equally about 3% on average gain so there's not much change, so it was still a third and third.</p>
          <p>Yeah. Rogerio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Rogerio Fujimori from Credit Suisse. Two questions; in 2009 your profit generation was more or less balanced between the first half and second half, about 49/51 roughly. Should we expect more or less the same shape this year? And the second one is just on the cost savings, I was just wondering if you could indicate qualitatively if the reinvestment rate in 2009 was more or less in line with the 50% run rate, or was it higher or lower? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I got the questions, wants to know whether the profit generation in 2010 is going to be equally split between the two halves in the same way they were in 2009. And also the cost savings in 2010, is it going to be the same level of reinvestment in 2010 as we saw in 2009, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> 2009 the reinvestment, if the investment rate was considerably different than the 50% historical average.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What the reinvestment rate was in 2009 and whether it was especially different from the 50%. I think this is a question that Ben is going to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as much as I try to stop talking about reinvestment and spend back the questions keep coming. Look at the operating margin is the guide, the operating margins on target, the operating margin assumes a 50% spend back. I mean, if you want a rough feel, given the fact we have to eat 154 million of transactional FX in '09 you can assume slightly more drop through to the bottom line to offset that. But really, I'd just guide you to looking at our 34% operating margin by 2012. That's the important thing.</p>

          <p>Adam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things that struck me when I read this results was particularly in Asia there seems to be quite a lot of markets where you're losing market share whereas previously my memory was that you were gaining market share in many of those markets; something about Australia, Vietnam, Japan.</p>
          <p>But I was just wondering whether that means to say that we're going to have to see a bit of an increase in A&amp;P spend. And also I suppose is there something big that's driving those things? Have other people caught up effectively with your innovation, have people become more aggressive at the low end; I'm thinking of Australia, New Zealand and what are your plans for reversing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The question is around the fact that we seem to be losing share in more markets than we normally do and what the reasons for that might be and whether this will have an impact on A&amp;P spend going forward. A question I'm delighted to pick up.</p>
          <p>You are absolutely right. And yeah, we lost volume share overall in our top 40 markets. We dropped by about 0.3 so we went from 28.1 down to about 27.8. And we don't like losing share. The one consolation that we had was that most of that share loss was in low margin brands, some of it in low margin markets as well.</p>
          <p>So whilst we lost overall corporate share, our Global Drive brands did well in most of their markets. And we saw share growth for our Global Drive brands in most of their markets. So where we lost it was on mid and low price, particularly low and particularly in some markets.</p>
          <p>You mentioned New Zealand and Australia, yeah, that was discounting by competitors and lower price. We lost share in Russia, which was also a big slug of that and that was predominantly in low price, so we lost share on low price brands in a low margin market. Kent and Dunhill both grew share in Russia.</p>
          <p>So what does this mean for A&amp;P spend? Well, let me answer the question you normally ask, Adam. Our marketing spend in 2009 organically was up a shade under 100 million. We don't talk about what our marketing spend may go up by in the next year, but we'll do what it takes to do to get back some of that share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to probe in detail about Russia; there's obviously a bit of loss of market share at the end of '08, beginning of '09. I'm just wondering sequentially, are you now on a happier track or what track are you on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The question is around our market share in Russia and how we feel about that, whether we're happier with it in the fourth quarter '09 and going forward. I'll pass it on to Nicandro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As you said, Adam, in second half 2009, we took the price increase, which was not immediately followed by the competition. It took some months for them to follow us and we lost some share in the low price segment. But I think that I'd like to qualify the loss of share. Last year, in 2009, if you compare to 2008 we grew in the premium segment 1.5% and despite all the downtrading in the Russian markets, Kent is very solid. We ended the year with a higher share than we ended 2008.</p>
          <p>And just to qualify the importance of the premium segment in Russia, margins of the premium segments in Russia, as you know, are three or four times higher than the margins of the value for money brands, and 10 to 20 times higher than the low price brands. But coming back to your question, yes, the share has stabilized since May, June last year. We have a stable share in Russia, and what I can tell you we have very solid plans to grow share again in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just picking up that point, I mean, Nicandro mentioned it, but I think it's just worth emphasizing. If you go into our constant organic growth, so that's really stripping everything out and looking at the fundamentals; so how was our organic growth in constant currency.</p>
          <p>Our revenue was up 5. Our operating profit was up 7. And if you add back the 154 million transactional FX impacts, that gets you too an organic constant, if we're comparing constant all the way through including costs, which we find is a slightly unusual way of doing things but let's follow the thinking. We end up with 11 operating profit growth. So we had organic volume decline of 3.3; 5% revenue and that gives you 8.3% price mix and 11% operating profit growth. So in terms of going for value rather than volume, we think we're doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's also worth mentioning that if you take our top 40 markets we actually increased our market share in those markets if you take out the loss of share in Turkey, and loss of share in STK. And we knew that we were going to be losing share in those markets because the portfolios we bought were of declining local brands. So underlying the market share growth in our top markets is actually quite healthy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> for that figure, excluding those declining brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We had 28.1% market share last year. If you exclude Tekel and STK, our share this year &#x2013; in 2009 would have been 28.1. So you have a stable share. And the main loss that we had here &#x2013; and the loss of market share in Russia last year was compensated by gains somewhere. So if you take Russia out again, you have 28.3, but then it's too much adding, without saying that what Ben just said is totally true.</p>
          <p>So if you don't consider the tail brands because in some of the operations that we bought we have to delete some of the brands and clean the portfolio so that's where we lost share. But I have to say that I am glad to tell you that in the case of Turkey the last four months of the year we have a stable share, which I think that's outstanding. How sustainable it is, that is a very good question, but it just shows the improvement that you have gone through in our portfolio in Turkey.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the question is what's going to happen to leaf costs in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As you know, leaf costs, the leaf you buy one year you actually use the following year so in 2008 there was quite a significant increase in leaf costs. Leaf costs are about 30% bought in 2008; they were only up about 4% in 2009. So in terms of the leaf we actually use in our product, because that's mixed over a number of years, leaf costs were up about 13% in 2009 and we think the increase will be less than half that in 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Matt Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Just following on the issue of the low margin volumes in some of the brand management decisions with ST and Tekel, can you give us a sense of how that impacted organic volumes in the fourth quarter and do you expect those efforts to be largely completed by sort of the end of first half 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay the question is around what happened to organic volumes in the fourth quarter 2009; and sorry, the last bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With the brand management decisions in ST and Tekel would we expect to see those end could be completed by the end of first half 2010 or would we expect to see the impact that they have on organic volumes sort of become less apparent by second half of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what impact there might be when we start lapping the Tekel and ST acquisitions. Do you want to grab that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think, the decline &#x2013; first of all, let me start with the second question. We cleaned up some of the portfolio in Tekel and ST, but we still have some brands that are in historical decline. We don't think that the declining has gone. So we still have some brands in the low price segments in places like in Turkey and Poland that we have to manage. We have had some recent successes and I think that is quite encouraging to see that the share has held up in places like Turkey. But we have to wait and see. But the clean up portfolio, the deletion of the brands in the some of the places, we have done last year. So the bulk of the change we have done last year.</p>
          <p>In terms of your first question, what was the impact in the fourth quarter, I'm going to give a number here, and Ben maybe can help me. I think that half of the decline in the fourth quarter was still a decline in the Tekel and ST brands. So we declined in the fourth quarter 2.4%, probably half of that was the portfolio that we acquired from both companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The figure that I have fourth quarter underlying decline would have been 1.2%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon Leinster, UBS. Going back to the market shares again, of all of the markets where you invest heavily in DSD are the same markets you seem to be declining in the shares, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, so on and so forth. Mexico, I know you expanded it. I mean, has DSD proved to be as successful in Malaysia as well as successful as you'd hoped? Has it really provided any competitive edge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The question is that we seem to be losing market shares in those markets where we gone DSD and therefore does DSD provide a competitive edge. I'll be delighted to take that question.</p>
          <p>Brazil, we have DSD. Brazil went up 1.7 points last year. Venezuela increased share, we have DSD in Venezuela. So the point of all this is to say there are a large number of markets where we have DSD where the share has gone up. I don't think it would be right to say, to pick out the markets where share has declined and ascribe that to DSD.</p>
          <p>Canada, we lost share in Canada. I think we got uncompetitive on pricing at the low end in Canada as well as the long-term decline because of the fact of that we have high shares in premium and still good shares in low price but not as high as our overall corporate share in Canada. So the sheer mathematics mean that you lose a bit of share. Don't think that's anything to do with DSD.</p>
          <p>Australia, same difference; I mentioned that there was price discounting by the competition in Australia and New Zealand. And Mexico we've been declining share for some time, and indeed in Mexico the share decline is less than it is used to be, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> price discounting that you got DSD should have been able to react quicker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that &#x2013; go on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you want to, because if you react to all this discounting or all the new launches in the low price segment, you drive the profitability of the market down. So we have to be very careful in the way that you respond to that. So we cannot just drive the whole portfolio; in places in which we are predominantly premium going to the low price you will drive the profitability of the market back.</p>
          <p>But if you want to react, yes, we can react very quickly. And I have to say that in the case of Australia, we have done some work in last months. The share is stable; we lost last year, mainly in the first half of the year. But you go to Malaysia, for example, the main losses in Malaysia of the shift from the legal market to the duty not paid market. So duty not paid in Malaysia nowadays is 37% of the market. If you take 2008, was 20.</p>
          <p>So those are the reasons that you are losing share as well. So we have to be very careful because I don't think that we can compete against illicit trading, for example, launching brands in the low, low price segment because it's just driving the profitability down. The way to face illicit trade is about having policies in place not by the company, by the government, to avoid this to happen. And we engage with the government as much as we can to make it happen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our preference is to look at value share, and to talk about volume share and why your volume share is declining is like having the same conversation why is your volume declining. And we're back to this sort of schizophrenia as to the value of volume. And we go after quality volume.</p>
          <p>We go for to try and get a pricing strategy that supports premium price brands. We try to avoid getting into price wars down at the bottom end. We think that drives shareholder value, but if you guys want to sit here and sort to say really we want to increase your volume share, no problem. We can do that. I'm not sure it's good for shareholders.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jon Fell, Deutsche again. Just a quick one on the restructuring charges; I think you previously signaled that at this stage of the cost savings program restructuring charges would be dropping. We've got quite a climb number this year. Has that changed and I want to just focus on the cash element versus impairment in that <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, question is around the restructuring charges in '09. They seem to be slighter higher than normal and what is the sort of the cash involved in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a slight increase in exceptionals or adjusting items as we call them now this year, which is the global integration project, putting a provision in for that. So that's been the cause of the increase in the exceptional items. It's going to take some time to deliver on that, obviously, because we're harmonizing systems and processes and management structures. But that's the reason for the increase.</p>
          <p>Actually in cash terms it's the other way around. There's a cash inflow from exceptionals on those trading items, which is largely from the sale of the roll your own brands in Norway this year; so cash-wise it goes the other way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi on Chas' question because I think you talked about modestly rising premium and value. I think at the first half it was minus 1, minus 5 premium value. That feels like the down trading, if you like, got worse in the second half. So can you talk about whether that was the trend and then where we are now, if you can, in terms of whether that's beginning to go and now we've dropped and we came back the other way.</p>
          <p>And then just secondly on the buyback, I think you said in the interviews that you published that they're not off the agenda. Are they off the agenda for 2010 or is that something that, depending on trading, we could see come back into <mark type="inaudible" />. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On looking at premium was there sort of more down trading in the second half of the year than it was for the year as a whole and what conclusions does that lead us to? And secondly, we have said on Cantos that share buybacks are still on the agenda. Are they on the agenda for 2010 in any shape or form? I think that was the question. Do you want to handle the down trading in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The down trading of the second half of the year was even with the first half of the year. What I'd like to point out is that we have a neutral mix in BAT which shows the strength of our portfolio because with the down trading keep your mix as we kept is a very good result.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, as I mentioned and explained the case in Russia, we gained share in the premium segment. That's why our Global Drive brands went up 4%, which is an outstanding performance from my point of view in any account. So it's more or less the same shape.</p>
          <p>And how that do I see the 2010 shaping up, it's very difficult to say. As Paul mentioned, we expect the volume next year is going to be around -- down around 2%. So it will be pretty much dependent what was going to happen with the consequence of the economic crisis and employment rates and things like that. What I can say is that we see some first signs of recovery in the emerging markets; consider that we are very well exposed to the emerging markets, I hope that you can and I'm sure that you benefit from the recovery.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me pick up the buyback. I mean the buyback is suspended, it's not canceled. We've taken the decision to continue its suspension with the full year results this year. When we look at the buyback and we consider, obviously, how earnings accretive it would be, we consider what acquisitions might be out there or terms of usage of cash and we consider our credit rating, our BBB+/Baa1 credit rating.</p>
          <p>Because we've returning a lot of cash to the shareholders over the last couple of years and our dividend has been growing substantially, in fact this year we're returning as much cash purely on a dividend as we did with the dividend plus the buyback last year. Then we've got to make sure that we keep our retained cash flow to adjusted net debt ratio, which is one the rating agencies like, at a sufficiently high level. So the decision's really there to make sure we maintain our BBB+/Baa1 credit rating this year. But we'll keep it under guidance and we'll review it again at the half year.</p>
          <p>Okay. One more question. Yeah.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. It's Nico Lambrechts from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.With regards to regulation, you've had all the easy wins from the regulators implemented like smoking bans in public places, et cetera and I assume that's in the base</p>
          <p>A lot of the countries are now going for the next level; I mean plain packs, etc, and not smoking in your car or in your home. Can you give us a view, do you think they will succeed in some of these over time? Obviously, the industry will oppose it. And are the noise being made mainly in those countries where the excise tax receipts are actually very small from <mark type="inaudible" />? Could you give us a view on that? And that &#x2013; has the focus towards that, from the government, changed your view on the long-term volume growth of the industry? I think you've always said between zero and minus one; ex China.</p>

          <p>Yeah, the question is around regulation and whether the &#x2013; some of the more draconian thought proposals going around are going to get any traction and be implemented and what impact that may have on industry volumes going forward. I will pick that one up.</p>
          <p>It really depends on whether governments want to legislate using science-based argumentation for putting in ban or legislation and whether that is a proportional response to the issue. We get into the realms of politics rather than science here. We've seen, for example, in the U.K. there's no credible evidence for what they are aiming to do on display bans, for example. There's no evidence in terms of plain packaging. So we're into politics rather than sound science and evidence. So I can't really predict it.</p>
          <p>I think there are some countries would find it very difficult to implement that because it's in the constitution, the rights of commercial free speech. And certainly, we would think that anything that infringes intellectual property, we would challenge legally; so we'll see where it goes.</p>
          <p>I tend to think that it doesn't have too much impact on industry volumes. Why? Because there's no evidence that it has an impact on industry volumes which is why this is in the realms of politics rather than sound science. So I don't think it will have an impact on industry volume. I think it will dampen down competition.</p>
          <p>But far more importantly, and this is the tragedy of all of this, it's a smuggler's charter. And some of these proposals around plain packaging, some of the proposals around ingredients regulation is just going to help smugglers and counterfeiters. They've already got a price advantage, if we hand them a product advantage as well, where this is going to go?</p>
          <p>So on that somewhat depressing note, thank you very much for coming. And thank you for your questions.</p>
