          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's first quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2011 performance. I'm here with our CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Olivier Brandicourt, President and General Manager of Primary Care; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Geno Germano, President and General Manager of Specialty Care and Oncology; Amy Schulman, General Counsel and Business Unit Lead for Nutritionals; and David Simmons, President and General Manager of Emerging Markets and Established Products.</p>
          <p>The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our home page, Pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer quarterly corporate performance, first quarter 2011 which is located in the investor presentation section in the lower right-hand corner of this page.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause the actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.</p>
          <p>Also the discussions during this conference call will include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's Current Report on Form 8-K dated today, May 3, 2011.</p>
          <p>These reports are available on our website at Pfizer.com in the investor's SEC filing section.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chuck. Good morning everyone. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter, speak to the progress we're making in executing our R&amp;D strategy, provide updates regarding our late stage product portfolio and capital allocation in the units, and I will close with an update on the business portfolio review work we have underway.</p>
          <p>Our year is off to a good start. Our results were favorably impacted by revenue growth from several key products, growth in emerging markets, the addition of legacy King products and the benefits from cost reduction initiatives, among other things.</p>
          <p>At the same time revenues were also negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of several products in the U.S. and other geographies.</p>
          <p>Frank will take you through the details of the quarter, but here are a few of the noteworthy highlights.</p>
          <p>We saw strong growth in the Prevnar franchise, Enbrel, Zyvox, notably in the U.S. and Japan. We saw growth from several other products including Lyrica, Spiriva and Celebrex in key international markets.</p>
          <p>We had 8% operational growth in the biopharmaceutical Emerging Markets business including 10% percent operational growth in the BRIC-MT countries.</p>
          <p>This was highlighted by strong growth in China, India and Turkey. Sales were impacted by large vaccine sales in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Our overall global innovative core of patent-protected biopharmaceutical products had operational growth in the mid-single digits. Within our established products business, if we exclude revenue additions to the business unit from off-patent Wyeth and King products as well as LOE transfers from the other business units since the beginning of 2009, we saw 7% growth.</p>
          <p>This performance was driven by both the legacy Pfizer Established Products in the unit as of 2009 and those products added through the portfolio expansion strategy. This is a good measure of the progress we've made since creating this business unit in 2008, with the goal of transforming what was a shrinking revenue base to a growth opportunity.</p>
          <p>We continue to remain focused on efforts to reduce costs with our more disciplined and deeply rooted cost management effort. Operating savings were realized during the quarter due to the Wyeth integration, workforce reductions, actions taken with the R&amp;D portfolio as well as savings from our smaller physical footprint.</p>
          <p>So far this year through April 30th, we've returned approximately $3.8 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And in early April, we announced an agreement to sell the Capsugel business for $2.375 billion in cash to KKR.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the rest of the year, I believe our performance during the first quarter firmly positions us for executing our 2011 plan and achieving our financial guidance.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn to an update on the progress we're making with our R&amp;D strategy. I'll begin by reiterating that improving the performance of our innovative core remains my top priority. Since sharing with you our R&amp;D strategy during the February earnings call, we have moved quickly to set in motion the actions needed to execute on our plans.</p>
          <p>Over the past three months, we have spent time successfully aligning colleagues across the business with our strategy. We are taking important steps forward to provide greater budget authority and accountability to our disease area Chief Scientific Officers. Based on my interaction with our R&amp;D team I remain confident that we have Chief Scientific Officers who will deliver scientific excellence with an ROI mentality.</p>
          <p>We have completed a review on our pre proof of concept portfolio. As a result of this review we've elected to terminate 39 projects. We did this to create a greater focus on high potential projects in our areas of go forward investment which include neuroscience, cardiovascular metabolic, oncology, inflammation and vaccines. We believe these and other changes will lead to more effective prioritization of portfolio based on key value and cost criteria.</p>
          <p>We said we would establish a dedicated unit focused on pain and sensory disorders. To that end we recently opened a new biotech research unit in Cambridge, U.K. focused in this area. We have also started preparations for shifting resources to strengthen our key biomedical hubs, including the Cambridge, Massachusetts and New York City academic hub and have begun recruiting key talent.</p>
          <p>Clearly our work here is not going to be completed in one year. It is a multiyear endeavor and I'm working closely with Mikael Dolsten and the R&amp;D organization to accelerate our efforts.</p>
          <p>As this work continues, we're also seeing progress in our late stage clinical portfolio that we anticipate will lead to new product opportunities.</p>
          <p>During this year, we expect to present clinical data on assets from each of our innovative biopharmaceutical businesses: Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology. Specifically, during 2011, we expect to report on several important programs in Phase III and some potential regulatory submissions and actions.</p>
          <p>For Phase III, we now have reported top line results for all five of the tofacitinib Phase III registrational studies, which we believe are forming a very encouraging clinical profile and expect to present detailed data at medical conferences during this year.</p>
          <p>We expect additional clinical data to be presented for axitinib for renal cell carcinoma, Prevnar 13 for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in adults, age 50 and older and Eliquis, which is the new name for apixaban read data for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. We continue to collect clinical data for crizotinib in non-small cell lung cancer patients and for tofacitinib for psoriasis.</p>
          <p>Regarding regulatory submissions, for crizotinib we remain on track with our rolling U.S. submission which began in January. We look forward to acceptance of our application in the first half of this year. We continue to anticipate filings in the U.S. and EU by the end of 2011 for certain other oncology compounds as well as for tofacitinib and Eliquis.</p>
          <p>In terms of anticipated regulatory decisions later this year, the PDUFA date for Remoxy is currently set for June 23, 2011. At this time we're working to address a specific issue in the manufacturing section of the application as well as to understand any potential implications for FDA's recent class-wide REMS announcement for extended release opioids. These issues could delay the timing of approval or the launch of Remoxy. We expect to receive actions later this year on our U.S. and EU filings for Prevnar 13 in adults.</p>
          <p>In summary each of these assets or compounds is truly innovative and demonstrates our R&amp;D capabilities.</p>
          <p>Next I'll discuss our ongoing efforts around how we are allocating our capital to correctly enhance shareholder value. Specifically, as of April 30th, we repurchased approximately 2.2 billion of Pfizer shares this year. With our recent agreement to sell Capsugel to KKR for approximately $2.4 billion cash, we now expect to repurchase at least 5 billion and up to 7 billion of shares during 2011. This compares to our previously announced plan to repurchase approximately 5 billion of shares in 2011.</p>
          <p>We may also consider using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Capsugel to fund other opportunistic development transactions that are expected to meet or exceed the return on investment on share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Regarding business development, we will continue to identify and pursue those bolt-on opportunities that leverage our core capabilities, and then build on our portfolio strengths. We will seek and pursue the opportunities that we believe will return the highest value to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>On our February earnings call, I shared with you that we are looking at the long term value creation potential of all our businesses. As part of the evaluation, we will consider synergies between businesses, the opportunity costs associated with continued or increased investment in each business, as well as the potential returns from pursuing other strategic alternatives.</p>
          <p>As I previously shared with you, we're undertaking a rigorous process which we expect to complete during the second half of 2011. Following the completion of this process, we will be in a position to make a set of decisions and determine the appropriate next steps based on those decisions.</p>
          <p>In summary, with a solid quarter behind us, I believe we're making good progress in executing on our R&amp;D strategy to improve the performance of our innovative core, building a strong pipeline with good scientific and commercial potential, continuing to take steps that will enhance shareholder return in the near term and we are being diligent on how we make the decisions that we believe will result in long term value creation that maximizes shareholder return.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Frank to take you through the numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that because of our decision to sell the Capsugel business, all revenues and expenses related to Capsugel for both the first quarter 2010 and first quarter of 2011 are included in the single line item discontinued operations net of tax in our consolidated income statement for the first quarter of 2011, and the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>In addition, as a result of the completion of the King acquisition, legacy King operations are including in first quarter 2011 results beginning January 31, 2011, but are not included in the results for the first quarter of 2010. Now let's move on to the results.</p>
          <p>First quarter 2011 reported revenues were $16.5 billion, essentially flat year-over-year and favorably impacted by $224 million or 1%, due to the addition of legacy King products, $97 million or 1% due to foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>First quarter of 2011 revenues were decreased by $166 million or 1% due to U.S. Healthcare Reform.</p>
          <p>The 12% year-over-year increase in reported diluted EPS was driven by growth for certain products, lower purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition-related costs associated with the Wyeth acquisition. Lower first quarter effective tax rate on reported income, primarily reflecting the extension of the U.S. R&amp;D tax credit, the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings during the quarter and the tax impact of charges related to certain legal matters. These were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of certain products, legal charges and costs incurred to improve overall R&amp;D productivity.</p>
          <p>First quarter 2011 adjusted cost of sales increased 9% or $261 million versus the prior year quarter. It's important to note that adjusted cost of sales was negatively impacted by $64 million due to foreign exchange, $30 million due to the Puerto Rico excise tax, as well as Healthcare Reform, which resulted in decreased revenues but did not correspondingly decrease cost of sales, and a shift in product and business mix.</p>
          <p>Consequently, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased year-over-year from 17.1% to 18.7%. However, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, the Puerto Rico excise tax and Healthcare Reform, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 18.1%.</p>
          <p>Adjusted total cost increased 3% to $9.6 billion driven by a shift in product and business mix, the addition of legacy King operations, which had an impact of $160 million, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $101 million, the quarterly component of the annual fee required under U.S. Healthcare Reform legislation which had a negative impact of $69 million and the previously mentioned impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax. These were partially offset by savings from our cost reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted total cost increased only 2% year-over-year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60 per share, flat year-over-year and driven primarily by growth in certain products, a lower effective tax rate on adjusted income and lower R&amp;D expenses offset by a shift in product and business mix, the loss of exclusivity of certain products and the impact of U.S. Healthcare Reform.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter 2011, foreign exchange positively impacted revenues by $97 million, and negatively impacted adjusted total cost by $101 million. Remember, our Q1 international results include the months of December, January and February, and over this timeframe, the euro to the dollar actually worked against us on a year-over-year basis. All in, foreign exchange had essentially no impact on first quarter adjusted, diluted EPS.</p>
          <p>Primary Care unit revenues of $5.4 billion decreased 7% year-over-year driven by growth in Lyrica, Spiriva, Pristiq and Celebrex and certain other patent protected products in key international markets as well as the addition of legacy King products. These were more than offset by the loss of exclusivity of Lipitor in Spain and Canada and Aricept in the U.S., all in 2010, which decreased Primary Care revenues by $590 million or 10% this quarter.</p>
          <p>The 12% increase in Specialty Care unit revenues was by driven by the strong growth in the Prevnar franchise, Enbrel and Zyvox, notably in the U.S. and Japan. Established Products unit revenues of $2.4 billion decreased year-over-year by 16% operationally, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of Effexor, Protonix and Zosyn/Tazocin and the resulting increased competition facing these brands which was partially offset by the addition of legacy King products.</p>
          <p>The 8% operational growth in biopharmaceutical Emerging Markets revenue was due to both innovative products including Enbrel, Lyrica, Sutent and Vfend, as well as Established Products.</p>
          <p>Oncology unit revenues decreased 13% operationally primarily due to the transfer of Aromasin's U.S. business to Established Products in 2011 as a result of its loss of exclusivity in April of 2011.</p>
          <p>Animal health grew 15% operationally of which 6% or $50 million was due to legacy King products and the remainder due to strong global performance.</p>
          <p>In consumer healthcare grew 11% operationally driven primarily by higher sales of Robitussin and Advil Cough &amp; Sinus because of a more severe cold and flu season, particularly in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>First quarter 2011 revenues generated by both biopharmaceuticals and other businesses in Emerging Markets increased 11% year-over-year and biopharmaceutical renews grew 8% operationally. It's important to note that over the same period, Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico and Turkey, contributed a combined 58% to the overall growth in Emerging Markets.</p>
          <p>Revenues from the biopharmaceutical business grew 10% operationally in these BRIC-MT markets to approximately $1 billion. Revenues from Established Products in emerging markets increased 6% operationally to approximately $900 million and Established Product revenues in the BRIC-MT markets increased 13% to $450 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, worldwide revenues generated by sales of Established Products, which includes revenues from the Established Products business unit and revenues from Established Products generated in Emerging Markets, totaled $3.3 billion in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We are reaffirming all elements of our 2011 financial guidance. As a reminder on April 4th, we updated our previously 2011 reported revenue guidance to $65.2 to $67.2 billion, from $66 billion to $68 billion to reflect the pending sale of Capsugel. We are also reaffirming our 2012 financial targets given our continued confidence in the business. Again we updated our previous 2012 reported revenue target range to $62.2 billion to $64.7 billion from $63 billion to $65.5 billion due to the pending sale of Capsugel.</p>
          <p>So moving on to key takeaways: we continued to deliver strong operational performance; we're reaffirming all elements of our 2011 financial guidance and 2012 financial targets; we expect to complete our business portfolio review during the second half of 2011; we anticipate presenting data and submitting regulatory submissions for several of our late stage pipeline compounds during 2011; and we continue to expect to repurchase 5 to 7 billion of common stock during 2011. And we anticipate using approximately 2 billion of the after-tax proceeds from the pending sale of Capsugel for these repurchases and/or for business development. To date, in 2011, we repurchased approximately $2.2 billion or 110.5 million shares of our common stock including repurchases made in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.</p>

          <p>Thanks Frank. At this point, Operator, if you could please poll for questions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Your first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ian, a couple questions for you. Specifically if you could outline for us what your &#x2013; how you're thinking about strategic alternatives for Emerging Markets and Established Products.</p>
          <p>And secondly, if you could also share with us if you have narrowed your options regarding strategic alternatives for your diversified businesses?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just so that you could clarify what your plans will be assuming you do spin or sell some of these businesses, what you will do with the cash proceeds? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jami. Let's take it in reverse order. I think we said that proceeds, if we do have spin proceeds, the case to beat will be share repurchase. So I think that's &#x2013; we've firmly drawn a line in the sand there.</p>
          <p>You asked then for the &#x2013; look at how I see or looking at the EP and Emerging Markets strategic alternatives. No, the EP business is made up of mature markets in the United States and in Europe, and then the Emerging Markets. In mature markets, it's really a low cost and to a certain extent, a price game. In the Emerging Markets, it continues to be promotion and field force and traditional marketing.</p>
          <p>So I think if we look at the strategic intersections, it's the &#x2013; the most interesting question is in the Emerging Markets, and to the extent that the Established Products are part of the core, are they linked to the infrastructure, are they linked to overall presence in the marketplace and how would those businesses be operated separately or do they require different capabilities. So those are sort of the strategic questions we're looking at as we look at those two options.</p>
          <p>And then you asked me if I've narrowed my alternatives. We are still reviewing, you know, all of our alternatives on the businesses outside of the core and we intend to take, you know, the sort of second half to go through that in a thorough way. And as I said in my opening remarks, expect to start making some announcements during the second half. I don't think we see it as a big bang, I don't foresee at some point in the second half suddenly coming out with a detailed master plan but certainly we'll lay out decisions we've taken and decisions we haven't, and the whys and the analysis and give a clearer path forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and good morning everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Catherine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to ask Ian a big picture question and then I have a question on Nutritionals business.</p>
          <p>If you step back, Ian, I know you've talked a lot about how you're evaluating each particular business on its own and what to do with it, but clearly in the bigger picture, I wonder if you can directionally just address what type of growth profile that you're trying to create for the Pfizer business ultimately, in thinking about the strategic exercise that you're going through. Are we talking about a company that's going to be growing mid-single digits, mid to high single digits? Anything you can directionally say kind of as to your aspirations longer term would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And then on the Nutritionals business, it seems like the growth was a little weaker this quarter. I wondered if you could give us some color on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll address the first question and then ask Frank and Amy to add something on the second.</p>
          <p>So you know, when we look at post '12, we'll continue to see a series of LOEs that will affect our growth rate. Yet, we will be launching some really innovative products into that marketplace post '12.</p>
          <p>So I conceptualize the company, if you put to one side the diversified businesses, just in the way you described what's happening, as a pharmaceutical business it has an exciting inner core of launching new innovative products and then a set of more established assets that some of those will be suffering LOEs. So I think the key question for the investors is how exciting is the innovative core, how exciting, what's the penetration of those newly launched products and what will we do with the cash flows from those more mature products and to what extent can those cash flows be used to produce earnings growth.</p>
          <p>That's, you know, without getting into any decisions about how we see the final shape of the company or how we see it being structured or managed, I think those are the two big strategic themes in the company going forward.</p>
          <p>Frank, do you want to take the Nutritionals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so Catherine, let me just run the numbers in and I'll answer what took place. Nutri sales for the quarter were about $470 million. On a reported basis they were up low single digits, on an operational basis they were flat when you remove foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>What's happening is last quarter's results, so Q1, 2010 actually had some favorable items, one-time items that impacted revenue that did not take place this year. So that's kind of major point one.</p>
          <p>Major point two is we'll have some new products for the Nutri business this year that weren't available yet in Q1 so we didn't get the benefit of those new products. So when you look at kind of the numbers and then what happened, those two reasons are really the driver of the Q1 revenue being essentially flat on an operational basis year-over-year.</p>

          <p>Okay, thanks Frank, I think that's a pretty complete answer, so we'll move on to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Tony.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, thanks very much. Two questions first has two parts, it's on Prevnar. Prevnar 13 sequential growth remains extraordinarily strong in the U.S. Can you comment as to the number of previously vaccinated Prevnar 7 infants who are coming back for a 13 boost relative to the overall de novo vaccinees, that is, infants that have not had a vaccination and are therefore getting 13? Part B of that question is, can you comment internationally on maybe new tenders that you won in the quarter or those that may be coming up?</p>
          <p>The second question involves manufacturing. As the LOE for Lipitor or atorvastatin looms in the near future, the question is, do you continue to operate the manufacturing process at full capacity given you will be supplying Cobalt or Watson product for volume sale or do you actually ratchet that back? Any color you could provide will be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geno, do you want to take the Prevnar question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Let me talk about the &#x2013; first the catch up for Prevnar 13 in the U.S. The catch up program has been a strong contributor to our growth, both in 2010 and continuing into 2011. In the first quarter about $90 million of our revenues were associated with catch up sales. As time goes by, the additional revenues from catch up will diminish as we continue to complete that program. But it should be a continued strong contributor for the remainder of this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of new tenders, we're in pretty solid position with most of our major developed markets right now. We're seeing strong growth of actually the seven-valent in Japan with now new funding, government funding available there and that's driving some significant growth in that country. We've signed a two-year contract in Mexico recently, and a number of other smaller markets in the Emerging Markets.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Geno.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the manufacturing question I'll start by saying clearly, once Lipitor loses LOE in the U.S., we will be competing vigorously for those volumes, not only in the U.S. but globally as it loses LOE in different countries. From a manufacturing perspective, we clearly made assumptions around demand forecasts and factored those into the manufacturing load. So that's the way we think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Frank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple questions. A year and-a-half into the merger with Wyeth, SG&amp;A isn't exactly going down. I know you've talked about a couple things keeping the spending higher, but in 2011 it looks like it's probably going to be flat. If I look at the midpoint of your 2012 SG&amp;A guidance versus the midpoint of the 2011 guidance, you're saying SG&amp;A would be about $1.5 billion lower next year. I'm wondering if you can categorize where that $1.5 billion in cost savings is going to come from exactly?</p>
          <p>Second question is, if you decide that Established Products is not really part of the core or the future for Pfizer going forward, can that business really be carved out from the parent? I'm just trying to figure out what that would look like and how it would work. Is there a potential buyer for that business? Is it capable of standing on its own as a separate publicly traded company or what exactly? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Tim, it's Frank. I'll hit the SI&amp;A question. Let me just start with the numbers for the quarter. So SI&amp;A for the quarter was, give or take, about 4.5 billion, up about 4% year-over-year from 4.350 or so in the year ago quarter. Three things really driving that: so you've got the addition of King, you've got foreign exchange and then you've got Healthcare Reform, that's the annual fee, the Rx fee on the annual sales which is a charge to SG&amp;A. Those three items all in are give or take about $170 million which more than basically offset what the increase was. So the slight difference is really from cost savings.</p>
          <p>Now, to run the numbers for the year, our guidance for the year on SG&amp;A is about 19.2 to 20.2 is the range. Then the 2012 target is 17.5 to 18. To your point, if you take the midpoints, you see a number that's coming down, give or take about $1.5 billion from '11 to '12.</p>
          <p>The major categories there, and let me frame this. There's no one big ticket item. It's not like some one big ticket item. It's really multiple areas of opportunity. And you know, one of the things we'll have is we'll have some products that are going to be losing exclusivity. There will be some marketing and sales savings as a result of some of those products that are losing exclusivity. Then there's lots of opportunities in the discretionary spend areas. Whether it be things like consulting, non-employees, how we travel, so there's different buckets for each of those. We continue to generate savings from our integration efforts that will be generating part of those savings. So it's no one big ticket item. It's a bunch of different opportunity areas, all of which are being worked very aggressively inside the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Tim on your question on Established Products, you know, all good questions are really good strategic questions we're in fact dealing with and thinking through as we go through this year.</p>
          <p>Certainly we have the critical mass in the size of our Established Products in the Emerging Markets for the business to be, to be a standalone if we want it to be or if we wanted to try and look at some sort of way of improving the capabilities of that organization to be more effective. I mean, our thinking on this is clearly how do we create more value for shareholders. What are the core capabilities needed to drive that business? If you actually look at our performance in the Emerging Markets we do very well on our legacy brands, we do very well on our specialty. I would say the area that perhaps we struggle to compete against local companies is in the pure established brand products. There we're trying to step back and say we have a strategy that's based on multi-sourcing from partners throughout the emerging markets. Is that strategy scalable? What is the best way of running that business? And so all of questions you ask are the questions we're trying to answer in the second half of the year.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from John Boris from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations on the results and I just have a couple of questions. Ian, I think you indicated on the last conference call that you were going to be spending a fair amount of time with the R&amp;D organization. What have you learned over the last quarter as you spent time with R&amp;D and as you look at R&amp;D spend going forward is there any additional room for trimming of the R&amp;D budget?</p>
          <p>Second question on oncology. I think you're about to file certain oncology assets. Can you maybe articulate whether axitinib and bosutinib are part of those filings?</p>
          <p>The third question, especially in light, Ian, of your comments on bolt-on opportunities with the highest return for shareholders, can you help us understand whether you have the right business development process in place, especially in light of some of the things that we've seen with the King transaction, most notably the withdrawal of Embeda, Remoxy filing, etcetera, to ensure that these things can be ironed out before a transaction is actually hit on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you John. On the R&amp;D organization, I'm very optimistic and enthusiastic about the organization. I think under Mikael's leadership, we're getting an entrepreneurial sense into the organization with empowered, committed scientists that are focused on what I would call making unstoppable products, shots in goal, not shots on goal, very acutely aware of the resources being used and the payback necessary to continue getting those resources.</p>
          <p>On the spend, I think we did, you know, this R&amp;D review that we did is part and parcel of the total strategic review we're doing of the other businesses. It's not different in any sense. So we arrived at an amount of funds we thought was appropriate to generate a return on investment of that innovative core. So I think the spend is right and you know, we'll see as the performance comes through what the appropriate spend level is.</p>
          <p>Geno do you want to answer the oncology and then I'll come back to the bolt-on thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure, yeah. It's an exciting time with the oncology portfolio now. We're continuing to proceed with the rolling filing for crizotinib in the U.S. and we have plans to file axitinib in the U.S. as well, and are discussing bosutinib filings in both Europe and the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So John, on bolt-on acquisitions, I think we have a rigorous process that goes through, identifies opportunities and you know, we have been very selective in where we've chosen to play and we have stepped back when necessary and we've been very disciplined in the use of our funds. So I am pleased with the King acquisition.</p>
          <p>We were pleased when we acquired it. We will remain pleased. It provides significant and immediate value creation. It's accretive. It adds to our scale of both PC business, Primary Care business in the EpiPen and the Flector Patch and when Embeda and Remoxy launch it will add to those capabilities. It adds to our Animal Health business and to our EP business. So, you know, I feel that we looked at the opportunities out there. This was a prudent acquisition; it was a good value for money. We saw the risks in our due diligence on Embeda and potentially on Remoxy and we took the decision based on the value we're acquiring at.</p>
          <p>So I feel that we have a very solid process. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Follow up on the King assets. Can you give us some color when or whether Embeda will come back? And what's the manufacturing issue on Remoxy that you mentioned and perhaps you can share your enthusiasm for that product in the abuse deterrent market.</p>
          <p>My second question, Ian, is bigger picture. Do you think having a large portfolio of brands and generics including some very mature ones can help your new innovative product launches from a contracting point of view or do you not really subscribe to the product breadth in contracting muscle sort of playbook? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So on Embeda, I can't give you an exact date. We're still working through the manufacturing issues on that. And on Remoxy and in that class in general I'm very encouraged by the opportunities given the REMS that has just come out and the government's recognition of just how important this area is in abuse deterrent and safety.</p>
          <p>So I think as a strategic play this is very important for us and medium to long term will work out very well.</p>
          <p>In regards to the broad &#x2013; breadth of portfolio, you know, I am a lot more inclined to look at it asset by asset and look at the clinical value that the asset delivers to the society, to the payer, to governments around the world. I don't really subscribe in today's marketplace to a breadth of portfolio as being an argument to get listings.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I have two questions for you, Ian. The first is, if you could provide some more color on your comment about no big bang in terms of your strategic review outcome. Do you mean to say that you're going to be making decisions one by one on the non-core assets and so that's why you said no big bang, or are you backing it off at all from your recent discussions that you're interested in significantly downsizing Pfizer?</p>
          <p>Then separately with respect to the innovative core, I'm hoping that you can provide a little more color on how you plan to boost Pfizer's productivity in the face of a variety of headwinds, including size working against innovation. I know that you're doing some small partnerships with academic institutions but that seems to be a small fraction of the spending and time of your R&amp;D organization. It doesn't seem to be that there's a large effort on individual academic partnerships.</p>
          <p>And then one follow up on that is just maybe you could comment on improving your culture and being able to do so in the face of stepping down the R&amp;D spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, David. So re: the Big Bang, I remain &#x2013; we remain committed to looking at all of our businesses. I think we used the expression no sacred cows. We remain intent upon that.</p>
          <p>What I was trying to convey there is that I don't expect in the second half to come forward with a fully mapped out announcement of dispositions and models that will direct the company for the next five to ten years. That is the intent to get to that and I think we will expect that over the rest of this year and some part of the beginning of '12. But certainly we will take decisions in the second half of '11 with regard to how we want to create additional value for shareholders vis-&#xE0;-vis what we do and how we treat the non-core businesses. And we will get back to you in the second half on that. You should not interpret my comments in any way as being a reluctance to take the decisions necessary to drive the innovative core.</p>
          <p>Vis-&#xE0;-vis the culture and how we're going to return productivity in R&amp;D, you know, I think it comes down to a lot of what we've discussed on creating the Chief Scientific Officers for disease areas, empowering them, giving the right incentive structure, giving them control over their budgets. It comes down to the quality of leadership that Mikael Dolsten will exercise over research, the quality of the leaders that we will hire, and also utilize the leaders we already have inside the organization. We intend to look at a very strong incentive system to motivate entrepreneurial behavior in R&amp;D and we are focusing on key disease areas where we believe we have capabilities and the depth of science to be successful.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally we think we've sized our research, sized the effort, sized the resources and focused it so it will be productive. And we will continue to work on that. And while I think the model we have is going to be successful, we'll continue to review it. We have metrics internally that will measure that on a sort of six-monthly, yearly basis. We're very, very focused on getting this model right and getting productivity.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks very much. My first question is on the strategic review. It seems like several of the actions you could potentially consider if you were to break up pieces of your pharma division could be associated with incremental near term costs or dis-synergies. At the same time, they could unlock a lot of shareholder value. How are you thinking about the trades offs as you consider opportunities to reshape the company?</p>
          <p>The second question was on bus. development. Obviously during this year of strategic review, are your various business units free to pursue transactions, particularly the larger bolt-on deals, the multi-billion dollar type of acquisitions or should we think about Pfizer pursuing a lower amount of activity as we go through this year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. So yes, I mean your characterization of the way we are looking at the innovative business and the diversified businesses are that we look to see where there are natural synergies. Are there reasons why the businesses work well together and improve our market presence or are they really standalone businesses where there are no dis-synergies? We look at what we need to invest to maintain or improve market position. I'm trying to assess what is the competitive set against where we're competing and what is the probabilities of continued success in those businesses. All that comes down to our view of what is the net present value of the cash flows of those businesses and what is their value inside Pfizer and what is their value outside Pfizer? That will drive our decision-making on that.</p>
          <p>As regards to business development, each business unit is working in partnership with central business development resources to identify opportunities and bring them forward. A key component is I want to have accountability; I want to have the BU leaders feeling responsible and accountable for the deals they propose. They will then take those deals and manage them much in the way that you know the King deal is a good deal and the business units that proposed it are responsible for the results of that acquisition.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This first question is on tofa [tofacitinib]. Can you just make sure we understand, have there been any more deaths in any of the other studies that you just reported out on? I think we are all pretty clear based on the press release you put out on the prior studies but there were two additional studies that were put out. So if you could comment on that and maybe just overall how you view the response out there and what's happening with tofa.</p>
          <p>The second question is just specifically, can you talk about Russia? Did it bounce back this quarter? I know it was a tough quarter last quarter. And then in China, how are things looking specifically there, what kind of growth did you see in the quarter? Are you still actively investing as fast as you can there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, yeah. On tofa, just let me start by saying that the mortality rates that we've seen for tofa across all trials are within the expected range for therapies- biologic therapies used in this patient population. These are very large trials with patients with severe, moderate to severe disease and mortality does occur in these trials. So we will be reporting full results of all the trials at upcoming meetings but you won't find anything that's unusual with regard to the mortality rates.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the question for Brazil &#x2013; or for Russia and China. For Russia we did have a bounce back this quarter from what we had last year and in the fourth quarter in particular. And that was underlying demand was very good.</p>
          <p>Specifically in China, things are going very, very well in China. We're currently the number one ranked pharmaceutical company in the Chinese market and our evolution index is greater than a hundred. We continue to have targeted investments in this area and we're very, very pleased with our progresses and optimistic for future growth in China.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but separately, Ian and Frank, your discussions, maybe you can tell us with your discussions with chains and payers, what are their biggest challenges right now that have implications on Pfizer? In other words, what are your customers telling you?</p>
          <p>Separately, legislatively, is there anything in recent months that you're concerned about or less concerned about the pricing environment in the U.S.? And what do you think the implications are for the legislation to defund the state health insurance exchanges? Are there any implications for the drug industry or for Pfizer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So evolution index. That is a measure of are you growing faster or slower than the market. So 100 would mean you're growing at the market rate, above 100 is faster than the market and below 100 you're growing less than the market. So David's comments about China that we have a positive evolution index means we're growing faster than the market rate to date.</p>
          <p>The next question was on?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our customers remain focused in sort of broad terms. They remain focused on ensuring that they have a competitive offering to their customers in regards to the quality of their healthcare and the cost or price of their healthcare. So to the extent we participate in doing that where we add value to their offerings, then we're going to be successful.</p>
          <p>On the environment, you know really I think it's very much in flux. We're working along the assumptions of the law that we have in place today and you know, we'll see how it develops as it develops.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The recent EULAR tofa abstract cited four opportunistic infections. I'm wondering if you could tell us what the causative organisms were.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. Two &#x2013; wondering, can you &#x2013; on the strategic review, Ian, when we kind of think about the difficulties of, you know, sort of breaking up the company and the way that the debt was structured, is there anything that we should think about with regard to, you know, covenants for the debt and the ability to kind of restructure the debt associated with some of the potential movements going forward? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Thanks, I'll ask Frank to answer that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think, Seamus, the short answer is no. Given how the debt is structured, we don't see that handcuffing our ability to make the right operational and shareholder value decisions relative to the business portfolio.</p>
