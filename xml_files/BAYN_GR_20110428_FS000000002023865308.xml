          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Bayer's investor and analyst conference call on the first quarter 2011 results. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alexander Rosar, Head of Investor Relations of Bayer AG. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jason. Ladies and gentlemen, for you, thank you for joining our first quarter conference call, but I would like to welcome you also on behalf of my colleagues.</p>
          <p>With me today on our call are Marijn Dekkers, our CEO; Werner Baumann, our CFO; and from our sub-groups, HealthCare is represented by J&#xF6;rg Reinhardt; CropScience by Sandra Peterson; and MaterialScience by Patrick Thomas.</p>
          <p>Marijn will start off our conference call with a brief summary of the developments in the first quarter. We assume you have all received and reviewed our corporate newsletter, the briefing documents and the slides, so we just run through the main parts.</p>
          <p>Before handing over to Marijn, I'd also like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor wording statement. Thank you. Marijn?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alexander. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Bayer had a successful start to 2011. We achieved 13% reported sales growth in the first quarter, and net income was up 8% after special charges of EUR 0.4 billion.</p>
          <p>All the subgroups contributed to a 22% improvement in adjusted EBITDA for the group. The increase was primarily driven by a strong start to the 2011 season in CropSciences, by the significant business expansion at MaterialScience and by a solid performance of HealthCare.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share came in at EUR 0.83, up 9%. Core EPS increased by 28% to EUR 1.45. We are raising our full year 2011 sales and earnings guidance for the Bayer group due to the successful start of CropSciences to the 2011 season. We confirm our HealthCare outlook, and are updating our forecast for MaterialScience to reflect the impact of selling price increases induced by higher raw material cost.</p>
          <p>So let's now take a brief look the key data for first quarter. In my comments, I will concentrate on the sales data adjusted for portfolio and currency effects.</p>
          <p>Group sales in the quarter grew by 10% driven primarily by higher volumes. Overall, volume growth contributed nearly 8% to the increase, and higher selling prices almost 3%.</p>
          <p>Business expansion was also reflected in the bottom line, and in cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA rose by 22%, and core earnings per share climbed by 28% to EUR 1.45. Net cash flow advanced by 9%.</p>
          <p>Reported EBIT of the Bayer group rose by only 4% to EUR 1.1 billion, despite the positive business trends. Earnings were diminished by special charges of EUR 442 million. This figure included EUR 248 million for the already announced restructuring in HealthCare and CropSciences, and EUR 194 million for legal and defense costs, and an intended settlement program in connection with litigations concerning genetically modified rice, the so-called LLRICE. Important to know is here that we hope that this further provision -- with this further provision, the LLRICE subject is now dealt with to a large extent.</p>
          <p>After a non-operating result of minus EUR 230 million, pre-tax income came in at EUR 935 million, and net income at EUR 684 million. This corresponds to earnings per share of EUR 0.83, up 9% versus the prior-year quarter, as already mentioned.</p>
          <p>From a regional perspective, we again achieved our strongest growth in the emerging economies. In Western Europe, business gained 9%, and in the United States sales were up by 6%. The emerging markets accounted for 33% of group sales, and in these countries we expanded sales by 16%, recording our strongest growth in Eastern Europe, the emerging Asian markets and in Latin America. These figures clearly demonstrate that we are well positioned in the emerging markets, and that our significant investments there are really paying off.</p>
          <p>Gross cash flow in the first quarter moved forward by 11% to EUR 1.3 billion as a result of the improved operating performance. Cash tied up in working capital increased significantly due to the expansion of business, but overall working capital management continues to be very good.</p>
          <p>Net cash flow rose by 9% to EUR 800 million. Net financial debt receded by a further EUR 800 million compared to the end of the last year to now EUR 7.1 billion.</p>
          <p>During the same period, the net pension liability fell from EUR 7.2 billion to EUR 6.6 billion due especially to higher long term interest rates on the capital markets. The significant progress we achieved in deleveraging our balance sheet was also acknowledged by the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's. Just last week, S&amp;P revised the outlook of our corporate credit rating to stable from negative; at the same time, the A long term and A2 short term credit ratings for our firm, so it's A minus long term and A minus 2 short term credit ratings for the firm.</p>
          <p>Let's now move on to the performance of our sub-groups. Sales of the HealthCare sub-group rose by 4% to EUR 4.2 billion in the quarter. The improvement was mainly driven by the positive development of the Consumer Health segment.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Pharmaceutical segment improved by 1% in the first quarter, with particularly good gains in China and Japan. Business in China expanded by nearly 40% against the weak prior-year levels. However, the genericization of YAZ in the United States has a negative impact on growth in Pharmaceuticals. Sales in the Pharmaceutical segment were also held back by adverse effects of the health system reforms in various countries.</p>
          <p>The development of our key Pharma products was mixed in the quarter. Kogenate and Aspirin Cardio both advanced strongly, up 13% and 19%, respectively. Nexavar gained 7%. Betaferon sales declined by 5%, and YAZ sales were down 18% due to generic competition in the United States, as I already mentioned. Excluding the United States, the YAZ family of products advanced by 6%.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health reported a strong first quarter, with sales up 10% over the prior-year period. Sales in the Consumer Care division grew by 13%, driven by the strong performance by our key brands.</p>
          <p>Sales of the Medical Care segment rose 4%, driven by the positive development of our diabetes care business. This was mainly due to higher volumes for our Contour blood glucose meter system. Sales of the Animal Health division advanced by almost 9%, supported by our Advantage product line, which grew especially in the United States.</p>
          <p>The adjusted EBITDA of HealthCare increased by 11%. This was largely attributable to the favorable development of Consumer Health and to positive currency effect, which more than offset the increase in selling expenses.</p>
          <p>CropSciences continued its strong performance of the previous quarter, and raised sales by 14% mainly as a result of higher volumes. Selling prices contributed 1% to the increase. An early and particularly strong start to the season in the northern hemisphere and high prices for agricultural commodities provided a favorable market environment compared with the very weak market environment in prior year quarter. In addition, we pressed ahead with the expansion of our BioScience business.</p>
          <p>In the Crop Protection segments, sales in the first quarter came in 12% above the prior-year period at EUR 1.7 billion, with significant sales gain in all regions. Good increases were recorded for our herbicides, fungicides and seed treatment division, while our insecticide sales declined slightly.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Environmental Science BioScience segment climbed by 18% due to the strong business expansion at BioScience, which posted a 27% increase. This positive development in our BioScience division was largely attributable to significantly higher sales of our canola and rapeseed businesses in Canada and the United States, which were due to expanded acreages and higher commodity prices. Adjusted EBITDA of CropSciences was up 40%, driven by the business expansion at Crop Protection and BioScience.</p>
          <p>MaterialScience continued its positive development in the first quarter. With sales of EUR 2.7 billion we exceeded the prior-year quarter, which was still significantly hampered by the global economic prices, and we exceeded the prior-year quarter by 19%.</p>
          <p>The expansion of business was due to a considerable increase in demand from our key customer industries, especially construction and automotive. This enabled us to significantly raise volumes in all regions and for all products, and to increase selling prices overall.</p>
          <p>The improved business situation was also reflected in the earnings. Adjusted EBITDA rose markedly by 24%. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.8% in the quarter was virtually unchanged versus the prior-year, as higher selling prices for our products enabled us to just offset the much higher raw material and energy costs.</p>
          <p>Following our successful start in 2011, we are raising our sales and earnings forecast for the full year, mainly in light of the good start to the season at CropScience. For the full year 2011, we are now targeting a currency and portfolio adjusted sales increase for the Bayer group of between 5% and 7% compared to our present guidance of a 4% to 6% increase.</p>
          <p>This corresponds to group sales of between EUR 36 billion and EUR 37 billion. We now aim to increase EBITDA before special items to more than EUR 7.5 billion rather than just toward 7.5 billion as we said before. Core earnings per share are expected to improve by about 15% against our previous guidance of about 10%.</p>
          <p>So now let's come to the outlook by sub-group. First, for HealthCare, as already mentioned, we confirm our outlook for 2011. HealthCare plans to increase sales by a low to mid single digit percentage after adjusting for currency and portfolio effects, and to achieve a small improvement in EBITDA before special items.</p>
          <p>In the Pharmaceutical segment, we do not expect sales to resume growing with the market in 2011. We plan to increase sales by a low to mid single digit percentage after adjusting for currency and portfolio effect, and to raise the EBITDA margin before special items.</p>
          <p>In the Consumer Health segment, we anticipate above market sales growth in sales &#x2013; sorry, sales growth, after adjusting for currency and portfolio effect. We expect sales and EBITDA before special items to increase by mid single digit percentages.</p>
          <p>On CropSciences, following the dynamic start of 2011, and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our guidance for CropSciences. We now expect to improve sales in both segments on a currency and portfolio adjusted basis, and to grow overall by a high single digit percentage compared to our previous guidance of a mid single digit percentage.</p>
          <p>We intend to further strengthen our market position in the Environmental Science, BioSciences segment, and to at least maintain our existing position in Crop Protection. We now plan to expand EBITDA before special items by about 20% compared to the weak prior year.</p>
          <p>The good business situation at MaterialScience in the first quarter of 2011 was in line with our expectations. We expect that the economy will continue to recover. We are adjusting our sales forecast for 2011, as we expect to be able to pass on the raw material cost increases and higher prices one for one to our customers.</p>
          <p>We now plan to raise sales by a high single digit percentage on a currency and portfolio adjusted basis, and continue to expect that EBITDA before special items will increase at a higher rate than sales.</p>
          <p>So just to be very clear: as a result of this adjustment in MaterialScience, we expect higher sales, but not a higher EBITDA number versus our previously &#x2013; guidance. For MaterialScience in the second quarter of 2011, we anticipate further growth in sales, and an improvement in EBITDA before special items compared with the first quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure you will agree that our operating performance remains on track in the first quarter of 2011, and that we got off to a successful start. Very good news is that all the sub-groups contributed the sales and earnings growth. We are raising our full year 2011 sales and earnings guidance for the Bayer group, particularly due to the expected improvement at CropSciences.</p>
          <p>That concludes my remarks. We will now be happy to answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. Jain. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch, just two quick questions. Firstly I think in introductory comments you said that the rice litigation was behind you with the provision taken in the quarter. Can you just clarify that comment as my understanding was there were still a number of court cases outstanding? And then secondly, just very quickly, on Xarelto, do you have any visibility on the timing of the ROCKET AF general publication? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I will have the rice litigation question I will ask Werner Baumann, our CFO, to answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Sachin. Just to clarify that, first of all, we had a little bit more than 400 cases representing almost 12,000 plaintiffs, 11,800 plaintiffs all together. What we have done with the provision, which covers both an increase when it comes to the settlement mandate we have given and we expect, and secondly, one settlement with one of the plaintiffs already. We assume that the amount we have provided for now takes largely care of this entire complex. I think that's the best I can answer the question with. Since the settlement is not finally inked here there's not much more I can say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Xarelto, J&#xF6;rg Reinhardt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Xarelto, I'm afraid I don't have real news. The expectation is still that the publication is going to be out soon, but I can't give you any more precise data than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Leuchten. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Michael Leuchten from Barclays Capital. Three HealthCare questions, please. One clearly very strong margin performance in the first quarter both in Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health, but you're not changing your outlook for the full year. Can you just run me through what your thinking is for the rest of the year, how the margin will progress, and what the major factors are? Secondly, you alluded to the FX impact on EBITDA in your remarks and also in your quarterly report. Can you just given me more details what really was impacted here and how is that going to look going forward at current rates? And then thirdly on YAZ, there are again publications on thrombosis risk. How do you think about the risk to the franchise and also the more recently launched products that incorporate the same active ingredients? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me start with the margin. Yes indeed, we had a strong first quarter, which was mainly driven by a strong performance in Consumer Health. Pharma was doing well as well, but certainly Consumer Health was the main driving factor, together with strong FX impact, as we stated before.</p>
          <p>Now for the rest of the year, two aspects that one needs to consider. One is of course the fact that the R&amp;D costs tend to be a little bit higher in the second part of the year than in the first part. And second, we are getting closer to launch of Xarelto in spots, which will also have the consequence that our efforts will be intensified there, which will drive a little bit higher costs.</p>
          <p>The third factor, and maybe Werner wants to comment on that, is FX, which is obviously very favorable in the first quarter, but our projections at the moment show us that, that as the extent of favorability is not going to be expected for the full year. Werner Baumann, do you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, J&#xF6;rg. Michael, on that point, as we have reported, overall for the group we had roughly EUR 75 million positive FX. Most of that happens to be in HealthCare and inside of HealthCare most is actually in Pharmaceuticals. If you look at our currency baskets, quarter one versus quarter one a year ago, you can say that we have a positive sequential of roughly 5% on average for that basket, but that was only true for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>As we move into quarters two, three and four, that advantage is going to fade completely, and it's going to completely fade way, and we will not have any favorability based on the assumptions we have taken with our forecasted rates. So there will not be any further support on the earnings side from currency the way we have seen in quarter one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding YAZ. Yes, there are new studies out there that essentially don't bring any new aspects into the discussion. When you look a little bit more closely at what the studies actually say, then you see immediately that they are flawed by the same kind of shortcomings that we have criticized and others have criticized before, which is that they are not taking into account risk factors like, for example, smoking rate or age. And they are not, for example, corrected for duration of treatment where we know that that has a significant impact on the thromboembolic event rate as well.</p>
          <p>There are also a number of third party comments to the BMJ Articles in the meantime that have been published on the BMJ website that share this perspective, and actually going even in more detailed why these data should actually not change our perspective on the product. So given that situation, we don't think that there is significant impact of these data neither on our business in the U.S., nor overseas. Of course we will have to follow further development diligently here, but what I can say is that after the first few days of discussion there's actually nothing that would change my perspective on these data not adding new insights into the situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Race. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's, I presume that's me, Tim Race from Deutsche Bank. My question is regarding VEGF Trap and just wanted to know if you could talk about the timing or your expected timing of potential filing and launches in the EU and various international markets for that product? And then just a question on in terms of the safety profile. Obviously, we're going to get the CATT study data very soon in terms of Lucentis and Avastin, but I'm just wondering about the read-through on the safety-wise, given that VEGF Trap contains actually a portion of antibody, and how you may be able to distant yourself from any potential sort of systemic side effects that I imagine the makers of other products may highlight? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. J&#xF6;rg?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Regarding filing, we have been indicating all along that we would be filing in the first half of 2011, and that's still our intention. Regarding safety, of course, this is very speculative, and I've also seen some first, let's say, comments based on claims data bases on potential safety difference between Lucentis and Avastin. It will be interesting to see whether the upcoming CATT study has any new insights to that, but to now speculate how our product would compare to these from a safety perspective would probably be premature and would not be the right thing to do.</p>
          <p>I mean, all I can say is that from an overall safety profile, we are very happy with the profile we have seen so far. There is rare incidents of inflammatory events like for all of these products, but beyond that we are quite confident that the safety profile is at least competitive, but obviously, we'll follow and very closely watch further developments in that area.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Vosser. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Three questions, please. First two on Pharma and just wondering what sort of impact you're seeing on BETASERON? Clearly, we saw a decline this quarter, but if you could &#x2013; but should be we thinking of that decline accelerating or are other interferons more likely to suffer from Gilenya competition then BETASERON in your view? Any thoughts there would be excellent. And then on Pharma, just following up in terms of the EBITDA margin progression in the Pharma business. Have we seen any benefits from a restructuring in Q1, probably too early, but should this help in the second half despite the Xarelto investments? Or how should we think about that development? A little bit more color there would be great. And then the third question is on CropScience. I noticed that, and you said on the call, there was a 1% benefit in price from price in Q1 '11. Just wondering your views on with the continued positive demand drivers whether we should see any price benefits adding to the strong volume demand through Q2? Any help there would be great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll start with the Pharma question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Regarding BETASERON, actually it's a bit too early to comment on impact of Gilenya. So far I would say that that impact has been minimal. What we see, of course, is an impact from Extavia, which hits us in quite a number of important markets, which is not unexpected, but not nice to have. So we'll have to see also how the focus of Novartis for Extavia versus Gilenya is going to impact on that development. But overall, I would think that we can state that the high single digit decline that we projected in the number of years now for BETASERON is going to continue; anything else than but that would be optimistic.</p>
          <p>Regarding the margins, yes, of course, I mean restructuring you do in order to be more efficient and more productive, and we would hope that you have an impact of that. On the other hand, I mean when we made this announcement on restructuring, we also indicated that a significant part of the savings would be reinvested, and especially in Pharma, where we have the intention to add significantly to our sales force capacity in China. We do anticipate to reinvest around 50% of the savings that we're going to make again in our business, which will obviously limit the impact you see. But it should nevertheless net-net help us a little bit get to the slight margin improvement that we have in our guidance.</p>

          <p>So as you saw, we were able once again in the quarter to maintain prices, and in some cases take prices up in certain markets and in certain product. And based on where we sit today, our expectation is that we should be able to sustain this through the rest of the year, that our pricing should be able to hold. And in selected cases, we're able to actually take up pricing because of the value of the products. It's worth it in the marketplace. So as we said today, it looks like we're doing all right on pricing in the market.</p>

The situation is not unchanged as compared to former quarters where we see a more or less flat business in the United States, but strong growth still in Japan where, obviously, the hepatocellular indication helps us a lot, and it's adding strong patient numbers. But we also see significant growth on a low basis in China, so for example, in Japan we show close to 35% growth where as I stated in the United States it's more or less flat. In China we have close to 50% growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Jeremy Redenius from Sanford Bernstein. I have a question for each business unit, please. First in CropScience, we noticed you started using tiered rebates in some of the fungicides in the U.S., and I'm wondering if you're doing this more broadly in other regions with other products too? Could you also describe how that fits into your pricing strategy and are you getting the results you're expecting so far with the strategy? Second in MaterialScience, I wonder if you comment on some of the recent developments in polycarbonates? I see you've lifted your force majeure in the U.S., you've announced big price increases, but you have the Saudi cayenne plant starting up, and so is the balance of these effects positive or negative in your view? And also a kind of hypothetical question for MaterialScience. If I were to assume that benzene prices peak this month hypothetically, how long would it take until you started to seeing lower input costs? And then finally on HealthCare, what implications do you read from the recent FDA warning about the handling of Boehringer Ingelheim's Pradaxa tablet? I understand now that there's a warning that they can't be stored basically outside their bottle. Is that something that they can fix easily? Does that really affect how elderly patients will be able to take these pills? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We start with pricing strategy on fungicides. Sandy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in general what I would say is every market we actually end up having slightly different pricing strategy depending upon the competitive situation and the channel dynamics. So I don't think you could say that we're going to use this strategy broadly across the whole portfolio, but it seems to be the right approach for us in the U.S. and it seems to be an approach that's actually working. And it's helping us with our existing portfolio and the new products that we're launching in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Patrick, on the polycarbonate supply and pricing equilibrium?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for this question, Jeremy. You've watched the polycarbonate story unfold so far this year. At the moment, we're probably at around 90% plus of capacity. And to be honest, the first two lines of Saudi cayenne, which are published to come online in the middle of this year, are really quite necessary to supply the market, which is still growing. Market grew, or we expect the market to grow, at about 6% during this year, and certainly in first quarter we saw 7% growth. So I think that's probably a fair explanation around supply/demand.</p>
          <p>Your question on benzene, of course, is an interesting one. The peak on benzene margins over naphtha occurred in February, and probably the peak pricing around about March. And you've seen the forward prices in April coming down. It takes around about six weeks for that effect to come through into the business, and so we would expect to see still some peak benzene being consumed during second quarter. But as I think we said in the introduction, our intention is to continue to push price movements, as you've indentified, in polycarbonate. We certainly made a pretty good shot of that during the first quarter and caught up with a significant amount of the price input increase, and now we continue to do that through the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then BI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I probably shouldn't comment on a warning that a competitive product got from the FDA, but I mean what I can say is that in most of the European markets, any product or tablet-based product normally comes in blisters, which means that these tablets are individually packed, which would not be impacted by a concern like that. And in the U.S. it's a different situation where the bulk of the tablets come in boxes, and I'm sure that Boehringer is working on solution for that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for taking my question, Christian Faitz from Macquarie. I have three questions, if I may. First of all did the recent early drought in Europe have any impact on your CropScience business? And can you update us on your view how U.S. farmers so far have dealt with the cold conditions, at least in patches of the key crop areas? Also...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me? Can you speak a little slower? Because we have trouble with understanding your question. A little slower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First, recent weather conditions, the drought in Europe, and at least cold patches in parts of the U.S., has that impacted any of your business in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the second CropScience question is I am missing the information about the top 10 CropScience product sales in the quarterly report. Can you update us on that? And any reason for taking that out? In Material Science, how likely do you believe that it is that some of your key customer groups, for example, typically automotive supplier will easily accept further price hike with them not being able to pass this on to their own customers? And then third, a group questions. Your reported EBITDA North America, I assume a slide simply because of the provisions for the litigation charges. Could you share with us an adjusted EBIT figure for the regions, particularly for North America? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we start with our weather expert, Sandy, talk about the influence of droughts and flooding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thanks very much for asking me a weather-related question. To simply answer the question regarding Europe and early droughts in the first quarter, we did not see any impact because it was much too early in the season. At the moment, the business in Europe is still doing well, but this is one of these cases if it doesn't start raining soon it probably will start impacting some of the markets in Western Europe. But at the moment we haven't seen any substantive impact in Europe.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the U.S., it's actually kind of a mixed bag. The northern part of the U.S. everything is still under snow, and so the Northern Plains in Canada wheat and canola has not been planted yet. And in the Midwest belt they had huge issues of flooding, and obviously in the Texas region there's a drought. So it's a wonderful time to be in the United States at the moment. So I think the relevant point is at the moment you've seen this data that normally at this point in time across these crops usually have about 30% planted, and right now on average it's about 9%.</p>
          <p>So it's early in the season to know what the impact of all of this is, but if it doesn't fundamentally change in the next six weeks, it will have an impact on the United States in terms of the market. So that's a little bit about how the weather is progressing. I don't think there's any reason to be concerned at this moment, but I think it is something we just have to watch, particularly the U.S. situation. So that's the weather report. The rest of the world is basically doing as it normally would be.</p>
          <p>The other question you asked about products details. We continue to provide details as it relates to segments, fungicides and insecticides, and we can periodically give highlights on how new products are potentially doing once they've been in the market long enough. But for competitive reasons we made the decision not to provide that level of detail any longer on a very specific product basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Material Science, automotive customers accepting our price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Christian, the bottom line is the answer is yes. But I should explain a little bit why, and probably if we think about polyurethane, first of all, TDI prices have actually been at higher than this, and there's no big drama in terms of automotive seating when TDI prices move around either in the furniture market.</p>
          <p>On the insulation front the prices are being passed through to the construction industry at the moment. The price increase we're putting through on MDI next month has already been announced in the market for rigid foam insulation in Europe, for example. So there's a pass-on effect there which is easily accommodated within the market from what we can see.</p>
          <p>As far as automotive is concerned, typically where beyond the seating and comfort components we're supplying new materials, substituting old materials and perhaps the best example is the new Mercedes SLK where both the hard top, which is retractable and the transparent panoramic hardtop are made using our polycarbonate where actually the pricing is similar to laminated glass, but of course, the benefit is significant in terms of weight reduction, design freedom and functionality.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Okay. We'll all go buy one, Patrick.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question, sorry, about the EBITDA/EBIT developments in the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, first of all, when it comes to special classes or what have you, we do book those regularly at the level of the entities which are concerned, so that was true actually in all regions. When it comes to the operational result on an adjusted basis, it's my understanding that we do not disclose those because they are actually fairly meaningless. There are, of course, elements such as the special charges, but all the regional result and the local results are typically affected by transfer price changes and the like, so it wouldn't give you any further insight when it comes to profitability of these markets if we go to the stocks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it would be fair to assume that the fall of nearly 50% in EBIT North America could be mostly explained by exceptional charges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a mixed bag of different things. If you look at the EBIT, which is reported as EUR 123 million in quarter one 2010, it is EUR 83 million in quarter one 2011 we reported at the same time. If you just look at the special charges for our LLRICE litigation, the charge of EUR 194 million and that means we can't make &#x2013; take that conclusion that is driven by &#x2013; by some other &#x2013; there are other things which weigh in there as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I will do so. In the Crop Protection business, in insecticides you had a decline in sales whereas the competition had the strongest increase in their segments insecticide. Do you have any explanation for this huge difference? And then secondly in the BioScience business you were able to improve some margin considerably. Is that just the sales growth? Or has it also to do with the higher importance of the Genentech trade royalties and your own trade penetration? And last but not least in the pricing, the price increase of 0.7% for CropScience. Is it fair to assume that the price increases come more from the BioScience business and that in Crop Protection the prices are still below last year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sandy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me take each of your questions in turn. As it relates to insecticides, the reason for the year-over-year decline is a portfolio effect. We divested two products, and as you know, we also made the decision earlier this year to discontinue production and sale of Temik. And all three of those are insecticides, and so they had a first quarter impact and we weren't able to completely make up for those in the first quarter. If those three products had been in our portfolio in the first quarter, we would have actually seen a slightly more than 5% increase year-over-year for the revenue line. And so as the year progressed, and we have other products in our portfolio we should be able to make up for that, but we didn't in the first quarter. So that's the explanation as it relates to insecticides.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the BioScience business, there are multiple effects. There really are three, and one of them has to do with your third question. Clearly, with higher sales there's a margin impact on some of the business. There also is &#x2013; we saw positive pricing impact on our Broadacre crop as well as some of our vegetable crop, and then obviously, some of the trade income has an impact also on the BioSciences in the first quarter. So there are three positive things that impacted the business.</p>
          <p>And as it relates to pricing overall, we actually did not see a decline in CP pricing in the first quarter. We were actually flat year-over-year. So as I said earlier, we've been able to maintain pricing on average and in some cases we've actually and in some markets been able to take price up in CP, but in the first quarter we saw a larger improvement in our pricing in our BioScience portfolio.</p>

We had, nevertheless, a good first quarter this year, especially in the U.S. where we seemed to gain back market share from our competitors, which is actually a good sign and makes me confident that we will see a similar performance for the rest of the year in diabetes care.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health overall had a strong quarter. We had a strong cough/cold season in the U.S., but it's actually going beyond cough/cold, actually all products. All major brands, including Bepanthen and Canesten did very well in the first quarter. We'll have to see whether we can maintain that trend, but so far we are certainly very pleased with the progress we are making in that area there in 2011. And regarding currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, FX impact on the group EBITDA? Werner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. For the first quarter we had a positive effect amounting to a total of EUR 75 million bottom line including EBITDA. Top line was a little bit more than EUR 220 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you did say, just trying to get this right, that based on your planning assumptions there wouldn't be an FX effect for the full year, but I know that your planning assumptions don't take account of the foreign exchange as it is today. So if foreign exchange were to be as it was today for the rest of the year, would there still be a foreign exchange benefit for you for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't answer it exactly for the rates as of today, but let me bring you back to our basic assumptions, which are as of the end of last quarter, and if you were to take the rate as of the end of last quarter and simply project them out for the remainder of the year, our full year earnings would be essentially foreign exchange neutral, slightly negative, minus EUR 20 million compared to the EUR 75 million plus we have had in the first quarter. And our top line would be impacted negatively as well.</p>
          <p>So we see some distinctively different movements between quarter one, which has been positive on both sides, and then the remainder of the year, which would turn it into a net negative on the top line, so roughly three quarters of a billion, and just about even slightly negative bottom line.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen, Florent Cespedes from Exane BNP Paribas. Thank you for taking my question. So on HealthCare first on M&amp;A. Glaxo has released a list of the OTC brands that will be divested. Knowing that they are mainly in Europe and the U.S., would you look at this opportunity? Do you believe it is attractive enough compared to your portfolio? Or would you prefer emerging market brands? Another question on M&amp;A on the Animal Health side. Do you still see some external growth opportunities in Animal Health following the termination of the agreement between Sanofi and Merck that they won't have, let's say, dividends that will be divested there? Or in other words, are you happy with the size of your Animal Health division in absence of potential targets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will answer these questions, Marijn Dekkers. We don't want to comment on specific acquisition opportunities, businesses that are for sale, obviously for competitive reasons. But let me just answer it more in general also from an Animal Health point of view. We are interested in doing acquisitions in HealthCare.</p>
          <p>Our major focus across the company is organic growth, but if we can strengthen our businesses with acquisitions, we will do so, particularly in HealthCare and also in the BioSciences part of CropSciences are areas where we would have the major focus. On Consumer Care I don't want to comment, as I said, on particulars, and on Animal Health we are not aware of any businesses for sale there at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, Martin Fl&#xFC;ckiger from Helvea. First three questions, please, short ones, I promise. First question is a clarification question regarding pricing in CropScience, again, I'm afraid. The acoustics weren't very good, so I couldn't hear anything you said. Just coming back to it; as far as I understood, you were going for relatively flat or stable pricing going forward for CropScience. Now my understanding is that the second quarter was particularly, in 2010, was particularly impacted by the competitive price pressure, particularly in North America. Assuming that you will seek overall flat prices sequentially going forward, shouldn't that mean that your pricing contribution in Q2, but also in the subsequent quarters should be larger than what we have seen in the first quarter? That's my first question on CropScience. Then second question is on Crop Protection, and there I was wondering whether you could give us your insights on how you see the channel inventory situation in the &#x2013; at the beginning of the second quarter, i.e. in April so far? And then the third question will be one, a very short one for MaterialScience. I was wondering whether you could indicate to us what the raw material price and energy hit was on EBIT quarter-on-quarter? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Short, easy questions, but the answers may not be so short and easy. Okay. So, Sandy, is starting with pricing in CropSciences, and then inventory levels and Crop Protection price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me try to clarify the pricing comment that I made. What I said is that in total for the business we saw a 1% improvement in pricing. In the first quarter in Crop Protection net-net it was a zero increase in pricing relative to first quarter of last year, and our BioScience business saw an increase in our ability to take price in the first quarter. Our expectation through the rest of the year is that we should be able to see positive impact from the market place, the higher demand and high commodity prices, and we should be able to take &#x2013; to see the impact of some of our pricing actions in the marketplace in Crop Protection, and it's not at a minimum able to sustain where we are to actually improve our pricing slightly through the back half of three quarters of the year. And quite honestly, that's consistent with what we were able to do in the third and fourth quarter last year in CP.</p>
          <p>You asked a question about the second quarter of last year. That was, as you know, in the United a quarter where glyophosate pricing went down dramatically, and then we ended up because of that having to not match it, but everybody in the marketplace actually ended up taking down pricing in the herbicide part of the category. And there was a lot of competitiveness in fungicides, particularly in North America in the second quarter of last year. Our expectation is that we should be &#x2013; that has moderated and it looks like as we go into the second and third quarter that the industry pricing is much more stable. So that's why I'm saying that I think we're feeling relatively positive about our ability to sustain and slightly increase our pricing in Crop Protection through the end of the year.</p>
          <p>The question around channel inventories, because of the &#x2013; it looks like given the slight delay in North America because of the weather situation and the fact that planting has been slightly delayed, and also that had some impact on some European markets. The channels in April are, I would say, they're significantly high, but they're relatively high. But I don't think anybody in the industry believes that's an issue because everybody is putting product as close to the market as possible and staging it. And so it's really now a question about the weather breaking and planting starting and getting these things on the field. So channel inventories are slightly higher at this moment in time than they were at the beginning of the March. That's normal for this time of year, given the weather.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Patrick Thomas in Material Science, the effect of raw material and energy increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Martin, if you look at it sequentially quarter four to quarter one, then that raw material and energy price impacted around about EUR 120 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, Mr. Amit has withdrawn his question. The next question comes from Mr. Spengler. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning &#x2013; good afternoon, gentlemen. This is Peter Spengler with DZ Bank. Thank you for taking my question, three questions actually. First is on MaterialScience. Your guidance that Q2 will be better than Q1, so it seems to me that there is no major effect from Japan visible at the moment? Then second question on restructuring HealthCare and CropScience. Could you tell us a bit about the status in both segments like plants already identified to be closed down, are they already closed down? Are the people already relocated, so what's the status on that? And do you think you are more advanced than expected or behind schedule? And the last question on your impairment of EUR 92 million, so it's broadly connected to CropScience. Maybe you can give us an idea what it is about? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Peter, on Japan, I guess as you've seen, there are very many mixed opinions about what's happening in Japan. There are certainly a lot of logistics difficulties and there are certainly car companies that are having problem getting some components through to their production lines.</p>
          <p>Primarily, I see this as a supply issue and not really a demand issue. And there are certainly customers who are now having to accept delays on cars that have already been ordered. But I honestly think although there is some phasing effect, it's not a huge effect as far as we can see so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer the question, Marijn Dekkers here, about the restructuring and the progress we are making in HealthCare and in CropSciences. This is basically a program that we are implementing over the next two years with the expectation that by the end of those two years, so beginning 2013, we will have in total EUR 800 million of annual savings, and that we will be reinvesting EUR 400 million of the savings back into the growth of the business. There are a number of projects. Some of them have been announced, and are beginning to be implemented. Others are not announced yet, are not completed defined or are still being discussed with the representatives of the employees, so it's hard to generalize.</p>
          <p>But two specific examples I can mention of where we have already made announcements is the recent announcement by HealthCare that we will consolidate a number of sites in HealthCare in the Eastern part of the United States into one larger facility in New Jersey. So that's an announcement that was recently made. And secondly in CropSciences in West Virginia, we have announced a rationalization of production capacity that is being implemented as we speak. So my suggestion would be to sort of follow us on certain news bites as the year goes by, and then you get a good overview of where we are, and what exactly we are doing. But it is a little bit of a smorgasbord of activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Third question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You asked on the EUR 92 million impairments. You can take it actually in two buckets. One and that is actually the lion's share of EUR 76 million relates to an impairment charge for the discontinuation of our activities at the Institute plant in CropScience. And then the remainder, which is EUR 60 million, is not a special item in product or, let's say, larger of those charges, that we have taken in HealthCare for a number of smaller IT investments on actually three products, total of EUR 60 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. One more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. K&#xF6;hler. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. It's Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. I have three questions, if I may. The first question is on Kogenate; obviously, very strong development. As far as I remember, you have a guidance of a mid single digit growth for the full year after 13% in the first quarter. Is there any update on the guidance or is in it unusually high quarter in your view? Second question also product specific, Mirena. You obviously have taken, I guess, a year ago or even a little bit longer big price increases, especially in the U.S., and since then obviously volume lacking significantly. What is your strategy actually to resume the growth path again in Mirena? And can you a little bit just elaborate on that? And a third question actually on CropScience. You highlighted the phase out of Temik. Obviously you do it first in U.S., and I believe you will follow in the rest of the world until 2014. Can you give us actually your sales in Temik and are you, let's say, do you sell more modern products here now in the insecticide or what the strategy to get let's say these changes into your portfolio instead of giving it out to competitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll start with HealthCare, J&#xF6;rg, Kogenate and Mirena?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Kogenate, yes, you are right, had a strong quarter. Based on one quarter I think it's a little bit premature to really change the guidance. Nevertheless, Kogenate did well in most countries, did well in the U.S.; did well in LatAm and Middle East. So I'm looking forward to a continuously well performing Kogenate brand, but I'm not feeling comfortable yet after one quarter to change the guidance.</p>
          <p>Regarding Mirena, these numbers that you saw for this first quarter are a little bit misleading because we had a very, very strong first quarter last year in the U.S., which was mainly driven by the price increase which happened in the second quarter, so we had strong sales in the first quarter which provide a very high basis for Mirena for this year. The first quarter performance this year is absolutely in line with our expectations, and we do expect for the rest of the year to show growth according to the guidance also for Mirena. We do see volume coming back also in the U.S., and we think that volume-wise, especially in U.S., we should be at the same level we have been before the increase at least by the end of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That means the price increases then should fit through to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sales here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. With the price increase we need to be a little bit careful. As you know in the U.S. it's a pretty mixed bag, depending on what customers you've got, and for Mirena we see a shift to managed care customers where obviously some rebates play a significant role as well. So you cannot just take the price increase and take the volume and do a simple price up. That's not going to work, but as I said before, you will see growth for Mirena for the rest of year, but it will not totally reflect the price increase that we took last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you, J&#xF6;rg, and then, Sandy, on the phase-out of Temik?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So let me clarify on the phase out of Temik. Last year we had originally announced that we were going to phase out Temik over a period of a couple years to give our customers, the growers, an opportunity to transition to other products. And that was in part because it's consistent with our sustainability policy of not wanting to have <mark type="ph" /> toxilin (1:06:57) products in our portfolio anymore. We ultimately made a decision earlier this year to not re-restart production, and that is part of the divesture and the shut downs, some of the lines that Marijn mentioned earlier, spoke about regarding West Virginia. So we are no longer selling Temik in the marketplace, and we think it's the right thing to do, although it's a transition issue for some of our customers.</p>
          <p>There are alternatives that we are working on with our customers that have a better profile environmentally around using some seed treatment products, and then working on some things in our labs to actually come up with a better profile product that actually can do &#x2013; have the same impact on insecticides, but without the environmental profile. So it's going to take us a couple years to work through that, but we are no longer selling Temik at all, and actually it's globally. It is not &#x2013; it wasn't a decision for the U.S. It was a global decision to stop selling it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just to get a little bit of feeling, should we expect a similar effect in the next quarter? Is Temik a very, let's say, first quarter product from a seasonal point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There will be a similar impact for Temik itself in terms of it not being in our portfolio in the second quarter. However, and we believe that we can work to mitigate some of the impact because of some of the other products, insecticide products in our portfolio.</p>
