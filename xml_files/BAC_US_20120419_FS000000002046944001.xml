          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's program. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Please note, today's call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to turn the program over to Kevin Stitt. Please go ahead</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Bruce Thompson begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. These factors include, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes in interest rates, competitive pressures within the financial services industry and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. And, for additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>
          <p>And, with that, let me turn it over to Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kevin. Before Bruce discusses the results in detail, I just want to take a minute and provide some additional thoughts on the quarter. On our last call I listed the following areas of focus for our company during 2012. We wanted to focus on our capital levels, we wanted to focus on our risk, we wanted to focus on the cost base in the company and we also needed to drive the core business improvement.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2012, we've made progress in each of these areas. As you can see, our capital and liquidity are at record levels in our company. Our credit costs continued to decline and our cost structure is coming down and many of the business, customer and profit metrics have improved.</p>
          <p>So first, from a capital perspective, we entered 2012 with increasing strength in our balance sheet position. We've managed through the CCAR test and made significant progress on our regulatory capital ratios again in this quarter. Our Tier 1 common ratio reached 10.78% at March 31, 2012. We continue to make progress on capital at a faster pace than we expected.</p>
          <p>When we turn to risk, our credit costs fell to the lowest level in nearly five years. Reserve levels cover 3.6% of our loans and leases and two times our current level of annualized credit losses. The improvement in delinquent and non-performing assets bodes well for further improvement in net losses as we go forward.</p>
          <p>As you know, we continue to take opportunities to reduce the remaining legacy assets in the Capital Markets business and we believe we have strong litigation and rep and warranty reserves in the mortgage area.</p>
          <p>On a day-to-day basis, the average value at risk, or VaR, is lower in our Trading business than it has been in some time. Yet, we managed to make similar levels of sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA, as we did last year.</p>
          <p>The continued cost reduction remains at the forefront of our thinking at Bank of America. We continue to streamline our company. Our priority is to make our company work better for our customers, our teammates and our clients and in the process reduce costs.</p>
          <p>As Bruce will show you later, we are achieving those results. We're achieving good results in bringing down expenses across our various business lines, showing good progress in trends over the past year. One area where we continue to work is our Legacy Assets and Servicing area. Personnel costs there are beginning to peak after adding significant resources over the past several months to implement the single point of contact and other mortgage programs. We expect these Legacy Assets and Servicing costs to come down the second half of 2012. Just for your reference, in the first quarter of 2012, the expense in Legacy Asset Servicing was $3.3 billion.</p>
          <p>As those costs increase, we passed a milestone. We have now modified more than one million mortgages. In addition to the modifications, the paces of short sales, deeds in lieu and other alternative resolutions continues to make progress and continues to quicken helping us reduce our delinquent loans overall.</p>
          <p>For the rest of our company, we saw a continued improvement in our costs. We expect to continue to achieve significant cost savings over the next 18 months consistent with our New BAC goals. We're finalizing New BAC Phase II as we have told you and will discuss those expected outcomes soon.</p>
          <p>As you are well aware, head count drives our operating costs in the end, and we expect to see continued progress in this area going forward. This quarter we added more than 2,500 associates in LAS as I spoke about earlier. But overall as we work throughout the company and cost management and every other area, we reduced our overall head count including those additions in LAS by over 3,000 FTEs. That's on top of a reduction of 7,000 FTEs plus last quarter. At the same time, as we're reducing our costs, we continue to invest in our franchise and support the economy.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, to help move the economy along, we extended more than $100 billion in loans to individuals and companies of all sizes showing the fifth consecutive quarter of average commercial loan growth to corporate and commercial clients.</p>
          <p>We've added client facing teammates in selected growth areas in our company. We've hired a hundred small business bankers in this quarter to further support our small business customers bringing the total of small business bankers since the program began to over 700. In small business lending, we continue to exceed all the goals we set for small business lending, including the goals we announced last fall in cooperation with the administration and small business administration. In fact, we're up 17% this quarter versus last quarter, first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>We've added 200 financial advisors to our team in the first quarter. As the quarter progressed, we added mortgage loan officers to focus on our direct-to-consumer mortgage business. As we think about the consumer business, it's an area we continue to work and we spoke about, we continue to respond to changing preferences to optimize our distribution network while investing where appropriate. This quarter, we added a half million mobile banking customers during the quarter. That's about 40,000 a week &#x2013; a pace that continues. We now have more than 9.7 (sic) [9.7 million] (6:07) mobile banking enabled customers.</p>
          <p>In our industry leading online banking area we added another half million accounts this quarter &#x2013; active accounts this quarter, bringing us to over 30 million active accounts. In addition, through our ATM capabilities, we passed a milestone with half the deposits of Bank of America going through our ATMs that used to go through our branch platform.</p>
          <p>So overall our customers continue to do more with us through all the channels, including traditional branches, mobile, online and ATM, but they're using the branches less, and that's why we are fine tuning our delivery network. We continue to align our banking center network to our customer needs. This includes reduction and consolidations, which there was a net reduction of 51 this quarter. That's part of the reduction we've spoken to you about of 750 branches over the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>In select instances we'll consider branch sales in markets where growth potential and size don't meet our goals. And at the same time, we continue to expand in markets with high density, where new locations can generate good results and we continue to renovate centers in all the places that we do business.</p>
          <p>We continue to use our leadership position to deepen our relationship with our customers and clients across all our franchises. In the consumer business we opened 800,000 new credit card accounts this quarter, half of which, even with our focus on credit quality were opened in our branches. Our innovative Bank of America card, Cash 1, 2, 3 card introduced only eight months ago, now has more than a million cards outstanding and has achieved great customer acceptance.</p>
          <p>In our brokerage and wealth management area, we continue to make good progress. Brokerage accounts and assets are growing nicely. In our Merrill Edge self-serve area, they've grown nicely year-over-year. But most importantly in our industry leading capabilities in Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and U.S. Trust we've seen solid, long-term assets under management flows this quarter, some of the best we've seen in a while.</p>
          <p>Our affluent and wealthy consumers at Bank of America are served by the best team in the business. For the fourth consecutive year we have more financial advisors on Barron's top 1,000 list than any other firm. When we turned to our commercial clients we saw higher utilization of lines of credit as our commercial customers continue to take advantage of opportunities as the economy continues to grow slowly. Our business is serving clients in our global banking segment and our ability to offer integrated solutions from lending, investment banking, treasury services, all the areas these clients need services, is continuing to produce strong and steady profits, and we maintain our number two investment banking position on fees.</p>
          <p>For institutional investor clients we are encouraged to see a rebound in capital markets activity. We had more than $5 billion in sales and trading revenues this quarter, excluding DVA, and that's a strong quarter. We reported positive trading related revenue every single day in the quarter, and this quarter represents the highest ever fixed income results in our company's history. This team did a good job of continuing to build our customer depth, even in the uncertainty of the world's economic events over the past couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>So let me close with this before I turn it over to Bruce. The momentum around our strategy continues to accelerate. We still have lots of work to do, but the team is focused and encouraged by these results. We're going to stay focused, as we said in the first quarter call. We're going to stay focused on the fundamentals this year and continue to drive forward the results for our clients, customers and you our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Bruce.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, Brian and good morning, everyone. I would just echo Brian's comments about the progress that we feel that we made throughout the quarter and would look to kick off the presentation starting on slide 4 of the investor presentation.</p>
          <p>As we look at that and think about the quarter, we note several key takeaways, some of which Brian referenced. We obviously reported $0.03 a share in earnings, but when you look at and consider that number, realize that includes negative valuation adjustments of $4.8 billion pre-tax or $0.28 a share after tax, which is the result of our credit spreads tightening significantly throughout the quarter. In addition to those results, we accreted significant levels of both capital and liquidity throughout the quarter and each of those metrics are at record levels as we ended the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>As we look at the operating results, Brian referenced capital market activities and the capital markets generally improved throughout the quarter, driving sales and trading results that were significantly above the fourth quarter of 2011 and in line with what we saw during the first quarter of 2011, once again excluding DVA. Outside of the sales and trading business, all of our business segments reflected improved profitability during the first quarter of this year relative to the fourth quarter of last year. Credit quality continued to improve significantly. Provision expense at $2.4 billion for the quarter was the lowest that we've seen since the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>We've talked a lot about expenses. Expenses did decline from the fourth quarter of 2011 despite the fact that we had higher revenue related incentives as well as the annual retirement eligible compensation of costs that occur during the first quarter of every year.</p>
          <p>And lastly, I'd highlight, we capitalized during the quarter on the ability to capture significant gains on some of our subordinated debt and preferred securities, $1.2 billion pre-tax during the quarter.</p>
          <p>If we turn to slide 5 where we give a little bit more income statement information, you can see the buildout of the net income of $700 million or $0.03 a share. The one thing I would highlight when you look at the income statement, that the pre-tax, preprovision number of $3.3 billion does not add back the $4.8 billion of FBO or DVA that we had during the quarter or for that matter, any of the other selected items which I'll go through now.</p>
          <p>As we look at things during the quarter that benefited net income, I referenced the debt and trust preferred repurchases. In addition to that $1.2 billion during the quarter, we had $800 million of gains, both within our private equity portfolio, as well as on the gain on sale of fixed income debt securities.</p>
          <p>On the negative side, I referenced the $4.8 billion of FBO and DVA. In addition to that, we had $900 million of annual retirement eligible compensation cost that, once again, as you recall, we incur each year during the first quarter of the year, and roughly $800 million of litigation expense, the majority of which was not mortgage-related.</p>
          <p>If we turn to Slide 6 and look at capital, we obviously built significant levels of capital from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of last year when we took our Basel I Tier 1 ratio from 8.65 to 9.86. We had another very strong quarter from a capital accretion perspective, growing capital from 9.86% to 10.78%.</p>
          <p>If you look at the components of that increase, four buckets that we've laid out here, the first, roughly seven basis points in capital by virtue of the fact that employees were paid a portion of their 2011 compensation in stock. The gains on repurchases of sub-debt and trust-preferred exchanges and repurchases I referenced were 13 basis points of capital. And most significantly during the quarter, risk-weighted assets declined by $64 billion during the quarter, which contributed 52 basis points to our benefit in our common ratio.</p>
          <p>As you think about that 52 basis points of improvement, think about that in the context, two-thirds of that represented pure exposure reduction, and roughly one-third of that represented declines as we continue to analyze, refine and optimize our capital calculations.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, about 20 basis points of capital from earnings. As you look at that earnings, realize that the FBO piece of the charge that I referenced does not negatively impact &#x2013; or positively, if it goes the other way &#x2013; regulatory capital.</p>
          <p>As a result of this capital accretion that we've seen during the quarter, we've previously given you guidance that we would expect to be at 7.25% to 7.5% of Tier 1 common under Basel III on a fully phased-in basis at the end of 2012. Based on the improvement we saw this quarter, we're very comfortable increasing that guidance to above 7.5% at the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>As we move from capital to liquidity on slide 7, you can see that during the quarter, our excess liquidity sources across the company grew by $28 billion to an all-time record of $406 billion at the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>As we look at parent company liquidity, it increased to $129 billion during the quarter, which is up $4 billion, while at the same time, on a net basis, our parent company debt was reduced by $5 billion.</p>
          <p>Importantly, as we talk about liquidity, we quote a time-to-funding metric. That time-to-funding metric increased to 31 months during the first quarter, and with $129 billion of parent company liquidity, we're in great shape to address the $34 billion of parent company maturities we have during the second quarter, which includes the remaining $24 billion of debt associated with the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, or TLGP.</p>
          <p>As you recall, we worked hard. We no longer &#x2013; or have very little parent-company or broker-dealer short-term unsecured funding. And as we look out at the balance of the year, we issued just over $5 billion of debt during the first quarter. Based on what we're seeing now, we clearly expect that to be less during the entirety of the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 8 to look at certain balance sheet items, I referenced the reductions in risk-weighted assets. You can see that we had about an $8 billion increase in deposits during the quarter. Our tangible common equity ratio remained very strong at 6.58%. Tier 1 common grew by just under $5 billion to $131.6 billion, which contributes to the 10.78% Tier 1 common ratio I just referenced.</p>
          <p>Tangible book remained relatively flat at $12.87. And you can see below, our allowance continues to cover our annualized charge-offs by about two times, and our liability for reps and warrants remained relatively flat at $15.7 billion.</p>
          <p>If we move away from capital and liquidity, net interest income on slide 9, net interest income increased sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter by about $100 million. As you look at and think about that change, we benefited from about $500 million of less premium amortization and hedge ineffectiveness. In addition, $100 million improvement by virtue of lowering our rates paid on deposits as well as the contraction of our debt footprint. And offsetting those benefits were reductions from declines in consumer balances and yields of about $400 million.</p>
          <p>If we turn to slide 10, we've laid out here the changes that we've made from a business segment reporting changes. I'm not going to go through this. We've laid it out here. We filed an 8-K last week that gave you a lot of information as to what those numbers look like with those changes. And while we apologize for the additional work that it creates, I would note that it very much aligns our business segments with the way that we manage both our customer relationships, as well as the way that we manage the overall company.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, we highlight the results of our Consumer and Business Banking segment. Earnings for the quarter were $1.5 billion, which is an increase of 17% from the fourth quarter and was driven by both lower expenses as well as lower provision.</p>
          <p>From a deposit perspective, average deposits were up 1.4% or more than $6 billion during the quarter. The rates that we paid on those deposits declined during the quarter to 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>As we look at credit and debit card purchase volume, volume had a seasonal decline of 6% from the fourth quarter, but increased 4% from a year ago. In U.S. credit card, new accounts grew by 19% from the first quarter a year ago. I would note that as we look at the U.S. credit cards, there's been a significant change in the way that we open new accounts. We're very focused on leveraging our franchise and online networks while scaling back what we do from a direct-mail perspective.</p>
          <p>Average loans during the quarter declined $5.6 billion from the fourth quarter, due to seasonality, divestitures that occurred at the end of the fourth quarter, as well as the continued runoff of our non-core portfolio.</p>
          <p>Lastly, within the card space, credit quality continued to improve, U.S. credit card losses improved for the tenth consecutive quarter, and the 30-plus day delinquency rate declined for the 12th consecutive quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 12 and looking at our Consumer Real Estate Services area, it reported a loss of $1.1 billion during the quarter. That loss was driven by the cost of managing delinquent and defaulted loans in the servicing portfolio, combined with costs associated with managing other legacy mortgage exposures.</p>
          <p>The Home Loans business, which is reported within the Consumer Real Estate Services segment, did record a profit of $115 million for the quarter. First mortgage originations of $15 billion were down from the fourth quarter due to our exit from the correspondent mortgaging business. Importantly, though, while our production volume was the lowest that we've seen in five quarters, production income before the negative impact of reps and warrants was the highest that we've seen in five quarters.</p>
          <p>Our results for the quarter include $282 million in costs for reps and warrants, primarily related to the GSEs, $313 million of litigation expenses, $410 million for expected assessments and waivers cost associated with our servicing operations, as well as overall increased cost related to our servicing operations.</p>
          <p>As you look at the MSR, our MSR asset increased by $211 million during the quarter, driven by higher rates and partially offset by borrower payments and model changes and ended the quarter at $7.6 billion. MSR results, net of hedge, were positive by approximately $200 million in the first quarter, and as you look at our capitalized MSR rate at the end of the quarter, it was at 58 basis points, versus 54 basis points in the fourth quarter and 95 basis points a year ago.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 13, some data that we want to talk about within our legacy assets and servicing area that's within the CRES segment. You can see on a linked quarter basis, as well as compared to the first quarter of a year ago, we continue to work hard to reduce the number of delinquent loans and find homeowners solutions. Keep in mind, Legacy Assets and Servicing now reflects all of our servicing operations and the results of our MSR activities.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we added more than 6,000 people, both employees as well as third party staffing in this area in the quarter alone. As we look at the results and as we look to drive down both the number of loans serviced as well as the number of delinquent loans, the number of first lien loans serviced dropped 3% in the quarter and more importantly, the number of 60-day-plus delinquent loans dropped 6%. Once again, we're very focused on driving the number of 60-plus-day delinquent loans down because as we drive those down, it will give us the ability to start reducing cost within the segment.</p>
          <p>In Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 14, earnings of $547 million more than doubled the results in the fourth quarter of 2011 as higher transactional activity and market levels drove higher revenue, while both expenses and credit costs were down for the quarter. Pre-tax margin for the quarter was strong at 19.8%. Client balances up 4.8% from the fourth quarter due to higher market levels while our long-term AUM net flows were $7.8 billion, the second highest that we've seen since the Merrill merger.</p>
          <p>Expenses declined versus the previous quarter due to the absence of certain fourth quarter items including litigation expense and other operating losses, FDIC, and severance expense.</p>
          <p>Net income in Global Banking, slide 15, was up 19% to $1.6 billion versus the fourth quarter and essentially flat with the first quarter of last year. Revenue increased 11% from the fourth quarter from higher investment banking fees, equity investment gains and income from leasing transactions.</p>
          <p>From a lending perspective, average loans were up slightly as 3% growth in our C&amp;I lending to both large corporate and commercial clients was offset by planned decreases in commercial real estate and the DFS portfolio, as well as trade finance.</p>
          <p>Average deposit balances at $238 billion declined 1% due to seasonal outflows, as well as certain liquidity management actions that we took. Despite that, our Treasury Services revenue remained strong at $1.6 billion up 3% from the fourth quarter and 8% from the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>Asset quality continued to improve from the fourth quarter, net charge-offs declined $133 million or 44%. Reservable utilized criticized exposure declined 10% to $18 billion and our NPAs dropped 11% to $4.1 billion.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 16, Investment Banking fees firm-wide, excluding self-led, were $1.2 billion up 20% from the fourth quarter as an increase in debt and equity underwriting fees were partially offset by a slowdown in overall M&amp;A activity.</p>
          <p>We were ranked number two globally in net investment banking fees for the quarter and about three-quarters of our fees in the quarter were driven by activity in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
          <p>Switching to Global Markets, on slide 17, net income of $798 million increased from a loss in the fourth quarter reflecting increased sales and trading activity during the quarter. Total revenue, ex-DVA was up $3.3 billion from the fourth quarter and in line with what we saw in the first quarter a year-ago.</p>
          <p>Expenses were up from the fourth quarter, driven by higher revenue, but down slightly from a year-ago. Excluding DVA, net income in the first quarter would have been in line with what we saw in the first quarter of last year. I think it's important, though, that when you look at that consistency in revenue and net income, it was done with risk-weighted assets that at period end were $192 billion, down $87 billion from a year-ago and average VaR in the quarter was $84 million down from $184 million a year-ago.</p>
          <p>Continuing with Global Markets on slide 18, sales and trading revenues ex-DVA losses increased $3.2 billion from the fourth quarter driven by our fixed income area due to improved market sentiment regarding the European financial crisis and an improved domestic outlook.</p>
          <p>FICC revenue, ex-DVA was three times the level in the fourth quarter as we experienced increases in almost all product areas. Versus a year ago, FICC revenue was up 12% ex-DVA, once again, due mainly to improvements in rates and currencies.</p>
          <p>In equities, excluding DVA, results increased 62% from the fourth quarter driven by increased derivative revenues. However, if we look back compared to a year-ago, equity results were down about 18% due to lower overall market volumes. Once again, we recorded DVA losses of $1.434 billion in the fourth quarter as our credit spreads tightened during the quarter and that compares to losses of $474 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $357 million in the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, we show you the results of all other, which once again includes our Global Principal Investments business, the non-U.S. Consumer Card business, our discretionary portfolio that's associated with interest rate risk management, insurance and the discontinued real estate portfolio. The $4 billion decline in net income versus the prior quarter was driven by the selected items that are listed on the slide, along with litigation expense of $480 million. One other item in all other that on the income statement flows through insurance revenue is an additional reserve of $200 million that relates to the payment protection insurance claims that we accrued for in the U.K.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 20, total expenses were down from the first quarter a year ago and except for all other, expenses are down year-to-year, in part demonstrating our focus on efficiency across the entire company, as well as the initial impact that we've begun to see from the first phase of our New BAC efforts. If we exclude LAS, FTE head count for March was down approximately 5,600 people from December and down approximately 20,000 from a year ago. Compared to the fourth quarter expense increases were, for the most part, isolated to increases and performance-related incentive expense, LAS cost, as well as business performance.</p>
          <p>While I'm talking about expenses, let me spend just a moment on taxes. We would expect the effective tax rate for 2012 to approach 30% excluding any unusual items. Embedded in that 30% or approaching 30% estimate is that we do anticipate another U.K. tax rate reduction of 2% to be enacted in the third quarter of 2012 which should result in a tax charge at that time of about $800 million and remember, though, due to our DTA disallowance, that $800 million charge will not impact our regulatory capital ratios.</p>
          <p>If we switch to credit quality, on slide 21. Overall consumer credit trends remain positive. Net charge-offs in the consumer portfolio increased during the quarter, but it was due to the absence of approximately $289 million in recoveries in the fourth quarter related to the sale of previously charged off U.K. credit card loans. Excluding those recoveries in the fourth quarter net charge-offs would have been down by about 6%. 30% or 30 plus day performing delinquencies continue to drop and provision expense in consumer for the quarter was $2.6 billion and included a $1.1 billion reserve reduction.</p>
          <p>On slide 22 we show the non-performing asset trends for both residential mortgage as well as home equity. Residential mortgage NPAs were down 6% from the end of the year as pay downs, charge-offs, as well as returns to performing status continued to outpace new non-accrual loans. Home equity non-performers did increase from year-end due to the impact of interagency guidance to reclassify to non-performing status, junior lien loans that have a first lien loan 90 days or more past due. This regulatory agency guidance resulted in an additional $1.9 billion of home equity loans being moved to NPAs. We have not restated prior periods.</p>
          <p>As you think about that change, it's important to note that it did not have any impact on our allowance or provision expense, as we track the underlying first lien delinquency status of our junior lien home equity loans and have previously considered the additional risk that these loans present within our reserving process. If we back out this change, home equity NPAs were relatively flat for the quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 23 you can see that residential mortgage and home equity 30- to 89-day performing delinquent loans, excluding fully insured loans, were both down. Of the $364 million decline in home equity $264 million of that was due to the reclassification to non-performing due to the impact of the interagency guidance that I just mentioned. While we typically see strong collections in the first quarter and while we believe that pace may slow, we would still expect improvement going forward.</p>
          <p>If we turn to slide 24, commercial credit trends, we saw improving trends, as I mentioned when discussing the results within our Global Banking area. Including the provision for unfunded commitments we recorded a benefit to provision expense of $226 million that did include a reserve reduction of $595 million.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, both non-performing assets and reservable criticized levels showed declines of 10% on a linked quarter basis.</p>
          <p>And as I wrap up my part of the presentation before moving to questions, I would just close with four comments. We feel very good about the progress that we made in the operating performances of the different lines of business. We've closed the first quarter with record levels of both capital and liquidity and we achieved this while lowering the overall risk profile of the company, and as we go forward, given the operating environment that we're in, we're very focused on continuing to drive expense levels down during the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>And with that, we'll go ahead and take questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes to us today from Glenn Schorr with Nomura. Please go ahead, your line is open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much. Maybe we could get a little more granularity on FICC. The trading numbers were great pretty much across the board, big turnaround from last quarter. I want to talk about which pieces of the franchise you thought were strongest and maybe any help you can give us on the positioning coming into the quarter so we think about the rest of the year the right way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mm-hmm, sure. If you look at and think about the numbers that we gave you, within FICC, I mentioned on both a &#x2013; or on an absolute dollar basis, clearly the most significant area that we saw was rates and currencies. Client flows were very strong and we saw them in two areas. We saw them within Europe with some of the volatility of the markets in Europe, activities were very high. And the second thing I would say is that within the FICC business, as you think about the high levels of activity that we saw in the investment-grade bond area, that translated into opportunities to do more business with our corporate customers and that contributed to the results in FICC as well.</p>
          <p>Outside of FICC, the other areas that had nice increases during the quarter included our commodities area, which we've been focused on starting to get some traction in the growth there, as well as in the mortgage area. Those were the three most significant areas, Glenn. I'd say the other area that was down a touch during the quarter would have been the overall loan trading area as some of the revenue opportunities given that the new issue business in loans was a little bit slower this quarter than a year-ago quarter. We didn't see quite the opportunities there, but at the same time, that area performed very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to put words in your mouth, but sounds like it was a pretty cash-driven business, flow as well, as opposed to the derivative side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glenn, I think if you think over the last 24 months, Tom and the team have continued to build out the breath of our platform across the world and we're reaping the benefits of that. So if you think about this quarter this year versus last year, all the prop trading was closed out by mid last year, etcetera, and then so that it's really client flows driving this. Now this is driven by really, as you said, less derivative but more client flows, more of the new issue activity, more of the cash businesses. It's a very core aspect of what we do. So next quarter, if this is a strong quarter in total revenues, it may not be as strong, but the way we're getting there is very consistent quarter after quarter after quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate that. Bruce, I wonder if you could just explain a drop more, give a little color on the one-third of the RWA reduction that was the optimization of off balance sheet OTC assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. If you go through that area, I'd say we continue to work very hard in scrubbing the data. There were certain lending activities that we do that are secured lending activities that as we work through, we have the ability to optimize from an RWA perspective. So we had some of that. I would say, as we look to and we refine what we do in the markets business, we improve the ability to net as we consolidated certain trading type activities. And we also worked through and got third party ratings on certain of the things which improved that as well. So we continue to be very focused and think we've gotten through the majority of the optimization associated with Basel I. As I referenced in the increase in our guidance we're very focused now on optimizing the balance sheet and looking to drive those Basel III ratios higher as we go throughout the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last one for me. Reps and warranty claims continue to rise. Just curious if you can give us an overall comment on a, what's driving it and b, when we might see a leveling off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what I would say on that, Glenn, I would say it's really consistent with what we talked about when we discussed year-end numbers and with the disclosures that are in the slides, the majority of the increase in the backlog of reps and warrants is in the GSE category. It largely relates to Fannie Mae. And if you saw and compared the balance at the third &#x2013; at the end of the third quarter of 2011 with the balance at the end of the first quarter you would see that the majority &#x2013; a substantial amount of the amounts that are coming in are for borrowers that have paid well north of 24 months. And we obviously continue to have a disagreement with them about whose responsibility those are.</p>

          <p>And we'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we could drill down a little bit more on the expense side. You mentioned the legacy mortgage costs start to come down in the back half of this year. Obviously the New BAC cost saves will probably start to accelerate. When we put that all together how do you envision the expenses trending both for second quarter and then maybe as we exit this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say as you think about that and as you think &#x2013; let's spend a moment just on what we saw during the fourth quarter, and I think there are two items to note in the fourth quarter when you think of expenses.</p>
          <p>The $900 million that I referenced is related &#x2013; as it relates to compensation-related expense. That obviously, as I said, only occurs in the first quarter of each year. So as you look out at &#x2013; over the next group of quarters, that will obviously no longer be there.</p>
          <p>The second thing, when you think about expenses for the quarter, over and above that FAS 123 amount, the expense number for the quarter was up, given that the accruals that we had, based on the strong performance within the overall markets area.</p>
          <p>So I think I would level-set with those two areas, as well as think about some of the mortgage-related charges that I'd referenced, that the goal is as we work through the year that those would come down.</p>
          <p>Once you move away from those expenses, you move to the New BAC expenses. If you think about New BAC I, we had originally given guidance that it was $5 billion, 20% of which we would recognize during 2012. We obviously took that guidance up and said it would be greater than 20%. So as you look at those consumer businesses on the line of business slide that we gave you, you would expect to continue to see those expenses going down.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we're in the midst of New BAC II, which we look to wrap up in the May timeframe. And I would just reiterate what we've said there, which is that we don't think the expenses will be as great as what we saw in New BAC I, although once again, given that they're not as interdependent on technology, we look to see those expense savings to start as early as the end of this year.</p>
          <p>So I'd say that it's &#x2013; we continue to press through these. I think we wanted to show you the line of business breakdown because I think it gives you a good sense within each of the lines of business, outside of what we're seeing in LAS, which Brian talked to about the second half of this year, seeing savings, as well as all other, which can be lumpy, to the extent that there are non-recurring type items showing up, that you get a sense for where we're trying to go.</p>
          <p>But clearly we would expect sequentially, each quarter during 2012, for expenses to go down each of the next three quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as we think about some of the lumpy items, like the litigation, the mortgage rate assessments, and maybe any restructuring or severance costs for New BAC parts I and II, any thoughts on the magnitude and timing of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean I think one of the things to keep in mind is that as we've gone through and as we're going through New BAC, we've been absorbing through the P&amp;L the severance cost that goes along with the actions we've taken.</p>
          <p>So if you go back to the fourth quarter, we talked about there being a couple hundred million dollars of severance and related items that we took during the fourth quarter. We had roughly $100 million of those type items that we saw during the first quarter for severance.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the other items, you know, the only thing I can really say about the lumpy items is that each quarter we accrue them and true them up for what we think our best views are, and we'll continue to do that. So it's hard to give any specific guidance about what we may or may not see in any one quarter, recognizing that the accruals that we have on the balance sheet at this point are significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just separately on the capital side, obviously the build over the last two quarters has been very impressive, much more than many of us, including myself, had thought. As we start kind of hearing you guys talk about additional changes from here, whether it's like some branch sales or there was something in the media the other day about you guys potentially looking at selling the non-U.S. wealth management, as we see those things potentially coming up, is that still about a goal of building capital or is it much more about kind of rationalizing the franchise as Brian mentioned earlier? How do we think about what's driving the motivation for some of these actions that you might be doing or might be being speculated out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Without addressing speculation, if you look across the last two years, Matt, our goal is to get the franchise against the three customer groups and get out of the businesses which don't do that. Everything we've been doing is consistent with that. Does it contribute to capital? Yes.</p>
          <p>I'd say you shouldn't expect the things in the future to have as much impact as the things we did in the last couple years, increment on capital &#x2013; and a lot of the capital generation really comes from the earnings. In the case of Basel III, remember that our biggest difference between our peers is the deductions for disallowed DTA, et cetera, which accrete off over time.</p>
          <p>And then the third thing is continuing to optimize the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So when we're making decisions about various aspects, whether it was Canadian card or something like that, it is in line with the strategy, which is that everything we have will be direct to customers, focused on those customers and where we have competitive strength.</p>
          <p>And then <mark type="ph" /> brace (47:00) as I talked about earlier, it's really fine tuning the franchise, that we have top positions in the top 30 markets, a lot higher than other people by numbers of branches and things like that, and continuing to enhance that position, continuing to build out markets behind that. But also focus a little bit more on the markets that there's growth potential and size and scale that we can take advantage of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hey. Thanks. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Betsy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple follow-ups. One is on the New BAC II. I'm sure you're going into this with a number in your head, and given the first quarter strength, would you be inclined to be kind of taking that down relative to what you had been expecting? I would think you could make arguments for less pull back than maybe you'd thought before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one of the things, Betsy, that we're very focused on is, given that the environment, relative to when we would have started New BAC I, has started to improve a little bit, we're very focused on not taking a step back but continuing to drive what we saw in both New BAC I as well as New BAC II.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind, a lot of what New BAC is relates to simplification, it relates to getting rid of work that doesn't need to be done, and it relates to becoming more efficient. So while I think clearly on the margin this quarter you feel better about the overall sales and trading opportunity, it's not going to change the rigor and discipline with which we go through New BAC II. And once again, we think given that we don't have as much technology, we'll be able to get after those costs quicker than what we saw in New BAC I.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I think is important, and even though it's not part of New BAC, if you look at both the global banking as well as the global markets expense levels, you read some about the reductions that we made during the third and fourth quarters of last year, outside of the New BAC process. And you start to see some of the benefits of those flowing through. And you'll see more of those next quarter, as the people actually come off the payroll.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then separately on page 9, you go through the NII. Could you just give a little more color around the hedge that you've got? I know you've got one on the AFS portfolio. And give us a sense as to how you're managing that right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, largely, a lot of those tend to be more pay-fixed. So I think if you look at the variability, they will bounce around a little bit, depending on where the rate curve is. But I think if you look out over the last couple quarters, they tend to be within a range of several hundred million dollars. And they've been relatively fixed within that range, and that's why we wanted to give you the guidance so you could get a sense as to what the core NII was, backing out any changes that happened due to those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you haven't changed the size of that, that much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at all. And indeed, I would say the other thing we're very focused on is managing the interest rate risk, as we look out to Basel III, given that OCI will flow through capital. We've been, I think, very conservative in making sure that we manage this in a way so that at some point in time, when rates start to move up, that we don't have an OCI hit through that investment portfolio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you very much. On your home equity portfolio, I know it's been &#x2013; a lot of stuff has been new guidance out on &#x2013; pushed on recognizing in NPAs, some of those loans that &#x2013; where the first has defaulted. What do you do when you've modified the first? Can you talk a little bit about do you &#x2013; how do you treat the seconds? Do you modify the seconds also with the first? And how do you classify those seconds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think there's a couple different ways to look at that, Paul. But let me spend just a moment &#x2013; I'm glad you asked about the seconds behind delinquent firsts.</p>
          <p>If you go back and look at the disclosure that we put out at year-end with respect to our seconds behind delinquent first, you'll see that at year-end, as we took a look and did the work, we had roughly $2.5 billion of current seconds that were behind delinquent firsts.</p>
          <p>Throughout the quarter, as we continue to work with &#x2013; and keep in mind, the majority of our home equity portfolio, where you have the first behind delinquent firsts, we do not have the first. So we need to work through the credit bureaus to understand exactly what the status of that first is. And as we've worked through and done more and worked with the credit bureaus to understand those seconds behind delinquent firsts, that the guidance and when we adjusted up our non-performers to the $1.9 billion, that's an improvement from what we saw at year-end of the $2.5 billion that's out there.</p>
          <p>I would say, secondly, as you think about &#x2013; and what we do through the reserving process with respect to both firsts and seconds, even though we may have &#x2013; and we obviously changed the way that the non-performers are reported this quarter &#x2013; but we are very cognizant, when we look at and have both our formulaic models as well as the imprecision reserves that we overlay on our portfolio, that to the extent that you have seconds that have a delinquent first, we are going to adjust our assumptions to be conservative as it relates to where we feel like we're reserved.</p>
          <p>And I think this new guidance as we came out and as we worked through it at the end of the quarter, and updated, we feel very good about where we were at the end of the first quarter relative to year-end.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I would say when you ask about the different home equity portfolios is if you go back to slides 34 and slides 35 that we have in the investor deck, I think there are a couple of important things to point out.</p>
          <p>The first is, if you just go Q4 2011 to Q1 2012, you can see that we continue to see fairly significant pay downs within our home equity portfolio. And I think importantly, if you look at the overall FICO scores, as we've updated and worked through the FICO models, that the refreshed FICO on our home equity portfolio is now at 742.</p>
          <p>So I think across the board with what we've seen in the quarter, while I think we're very sensitive too that there's not the growth that we'd all like yet in the economy, we've been very focused on the home equity portfolio. And so far, during the first quarter, it's performed better than we would have expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the other thing to add to that is two things. One is, think of everything that's been originated now for four or five years has been originated under fairly conservative &#x2013; very conservative standards than traditional, going through the early 2000s. So everything that's been added to the portfolio is very carefully underwritten.</p>
          <p>And then second is at the end of the day, ultimately the cash is the cash. Ultimately the person either doesn't pay or pays on their first. Ultimately that first goes through a liquidation. Ultimately the second is dealt with in that liquidation and the proceeds come in. So moving around the timing of reporting is one thing, but ultimately over a period of the course of months and quarters, the cash becomes the cash.</p>
          <p>And so what's reflected, if you look at some of these long term &#x2013; on page 23 in these charts, as you can see activity's been going on for many years now. And the simple matter is, each quarter it gets incrementally better. And this is the part of our portfolio where we're still doing the most work because this is the slowest to fully recover. If you compared it against the card business or other businesses that fully are recovered, and continue to have more upside, this will take us longer just because of the nature of the process. But it's a lot of talk about this, but ultimately it comes through in terms of the cash is the cash.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That's a really great update and I appreciate it, but going back to the question, part of the question was how do you treat modified loans? When you modify the first, what type of activity do you take on the second? And then how do you classify that second lien?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if there's &#x2013; up until the change in the guidance, if you have a second lien that's current and you have a first lien that's delinquent or been modified, you're not going to adjust the second.</p>
          <p>What the new guidance now provides is that if you have a first lien that's more than 90 days &#x2013; so as you look at the March balance sheet, if we have a first lien loan that's more than 90 days past due, we are now characterizing the second lien as a non-performer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you modify, like under these various modification programs, and if you modify the first, would you modify the second also? And then would you classify that as a current or TDR or a non-performing loan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult. You have to realize, Paul, that there are two different situations that we have. We have situations where we have both the first and the second, and then we have situations where we have the second, and somebody else may have the first.</p>
          <p>I think the important thing to keep in mind is that, as we went through and came up with this non-performing data, we only take somebody off or only look at a loan where there's a non-performing aspect to it. It only gets cleaned up by virtue of the Credit Bureau after they've been current for a year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Brian, one of the things that you emphasized was improvements in the core businesses. Could you just give us some color on the businesses that are meeting or exceeding expectations, versus those that are lagging? And what you're doing or may be doing in the lagging businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you think about the business across the five segments, in the consumer area, I'd say that we're very encouraged by the initial results and things, like I said, about the mobile banking enrollments and things like that, which help us reduce the cost structure in the general retail business as we call it. So we need to improve that business. All the regulatory changes that are well-known to you, Nancy, over the last couple years, took away a lot of profit, and in the interest rate environment which we're all familiar with.</p>
          <p>The reality is, if you look at the underlying customer dynamics, we're seeing improvements in online, mobile, the ability to fine-tune the branches, the cost of the branches per dollar deposit, which is a metric I look at, has improved and dropped again this quarter. The rates paid on deposits continue to work their way down. So it's improving, but it's still at the $300 million to $400 million of profit. You can see, in the core consumer deposit business we need to make upside from there.</p>
          <p>Now, let me flip to the place we're having good success there, on the preferred side of that business, which the 8 million consumers that have higher annual incomes and a little bit more with us, we're seeing great uptake in the service model we created, which is differentiated service model, and the FSAs we put in the branches, which are financial advisors in branches, which do two things. One is they serve clients who are below the threshold for the affluent group and they also refer clients into the affluent group. The mortgage officers working with those groups in the branches have been designated preferred branches. We're seeing great uptake there and strong growth and strong penetration across &#x2013; you can see in the Merrill Edge assets growing year-over-year. You can see in the flows of customer accounts. So that we're very excited about. So retail mass market is more fine-tuning the delivery system and continuing to get incremental growth there, but the preferred is going well.</p>
          <p>The wealth management business I think is performing very well, $500 million of profit. Look at the margins are better than anybody in the industry. We continue to see that.</p>
          <p>In the core Commercial Banking business, the Global Banking segment was put together to highlight that the &#x2013; that business with $1.6 billion in profits is fairly steady, provides good returns on a very capital-intensive business. Obviously the lending has shaved off its commercial real estate exposure, continues to perform and return above the cost of capital.</p>
          <p>If we were talking last quarter, we'd be talking about the Global Banking business needing to recover, and we saw it this quarter.</p>
          <p>So as you look across, a lot of work to do in mortgage, and I won't take you through that. Work to do on the core consumer retail franchise, optimizing the cost. But a lot of that progress is taking place. And we've sort of seen the bottom, I think, sort of last year as the final vestiges of Durbin came through. Seeing that come up.</p>
          <p>And then across sort of the relationship business and Wealth Management, in the preferred segment of Consumer, Wealth Management and Global Banking, seeing strong, steady profits. And then Global Banking &#x2013; Global Markets, we saw a nice recovery. So we're excited about that. That all poured through as we removed the cloud of the mortgage business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Bruce, a question for you. The core margin, ex the market-related assets, I think has hit 3% again. Is that maintainable? And if I could just ask you to speculate or forecast, I mean when we get back to a more normal rate environment, what is an achievable sort of normalized margin for the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I'd make a couple observations. I think when you look at &#x2013; and what we've talked about before was that as we think about 2012 and as we talked about year-end, as you think about 2012, the amount of NII we're reporting I think is a pretty good range, if you back out, either plus or minus what we saw from hedge and prepay.</p>
          <p>I think, though, if you look out at core margin and you think at about where we are, there's nothing over time, once the rate environment changes, with the exception of having less credit card in the portfolio that would change what we've been able to achieve historically in margins, with one exception.</p>
          <p>And the one exception that we're very focused on, and one of the biggest opportunities we have with core margin, is to continue to shrink the debt footprint that we have of the company. And when you think about the $35 billion in maturities that we have in the first quarter, or excuse me, in the second quarter of this year as well as the amount of liquidity we have, that outside the core businesses that we have where you can kind of project what the yields are, the biggest opportunity we have to drive that down is using the liquidity to shrink the debt footprint which, on average as we repay that, tends to be 300 and 400 basis points on a floating basis relative to the underlying LIBOR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Nancy, if you look at the long-term average, it's been closer to three across time. Assume that the mix of the assets may shift, so say it's somewhere below that, but from the 250-ish we kind of run at now to we've told you before 275, should be easily within range with a short-term rate that moves up 100 basis points or so. And we still feel comfortable that's the mix of business we have. And in fact we may have tightened that a little bit as we've tightened down the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Bruce, just following up on that last point, just sounds like for this year net interest income was $11 billion this quarter. It sounds like you're kind of running in place perhaps the next couple quarters unless something changes on the rate front or loan growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's fair, John. I think &#x2013; just realize, though, that when you look at that, think you look at the quarter, but think a little about the benefit that we had during the quarter from the prepay and the hedges, I would not assume that that's in the run rate during the next couple quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was that a benefit or just a lack of a negative compared to last quarter? Was it a positive benefit this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was both. It was a negative that swung to a positive during the quarter. And like I said, on a linked-quarter business, it was about $500 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about just how much it was as a net positive this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe it was in the mid-300s, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on credit, what kind of outlook do you have on the ability to keep up the current pace of reserve release? Do you expect the size of the reserve release to come down going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think as we look out at, and we look at the models, John, I think the right way to think about it is that we would expect that charge-offs would continue to decline as we go throughout 2012 quarter-over-quarter. And I think what you're likely to see is that the benefit from reduced charge-offs is probably going to be more or less offset by lower reserve releases. So as you look at the overall provision number going forward over the next three quarters, while there may be a little bit of variability, I think that'll be a pretty good proxy for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one little nitpick question. In the first quarter the diluted share count declined by about 300 million shares even though the stock price went up. You issued shares to employees. Is that impacted by the Buffett warrants? Or why would it have gone down this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You've got two different things going on. And the simplest way that I can say it, John, is that in a quarter where on a reported basis that we're north of $0.11 or $0.12 on a reported basis, you're going to see the Buffett shares in and on a reported basis when we're below they're out. So as you think about this quarter, given the impact of DVA and FPO and what it did to EPS, they were out. And then obviously part of the reason why they were up a little bit in the quarter was because of some of the exchanges that we did throughout the fourth quarter of last year as well as the employee shares that were issued during the first quarter. Those are the things that comprised the difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But &#x2013; so those things were overwhelmed by the Buffett coming out this quarter because of the reported earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one last follow-up on expenses, the LAS this quarter was 3.3. First, did you say that you think those have peaked? And then second, given that it's kind of a restated number now with the restatement, what's a good eventual number for LAS, do you think, longer term? I think previously you had said maybe a few hundred million per quarter, kind of a normal servicing over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we said it was sort of a 500 a quarter, is more of a normal servicing based on our estimates of what our portfolio would be at that level. So.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's still the case the way it's stated now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, John, we're seeing the &#x2013; if you look at the slide it'll show you sort of the work is about the delinquent loans and you're seeing those drop, and we'll see those come down. As we've said it'll take us the rest of this year and into next year, probably through next year to get it more normalized. But we're very encouraged by the amount of work that's getting done and the staffing levels we have. Just so people are clear, we talked about the 40-ish thousand employees we have here. We also have around 10,000 to 15,000 contractors that work in this business. So if you think about our total head count think of how much of our 278, 40,000 deployed against this. So when this comes down it will have a significant impact on the company's activities on a day-to-day basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify that, Brian, you aren't expecting to get from $3 billion to a couple hundred million in a year, right? That's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'll take us this year, next year, and then it'll really show up in 2014. It'll keep coming down during those timeframes, but I expect normal to really get behind this is probably into 2014, just because we'll get the activities down. It'll take us a little while to shape it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the last thing from me is, Bruce, on the assessment of waivers back up to 410. Why is that up so much? Is this the reserve and it's related to your dispute with Fannie Mae?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were a couple of things. There was a chunk that we had, that when we looked at that we set aside for reserves on servicing advances and there were other assessment-type things like you'd expect with Fannie Mae. So think about it in those two different contexts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is that something that you have an outlook on that could continue at that level? Or is it just impossible to predict?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would not expect it to continue at that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So somewhere between 0 and 400?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitionally that's correct.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question was on loan growth. And I see global banking loans are flat and G1 loans are flat and consumer is down, and it looks like some sort of deceleration. So are you seeing a swap from at least the large loans to the capital markets? Or how do you describe what's taking place there? A slowdown in the U.S. economy? Are you deliberately backing away from some credits? Any color you can give would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think what I'd say there's a couple things on that, Mike. The first is that we have a very strong, both commercial and corporate franchise. And obviously we're very focused and especially given where we've built capital levels now, as we go forward to look to build off and to grow traditional C&amp;I loans both within the commercial as well as the overall corporate bank. I think when you look at &#x2013; and two of the things &#x2013; three of the things that I referenced that were slight offsets that we made a decision on during the quarter is that we've continued to work through and we've got our commercial real estate lending down to an area that we feel good about.</p>
          <p>So going forward you wouldn't expect to see the reductions in commercial real estate that you've soon over the last couple quarters. The second thing I'd say is that we did, during the quarter, given what the market opportunity was and where pricing and securitization pricing was, to securitize some of our DFS assets out in the market which led to some of the reductions. That's something that was opportunistic and quite frankly gives us a base to be able to go out and grow and do more with our customers on.</p>
          <p>The third thing that was a little bit lighter relative to year end was on the trade finance side, that will ebb and flow, but as we've talked about before, we're focused on growing the international footprint as well.</p>
          <p>I think while on the overall, from an average balance sheet perspective, it looked kind of flattish, we did see some growth within the areas that we're focused and those areas that there are reductions, we feel like we're generally down to and have done the things we want to do to the point where we can start growing off that base.</p>
          <p>If you move to the consumer space, I would just note, a couple things, as people look at loans in the consumer space, obviously as we look at the home equity business that the balances were down about $3.5 billion in home equity. We clearly are not doing a lot of new home equity lending now. The fact that those balances are going down, we view as a very good thing.</p>
          <p>The second thing is if you look at our supplement, you'll see that the residential mortgage area is coming down. Keep in mind, that's not due to residential mortgages that we're originating, as we look to manage the overall risk profile and interest rate profile. There's a constant look at, do we want to own whole loans or do we want to own securities and at the end of the quarter, at the first quarter, we were a little bit more into securities than whole loans.</p>
          <p>And then the last thing I would say on loan balances, just within the card business, that seasonally card balances obviously tend to peak in the fourth quarter, so the declines you saw in the card business in the first quarter were largely seasonal</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just one follow-up. It seems as though your market share in cards and mortgages has declined. Do you agree or disagree? And if you agree, is this a deliberate move? Are you underperforming what you'd like to achieve or is this simply prudent given what you're seeing in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, if you look at &#x2013; let's take mortgage first, if you look at the fourth quarter, we did about $15 billion of direct-to-consumer originations and in the first quarter we did about the same. The real steep drop in, "Our market share," has been on the correspondent side just going to zero. If you look year-over-year, it dropped 20-odd billion dollars in production. That is an absolute deliberate move. We will move &#x2013; we will be in a direct-to-retail channel for both our general customers and also our affluent and wealthy customers, it's the business we think we have an advantage in and we'll continue to drive that.</p>
          <p>That being said, as we retool that business, we underperformed on the direct-to-retail. We expect that, as we move through each quarter, each month of the quarter, we saw improved results and just straight volumes and we've added more loan officers, we focused the people, they're getting several thousand in the quarter of referrals from the branches and working with the teammates there.</p>
          <p>We've staffed up on fulfillment side, increased our throughput. Remember there's some noise about a reservation system earlier on. We underperformed, but we're doing exactly what we wanted which is to focus on direct-to-retail. The team is working hard, David Darnell and the team. You'll see us improve there. The correspondent is behind this and you know as I said, if want that business back, go out and buy it in the market, it's not actually a customer-driven business in the way we look at businesses here in the company.</p>
          <p>When you go into the card business, I think we've been continuing to fine tune and have sold off some portfolios where we were providing the card as a backbone to other companies, meaning other financial companies, and we sold those portfolios back to them as part of fine-tuning the business. I'd say that we have performed as anticipated in card, but we brought the direct mail down.</p>
          <p>This quarter we did 800,000 new cards, as I said, half through the branch system with a credit quality as you can see in our numbers which is outperforming what we would have expected as we put the cards on over the last couple years. We should expect to hold our share there and start to drive it, but we still are in the straight raw market competitiveness of 15% versus 16%, something like that, in the fourth quarter. It really is based on us continuing to shape the affinity groups and some of the vestiges in the U.S. business of the past. But, you should expect that to stabilize now and start to grow. That's been a strategy we told you we would start in 2009 honestly and it's behaving the way we said. That being said, there's plenty of opportunity for us to drive the card business in our franchise. We have the 800,000 new originations, the million Bank of America cash 1, 2, 3, cards. We will drive that business back up but again it'll be focused on the customers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted real quick to hit on the tax rate. I got to 9% for the quarter. Is that right? And what's driving that? And were there any unusual items in there, that when you hit on your 30% tax rate for the year, we should sort of consider when we think about full year tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the thing when you look at taxes for the first quarter that you have to keep in mind is that because of the large DVA and FBO charges that went through the P&amp;L, the pre-tax income after those charges was reduced so you have a couple preference items in the first quarter that when they're compared on a book basis to a relatively low pre-tax income number, it tends to distort the effective tax rate. So as we &#x2013; and I just say what I said during the presentation, as you have a more normalized quarter without the DVA and the FBO, we would expect the rate for the year to approach 30%. And the one unusual item that I would note in that rate approaching 30% is that we'll have the $800 million adjustment for the U.K. tax rate, given that the tax rate's going down in a jurisdiction where we have a DTA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on rep and warranties, it seems as though there's a new lower level of provision that you guys tend to be running at, which really reflects BofA's view, yet we've got steadily increasing Fannie claims. And I'm just kind of curious how those resolve themselves? And maybe also how much of those claims are tied to MI through rescissions or cancellations of insurance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean at this point I'd say a couple things, the first is that as we talked about both at year-end and this quarter, we continue to adjust and provide reserves for the MI rescission and continue to work through that process with not only Fannie, but other places where MI is topical and our reserves reflect that.</p>
          <p>I think with respect to your original question, as it relates to reps and warrants, we obviously look at and provide the rep and warrant each quarter based on what we're seeing and based on our interpretation of the documents which, I can assure you, we've had numerous people look at and feel very strongly with where we are. And I don't think it's probably appropriate for me to reflect or to comment on what Fannie's view on that may be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, sure. That's fair. I guess I'm just trying to understand, as far as the MI impact is concerned, is it that BofA is providing the rep and warrant that valid insurance exists and then therefore the GSE has a claim against BofA? And then BofA has to go pursue that actual &#x2013; has then a claim against the MI? So can you help me understand how that works?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right, and in our disclosure we talk about in certain cases where we do need to go and pursue and work with the different reinsurers to get the re &#x2013; the payments that we're due and what I would say is that each quarter as we go through this, the reserves that we put up as it relates to the risk of mortgage rescission, the reserves apply both to the GSEs or anywhere else that, that could be a risk for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And they would reflect, if there's any deterioration in counter party, those reserves would reflect that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, great. And then last for me on capital markets, you made some comments about VaR, but just if you could talk about maybe what happened with risk in the quarter, did you guys take on risk, particularly in FICC? Which, given what happened, if you took it on in the beginning of quarter certainly would have worked out well. And then maybe give us an idea of how much of a tailwind for FICC you guys benefited as far as the tightening credit spread environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A couple things. The first thing that I would say is that the, as I referenced, the largest driver in the FICC business this quarter was our rates and currencies area. And that strength that we saw in the quarter was due solely, or due largely I guess I would say, to client flows where we were doing more with our clients during the quarter. So that is good core flow business for us that we saw during the quarter, and I think that if you look at both the risk weighted assets and the VaR, they support that, in that what we're saying we're able to take less risk and make &#x2013; and if you look at both RWA as well as VaR, they were roughly half of what they were a year-ago, and we were still able to generate the same level of revenue.</p>
          <p>When you think about that revenue number and you think about the level of risk, what it's reflective of is the fact that our client facing businesses during the first quarter were very strong and I think &#x2013; the only other thing I'd say is that, as we've continued to build the balance sheet, build capital, and as we've seen our credit spreads tighten, the one thing I would say is that we are seeing more and more people that are doing more and more business with us. We feel very good about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear, we haven't changed the limits this business operates under in seven or eight quarters. The ability to do what they need to do to participate in the markets is there and they're making choices based on opportunities and capabilities that they have to do it and they're well within the risk measures in producing as much revenues. So I think the team is doing a great job of really driving the business along the way you would want them to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it sure looks that way. Thanks for the color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>We'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a follow-up on the GSE activity, two separate points, first of all, with all &#x2013; despite all the rhetoric about the GSEs kind of expanding what they're looking at, it looks like this quarter actually had a smaller kind of new claims from the GSEs than the last, at least the previous four, but at the same time your kind of activity either approving repurchases or rescinding them were both kind of much, much lower. Could you talk about what's going on there and what it's going to take to get some more of this resolved as we go forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is generally in any one quarter it can bounce around a little bit but just to reiterate, I'd say the activity that we saw during the first quarter was not significantly inconsistent with what we saw during the fourth quarter. But, you're right, the data you just quoted, you would expect to see the number of repurchases as a percentage to decline to the extent that you'd disagree with what's coming in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Moshe, you're assuming that a loan is &#x2013; every quarter for the last ten quarters exactly what they sent in is the same, what's happened is, it's different and so the result of the activity is different because what's being sent is different. It's not that the volume's different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Couple of other quick things, first, actually you mentioned before the correspondent business and the mortgage business kind of being focused on the core Bank of America customer, is there any thought about thinking about that in the credit card business as well and doing something with some of the affinity business and the national credit card business that doesn't kind of overlap with your customer base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear, the correspondent business is out of the mortgage business, so it's a direct to retail business. In the card business we have an affinity group. We've narrowed that group of affinities over the last three years to be consistent with where we think it adds value to the customer and to the company and so we have major affinity programs which are very valuable to us that we continue to drive growth in. What we've done is pared off several thousand programs which the economics just didn't make sense. We have achieved that. Those are affinities with big brands that we benefit by as a company as opposed to affinities, frankly where we are providing a credit card for another financial institution to provide as a core product to their customers. That's what we've really gotten out of and then smaller groups that just didn't have the volumes enough to make sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great and just one quick last thing and that is, obviously some terrific progress on the capital front, I didn't catch if you had said this before, but do you have, and expectation &#x2013; have you changed your expectation of year-end, risk-weighted assets under Basel III? Has the improvement been more from the numerator or is it denominator-driven also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at it, it's going to be a little bit of both. Because as I referenced, as you think about what we got through and once again under both Basel I as well as Basel III we are in a disallowance under Basel I of DTA and then Basel III we're over the 15% sin bucket. So as we generate net income and as you think about the piece that's FBO, not being in it, the numerator's benefiting and then secondarily, the denominator, as we continue to work through and optimize, it will improve. We obviously have taken the guidance on Basel III at year-end fully phased in, up above 7.5%. We will look to give you greater detail on both numerator and denominator when we look at Basel III at the end of the second quarter.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks. I have a question on LIBOR, there's been some ruckus overseas on how it's set and regulators being concerned about potential I guess issues with how it's set.

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just want to circle back on the margin, NII commentary. In terms of, I think you're basically saying that we should think about NII basically holding. But I want to go back, this quarter you had the benefit that's not going to repeat, but then what were the drags? Again, you had mentioned earlier, maybe I missed it in terms of some consumer yield pressure, but then is there also core asset yield pressure because of the low rate environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the biggest thing, Andrew if you think about it was that the, and keep in mind, we're thinking of NII now not pre-tax income, the biggest difference in the quarter that was a drag was the fact that we had over $8 billion of Card receivables from the Canadian Card business. But that sale closed at the beginning of December. So as you think sequentially and you think about those consumer balances and consumer yields, that was the biggest piece of it. And obviously the number that we put out there was that it was to the tune of about $400 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then in terms of outside of that, commercial pricing competition, asset yield pricing, asset yield pressure. Is that manageable it seems like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's manageable, I think the only other thing that I would say is that as you look out at NII and when you run the size of the investment portfolio that we want run from a rate management perspective as rates bounce around and as some of those mortgage and other type securities yields either go up or down, will fluctuate with that, but there was nothing really notable for the quarter from that perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then in terms of looking at pre-pre, this quarter came in just under, on a core basis, maybe $7 billion. It's really better than last quarter, which was just under $4 billion. Is &#x2013; but then this quarter obviously helped by FICC and Mortgage Banking. That may not repeat. I mean how should we think about that kind of on a core run rate basis? And will that improve largely now due to expenses continuing to improve based on Phase I and then Phase II next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I think there's a couple things. Obviously in any one quarter if you think about variables you've got, on the revenue side the one variable piece that we have in revenues is going to be what you see from a sales and trading perspective, that there is a level of variability in that either up or down. I think from a revenue perspective, given that you've backed out the different security gains and private equity gains when you quoted that $7 billion, that's going to be the one number from a revenue line that does have the variability to it. And then I think your point is exactly right that what we can do to look to drive that number up is largely going to be on the expense side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you still have confidence in the &#x2013; maybe it's an outdated range now, of 45 to 50 on an annual basis. Is that still valid? Or have things changed enough that, that needs to be rethought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on a prior call we brought &#x2013; that range has been a lower range in the &#x2013; just because we sold off a lot of credit card and stuff from when that number was originally published. But I think as we said last quarter, we're continually confident that we push that number, given the time and the interest rate environment, into over $10 billion a quarter. But it's going to take a normalized interest rate environment and an economy growing at 3% as opposed to an economy growing at 1.5% to 2%, which is what we've been consistently seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then lastly, just on capital. Any updated thoughts on potential deployment? Maybe still too early, but maybe more confidence now that bumping up your goal and target for Tier 1 common Basel III of 7.5% by the end of the year. Any updated thoughts on when or how? Or maybe some thoughts, also lessons learned from what happened with Citigroup?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we were clear in the CCAR. We said and we came through that test and we were clear before that we didn't apply for anything in 2012. I don't think we changed our thinking, Matt, as we work to make sure that we drive towards being Basel III compliant over the next couple of quarters. So I think we have high confidence in our capital, high confidence that we have the right capital and high confidence we're building at a good pace, that we knew before but now you all see. And so I think we'll just keep playing it through the end of this year in this way.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
