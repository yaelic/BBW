          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2010 Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Michael, and I will be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. John Colglazier. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone, and I'm glad you could join us today for Anadarko's fourth quarter and year end 2010 conference call. Please note we will only be addressing our 2010 results today. We plan to host an extended conference call on February 24 to provide additional details surrounding our 2011 capital plan, guidance and how that plays into attaining our five-year strategic plan, as well as some additional property level details. We'll be sending out more information for that call in the coming days.</p>
          <p>I want to take a few seconds to thank Chris Campbell for his contributions during the last four years as a valuable member of our Investor Relations team. Chris is continuing to play an important role at Anadarko, and has joined our Corporate Planning Group. Dean Hennings and I look forward to continuing to work with you guys.</p>
          <p>I will remind you that today's presentation will contain our best and most reasonable estimates and information. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today.</p>
          <p>You should read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements in our latest presentation slides, our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business. In addition, we'll reference certain non-GAAP measures so be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release and on our Web site.</p>
          <p>We encourage you to read the cautionary note to U.S. investors contained in the presentation slides for this call. And as we do each quarter, we've included additional information in our quarterly operations report that's available on our Web site.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett, our Chairman and CEO, who will discuss our 2010 results, and Jim is joined by other executives who will be available to answer questions later in the call. Jim?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. Anadarko had a great operational year in 2010, and we surpassed the guidance we provided earlier in the year in almost every category.</p>
          <p>Starting with sales volumes at our investor conference in March of last year, we projected that we would grow about 4% over 2009 levels, and that we would spend about $5.5 billion in capital. We were able to outperform these objectives with almost 7% sales volumes growth in 2010 while spending almost $200 million less in capital.</p>
          <p>Also in March we forecasted an organic reserve replacement ratio of at least 130%, and we achieved 140%, adding 330 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves before the effects of price revisions. Costs incurred amounted to just over $5 billion, resulting in better than anticipated reserve replacement costs as well.</p>
          <p>We've talked previously about our ongoing efforts to reduce our lease operating expense per unit, and the 2010 results in this area continued to improve. Results were favorable to guidance by more than $0.80 per barrel of oil equivalent, representing a savings of more than $170 million.</p>
          <p>Coming off one of Anadarko's best exploration years in its history in 2009, we again reached a high mark in 2010. Our offshore exploration and appraisal drilling programs achieved a combined 75% success rate.  Another one of our goals that we discussed in March was attaining 10% production growth per debt adjusted share. We met this target as we delivered record production levels in 2010.</p>
          <p>The 2010 results reflect the depth and quality of Anadarko's portfolio. The record sales volumes were about 6.5 million barrels of oil equivalent higher than the midpoint of the original guidance, and 100% of this incremental growth was driven by increases in our liquids production as we allocated and re-directed capital to liquids rich areas of the portfolio. These areas included the Eagle Ford Shale, Bone Spring, Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes, among others.</p>
          <p>Also partly as a result of our focus on liquids rich assets within the portfolio, adjusted EBITDAX improved almost 40% versus 2009 to about $30.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding items affecting comparability. The 13% year-over-year growth in our higher margin liquid volumes, coupled with our efforts to manage costs more efficiently, contributed significantly to the improved EBITDAX for the year.</p>
          <p>We also continued to achieve reduced drilling cycle times with notable improvement throughout the onshore portfolio. One of the most dramatic examples was in the Eagle Ford Shale where our spud release times are now less than 12 days compared to more than 22 days in mid 2009.</p>
          <p>From a broader perspective, seven to 10 major assets in the Southern region had record cycle times during the quarter. In the Rockies, an industry study recognized four of Anadarko's contracted rigs as being among the top 10 rigs in the U.S. onshore for total footage drilled. All major areas of the portfolio provided year-over-year growth, led by the Rockies and the accelerated development activities in the shale plays.</p>
          <p>In the Rockies, we delivered an 11% increase in sales volumes and several areas continue to achieve record production levels, including Great Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, our operated Wamsutter and Salt Creek EOR.</p>
          <p>In the Southern and Appalachian region, the advancement of our shale and other unconventional resource plays contributed significant increases in sales volumes during the year as well. With the additions of the group and gathering systems and other infrastructure expansions in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, by the end of the fourth quarter we had nearly doubled gross sales volumes versus the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The Marcellus continues to be the only major area where we are drilling for dry natural gas due to the proximity to premium gas markets which further enhance the already robust economics of the play. We exited the year with approximate gross sales volumes in the Marcellus of 330 million cubic feet per day from about 70 wells.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, we recently established ourselves as the largest producer in this play. With the existing infrastructure and service agreements in place, about 94% of all completed wells have been flowing to sales.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with gross sales volumes of about 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 75% is liquids. This represents a six-fold increase in volumes versus the prior-year fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>At current market prices, the Eagle Ford is generating excellent economics, and with 450 million barrels of oil equivalent of net resource potential on our acreage and more than 2,000 identified well sites, we plan to ramp up to 10 rigs by the end of the first quarter of 2011 from two rigs at the beginning of 2010. We continue to evaluate a joint venture structure for our Eagle Ford program similar to what we have done in the Marcellus.</p>
          <p>Beyond the phenomenal growth in our shale assets in the Southern region, five of our seven major operating areas achieved their lowest base decline rate during the quarter as we continue to focus on maintaining our existing base production. Additionally, we're actively pursuing other emerging growth plays in the Bone Spring/Avalon shale and horizontal Niobrara plays, each with encouraging results, high liquids yields and substantial running room.</p>
          <p>Moving to our sanctioned mega projects, as you all know, the Jubilee offshore Ghana reached its first oil milestone in a record 3.5 years following discovery, which is twice as fast as the industry average. We're proud of the integrated project team that safely delivered upon the time and cost schedules for this deepwater development.</p>
          <p>Jubilee is currently producing around 50,000 barrels of oil per day from four wells, and we expect to ramp up to capacity of around 120,000 barrels per day by midyear. Jubilee also gives us an excellent foundation in Ghana from which we can grow in future years, given our additional exploration and development opportunities in these blocks.</p>
          <p>In Algeria, development, drilling and construction work are progressing at the El Merk mega project. Additional production is anticipated around the beginning of 2012, and will be increased as the full facility is commissioned.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, we were making good progress on the Caesar/Tonga project and had received the necessary permits to begin completion activities in the first two wells. However, as we announced yesterday, we're disappointed that the project will not begin first production by the first half of this year as a result of the production riser system failing our recent hydro testing procedures.</p>
          <p>We have a team in place that is actively working toward a safe and reliable alternative. In the meantime, we want to assure you that we fully expect to be well within our 2011 production guidance of 240 million to 250 million barrels of oil equivalent that we provided last March.</p>
          <p>Also in the Gulf of Mexico, we are fully utilizing our two contracted rigs. We recently brought the Callisto well on line at Independence Hub and completed work-over activities on two wells in the K2 area, returning them to production.</p>
          <p>During 2010, as you'll recall, we announced several successful appraisal wells in both the Lucius and Vito fields. During the moratorium, these future mega projects continue to advance with feasibility and preliminary front end engineering studies, as well as permit applications for additional drilling. We filed for permits with Obama to resume appraisal around our Heidelberg discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as well.</p>
          <p>Our worldwide exploration program continued to create differentiating value for our stockholders in 2010. We believe we were again one of the most active deepwater drillers in the world, announcing eight offshore discoveries with a 60% success rate. We also were nine for nine in our offshore appraisal program.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continued the successful evaluation and development of the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shales, which enabled us to establish a net risked resource potential of about 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in these two major growth areas. These successful activities and discoveries continue to expand the resource potential, confirm our geologic understanding and de-risk our positions in the U.S. onshore and in our offshore acreage positions in Brazil, Ghana, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone.</p>
          <p>Beyond the overall high success rate in Africa, according to IHS Energy, four of our exploration wells were among the five largest offshore discoveries in 2010. Three of those were in the Rovuma Basin of Mozambique where we hold a 36.5% working interest in the 2.6 million acre offshore Area 1. These natural gas discoveries were made at the Windjammer, Barquentine and Lagosta prospects.</p>
          <p>Based on the results of those wells, our partnership is designing an accelerated appraisal program in analyzing various development options. We plan to keep at least one rig in the basin throughout 2011 to carry out an active appraisal and exploration program, as well as to conduct at least one drill stem test.</p>
          <p>Currently at Mozambique, we are drilling the deep water Tubarao prospect, which is located approximately 19 miles southwest of the Lagosta discovery. Tubarao is a 15,000 foot test of a Eocene sand system, and we hope to have results from this well within the next week.</p>
          <p>In West Africa, we made our second discovery offshore Sierra Leone at the Mercury prospect which we operate with a 65% working interest. The well encountered approximately 135 net feet of oil pay and two Cretaceous-age sand systems. The discovery also demonstrated the stratigraphic tracking systems we've identified are working, and that the petroleum system is generating high quality oil. We expect to have an active exploration and appraisal drilling project offshore Sierra Leone, Liberia and potentially C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire with three to five wells planned this year.</p>
          <p>Our partnership's 2010 activities in Ghana continue to expand the potential of this world class petroleum province with the discovery and continuing appraisal of the Enyenra field, formally known as Owo. Enyenra is adjacent to our Tweneboa discovery in the Deepwater Tano License where we hold an 18% working interest.</p>
          <p>The partnership drilled four successful appraisal wells in this block during the year, three in the Tweneboa field and one sidetrack in the Enyenra field. We plan to continue an active appraisal program in 2011, and expect to submit a plan of development for the area by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>In the adjacent West Cape Three Points block where we hold a 31% working interest, we drilled another successful appraisal in the Mahogany East area to the southeast of the Jubilee field. The M5 well followed three other successful wells in the area that have enabled the partnership to submit a declaration of commerciality to the Canadian government.</p>
          <p>We are currently drilling the Teak prospect on the same block about two and a half miles northeast of the Jubilee unit boundary. Teak is testing multiple Campanian and Turonian objectives, and we are encouraged by what we have seen so far in this well with results expected soon. The partnership plans to drill at least another four exploration wells this year on the block.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, drilling is ongoing at the Itauna discovery on block BM-C-29 where we hold a 50% working interest. Back in November, we announced Itauna's discovery after the well encountered more than 275 net feet of oil pay in the post-salt section.</p>
          <p>We've begun drilling a bypass to the original well bore that should enable us to obtain core data and additional reservoir and fluid information to better define the discovery. We plan to drill additional wells in the Block in the latter half of 2011, contingent upon rig availability.</p>
          <p>I've summarized just some of the highlights of our exploration and appraisal drilling programs, and encourage you to look through the quarterly operations report on our Web site for more information.</p>
          <p>Turning to financial results for the fourth quarter 2010, we reported earnings of about $0.22 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release of certain items affecting comparability, without which fourth quarter net income would have been about $0.07 higher or $0.29 per share.</p>
          <p>Discretionary cash flow totaled approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter and almost $5.4 billion for the full year. We generated more than $200 million of free cash flow in 2010.</p>
          <p>As for the BP oil spill, we remain confident in our publicly stated position. Consistent with the past two quarters, we've continued to apply accounting guidelines to the facts as they are known to us today and accordingly, we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. We will, of course, include expanded disclosures in our 10-K when it is filed with the SEC later this month.</p>
          <p>As mentioned in last night's earnings release, we ended the quarter with about $3.7 billion of cash on hand after retiring more than $400 million of additional debt during the fourth quarter. Also in 2010, we took a number of steps to further strengthen the balance sheet and enhance liquidity, such as extending and upsizing our revolving credit facility from $1.3 billion to $5 billion. This facility remains undrawn. Our capital expenditures, including expensed G&amp;G, were approximately $5.3 billion for the year. As I mentioned earlier, this was nearly $200 million lower than the midpoint of original guidance.</p>
          <p>Turning to reserves. We added 330 million barrels of oil equivalent of organic proved reserves during 2010 before the effect of price revisions. This equates to a reserve replacement ratio of approximately 140% which exceeded our target, as I mentioned earlier. We accomplished this while incurring costs of just over $5 billion associated with our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.</p>
          <p>As of year-end 2010, about 69% of our proved reserves were developed and only 31% undeveloped. An estimated 44% of our proved reserves were liquids, consistent with the previous year, but up meaningfully from 2008 levels when liquids only comprised about 40% of our product mix.</p>
          <p>In March of last year, we detailed our five year goals and with the results in 2010, we are firmly on track to deliver upon those metrics. As I stated in last night's release, we are very proud of the dedication and focus of our employees who delivered very strong results in the face of significant challenges that we experienced last summer. Their efforts resulted in record production, better net-backs, high liquids volumes, improved LOE, important fractionation agreements and infrastructure expansions and significant exploration success.</p>
          <p>We look forward to updating you on our longer term plans and providing our 2011 guidance and capital program later this month. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we anticipate full year production to be well within the guidance we provided in March, last March. We also expect our total capital spending program to be in line with cash flows.</p>
          <p>With that, Michael, if you would, we'd like to open it up for questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Peter Kissel of Howard Weil. You may proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. First of all, in Ghana I was just wondering to hear your initial thoughts for development of Tweneboa? And in particular, I know you previously talked about lumping Tweneboa and Owo together, and I was just curious to see as both of those have gotten bigger and better, what your updated thoughts are. And I know it's a little preliminary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, this is Chuck. It is preliminary. We are undergoing studies to evaluate the full development of both of those fields. There's a lot of synergy between them, particularly in the early time. And so that's the direction we're heading, but those studies are ongoing, and we hope to have a decision later this year, early next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. Okay. Thank you. And then just one other question. I know the JV progress in the Eagle Ford is ongoing, and I was just curious to hear what your targeted structure is for the JV. And then also, are there any other areas where you're looking at a JV structure, in particular possibly the Niobrara?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bob. I'll speak to your question on the Maverick first. We're looking at a structure similar to that which we did in the Marcellus. I think that's the best guidance we could give you on that front and the progress is continuing. We've seen strong interest, and our expectations are on execution, haven't changed there.</p>
          <p>Speak to the Niobrara. We aren't looking at the Niobrara yet for a JV. Certainly down the road it might be something we would consider, but as you know, we're in the very early stages. We like to get our science done. It's worked well in the Marcellus and now in the Maverick to get the science done to show some really good performance and then to go to the market to sell the project as it's been a little bit more developed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we're obviously happy that there's interest shown in Niobrara from the outside world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning, everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Doug Leggate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little more exotic than normal. A couple of questions from me please. First of all, I know you don't want to speak to the production guidance, given that you have your call later this month, but when you put out the release yesterday on Caesar/Tonga and you confirmed that you will be within your March guidance, can you just reiterate what your maintenance capital or your stay flat capital is? And what the underlying decline looks like now, Jim? You said that was getting a little bit better? And I have a follow-up. Excuse me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Doug, this is Al. Let me try to see if I can help you with that as best I can, recognizing, as you say, we're going to probably only answer it in part today. The capital intensity around our ability to replace reserves year-over-year really hasn't changed. If you'll recall, that was about a $2 billion spend in prior years and that'll probably be about the same as we go forward.</p>
          <p>As we look at what we're going to be able to hopefully achieve in 2011, we do believe that despite the delays with Caesar/Tonga, the guidance we gave you in March is going to continue to be something that we can deliver on. And I think as we move forward here in a couple of weeks we'll be able to give you a little bit more information around that, hopefully in a way that we'll continue to give you development activity in our shales that is probably going to be the largest growth engine for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Al, does that guidance assume that you complete a joint venture in the Eagle Ford or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we look at that guidance, we don't really assume a joint venture. It's certainly today one of the better areas in our portfolio in terms of return on capital. So as we look at it, if we can improve the return on capital through a joint venture then certainly we'd pursue it because when you about guidance it is not a net number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. My follow ups are just relating to a couple of the assets, if I may, just to get an update. Obviously, Mozambique, you're continuing to drill there. Obviously, it looks like predominantly gas for the time being. What's a realistic time line? I mean, what do you need to see there in order to get comfortable that there's actually a viable project? And if you could talk maybe to the liquids opportunity perhaps further to the south?</p>
          <p>And the only other one I have really is on Sierra Leone, similar kind of question. You've got a lot of well control; I guess a lot of calibration logs and so on that you can basically look from all the wells you've drilled in that region. Can you maybe speak a little bit more as to the prospectivity of Mercury, given what you found, given the scale of the structure and perhaps whether the 65% working interest is something you would want to hold onto as you move forward with that one? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Doug. This is Bob. We'll start with the Mozambique question. We are continuing to drill out there, and we have said we'll keep the rig there at least through 2011, and we may even be bringing a second rig in towards the end of the year. We're in the process of looking at that right now. We're presently on Tubarao. That's almost done, and we're getting all our data out of it. Like what we're seeing there. It's just a further extension of the &#x2013; from the La, Barque and Jammer complex to the south about 19 miles and we should have results on that here very shortly.</p>
          <p>The rig then is going to go and really focus on defining the La, Barque and Jammer complex better, in that what we're hoping to do this year is define the resource where we're going to get enough data from the well bores, from DSTs, from interference testing to look at overall volumes, deliverability, well bore efficiency, so what's the drainage area, what's the ultimate recovery per well so that we can start designing the development with real detail. And also give the data to an outside reserve group to certify the reserves, which we're going to need to move forward with an LNG project. We do think that the La, Barque and Jammer Complex has already exceeded the minimum threshold for LNG. We've said that, which we thought was about 4 Tcf. What we're really trying to do is get those numbers pinned down to where they can be certified outside.</p>
          <p>As we move to the liquids side of it, we did find liquids down to the south of the block in our Ironclad prospect in tight reservoir. We're shooting 3-D down to the south. It should start the first week of February. We'll extend the existing 3-D all the way to the block boundary; then we're going to move to the north and shoot the &#x2013; extend the 3-D all the way to the northern boundary. The south will be focused on the oil potential. The north will be more of the gas up in that same complex. The second rig that we would bring in would be for the further exploration work because most of the year is going to be tied up with all the work to get to the reserve certification for La, Barque and Jammer.</p>
          <p>And then going over into Sierra Leone, we do like what we're seeing over there. Mercury was a nice discovery. We think that we have a good appraisal location. We've said that we're going to drill three to five wells in the margin outside of Ghana. If it's three, they'll all be up in the Sierra Leone, Liberia area.</p>
          <p>The five would be if we can clarify the situation in Cote D'Ivoire, get down there and drill the prospects that we like there. So one of those wells will be a Mercury appraisal well. We've got a good location that we think will really help prove up the volumes down there, but from a petroleum system standpoint, everything we've seen on our two wells in Sierra Leone tells us that that basin has the same sort of potential as what we're seeing in Ghana, and hopefully in Cote D'Ivoire.</p>

          <p>We're looking at that right now. There's a lot of interest, of course, in coming into those plays, and 65% is typically a little bit higher than we like, but we also have the issue of when the rig shows up. We can't bring a partner in, in the middle of a drilling campaign, so it would have to happen here in the next couple months if we do lay off some. It's not going to be a lot if we do lay off any, but we do have a lot of interest in it.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everybody. I'm not sure who wants to answer this, but if I think about, I'm just trying to recap what CNOOC and Chesapeake did yesterday. Can you guys recap your position in the Powder and then the Niobrara? And in the Powder, do you have any of the deeper frontier rights? Or any generalization you can make about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, this is Chuck Meloy. Our acreage position in the Powder River is about 750,000 acres, give or take a few. Mostly what we're focused on, of course, is the CBM assets where we're producing about 800 million cubic feet gross. So it's been a very good piece of business for us. We've, of course, through the course of time have collected the deep rights under many of those acreages and expanded our acreage position outside the CBM in hopes that we can put together a deeper play in the oil sands, tight oil sands and shales. And that's what we're evaluating currently today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe a question for Al. If the Eagle Ford JV doesn't get done, is there, I know you have cash on the balance sheet. How do you think about reallocation of capital? Is there something that perhaps wouldn't get done? Or what's that marginal project that would be added if the Eagle Ford JV does get done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, David, I think you'll see here in a couple weeks, our current plans as we roll out our capital for 2011 would not assume a joint venture. So therefore, the rig, operated rig count that we continue to make reference to in the play and taking that up to 10 rigs, that is today without the benefit of a joint venture. So we're not really contingent on the joint venture to fund the activity level that we see in that play in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if it does get done, can you give us an indication of where that additional capital would go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually today I suspect I will answer you as more likely than not we'd reallocate it to some other onshore liquid rich plays, particularly in the one to the north of that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. And then one final question for whomever. As we forecast it, it looks like on a quarterly basis production should be maybe some lumpiness, but production should be on an uptick here like throughout 2011. Can you give me any confirmation or denial of that? Anything along those lines as far as does that trend sound right as far as quarterly sequential upticks from here on out, at least for the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, this Chuck again. Well, I think what we'll see through the course of 2011 is we produced around 235 million barrels for 2010. We told you it's going to be between 240 and 250. We keep doing that guidance today; it looks like we'll be well within that. On a quarter-to-quarter basis there's a bit of lumpiness just because of the timing of liftings, et cetera in Algeria and China. So it's hard to project on a quarter-by-quarter basis that it would be absolute straight growth rate. But what you're seeing is a continuous and constant growth in our shales that's driving our production upwards. We're seeing Jubilee, of course, come up on its ramp up which would drive it upward. So you should see a steady upward trend with a few ups and downs associated with liftings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You guys had some pretty charts last March about what shales looked like going forward. Is that still a fair projection for us to use in modeling as we think about '11 and '12 for the shale component of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what we're seeing is just tremendous growth in the shales, David. If you take a look back in the start of 2010, our entry rate for the Maverick was around 3,400 barrels a day gross, and today it's at 27,000 barrels a day gross or a little better than that. If you look at the Marcellus, it was about 40 million gross. Today, it's about 330 million gross.</p>
          <p>So those are on a tremendous growth path. We intend to adjust that and show you what we're forecasting for the remainder of the next few years in our February 24 call, but I think it's fair to say that they're certainly matching, if not exceeding our expectations.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you guys highlighted looking at the efficiency gains that you're experiencing in the U.S. plays, specifically Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Rockies, obviously had some huge strides there from Bud's rig release. Can you guys talk about what inning we're in with respect to the efficiency gains that are taking place there? And maybe if I could push it a step further, quantify expectations of once you move from held by production in some of those areas to pad drilling what you think will happen from an efficiency basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Dave, this is Chuck again. We are extremely proud of our drilling group, and the many accomplishments they have made. The efficiency gains have frankly stunned me. They've just done a spectacular job working every element of the drilling process. I would hesitate to call what inning we're in because these guys continue to surprise each and every one of us. What we do feel like is once we get into a manufacturing process that we will drain even more cost out of the system, and if you take a look at the Maverick, we're getting nearer that. We're probably in the order of 70% or 80% into the manufacturing process.</p>
          <p>If you take a look at the Marcellus, it's further behind. It's maybe 50%. Those are just rough estimates. We're starting to do more and more pad drilling in the Marcellus. You're seeing the improvements. I think another thing in both of these areas, as we learn more about these reservoirs and how to drill them and how to make the curves and that type of thing, we continue to find those efficiency opportunities and I will never proclaim we're in the ninth inning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I just might add to that too, we don't talk about the completion side of it, but there's continuous improvement occurring on the completion side either in terms of yield or in terms of efficiency there too. So there's more room to move along the whole chain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's helpful. And just maybe following on, on that a little bit, two questions. One, as you guys continue to drive down costs on both sides of that equation, can you talk about what you think that means more from a macro gas outlook? And then, two, as you guys are experiencing efficiency gains, is this leading to an increase in drilled, maybe uncompleted wells or drilled wells that you're not able to rapidly tie in. In other words, do we have an inventory of production that's waiting to come to market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try the first part and then I might turn it back over to Chuck on the inventory issue. Obviously, this helps lower the cost structure for the industry, but I still think that you've got to be in the right places until we see a little more structural change in the gas demand side. The good news is I think that's going to happen even without federal legislation, which is something I didn't believe a year and a half ago. And I think we're four to five years away from that starting to happen in a much bigger way, particularly in the power generation sector, and we've tried to help make some of that come true up in places like Colorado. But from our perspective, we do have in the one place where we're drilling for dry gas actively in Marcellus has some notable advantages from a cost and market standpoint.</p>
          <p>So I think everybody still needs to be cautious about what they do here, even with lowering costs. And obviously, you have to be in the right places in the country, but I think gas continues to surprise us, even in the short-term. I mean, we have had a bearish view on gas for a couple years, and frankly, it continues to stay a little higher than we thought due to a variety of factors we couldn't have anticipated, so we're generally consensus on gas directionally in the short-term, but we're continually mindful that we might get surprised in the upside. I'll have Chuck answer the second part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As I appreciate it, Dave, your question was how are we dealing with the growing inventory of wells that are not flowing the line? If we look across our portfolio and I'll focus on the Marcellus, which is probably the example with the largest non-producing inventory, it's now approaching 200 wells. There's really three reasons why they're in that condition. The first is those that are actually in completion progress or progress is being made on the completion. We have roughly 50 wells that are now under some stage of completion and that is just associated with the complexity of the process of completing a horizontal well. There are several different steps in that process.</p>
          <p>There's many stages of fracturing, and because we're on pads, by and large today it takes longer to actually take a well from the start of completion to first production just because other wells on the same pad are being completed and all the activity going on. We then have about 75 wells that are waiting on completions, waiting for them to get in line on the completions. And finally, we have several wells in the order of 70 wells that have actually been completed that are waiting on the pipeline connections. And that's a matter, again, of the process of laying lines and getting the hookups and permits, et cetera in that area.</p>
          <p>So it's just a steady progression of wells going through the process. And I guess I would say that we are &#x2013; that's more than I would have anticipated at this stage in the process, but after you really look into it, it's not surprising, given the terrain and the challenges associated with the completions and just the durations of the completions.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Following up on some of the earlier questions, first sticking with the Marcellus. Can you just talk about well performance there and well performance in terms of IP rates from your newer wells and how that may be different in the different parts of your acreage blocks? And then separately, decline rates that you're seeing from some of your older wells and whether those decline rates are in line or lower than the type curves that you've put out in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brian, this is Chuck. We have about I'd say close to 80 wells online now. And as we mentioned, they're producing about 330 million feet a day combined, so you have a very nice rate, over 4 million a day per well on average. What we've seen from the new wells is if you plot IPs versus time, they continue to grow as we improve the completions and hone in on the exact target lines and that kind of thing. So we're seeing continuous improvement.</p>
          <p>In fact, our most recent wells we've put in two pads recently, and both those pads has averaged over 7 million cubic feet per well on the initial completions. The decline rates are in line with our expectations on our type curves that we've provided in the past. After a period where the pressure drops and the rates are flat, but the pressure drops, thet then go on decline and what you're seeing is, at least in the early times, we're still early in this play, the expected recoveries from these wells are well north of 4 Bcf and some in the 6 Bcf plus range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. And then on Lucius, can you just update us on the key milestones for Lucius and then what your latest thoughts are on both sizing, combining with other discoveries locally and the timing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well as you're aware, we've drilled a number of wells out of Lucius; have great looking results, tremendous pay. These are oil pays. Good oil. We have requested permits to drill additional wells in the Lucius area. The milestone is we need to get an oil spill recovery plan approved by Obama and then we'll go out.</p>
          <p>We also intend to do a DST in the field. We're working with our neighbors on the Hadrian area to do a complete development for the area that would be the most cost effective alternative for development along with a sole development concept.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And lastly, you touched on this a little bit earlier with regards to Niobrara. But what is your view on the extent to which the Niobrara play or the Frontier play extends to your PRB acreage? And then if you look overall between Wattenberg up to the PRB, the repeatability of the play?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me see if I can take it. This is Al. The play is probably at times a little misunderstood; Niobrara has been a big part of the production out of the DJ basin for a long time.</p>
          <p>As we move north, it moves from being more of a gas with oil condensate to less gas and more oil, and we see that as we move into Wyoming in particular. The area that you're making reference to in the Powder River there, that's really not a Niobrara shale.</p>
          <p>That's different producing horizons that people are targeting and the plays are very different. So when people talk about the Niobrara, they're talking about the Colorado/Wyoming portion of where that shale is present. As we get into the Powder River Basin and the deep Powder River opportunities there, that's an entirely different play, and I might, with that, let Bob Daniels take that just a little bit further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the deep Powder River Basin, there's multiple plays up there. We're looking at a lot of them very, very early up in that area. I don't think that the extrapolation as Al said from the Denver basin up to the Powder River Basin is going to be a blanket comparison that you could say it's all going to be the same.</p>
          <p>So we're trying to, as we typically do, work the science of it; look at the rock, look at the bases changes as we go up into there. But we did have a great position in the deep Powder, and we've been working it for quite some time to try to understand what the true prospectivity is up there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Just a quick question on your West African drilling campaign. Just want to follow-up on the earlier comments about the Teak prospect and what you said you see as encouraging signs there; I just wondered if you could give us any more detail on that?</p>
          <p>And secondly just on the Sierra Leone, Liberia, C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire plans, so just so I understand. Are you saying you might not drill a well in Liberia this year? And if you do five, your preferred operation will be to drill three in Sierra Leone and two in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Phil, this is Bob Daniels again. Sorry for the misunderstandings there. I'll clarify it. Let's start with Teak. Teak, we're not done with the well yet and so all we have is MWD information; still early stages. But we had dual objectives in there, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far. But until we get the final data out and know what we actually have, we're really not going to say a whole lot more about that. But it shouldn't be very long before that data is in our hands and then we can talk about it.</p>
          <p>As to the rest of West Africa, we have blocks, two blocks in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire, four blocks in Liberia and two in Sierra Leone. Our plan is to drill three to five wells in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The three wells, if we come at the low end of that, would be one in Liberia, two in Sierra Leone, of which one would be a mercury appraisal well, okay? So that would be the three-well scenario. If it goes to the five well, it's because we can get on to our C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire blocks. Of course, the political situation there has kind of thrown a wrench into our plans at this point. So it's how that develops as to whether or not we can in that same rig line get down and drill the prospects we see in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. And just one further question on that &#x2013; so you don't have a rig yet or drill ship for that campaign, and that's what you're in the process of finalizing at the moment?</p>

          <p>Okay. And final, could you bring us up to date on service rates out there in the field, particularly pressure pumping?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pressure pumping has been &#x2013; we've seen some increases in pressure pumping recently. There's a lot of pressure particularly where the industry is really busy like the major shale plays. We're seeing it try to level off some. We hope that's the case.</p>
          <p>What we're trying to do as a company is offset that inflation with efficiency, getting our job done faster and more efficiently and decrease the amount of time we have on location so our absolute cost of doing business is reduced and that's what we're pushing.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys. Quick question, this is for Jim and Bob. Just wanted to follow-up on Brazil. You guys talked about before potentially looking at that asset further post the Itauna well and also Itaipu, I just wanted to find out what the status was and what the strategy is there going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Bob. I'll talk about status right now in Itauna. We had a post-salt discovery we announced I think back in December. We went down to pre-salt in that same well bore, encountered some hydrocarbons, not really good reservoir. We've come back up into the post-salt section. And we're now taking a bypass core of the lower of the two reservoir intervals and then get full log evaluation of it to see exactly what we have there, how good the rock could be, what kind of fluids we have. So we're in the process of doing that right now, and once we have all that data out we'll talk some more about it.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we're going to be appraising Wahoo and Itaipu later this year. Itaipu now looks like it's going to be about May timeframe to spud, maybe even a little bit later. We're just waiting on when the rig comes out of a shipyard. Wahoo we're in the process of lining up a rig, and then Itauna we expect to be back drilling an appraisal well later in the year and we do have a rig lined up on that already.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just mention, so we have running room. We're obviously very aware too that it's an area that is very desirable. So we'll keep that in mind. I might just mention that we've got time for one more question, if you don't mind. Operator, and we'll finish the call after that.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everybody.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Joe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple questions. One, I noticed that for the fourth quarter the U.S. oil production was below guidance and below the third quarter, so could you talk about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Joe. This is Chuck. The primary issue in the fourth quarter was a deep water royalty relief adjustment that we received. It was about 700,000 barrels. Our production actually is doing very well. That was associated with adjustment and all the stuff that we settled back a bit ago. And right now our exit rate was right at 200,000 barrels, so we're actually right in the middle of the guidance on an exit rate basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Very helpful. And in terms of the reserves, talk about the big reserve add you had in 2010, and especially Jubilee. I'm just curious at this point what did you book in 2010 at Jubilee? What have you got in total booked? And what's your estimate of Jubilee on an 8 basis based on what you're seeing so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, we don't break out on a field by field basis what our reserves are. But generally what we've seen is where we drilled wells, particularly in the Rockies and in the shales, we started booking or we started booking again, and we've had just tremendous performance on our base, so we've been able to add incremental barrels to our expected PUDs that are offsetting those bases and base wells. So it's just across the board.</p>
          <p>We've done I think a fair job of not increasing our PUDs, so when we drill we're adding PDP reserves. The quality of those reserves is outstanding in my view. It's better than it's ever been from a go-forward basis and the quality of the economics associated with the PUDs, particularly given the shales. And I think we're real proud of the fact that today we've been very conservative with regard to our shale bookings. And about 2% to 3% of our company is shale reserves and we have tremendous upside in those as we drill out our program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gotcha. That's helpful. And then with the Gulf of Mexico, the permitting process. Could you guys just talk about like what really is the issue at this point that you think you just need to kind of get over to really start making progress with the permits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, it's primarily in the oil spill response document that we have to file. That's in with Obama right now and we saw news earlier that Shell has actually achieved their response plan approval, so we're hopeful that we're quickly behind that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think, Joe, just in our planning we have not actually anticipated any drilling until the second half of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. That's helpful. And just to follow-up with the oil production, so for the fourth quarter was the onshore oil up or down from third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, this is Al. I think most do this. We're going to be with you in a couple of weeks and we'll talk a little bit more about how '11 and '12 are going to play out, but generally what we're seeing from all of our onshore production is an upward trend. I know you're looking specifically at wanting to get some field performance information, and we just don't feel like from our perspective getting into field level performance is constructive, but rather talking about it from a portfolio perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, gotcha. All right. Thank you for your time.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Joe. And if anybody has any questions, obviously, please call the Investor Relations group and we'd be happy to work with you on that. I just want to thank everybody on the phone, first of all, and also I want to thank our shareholders and employees for a great year in 2010. We're obviously looking forward to another good year in 2011, and we will talk to you, as we've mentioned several times, in several weeks about more detail for the coming year.</p>
          <p>With that, have a great day. Thank you.</p>
