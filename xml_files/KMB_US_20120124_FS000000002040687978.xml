          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience and holding. We now have your speakers in conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the lines for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you'd like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first speaker, Mr. Paul Alexander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our year-end earnings conference call. Here with me today in Dallas are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller. Here's the agenda for our call: Mark will begin with a review of our fourth quarter results followed by an update on pulp and tissue restructuring. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our full-year results and our 2012 outlook. We'll finish with Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. This morning's presentation also includes an appendix with the details of our 2012 planning assumptions.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today. There can be no assurance that future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of forward-looking statements. I'd also like to point out that we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both of which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. For further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, please see today's news release and additional information on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul and good morning. Let's start with the headlines. First, we achieved organic sales growth of 3%, highlighted by 7% growth in K-C International. Second, we generated solid improvements in both adjusted gross and operating margins; and third, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.28. That's a 7% increase compared to the prior year.</p>
          <p>Now let's cover the details of the quarter. Overall sales increased 2% to $5.2 billion. Organic sales rose 3% driven by higher net selling prices of 2% and increased sales volumes of 1%. On the other hand, lost sales in conjunction with a divestiture combined with the impact of our pulp and tissue restructuring reduced sales by 1%.</p>
          <p>Moving down the P&amp;L, adjusted gross margin was 32.6%. That's up 20 basis points year-on-year. The improvement was driven by higher selling prices and $70 million of forced cost savings. These items more than offset cost inflation of $55 million and a negative impact of lower production volumes.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit rose 9% and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%. That's up 90 basis points compared to the prior year. In addition to the gross margin improvement, adjusted operating margin benefited from flat between-the-line spending and higher other income.</p>
          <p>Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.28. That compares with $1.20 last year. The improvement came despite a higher effective tax rate and lower net income from equity companies. So for the year, adjusted earnings per share were $4.80, at the low end of our previous guidance range of $4.80 to $4.90 a share.</p>
          <p>Cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $517 million. That compares to $948 million in the prior year. The decline was driven by a significant improvement in working capital last year that didn't repeat in 2011 along with higher pension contributions. Fourth-quarter 2011 primary working capital levels were solid overall, although receivables did increase somewhat including some impact from timing of collections.</p>
          <p>For the full year, our cash conversion cycle improved three days to a record low of 47 days and I expect us to continue to show improvement in 2012. In addition, we anticipate modest pension contributions this year which should help drive a substantial increase in operating cash flow in 2012.</p>
          <p>Consistent with our previous guidance, we did not repurchase any common stock during the quarter. For the year, we repurchased 19 million shares at a cost of $1.24 billion. Including dividends, we returned approximately $2.3 billion of cash to shareholders during 2011.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways heading into 2012. We plan to invest $1 billion to $1.1 billion of capital spending to grow our businesses, and we expect to increase our dividend at a mid-single-digit rate which will be our 40th consecutive annual increase.</p>
          <p>We also expect to repurchase $900 million to $1.1 billion worth of our shares this year. Together our plans for dividends and share repurchases will total at least $2 billion of cash returned to shareholders in 2012.</p>
          <p>Now I'll highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 3% with volumes up 2% and net selling prices advancing 1%. K-C International had another great quarter with 11% organic growth led by Latin America, China, South Korea and Vietnam. In North America, organic sales fell 5%, mostly due to lower volumes. We continue to generate solid volume growth in adult care. On the other hand, volumes were down in infant and child care including the impacts of category declines, competitive activity and some consumer trade-down in the child care category.</p>
          <p>Personal Care operating margins of 15.4% remain well below prior year. The decline was driven by input cost inflation, higher between the line spending and increased promotion spending in North American diapers. We clearly aren't satisfied with margins at these levels and we expect to bring more of the 2011 U.S. diaper price increase to the bottom line in 2012, which should help improve overall margin performance.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up 1%. Net selling prices rose 3%. Product mix was favorable by a point, while organic volumes fell 3%. Consumer Tissue operating margins improved to 14.3%. That's our best performance in over two years. That was driven by selling price increases, cost savings, input cost deflation and lower between the line spending. Margins were up in every region around the world and I'm encouraged by the improved profitability that our tissue teams delivered in 2011 and expect to see further progress in 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving to KC Professional and other, organic sales were up about 3%. The increase was driven by improved volumes and higher net selling prices. Volumes were up low-single digits in each region, despite market demand continuing to be relatively sluggish. Operating margins of 15.5% were up 150 basis points versus last year. It's driven by benefits from sales growth and cost savings.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Health Care organic sales were up 9%. That included volume growth of 7% and higher net selling prices of 2%. Medical supply volumes rose double digits, led by growth in exam gloves and surgical products. In addition, our North American medical device business increased volumes in the mid-single digits. Operating margins of 14.3% were up considerably from last year driven by significant litigation-related expenses a year ago that were connected with our I-Flow acquisition, along with benefits from sales growth and cost savings.</p>
          <p>So that wraps up the financial review of the quarter. But before I turn it over to Tom, I wanted to provide an update on our pulp and tissue restructuring actions. Overall, we made significant progress in 2011 and are on track or ahead of all major elements of our plan.</p>
          <p>Actions are underway or complete at all but one of the facilities that will be impacted by last year's announcement. In the fourth quarter, we closed our pulp mill in Australia, we sold two KC Professional facilities in Spain and we announced the closure of our pulp mill in Everett, Washington. Earlier in 2011, we streamlined the Consumer Tissue facility in Australia.</p>
          <p>In addition as mentioned in this morning's news release, we recently made a decision to streamline an additional Consumer Tissue facility in North America that is located in Chester, Pennsylvania. Taking into account all restructuring actions, both the January 2011 announcement and this additional streamlining action, we now expect total restructuring charges of $385 million to $420 million after tax over the 2011 and 2012 time period, within the range we expected a year ago. We incurred $289 million of after tax charges in 2011. So most of the restructuring charges are now behind us.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in terms of the benefits from restructuring, we're ahead of plan. Fourth quarter savings were about $10 million. That brings full year 2011 savings to $20 million. We continue to expect to grow savings and reach at least $75 million in 2013. We now anticipate savings of at least $100 million in 2014. So all in all, I'm very pleased with the progress our teams are making with all our restructuring actions.</p>
          <p>So that wraps up my comments. To recap, we achieved solid organic sales growth led by K-C International. We delivered improved margins and earnings per share and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Since Mark has already reviewed the fourth quarter, I'll focus my comments on the full year and then I'll discuss our 2012 outlook.</p>
          <p>So starting with our 2011 performance, adjusted earnings per share rose 3% in 2011. That's below our original objective for the year. That was mostly due to two factors. First, we absorbed about $580 million of cost inflation and that was more than double our original expectation for the year. And, second, we had soft demand in portions of our developed markets, particularly in the infant and child care categories in the U.S., which continue to be impacted by a multi-year decline in the birth rate.</p>
          <p>So regardless of the reasons, we're not satisfied with the results that we delivered in 2011 and we plan to get that back on track in 2012.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we did make good progress in several areas that I'll highlight briefly. First, we launched a number of innovations including Huggies Little Movers Slip-On Diapers, Poise Hourglass Shaped Pads, Kleenex Cool Touch facial tissue, U by Kotex Tweens and an improved Cottonelle bathroom tissue. All of these innovations are performing very well in the marketplace so far.</p>
          <p>Our innovations and our supporting marketing programs helped improve our brand market positions. In the U.S., we improved or maintained market share in six of our eight consumer categories in 2011. We also increased market share in a number of areas in K-C International, such as in China and Latin America.</p>
          <p>Second, we successfully executed our growth initiatives. K-C International performance was particularly strong with 8% organic sales growth and a double-digit increase in operating profit. In China, Personal Care organic growth was 20% boosted by our expanding diaper business where Huggies are now sold in more than 70 cities. And in Latin America, Personal Care organic growth was more than 15%. In total, K-C International accounted for about 36% of K-C sales in 2011. That's up three percentage points from the previous year.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere, we achieved mid- to high-single digit volume growth in North America in a number of businesses including adult care, feminine care, baby wipes and our health care medical device business.</p>
          <p>Third, we took aggressive steps in response to the cost environment. We achieved higher net selling prices of 2% and we delivered $265 million in forced cost savings. And we tightly controlled our overhead spending.</p>
          <p>In terms of commodities, costs moderated some over the back half of 2011 from the peak levels we experienced in the summer. At the same time, our pricing and cost reduction initiatives built further momentum. As a result, our second half of the year adjusted gross margin was up 100 basis points from the first half of the year. So, I'm encouraged by this performance and I expect more improvement in 2012.</p>
          <p>Finally, as Mark mentioned, we made excellent progress with our restructuring actions and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. So overall, we achieved our top line goal, but we missed our bottom line target last year. We also delivered a number of important accomplishments and we plan to build on them going forward. Now let me turn to our 2012 outlook.</p>
          <p>In short, our plan is to continue to execute our global business plan, to invest behind our brands and to deliver improved growth in adjusted earnings per share. Now we expect economic conditions to remain challenging in the near-term, particularly in developed markets. And while we're cautiously optimistic that portions of the U.S. economy are improving, we aren't planning for a big increase in market demand.</p>
          <p>Category demand will remain soft in the infant and child care categories in the U.S. and we're also closely monitoring the European marketplace and events in Venezuela. On the other hand, we anticipate another strong year for K-C International, boosted by solid economic growth and execution of our growth strategies.</p>
          <p>In terms of commodity costs, we're assuming a relatively benign environment in 2012. We currently expect an impact in the range of $50 million of deflation to $50 million of inflation. So costs could be down slightly in developed markets but up somewhat in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the last several months, foreign currency exchange rates will likely be a headwind for us this year.</p>
          <p>We have an excellent pipeline of innovation launching across the business this year. Near-term activities in North America include an improved Huggies diaper; a new and improved Huggies baby wipes lineup and exciting innovations in adult care and feminine care. We also have several launches coming in K-C International, particularly in infant care and feminine care.</p>
          <p>So we'll support our innovations and targeted growth initiatives with an increased level of strategic marketing and spending in this area should rise much faster than sales growth. We'll also increase our investments in research and development and selling to support our future growth and to improve our capabilities.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we'll continue to manage our company with financial discipline. We expect to deliver another solid year of cost savings and to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders again this year. So all-in-all, in 2012, we expect to deliver organic sales growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings per share of 4% to 7%. The growth in adjusted earnings per share compares favorably to our 2011 growth of 3%.</p>
          <p>Similar to 2011, given the timing of our initiatives, we expect that adjusted earnings per share will be stronger in the second half of 2012. So to summarize, we continue to execute our strategies for the long-term benefit of Kimberly-Clark. We expect to make significant investments behind our brands in 2012 and deliver improved bottom line growth. And we remain convinced that execution of our global business plan will continue to improve shareholder value.</p>
          <p>So that wraps up our prepared remarks and now we'll begin to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ali.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a few questions. One is obviously want to drill down a little bit further on North America, particularly on infant and child care being down high single digits. And you mentioned some drivers of category softness from birthrates, competitive promotion and trade-down. Can you help disaggregate the large decline into those buckets so we can try to figure out &#x2013; I mean can you help us figure out going forward which one of these things are going to get better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess I'd say a couple things. If you look at it for the full year of 2011, the category for diapers was down 2% to 3%. Our volume was down about 4%. So it was a little bit steeper in the fourth quarter with the count decline. Basically we took 7% of diapers out of every bag across the fourth quarter. Usually we don't see all of that hit. This time we took a bigger hit from that. So that should start to roll off as consumers rebuild their household inventory.</p>
          <p>Second factor, price. We'd expected to realize more of that price in the fourth quarter. More of it wound up being spent back in trade, but also in couponing, really to respond to the competitive environment. Some of that was a response to our launch of Huggies Little Movers Slip-On diapers and in the third quarter, there was still a lot of noise in the marketplace. And that should start to get better sequentially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If we switch gears just a second and you guys are very well known for strong capital allocation, giving back to shareholders, this year I think it was $2.3 billion. Next year it sounds like it's going to be a little bit less than that, both dividend and share buyback. But it's been at least for the past couple years below your free cash flow. How should we think about that? How should we think about the philosophy there and the safety, frankly, of those things that people gravitate toward Kimberly-Clark for? And also, particularly in the context that it looks like it's going to be a little bit less this year versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so last year, as you recall, we said early in the year, we were going to take on about $700 million of additional leverage, that that was going to be a higher than normal year. So I'd say this year will be another solid year. I think it will be the 40th year in a row we've increased the dividend. So that's obviously a strong long-standing commitment. Expect to see that continue. And I'd say that maybe the challenge that lots of multinational spaces, as we make more money overseas is getting that money back on a timely basis to be able to use it to fund dividends and share repurchases. And we've been aggressive at that and you see that in the slightly higher effective tax rate next year than this year as it does cost more to bring that money back. But it's not our plan to accumulate cash on the balance sheet long-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're planning to accumulate debt to be able to pay the dividend and the share buyback that people are used to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think if you take a look at the cash flow we'll generate, say next year round numbers, stake $3 billion. You'll have $1 billion, to $1.1 billion go to CapEx. You'll have $1 billion to $1.1 billion go to dividends and the balance will go back to &#x2013; in the form of share repurchases. As the business grows, we want to target to be a solid single-A credit over time, as we did this year. If we can take on just a little bit of leverage and keep us right in that solid range, we might make the decision to do that, but you should think about us funding those obligations primarily out of operating cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Because that hasn't been the case the past couple years, obviously. And then last question is just a broader question of what you said for <mark type="ph" /> 3Q (20:27) top line but we missed the bottom line goal and then next year gross profit will grow faster than operating profit. It seems like and this is not just a Kimberly question. You have a broad view of the whole sector, but it feels like look, this is just the new world we're in where you're going to have to invest more &#x2013; one is going to have to invest more than you used to just to grow like you used to. Are you seeing any end in sight about this or is that just kind of the new view that we're going to have to have going forward here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say the markets are certainly more competitive and there's plenty of things to worry about in the world today, but if I look at last year and say, well, we had a commodity cost spike that was double our original expectations, it's tougher to get price quickly to cover that and that showed up in our numbers. We do have a fair amount of carryover price increase coming into 2012 and commodity environment looks like it's going to be more neutral for us. So we should see that flow to the bottom line a little bit more readily in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. I guess two questions, one, to just go back on the personal care margins. Obviously it's kind of the lowest that we've seen in a while. So as we think about the year progressing and coming off that floor, what's your view, is it more commodity is going to get better, as the year progresses? Or do you see the promotional environment easing? And can you get back to that 20% margin kind of that we've been accustomed to seeing for the last couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd say a good near-term target is to say if you look at where the fourth quarter margin was in personal care, it's kind of the low point to get back in 2012; something closer to the average for 2011 would be a good first up step. And that's probably more realistic given at least where the price of oil seems to be hanging these days. I'd say the things that are going to get better will be, one, getting some positive price realization as opposed to negative price drag. That's the quickest and easiest and it's already in place in the marketplace. We just got to bring it to the bottom line. There'll be some commodity relief, but that's not going to be a huge plus for us in personal care. You'll probably maybe see more in the near-term on tissue with lower pulp prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess shifting to the next question. I think you said when we look at the cadence of earnings for the year; the second half would be stronger than the first half. Was that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I said the profile would be similar to what it was in 2011. So I think in 2011, the way it shook out is -- I don't know -- 47% of our full year earnings were in the first half and 53% were in the second half. So what you tend to see is slightly positive bias toward the back half just because cost savings build during the year. So that's typically the way it plays out. We have a couple other businesses, KCP and health care in particular, where distributors tend to have a much stronger December than January. And so there's a little bit of seasonal bias that pushes it that way as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess my thought was that the first half you would see much stronger gross margins, just given the easier comparisons and kind of where pulp has played out. Unless, is there any change in cadence for the organic sales, the 3% to 4%, should that be pretty steady every quarter? Or maybe the timing of innovation? I'm just wondering. That's why I was just a little curious why the second half would &#x2013; I understand the cost savings but why the second half would be stronger than the first half, especially with the gross margin kind of upside coming in the first half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the cost inflation should be much more favorable in the first half of the year especially as pulp is below our full-year estimate range. But some of the other factors -- you said timing of innovation and marketing investment related to that -- affect it as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; great And just the last question, I know last quarter you talked a bit about trade destocking <mark type="ph" /> in the batter CAGR (24:47). I was just wondering just generally speaking relationship with retailers, are you seeing anything in North America in particular right now just in terms of how retailers are managing the inventory, especially in a category like diapers where you are seeing softer trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say nothing abnormal at this time of the year. So, retailers everywhere just like companies like us are all trying to take days out of their cash conversion cycle. So you see that kind of push. But look, these are pretty high turn categories, so they can't afford to be out of stock either. So I think that's the balance point for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Morning, John.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was surprised you didn't call out the mix shift toward K-C International as a driver of margin decline in the Personal Care segment. Can you tell me either how operating margins compare in K-C International versus rest of world or how much of the margin decline is being driven by K-C International's rapid growth? Or is it really just not that material?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The mix shift from K-C International is not that material overall. And so we took a look at it and didn't think it was noteworthy enough to comment on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, this is Paul. Actually, just for the fourth quarter margins in K-C International Personal Care were up year-over-year. So the gap is closing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We got more price in Personal Care in the international business than we did in &#x2013; and obviously North America was negative, so that was part of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you. And then brings me to my second question which is I was hoping to learn more about the 7% price decrease in Europe Personal Care. Was that a promotion or list price and then I guess why make such a severe price investment when the volume growth in that region seemed to be pretty darn strong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's really more of a timing of promotion in Europe. As to when you're on deal, you typically have bigger discounts and higher volume spikes and it's more a function of how the trade in Europe wants to run the category. So, when you're on promotion, you're going to see that kind of a relationship.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the full year, you wouldn't see as big of a shift. It just happened that more of it was in the fourth quarter this year compared to last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the year, it was pretty flat in absolute dollar terms. And I don't know, Paul, if you've got the quarterly numbers <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:40)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is James Armstrong filling in for Chip. First question, why did the diluted share count increase at the end of the year? Was there something abnormal with the options or was something else going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we hit an all-time record stock price, so there was higher option exercise than normal in the fourth quarter. So, that was the primary factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we didn't buy shares in the fourth quarter which we expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. And then the other question I have is on tissue and pulp restructuring, you saw a $20 million benefit in 2011 and expect $30 million in 2012. First, am I right in assuming that is an incremental $30 million for 2012, for a total of $50 million? And then second, why is the improvement this gradual, specifically given the Everett mill is a giant discrete item, why wouldn't you see more of the $100 million in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good questions. The answer to your first question is yes, the $30 million is incremental to the $20 million. And the answer to the second question is -- given we knew where this was going, we really started taking steps to reduce spend at Everett in 2011, which is why we probably got more benefit in 2011 than maybe we were expecting at the time we started the restructuring. So, cutting maintenance spending, things like that that wouldn't have a benefit when you knew the facility was going to be closed or sold, we were able to get more benefit there in 2011 than we expected.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Javier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions. One, I think that Mark made a comment that you are looking to realize more diaper pricing going into 2012 and the question is, what needs to happen because we understood that the slip-on diaper introduction, the couponing, you probably already knew it and basically we should have seen more positive mix in the fourth quarter given that you reduced the diaper count. So, I'm kind of like confused, how come we see diaper pricing deterioration in the fourth quarter, but at the same time, Mark mentioned that you are looking for more pricing realization and the volumes are so weak? So I'm confused about your guidance and the way you're looking at the category in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I think in the fourth quarter we wound up spending more on coupons competitively to make sure that we had the right price value equation. Some of that was in response to our slip-on launch. Some of it was just the other activity that takes place in the category from time to time. So, we didn't realize as much of a price increase as we thought we would. We expect that to be better overall in 2012 as the pricing is in effect longer and we would expect to see more competitors' lineups to that over time. We'll see what happens in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but if your volumes were so weak with less pricing, what gives you confidence that you can realize more pricing? Shouldn't volumes even worsen if you take more pricing? I mean if volumes were down so much in the quarter, why say that if you take more pricing, volumes are now going to deteriorate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, our share overall was flat in the quarter. So we'd say we picked up some share with slip-ons and in our super premium segment. We've got some innovation coming in 2012 that will obviously strengthen our product lineup across the board and we believe that in the end, Mom wants the best diaper for her baby. And she'll choose Huggies with the product lineup that we have in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, on this planning assumption of pulp averaging $940 to $960 per ton in 2012, our pricing, the thing that we see in the pulp market is well below that, it's nearly over $100 per ton in January. So two questions here. Why is it that you are forecasting such a conservative pulp budget number? And secondly, coming back to the question whether &#x2013; your earnings progression should be front-end loaded instead of back-end loaded just because of given that the cost environment is such that you have the carryover of the pricing in 2011 and then you have &#x2013; you're lapping very high commodity increases last year. So I'm still also confused about how much of advertising spending you need to increase in order to make these earnest progressions back-end loaded again in 2012. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good questions. From a pulp forecasting standpoint, we look at the three major industry forecasters and average those, and that's basically what our process is. We don't try to outsmart the experts in this area. And so the experts are expecting China to come back and be a stronger buyer, and that's going to lead to higher fiber prices as 2012 progresses. We'll see if that takes place and we'll update you on our actual assumptions as we go through the year. We don't buy a lot of spot tonnage, but the current market price is below that, and so that will be a factor that will help the first part of the year. But there are other factors that will push us the other direction, and I think, as we said overall, our guidance is to be slightly back-half loaded, not usually so but a profile that's similar to what we saw in 2011.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I'm fond of saying, as long as it's not Focker, everything's good. A quick question for you, on the other income line, we saw a big favorable swing. I think it was about $0.13 or so this year. And just wondering as we look to map that out next year, it's going to be a relatively tough lap again, sort of more in the back half of the year which would argue for a little more of a front-end loaded year. But how do we think about that line item not just for 2012 but also sort of longer term to try and map that out a little bit better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the primary thing that goes in there on a normal basis is currency exchange &#x2013; or transaction gains and losses on currency hedges that we have in place. And so we had more gains this year which was a big driver. Our guess is as we look at plays in the currency market late in 2011, we'll likely have more losses on those lines in 2012. We also had a one-time effect. We sold a small healthcare joint venture that went in the fourth quarter. So that kind of stuff will pop in there from time to time, only those small gains or losses on things this year that happen to be gains. But in our guidance, we don't assume that any of those will take place in 2012. So that will also be a factor in the year-on-year earnings growth rate. We won't have as much good news in that line for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we're probably better off just going in predicting something closer to flat or plus or minus low singles and then kind of going from there? Is that the right way to look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say that sounds about right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you guys talked about the working capital improvement that you're projecting out. Can you walk us through it? Is that going to be something we should see relatively quickly? Or is that something you think is going to be sort of a slow build over the course of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be a slow build across the year. Inventories will be the key driver. We do have a lot of innovation coming to market which, as you know, depending on which business is launching, you're going to see some ebbs and flows as we build inventories to get ready for launch. But you should think of it as more gradual and its order of magnitude two to three days over the course of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Going back to inflation a little bit, can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of &#x2013; and expecting in terms of both wastepaper and resins and white pulp? If anything, wastepaper seems to have come off even sharper. Are you expecting that to rebound as you are with pulp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think our full-year forecast for wastepaper is higher than the current spot and that's when &#x2013; we hit an all-time record in September and then it dropped way off late in the fourth quarter. So we're currently seeing prices in the market that are below our full-year average. That one, we don't have ramping back up probably quite as much as pulp this year but there is still &#x2013; the forecast for that is to have some upward pressure as the year progresses. And resin, I'd say our current outlook for the year is slightly higher than the current prices we're paying. So we're really calling for oil in that &#x2013; what is it Paul, $90 to $100 a barrel kind of range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, $95.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, $95 to $105.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Polymer for the full year shouldn't be a big factor in the year-over-year comparisons. Pretty similar to 2011 average but as Tom mentioned, it's starting off the year a little lower than our full-year expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you talk a little bit about demand trends that you're seeing in K-C Professional around the world? Anything that makes you feel maybe a little bit better in terms of 2012 or a little bit worse, given how economically sensitive it is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess a couple of things. Our businesses in emerging markets is a place where we're putting a lot of focus. So we've got some aggressive growth plans in Latin America, places like China and Russia, so we're putting more sales people on the ground and we're really aggressively growing those areas. So we're certainly taking share and in some cases pioneering new category spaces. I would say Europe for lots of reasons, all of you are likely aware of, we would say is probably one that's looking like it's going to have a tougher economic growth year in 2012.</p>
          <p>We already have strong share positions there but the economic growth and the pricing environment in Europe is going to be tough. North America, a mixed bag. I think we're cautiously optimistic. We saw some progress in the fourth quarter in our washroom business. And we've got a lot of innovation coming in 2012. So we probably expect to see a fairly benign economic growth of very low single digit and we can hopefully do a little bit better than that in the North American market, particularly in places like safety and healthy workplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one last question. You mentioned the trade down in infant and child care and I'm wondering, one, was that mainly in terms of product or was it private label? And was that something you're seeing in any of your other product areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, private label shares actually for the full year were pretty flat and I think they were flatter down in all categories but one. In diapers, what you saw more was Pampers lost a little bit of share to Luvs. We picked up in our super premium segment behind the launch of our slip-on diapers and we gave it up out of our Tier Four business or our mainline business. But private label shares were fairly flat. I don't know, Paul, if you've got the data there?</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Connie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a couple more questions on your outlook for commodities. It strikes me also that natural gas is at a decade low and I think electric rates might also be lower than they were in the last year. Can you tell us what your outlook on those is? And if costs come in better than your forecast, is it your intention to reinvest it? Or to drop it to earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good questions. I mean natural gas; I think our outlook is what Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$300 to $350.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's a little higher than the current spot prices. Obviously, we also buy a lot of gas around the world and so that is just a U.S. price and there is more variability around that. For every dollar and BTU, it's what $16 million or something on a full-year basis? So it can be a big impact. Now we are at least partially hedged going into 2012, so we're typically hedging 12 to 18 months out on a rolling basis. So not all of that will drop directly to the bottom line. Part of it we'll have locked in to protect against spikes.</p>
          <p>From a pricing standpoint, I mean it's our intention to take the benefit of the commodity costs where we can. Obviously if it shifts too much, you'll start to see market pricing adjust in some categories and that can be an offset. We already have our strategic marketing plan laid out for the year and know where we want to spend it and what we're going to spend it on. So we'll focus on that, but if we have benefit from commodity costs over that, we'll risk surprising you on the upside.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you describe how business does in terms of demand or takeaway or market share when the balance of strategic spending, say promotion versus tilted more towards advertising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the question was broken up just a little bit, Connie. Were you asking how's the business plan looking at it with strategic marketing versus trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's not how, it's more of what's your experience in terms of demand or market share when the plan is more towards advertising versus promotion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that one of the exciting things about the plan is it's not just advertising by itself. Its advertising coupled with some great innovation aimed at a specific consumer need area. And so, we've got great innovation in the market that we're supporting now and we've got more coming in 2012. And so, we're going to spend behind those big ideas and what we've seen is when we do that you have stories like U by Kotex where you can pick up share in a marketplace. And so that's what the plan is in 2012 is to continue to invest behind innovation, invest behind our brands in emerging markets. And that's a more sustainable way to create growth going forward.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Lauren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple things, so first was just on the businesses and then personal care that aren't infant and child care. So, I know wipes tend to be a bit choppy depending on timing of promotions and such, but both fem care and adult care decelerated. Adult care, I would have thought you have kind of the follow-on benefit of the Poise launch at the end of last quarter. And it's the first time we've seen fem care volume down slightly. Comps have been tough for a while, so any additional color you can add there would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, probably the timing of innovation, we have a lot of innovation coming in fem care in 2012, and so we probably had a little lighter promotional calendar than normal. And we're saving up our dry powder for that activity which is going to hit later this year. And adult care, I'd say overall shares look good and the promotional calendar was a little lighter around some of the same phenomenon. We've got some innovation coming particularly in North America on that front. So both businesses had a solid year overall and look like they've got a great growth plan for 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the fem care piece, was U by Kotex volumes still up or was that part down as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No, U by Kotex was still up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the adult &#x2013; I'm just curious because the Poise launch happened at the end of the quarter. So was there any kind of shifting of promotional dollars also because of the competitive dynamics in child and infant care? Was that part of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, really not. We laid out the plan for those businesses and executed the plan. I think despite the challenges in infant and child care, one of the things our North American team did a great job on this year is really insulate the key innovations. So whether it was cool touch or some of the new Cottonelle variants or some of the things that we launched independent of Poise, we did those really per the plan that we tested.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then K-C International, I know the growth is still quite strong especially relative to developed markets but there was a pretty significant deceleration sequentially. So, just what were the biggest win factors there? And the comp wasn't particularly tough. You had Venezuela in the numbers last year. So as we look forward, are we thinking high-single digits or is this going back to double-digit growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think that's the right range. If you look at our business in China, Latin America, those did very, very well. There's other parts of the world that aren't as strong. Australia, for example, had a very relatively soft volume quarter. Korea still looks quite strong. So there was nothing fundamental in the numbers that I saw that was dry. I don't know, Paul, if you have any other color for Lauren?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just the one other thing that happened in Q4, Lauren, was we started to roll off a little bit of some the price increases that helped boost the numbers in the third quarter, but volumes continued to grow nicely and high-single digit growth overall for the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then on restructuring, so the additional North America Tissue piece, can you tell us more about what that facility is? Is it more private label or is it branded capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it's &#x2013; Chester is a large tissue facility in the Northeast that has served the heritage Scott Tissue and Scott Towel business for many, many years and it's really a testimony to our Consumer Tissue supply chain team that as they've driven Lean into our organization and freed up capacity, they're able to take some capacity out of that facility and still service our business with our remaining assets. And so we challenge them to continue to improve margin and find ways to improve their cost structure and they've served up some really exciting ideas for us this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. And my final thing, sorry, was just on share repurchase. So my memory is that last quarter when you talked about making the bigger pension contribution and holding back on repo in the fourth quarter, that the expectation was a sort of above normal year for repurchase in 2012. And just the numbers you've laid out, strong, but fairly typical actually. So what's changed in your thought process in share repurchase for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Lauren, I think on a typical basis, we might buy back 700 million to 800 million of shares. We're at 900 million to 1 billion this year. If we have additional cash that we can bring back effectively, we'll probably &#x2013; there's a chance we could be a little bit above that. But it's consistent with the plan we laid out in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Great. Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Our next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have a follow-up question about your first half versus second half guidance. I think you said the year's going to be second half weighted similarly to 2011. So that means the year-over-year increases in earnings are likely to be even throughout the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, similarly, yeah. That sounds about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And your guidance is for an increase in your SG&amp;A ratio driven largely by intensified marketing it sounds like. Is that going to be weighted entirely to Personal Care? We had in the fourth quarter spending between the line in Tissue was down and promotions were also not a factor off the top line for Tissue. So I'm just wondering if the increase in spending is all weighted to Personal Care in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably heavier weighted to Personal Care. We've got more innovation coming in baby, child care and adult care and feminine care in 2012, but where we have innovation on Cottonelle or Kleenex around the world, we'll spend behind those ideas as well. I think the &#x2013; and on the selling expense front, we are also adding selling expense capability for our KC Professional and Health Care businesses as we grow those businesses internationally especially. So you'll see a little bit of a push in that line. And we're trying to manage the rest of our G&amp;A to grow at a slower rate than sales if we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we assume that SG&amp;A in Tissue is up versus 2011? The ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of including strategic marketing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that intensifying SG&amp;A ratio applies to Personal Care and Tissue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my final question is about margins for Personal Care. I think you said that in 2012, you should get to the average margin for 2011. Does that mean that we should see for all of 2012 the same or similar margin for Personal Care as the entirety of 2011 or are we only going to get to the average of 2011 by the end of 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think for a full year basis, that's the right target and so that's what we're aiming at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the idea is margins might be down in the first half and up in the second for Personal Care?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It certainly is our comparison to be tougher in the first half, that's for sure. And so you should expect to see more of the year-over-year quarterly improvement happen in the second half, just because the comparisons will be a lot easier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then since we've got even EPS increases through the year overall now, does that mean that operating margins might be up more for Tissue in the first half than the second as sort of an offset to what happens in Personal Care?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Typically, with the lower pulp costs, you're going to get more benefit of that in Tissue in the first part of the year, that's for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we sort of got reversed trends in terms of margin comps in Tissue from Personal Care?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first half of the year, that's probably correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>I'm good. I just wanted to get a little deeper into the reinvestment you're going to make. If I look at marketing research, G&amp;A as a percentage of sales, I'd expect a lot of time, historically around 17%, crept its way up to 18.6% in 2010, came back down again in 2011. And I guess for your guidance to work, for operating profit to grow 3% to 6% and for gross profit to grow more than that, in other words, if we assume your guidance on gross profit and for your EPS guidance to make sense, you need MR&amp;A, basically MRG&amp;A]to be that kind of historical highs in 2010? And I guess, can you talk a little bit about that and is that right and is that maybe why we're seeing the organic sales guidance at plus 3% to 4% which is essentially an acceleration in a pretty tough environment?</p>

We're building out our platform and we're going to continue to invest despite the challenging economic environment.

And I guess can you give a little color around, I guess, the disaggregation between launch spending and I guess you made reference to capabilities, building capabilities in the press release, and I think you just said something about building up in Latin America. Can you just talk, I guess, about how you might think about the breakout between those two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean in terms of how much it is one time versus how much of it is a part of a long-term plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Essentially, yeah. How much is advertising behind new product launches and how much of it is just building up a sales force in places where you want to be more aggressive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say more of it is strategic marketing, and a much smaller percentage of it would be building up sales capability. And so it is like you said, a healthy model is where we're bringing margin accretive innovation to market and enhancing our gross margin and reinvesting a part of that every year and higher strategic marketing spending. We haven't always been able to do that because of the commodity volatility we've faced and the difficulty we've had in getting price increases to offset that. And so this is another step forward in that direction but it's one that we think is a journey that if we continue to drive innovation at the right level, we'll be strategically investing in the business long-term.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's helpful. I guess one last thing, can you try to help us out, I guess, directionally on what you think pension expense year-on-year in 2012 will be, and what you think the FX drag, from a profit perspective, would be? I mean even if you had it in basis points for us, margin grade, EPS, pending, either way would be good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The pensions should be pretty flat. We put enough money in the plan last year, and as you know, we took some actions several years ago to really wind up or freeze our DB plans, so that we don't have as big of an impact. We moved everybody into a defined contribution plan in the U.S. So that isn't as big of a factor as it may have &#x2013; would have been in previous years. And FX, I don't know, Paul, if you've got any color on that from a percentage drag?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you look at just translation, it could be a couple points of operating profit headwind. And transaction is harder to quantify precisely, but it's probably in that ballpark as well. So overall, currency's going to be a mid-single-digit drag on results next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And from the profit side, some of that I expect in gross margin or in COGS, and some of it's also in between the lines. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And some of it might wind up in the other income expense line or the transaction part where we had gains this year and we may have losses next year.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, I know you talked about private label trends in diapers this year, but if you look back to like 2008 until now, it looks like private label took about four points of market share. Do you think that's cyclical or is that a change in the consumer's mindset on the diapers side, because obviously it's a lot of volume that's going away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, our total category view would not be that significant. Actually it spiked up in early '08 when &#x2013; by a couple of points &#x2013; when the economy turned south and then it has shifted back down. So you might be looking at &#x2013; some of the measured outlook data might look a little different but on an all outlet basis that we look at, I don't know &#x2013; Paul's got the numbers in front of him.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about a 1.5 increase, Bill, from 2008 to today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean that's a big increase though, right? Especially because it's such a capacity utilization gain in diapers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I would say it's not a trivial increase but it is one that we continue to be focused on. We've got to be competitive across all spectrums. I would say if you look back to a little longer perspective when I was running the diaper business in the early '90s, I think private label shares were up in the mid-20s and so they actually have come down over the long-term, even though they have spiked up a little bit in recent terms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then just on pricing, again, broadly it seems like it's really schizophrenic. So I mean if you look in the UK and it's only a quarter of data, but it seems like you guys had a 12% price decrease in diapers. I mean is that really just timing and promotions? Can you kind of do it category by category? Tissue use is way up; Proctor's was flat. I mean can we read anything in terms of like is there going to be a consistent pricing across the industry or kind of what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you because you've got both trade as a reduction of sales and consumer coupon values as a reduction of sales, and we add all of that up into a net plus or minus price number, you're going to have more volatility there. And so there really wasn't any list price changes in Europe. It was all a combination of trade and couponing and the same is true in the U.S. So you're going to have more volatility in those numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. So we shouldn't &#x2013; it doesn't suggest that there's a change in strategy in Europe? I mean you want to optimize, get to that double-digit operating profit number and then take it from there. Is that still the end ball in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the tax rate, like you said before you're generating all this cash overseas and you're going to continue to repatriate &#x2013; pay the dividend and what not. I mean is the tax rate for next year the new base or will it kind of go up every single year because more and more cash is coming from overseas and has to be repatriated every year? And the reason I ask that is because if that's the case because it looks like the sort of evergreen, 6% to 9% EPS growth algorithm, it's still in place but you lose kind of two points on tax, and is there going to be a two point tax hit every year now going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so. I think what you'd typically see is probably &#x2013; and Mark's looking at me, so I'll let him correct my estimate here, but I would say we've assumed in our plans something like a 30 to 40 basis point increase in the effective rate over time. It makes sense. Actually we came in at the low end of our range this year. Next year is more kind of the normal level that you'd expect. And so we've got to go do tax planning and see if we can improve on that. We don't have those visibilities on those at this point, but I don't know, Mark, if you want to add more color to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's right. If you look at the last 10 years' taxes, it's been a help to our algorithm looking forward. It's probably going to be a little bit of a drag, but I think that the good news is from an operating standpoint, the business we've got between innovation and marketing support, we should be able to have more of an operating earnings driven plan. But our tax team works hard. We worked hard to get to the bottom end of the range this year and we'll work hard to get to the bottom end of the range next year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a couple of quick things. Can you tell us what's going on in Mexico and what you think the outlook is for that? And also just elaborate a little bit on the Venezuela risk and then I just want to clarify, are you &#x2013; is there very little risk of a down first quarter? Because again, it seems like you did say it's going to be a back-end loaded year. I just want to understand what the risk is in the first quarter if you could help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep, sure. On Mexico, I assume you're talking about Kimberly-Clark de Mexico &#x2013; and so we have a very strong business there. They had a little tougher finish to the year where they got hit in the fourth quarter with a weaker peso and high commodity costs. And they didn't get much price realization. They're expecting a better year in 2012 as the peso should improve a bit on a relative basis and they should be able to get some pricing. So we're expecting that to be a positive.</p>
          <p>Venezuela is one that obviously with the presidential election this year; it's difficult to say what exactly will happen there. It's only about 1% of our sales and about 3% of our operating profit and so it's not a huge factor for us and it's one that we're watching and managing very closely. With regard to the first quarter, we don't really give specific quarterly guidance anymore, and so we'll give you a full year guidance and a little bit of a perspective on the profile and then every quarter, we'll update you on how we did. So that's really the message we have going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

          <p>And then just, sorry, to follow on the retail environment, when they see pulp prices down as much as they are, are you &#x2013; do you tend to encounter some pressure to withdraw pricing or to fund sales in any other way as retailer driven?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even at our current pricing levels, the current level of pulp costs would support that, and so we never really were priced up for the peak. And much of the pricing went into effect at pulp price levels that are pretty similar to where they are now. That doesn't mean they don't call and ask, but we have a very good story when they do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. It's actually me this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Chip, you're back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Happy New Year to you. Hey, listen, I'm having &#x2013; I just wanted to &#x2013; I have a little difficulty in reconciling the year. If we look at your pulp forecast, which is spot on to what RISI said 2011 was for NBSK, $951. And so we just made a simple extrapolation that the two tissue segments were roughly flat, 11% to 12%, and I'm not saying that, but just roughly. That would mean that the Personal Care business would have to really surge back in 2012 to a record, like $1.8 billion in terms of EBIT to get you there. And so it just seems like if I take your pulp forecast and assume nothing else heroic happens in KC Professional or Consumer Tissue, you're going to have to see quite a turnaround from the rate of earnings that you saw in PC in the second half which was actually under $1.5 billion. So is there a different way you would encourage us to think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would say assuming that KC Professional and Consumer Tissue were flat year on year would probably be an incorrect set of assumptions. So we wouldn't think that was an acceptable plan, and the people that we have running those businesses wouldn't either. So no, we would expect to have a decent growth year in both KCP and Consumer Tissue in 2012. We have lots of cost savings coming through. We got more restructuring savings coming through. We've got lots of brands activity going on. So I'd expect to see a positive growth year in both those segments of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so even if they both were up about 10%, which would be $130 million, you would still have to have a number that approaches the 2010 level for Personal Care to get to, at least on my calculations, to the low end. So I guess even then you're still saying you expect a nice recovery in Personal Care during 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we talked &#x2013; I mean getting back &#x2013; we got a lot of innovation coming, lots of investment behind that, but getting back to a margin that is roughly equivalent to the full-year segment average in 2011 would be a big turnaround in that business this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second little question I had was I noticed two things. Do you actually disclose or can you tell us how much natural gas you use, at least in the U.S. and maybe outside the U.S. every year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, natural gas, we use about 16 million &#x2013; or 16 million MBTUs a year, so every dollar &#x2013; and an MBTU is about $16 million in cost, and that's really just North America. We don't have &#x2013; I don't think we've given statistics outside of that. I don't know, Paul, if you've got any other rules of thumb for them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The global number including the U.S. would be about twice that amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you also mentioned, I don't have it in front of me, but the other fiber that you use beyond pulp, I believe was $1.4 million, which was a lot higher than what I think we'd been using in the past. And I didn't know if that is just &#x2013; I would imagine most of that kind of is reflecting the growth outside of the U.S. in Consumer and KC Professional. Is that basically it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's basically right. I'd say that number's been kind of creeping up. It was $1.2 million not that long ago, but now it's up to about $1.4 million, and so it just reflects growth in KCP. And in some cases, recovered fiber is a pretty significant source of fiber for our consumer business as well in some markets.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking this follow-up. I have a question with regards again to the Personal Care business, the diaper business in North America. Number one, if you can tell us how much of the decline in volumes has to do with the change in diaper count and also whether these allocation or these changes in inventory for retailers, the $30 million that you commented in the release, is disproportionately allocated to diapers. I'm just trying to understand what is the underlying industry growth in diapers given that you're saying that you didn't lose share, but again high-single digit volume growth is pretty high. So I don't think that. I'm just trying to reconcile this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the $30 million was really a cost of down time in the quarter. And so that was our &#x2013; the cost of idling facilities and that was spread across our business in various places as our teams &#x2013; really they focus on hitting inventory at a target level and if they're at target level then they shut machines down, whatever business that is in the world. And so some of that fell on our baby/child care business as our volumes underperformed expectations.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the reconciliation of our volume in the quarter versus our share, I mean there's a lot of factors that affect that, as I'm sure you know. I mean our mix was positive and so that helped us from a share standpoint. But other than that, we really haven't got the analytics yet to unpack everything that happened from a volume standpoint. So some part of its trade inventory, some part of its consumer household inventory, etc.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The reduction in diaper count doesn't have an impact on your volume growth or in the way you measure volume growth or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Because we're measuring thousands of diapers in our volume count. But if you think about it, consumers buying a package with 7% fewer diapers in it. And so on average in their home, their household inventory drops, but usually you'd save maybe about half of that and based on historical count reductions would be the impact that you'd have in the period that you did the count reduction. Because if you said okay, on average consumers got a half a bag in their household, that bag has 7% fewer diapers. So half of that would be 3.5%. But this quarter, we had a bigger volume drop and so part of that was the comp change, and probably part of it was mix. Some part of it was retailer inventory changes. It's hard to digest which piece of that exactly took place here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me phrase it differently then. What is your assumption for underlying diaper growth or contraction in North America going into 2012? Down 2%, down 3% because of the lower birth rate? What is the industry growing at or declining at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you looked at full year 2011, it was down 4%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
