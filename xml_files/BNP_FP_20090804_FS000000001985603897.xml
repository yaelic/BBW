        <plist>
          <p>Well, good afternoon, everybody. We are here to comment on the second quarter result of BNP Paribas, and I'll be talking with Jean-Laurent Bonnaf&#xE9;, Chief Operating Officer; and Philippe Bordenave, our CFO. And the key messages I think for the second quarter are that BNP Paribas has confirmed its strong profit generation capacity with a net income Group share of &#x20AC;1.6 billion. And the operating performances were altogether very good. We have had a high cost of risk in this quarter, but very much in line as we'll see with the first quarter. And the Fortis integration is really proceeding very well since the 12th of May and has also made a significant first contribution to Group profit.</p>
          <p>The Fortis acquisition and the organic growth over the last two quarters have taken the Group to a new dimension, but also with the solvency very much strengthened, the Tier 1 ratio stands at 9.3% as of the end of June, against the 8.8% as of the end of March. The Group consolidated figures are not really well, relevant to &#x2013; I mean, to be compared to the previous quarters, because of the Fortis first time integration and also because of a significant exceptional one-off, on which I will come back in a second. We've just &#x2013; we see here the 1.6 billion net income Group share, which is a substantial figure, and confirms the profit generation capacity of the Group.</p>
          <p>In this second quarter, we have had two, well, some special events. The first contribution of Fortis Bank, now called BNP Paribas Fortis to the net income Group share for &#x20AC;261 million. We'll get back to it in more detail. And some one-off items booked in the Corporate Centre for a significant amount. First of them obviously is the badwill from the acquisition of BNP Paribas Fortis for &#x20AC;815 million. That is certainly a positive figure, which is significant. And goodwill impairments for a negative &#x20AC;524 million, of which &#x20AC;257 million relate to Personal Finance, &#x20AC;123 million, well, which relates to the entire goodwill of UkrSibbank, which is written off to zero, and &#x20AC;105 million relates to part of the goodwill that's attached to Arval, our car fleet management company.</p>
          <p>On top of these goodwill impairments, we have also had significant write-downs on shares this quarter for a total amount of 440 million, of which 282 million relates to Shinhan. Shinhan BNP Paribas has eight points &#x2013; just about 8% stake in the capital of Shinhan for a total amount of around &#x20AC;1 billion. The share price in won is still above the price we've paid that the exchange rate between the euro and the won has &#x2013; well, has been impacted by very weakened won. And this is why we have impaired this equity stake for &#x20AC;282 million this quarter. The rest of the impairments from 282 to 440 relates to some other equity stakes we have in some large industrial companies and also to some private equity participations. And last is &#x2013; in this quarter, is the own debt revaluation, which was a negative &#x20AC;237 million, and these are the one-off items booked in the Corporate Centre.</p>
          <p>And consequently, I think it's better to comment the results for the second quarter at the operating divisions level, therefore excluding BNP Paribas Fortis and the Corporate Centre. Here you see that the revenues stand at just above &#x20AC;9 billion, 20% over the second quarter of last year revenues and down only 3% to the very strong revenues of the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses up 5.5% to last year, therefore providing the Group with a very significant positive jaws effect of close to 15 points, which results in very strong gross operating income at over &#x20AC;4 billion, up 45% compared to the second quarter of last year and very close, actually only down 0.7% to &#x2013; very similar to the first quarter gross operating income.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk is just above &#x20AC;2 billion, very much increased compared to the last year second quarter figure, but in line with the first quarter which stood at above &#x20AC;1.8 billion. Therefore at the operating income level, we have over &#x20AC;2 billion figure, which is only &#x2013; which is down only 5% to the second quarter of last year. And so altogether, because of the very strong operating results at the gross operating income level, we have compensated 95% of the increase in the cost of risk compared to second quarter of last year, Therefore, having just a 5% reduction in the operating income.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenues, always at the operating level, Retail Banking activities had a 4.8% growth in revenues. We have a good sales and strong marketing drive in a, well, difficult economic environment. Investment Solutions, the revenues are down 13.5% compared to the second quarter of last year, well, falling equity markets have had &#x2013; have impacted the revenues, even &#x2013; that was limited by the good level of net asset inflows that we have incurred in that division.</p>
          <p>Corporate Investment Banking for sure had another very strong quarter with &#x20AC;3.3 billion of revenues, up 80% to second quarter of last year, still driven by very strong client activity on markets this quarter. So altogether, a very much strengthened franchise and we've gained market share altogether in our different businesses.</p>
          <p>Costs; I think the cost management has been proactive and rigorous. For Retail Banking, the French Retail Banking costs are down 0.5%. The BNL bc costs are up, well, for limited 0.2%, and Personal Finance costs are down 0.4%. For all of those businesses, we have done better than our targeted positive jaws effect, well, for the first half of this year. And in Investment Solutions, operating expenses are down 2.5% compared to the second quarter of last year. And last but not least, for Corporate Investment Banking, we had a record cost/income ratio at 43.8% this quarter, certainly one of the best in the industry, and very much below our medium-term target of 60% cost/income ratio over the cycle.</p>
          <p>At Group level, excluding &#x2013; at constant scope and exchange rate and excluding variable compensations, the costs are down &#x2013; the operating expenses are down 0.2% for the first half compared to the first half of last year, which make us confirm our objective for the full year to stabilize costs in the same &#x2013; for the same constant scope and exchange rate and excluding variable compensations. So with that, I think that was regarding costs what I wanted to highlight.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to the cost of risk. Cost of risk at Group level for the second quarter stands at 144 basis points, very much in line with the three last quarters, which were respectively, 145 basis points for the third quarter of last year, 180 for the last quarter of last year, and 128 basis points for the first quarter of this year. The cost of risk has seen contrasted trends; first, with the cost of risk related to capital markets and counterparty risk, we've seen a confirmed moderation there. The 23 basis points for the second quarter are very much in line with the 19 basis points for the first quarter of this year, and much below the 80 basis points that we had encountered in this respect for the third and last quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>On the other side &#x2013; on the other hand, the contribution of the credit portfolio to the Group cost of risk has been rising since the &#x2013; and has been at high levels since the third quarter of last year. It stands at 122 basis points for the second quarter of this year compared to 109 for the first quarter, 104 for the fourth quarter of last year. And I think that is what we could say about the risk level at &#x2013; for the Group.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the different businesses, what we see is that for the French Retail Banking, the cost of risk for the second quarter stands at &#x20AC;133 million, this is up &#x20AC;93 million to the very low base of the second quarter of 2008 and up &#x20AC;41 million compared to the first quarter of this year. We've seen a rise in particular in the corporate and entrepreneur segments. Well, the picture is very similar in Italy for BNL. The cost of risk there stands at &#x20AC;144 million. This is &#x20AC;78 million higher than the very low base of the second quarter of 2008 and &#x20AC;37 million over the first quarter level. And again, there was a rise in particular in the corporate and entrepreneur segments.</p>
          <p>Personal Finance, the cost of risk stands at &#x20AC;461 million for the second quarter, which is 40 million more than the first quarter of this year, but very much higher than the second quarter of last year, &#x20AC;187 million over. We've seen here &#x2013; we see here the impact of the rising unemployment, well, all over Europe and the economic slowdown on the cost of risk for Personal Finance.</p>
          <p>BancWest, the cost of risk for the second quarter stands at &#x20AC;300 million. This is, well, not much higher than the first quarter of this year, which stood at &#x20AC;280 million, so it's only 20 million more, but it's &#x20AC;176 million more than the second quarter of 2008. We've seen in &#x2013; at BancWest a stabilization of the specific risk on the credit portfolio compared to the first quarter of this year in the second quarter, but we have had additional impairment charges on the investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>Regarding Emerging Markets Retail &#x2013; Retail Banking in emerging markets, cost of risk for the second quarter stands at &#x20AC;195 million, which is equivalent of 293 basis points. And this is, well, much higher than last year, &#x20AC;173 million, compared to again there a very low base for the second quarter of 2008, and it is &#x20AC;33 million higher than the first quarter. It is really concentrated in &#x2013; on two zones, Ukraine, where we've had &#x20AC;118 million, the crisis in Ukraine is still very deep, and we will come back to that how we manage our operations there. And in the Gulf, it was more of a one-off provision, and I don't think we have a significant deterioration altogether there. And elsewhere, we've seen no significant deterioration whether in Turkey or in Maghreb or in other places, where we do have emerging markets in the &#x2013; Retail Banking in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>And as for CIB financing businesses, there the cost of risk is &#x20AC;447 million for the second quarter. It is, well, very similar to the first quarter rate with &#x20AC;27 million lower and that result in 121 basis points for the second quarter, which compares not very similar to the 117 basis points of the first quarter. And of this &#x20AC;447 million, I think it's &#x2013; we can notice especially &#x20AC;109 million on LBOs. On LBOs, may I remind you that we have an exposure of nine &#x2013; of &#x20AC;8.6 billion, very diversified on 400 different files, 95% is the very senior debt. And we have had like a dozen different LBOs that were provisioned for that overall amount of &#x20AC;109 million. Our overall stock of provision on LBOs stands now at over &#x20AC;1 billion from the portfolio of &#x20AC;8.6 billion.</p>
          <p>The other provision to notice is 103 million provision in the Gulf, they are also more of a one-off. I think that this is the impact of the slowdown of the global economy that we've seen, well, in the second quarter in a way similar to what we've seen already in the CIB financing businesses for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax income, Retail Banking stands at close to &#x20AC;600 million, 595. Well, that compares to the &#x20AC;750 million in the first quarter, &#x20AC;536 million in fourth quarter of last year. That, well &#x2013; significant, well &#x2013; much lower than the &#x20AC;1.1 billion of pre-tax profit of the second quarter of last year, prior to the increase in the cost of risk in our retail operations, because of the impact of the recession and slowdown that we've seen, since the &#x2013; especially, since the third and then fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Investment Solutions, &#x20AC;319 million, pre-tax profit. It is 30% &#x2013; 40% lower than the second quarter of last year at 536, but it has increased each quarter since the third quarter of last year. You see the 134, 210 for the first quarter of last year, 302 first quarter, and so it's rebounding from &#x2013; since the third quarter of last year. Now as far as CIB, 1.1 billion &#x2013; over &#x20AC;1.1 billion, well, just below the &#x20AC;1.2 billion of the first quarter, but still a very strong result compared to the &#x20AC;500 million of pre-tax profit for CIB in the second quarter of last year. So altogether, profitability held up well in all key businesses.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to divisions, as regard Corporate Investment Banking, again the revenues at &#x20AC;3.3 billion are down well 9% first quarter, up 80% to the second quarter of last year. I think, the first comment is we've had strong revenues altogether in capital markets, with very strong business accompanied by a new decline in market risks. Our value at risk stood at &#x20AC;111 million for the last quarter of last year, &#x20AC;69 million for the first quarter of this year and down then to &#x20AC;52 million for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Fixed income had still very strong revenues at &#x20AC;1.9 billion. Equity and advisory returned to good level of revenues, &#x20AC;710 million against &#x20AC;33 million only in the first quarter, so a very much &#x2013; a much more balanced contribution of respectively fixed income and equity derivatives in the second quarter. And financing businesses kept strong revenues, especially in acquisition finance and commodity and trade finance.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses were 1.5% down compared to the second quarter of last year at constant scope and exchange rates and excluding variable compensation. And the cost of risk, well, as already mentioned, altogether cost of risk for the second quarter at &#x20AC;744 million very comparable to the first quarter at &#x20AC;700 million, both for capital markets and for financing businesses. And also this cost of risk pre-tax income once again very strong figure, &#x20AC;1,145 million. And so this is &#x2013; I think, this is very successful repositioning of Corporate and Investment Banking, especially in capital markets we have &#x2013; has announced significantly reduced our market risks.</p>
          <p>In fixed income, we have had again the number one position in euro-denominated bond issues. The investor demand was very strong, you see, and we all know that we have had a significant tightening of the credit spreads over the quarter. And the bid/offer spread have remained still wide, but they have started to tighten.</p>
          <p>Equity and advisory, we had returned to normal business, thanks to the adapting of the size of the books to the new market environment achieved in the first quarter. Strong demand from institutional and pick up activity in &#x2013; from hedge fund. And in primary market, we acted often as bookrunner for a number of key issues. So altogether, strong client businesses, mostly on flow products in an environment where our markets were gradually normalizing.</p>
          <p>Investment Solutions, I think, the key here is strong asset inflows. And the strong asset inflow can be measured that the second quarter is still &#x20AC;6.5 billion, and that altogether makes the net asset flow at &#x20AC;20 billion for the first half of this year. It's in asset management, it's in wealth management, and it's in insurance, so every key business has been &#x2013; has had enjoyed significant net asset inflows. Therefore, the assets under management have gone from &#x20AC;510 billion end of March to &#x20AC;544 million (sic) (&#x20AC;544 billion) end of June, which is an increase of 6.7%. We had a positive performance effect due to the rise in indices, but the net asset inflow, and on top of that a scope effect which was the inclusion of Insinger de Beaufort as part of our private banking operations in Holland. So the franchise appeal has been, well &#x2013; is illustrated by the strong net asset inflow.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenues, revenues are down 13.5% compared to second quarter of last year, but up 5% compared with the first quarter. In wealth and asset management, the decline in revenue is due to the lower average margin due to the large share of money market funds and to the drop in transaction volumes. In insurance, we've had the effect on the fall of equity market, so the revenues are down 23%. And in securities, we've had the effect of the drop in value and the contraction of net interest margin.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses, already commented, down 2.5% compared to second quarter of last year, and so the pre-tax income down 40% to the second quarter of last year, but up 5% compared to the first quarter at &#x20AC;320 million. So we see a start of a rebound helped by recovering markets in revenues as in pre-tax profits for Investment Solutions.</p>
          <p>I'll now give the floor to Jean-Laurent Bonnaf&#xE9; to comment on the retail operations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. So for French Retail Banking, this quarter was characterized by strong sales and marketing drive within French Retail Banking. Deposits were up 7.8% over the second quarter 2008, led by an accelerated growth inside deposits, and loans were up &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; and loans were upped by 5.4% over the same period, all customer segments contributing positively to this performance. In this context, revenues held up well with 1.1% growth. Net interest income rose 7.6%, thanks to good intermediation business, whereas fees dropped 6.6%, as financial fees continued to decrease under the effect of an adverse environment.</p>
          <p>Operating efficiencies further improved this quarter as expenses declined by 0.5%, generating 1.6 positive jaws above our early guidance of 1%. Gross operating income therefore grew by 4% and pre-tax income dropped 14.5% as a result of the rise in the cost of risk, as previously mentioned. So this is for French Retail Banking.</p>
          <p>As for BNL is concerned, BNL continued to win new customers at a faster pace than previously, rose 34,000 for the first half of 2009 loans. Outstanding loans progressed well, since they grew 6.7% over the second quarter of 2009 (sic) [2008] . Contrary to what happened in the Italian market as a whole, BNL recorded positive net asset inflows in life insurance, as well as in mutual funds.</p>
          <p>Revenues posted a 5.3% increase as a result of increased lending, better deposit mix, increased cash management fees from corporates along with better cross-selling, and mitigated as for France by a decline in financial fees. Operating expenses were stable compared to the same period last year generating a positive jaws effect of over five points. As a result, the cost/income ratio has dropped by 10% over three years, a significant achievement. Pre-tax income at 145 million was down 22.5% as a result of the rising cost of risk as previously mentioned here.</p>
          <p>For BancWest, while revenues at BancWest were down by 1.4% compared to second quarter 2008, mainly as a result of the drop in net interest margin. Loans outstanding grew 4.3%, but recorded a drop over the first quarter 2009 as a result of tighter budget origination policies. Operating expenses grew by 12% compared to second quarter 2008. This drops to minus 2.2 should we exclude all FDIC assessments, as well as the restructuring costs.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that the cost cutting plan aims for 100 U.S. savings on a yearly basis, the first impact of which are being felt this quarter. Pre-tax income stood at minus 70 million versus 115 a year ago as a result of the sharp increase in the cost of risk. Then further efforts have been achieved this quarter to adapt BancWest to the U.S. crisis.</p>
          <p>For emerging markets, customer gains continued at a high pace this quarter with a net increase of 150,000 new customers. Revenues were up only by 0.9% compared to second quarter 2008, and revenues declined in Ukraine. Loans were up 1%, while deposits grew faster at plus 3%. Investment continued at an adjusted pace leading to 2.9% growth in operating expenses, and as a result of a high cost of risk primarily in Ukraine, pre-tax income stood at minus 39 million versus 147 a year ago.</p>
          <p>We have continued to adapt quickly to worsened environment, particularly in Ukraine where we have reduced our spendings, closed branches, and reduced staffing levels. We have recapitalized UkrSibbank and raised our stake and now own 81% of the bank.</p>
          <p>Finally, personal finance. Personal finance enjoyed a strong revenue growth at plus 12.6% over the second quarter 2008. The commercial terms of certain partnerships were improved and refinancing costs were lower.</p>
          <p>Outstanding grew by 7.2%, but were flat compared to the first quarter of this year, the result as for BancWest of tighter origins and policies. Despite the strong revenue growth, operating expenses were kept down, minus 0.4%. Personal finance in fact is benefiting from the full effects of the cost cutting plan implemented last year and a further plan has now been launched.</p>
          <p>Gross operating income thus grew close to 30%. Pre-tax income stood at 130 million as a result of sharp rise in cost of risk, plus 187 million compared to second quarter 2008. And finally, we are pleased to announce that we have come to an agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo over Findomestic and we'll acquire controlling stake in the company. We will now be able to rollout the Italy BNP Paribas integrated banking model and start cross selling with the BNL bc for the retail banking of BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>Now for Fortis, just a word about the integration calendar; till the closing of the deal we've been operating under a clear integration calendar, you can see in the slide. The top management of the bank was appointed in the very early days following the close, right away 61 tax forces involving 400 persons from both companies have been performing a top-down assessment of the integration to come.</p>
          <p>This first phase was finalized by the end of June and provide us with an initial assessment of synergy opportunities and integration-related costs. Since then a bottom up assessment phase involving about 3,500 people has been launched. They are currently working out the operating model of the bank as well as the target organization.</p>
          <p>The second phase will also provide us by the end of October with a clear view on synergies and integration costs. At that point in time, the rollout and implementation phase will begin with more than 1,000 projects, individual projects, we'll then communicate the details of the industrial plan on December, the 1. So this is for the integration process in two words.</p>
          <p>Contribution to the Group's results. We stress that we present here the contribution of the bank to the BNP Paribas Group. This means taking into account six-week period starting on May, the 12, including the purchase price accounting and having a participation of 75% in the bank. Fortis bank will release its statutory figures on August, the 31, that are specifically related to the full quarter performance will become available at that time.</p>
          <p>So for the period reported, BNP Paribas Fortis came in at a net income of &#x20AC;261 million; three key operational elements drove these results: first, good business in the retail networks; second, good performance of market-driven businesses; and third, significant level of cost of risk.</p>
          <p>In addition, two external factors also impacted the results. Improved market parameters generated a one-off revenue boost of 243 million, and amortization of purchase price accounting amounted 137 million. All in all, this is a significant first contribution.</p>
          <p>About retail, just to remind you that retail banking is obviously a core activity of BNP Paribas Fortis, totally worldwide close to six billion clients, of which four million for Belgium only. In Belgium, as you know, the retail activity has suffered significant outflows last year and continued to experience outflows of lesser magnitude during the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Although, since April intake has consistently grown and accelerated throughout the quarter, as you can see &#x20AC;2 billion for the second quarter of this year. So for the second quarter volumes of new customer loans in the Belgian retail bank continued to steadily grow, increasing by about 1% compared to the first quarter of the year mainly on the back of the growth mortgages.</p>
          <p>In Luxembourg, deposits remained globally stable over the quarter contrasting with the significant outflows the bank experienced during the second semester of last year. In Poland, BNP Paribas Fortis is currently focused on merging both the so-called entities, Fortis Bank Polska and Dominet Bank by creating a single banking platform of material size to grow and to best benefit from future expected growth. And last but not least, Turkey is a market where BNP Paribas Fortis shows resilient results, which positions us well to participate in the ongoing development of the country.</p>
          <p>About asset management and private banking, while Fortis Investment Management continued to suffer from net outflows during the period, nevertheless, positive market performance more than compensated the outflows, so that overall asset under management grew by &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;159 billion. The private bank also evolved in a similar trend, outflows being more than compensated by positive market performance. Win-back actions launched in all countries delivered better results.</p>
          <p>In the end for the merchant bank, it is worth mentioning the good performance of our fixed income, forex and equity derivatives activities in global markets. And in the financial activities, the financing activities, although new production volumes were somewhat lower, higher margin enabled us to improve our net interest income. Costs were kept under control, and as effect by the cost of risk, impairments on loans remained high as a result of the challenging economic environment. On this topic, it is worthwhile mentioning that risks continue to be closely monitored and significant efforts are being carried out to further reinforce the bank's resilience to adverse conditions.</p>
          <p>Finally, several actions to restore client confidence and attract deposits are being taken, including a win-back campaign in commercial and corporate. So this is it for BNP Paribas Fortis for this quarter. And now, Philippe will give you all necessary details related to the purchase accounting. Philippe?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Well, so we have conducted purchase price allocation exercise, PPA, according to the IFRS. Well, as you know, I'm not going to elaborate on the principles of this exercise, just focus on a few figures. First, we started from the net book value of Fortis at the moment of the acquisition, so 12th of May, 14.8 billion net of the latent losses in the AFS. And then so, we had to write-down the goodwill and intangible assets, &#x20AC;2.2 billion, including the goodwill coming from the acquisition of ABN Amro Asset Management.</p>
          <p>Then we went through the balance sheet, the banking book first and we had to put at the fair value of the 12th of May each and every item and so we &#x2013; well, we wrote off 2.6 billion and this is this banking book PPA, which is being amortized and coming back progressively in the P&amp;L over the next few years. Then we did the same for the market activities and equity portfolios, minus 1.5 billion. And then we looked at the credit portfolios with an eye on the credit quality and we added 3.2 billion to the existing allowances.</p>
          <p>So in order to take into account the general environment which is not very favorable at the moment, so we wanted to be on the safe side. And then there is minus 1 billion of others including especially, mainly the commitments to the employee as a social commitment. And all those amounts are before tax, so then you have the tax effect, which is reversing part of it. And on top of that we have some write-back of deferred tax assets as the prospect for turning Fortis within the BNP Paribas Group brighter than before, and so we were in a position to put in the balance sheet a little bit more deferred tax asset.</p>
          <p>So we &#x2013; having done that, we stand at 8.6 billion. So we in net after-tax, we have written off 14.8 less 8.6, which is &#x20AC;6.2 billion, so it's a very, I would say, significant PPA. We have only 75% of the bank, so the 8.6 are translating into 6.5 billion, our share. And here now, we are leaving Fortis Bank itself and we are looking at two other aspects of the transaction. One is the direct acquisition of 17% of BGL, which is also adding around 900 million net book value &#x2013; tangible book value, and the last one is our involvement in the special purpose vehicle which is called RPI, Royal Park Investments, where the structured credit portfolio had been good. I'll come back in a minute. And so we adjusted 400 million of these commitments, and so we come to &#x20AC;7 billion as the total contribution to the BNP Paribas Group net equity. Those 7 billion can be broken down into the part which is the payment in shares we did is 6.2 billion by issuing shares to the Belgian state and to the state of Luxembourg. And the difference by definition is the badwill, 800 million.</p>
          <p>Now, just a few words about the structured credit portfolio, because it has been, well, I would say, one of the reasons why Fortis get into trouble. And it has been a sole point of attention for everybody, including ourselves. You know that this portfolio has been divided into two parts. In fact we selected the worst part, which was bearing the biggest risk. And this part which was roughly half of the total or roughly &#x20AC;20 billion has been put into a specific portfolio &#x2013; specific vehicle, Royal Park Investments. And those lines had been already marked down by Fortis over time and created <mark type="inaudible" /> of the losses they preferred from. And so at the moment of the acquisition, the value of this portfolio, the book value of this portfolio was 11.8 billion only, so kind of 40% markdown from nominal value. In the PPA we &#x2013; well, we looked at that portfolio and we decided to write-off 100% of the equity tranche &#x2013; our stake in the equity tranche which is 200 million out of 1.7 billion. And also the most of &#x2013; well, more than half of our involvement in the senior debt which is 500 million, so we wrote down 300 million of that before tax.</p>
          <p>And, well, it doesn't mean that the terminal loss at redemption &#x2013; at maturity will be that high, but the PPA is an exercise where you have to assess the value today and not the outlook for recovery. And so we &#x2013; well, we thought that given the current situation of the market for securitized products, it was right to mark down those 500 million. For those 500 million pre-tax, the 400 we have seen in the previous slide post tax. So the remaining risk is very residual, as you can see, and very limited, and we think now that as far as this portfolio is concerned, we are really very, very remote free.</p>
          <p>On the other half of the structured portfolio, which was bearing &#x2013; which is bearing a risk which is more, I would say acceptable, more average for structured portfolio. The total nominal value is also close to 20 billion, 19.8 billion at the time of the acquisition. And Fortis had also already written down a significant part of it, 3.4 billion in relatively conservative &#x2013; well, very conservative way we thought. And while assessing the current value, we adjusted up a little bit 200 million.</p>
          <p>And so we are left with a total portfolio which is coming into the &#x2013; in <mark type="inaudible" /> balance sheet at &#x20AC;16.6 billion value, out of which we bear a 300 million first loss risk. Then as you remember, the Belgian state has guaranteed 1.5 billion mezzanine tranche, a second loss tranche. So given the, I would say, the characteristics of that portfolio and the level of risk of that portfolio, we think that the probability for that second tranche to be used or called is very limited, very remote. And that's again we are in &#x2013; on the safe side with this portfolio as well.</p>
          <p>So in total, I would say, a PPA work, which has been conducted in a prudent way, which is leaving us with a contribution to our balance sheet, which is sound we feel at that level. And I have to add that technically, we have one year to adjust the portfolio standard giving one year time to fine tune all the adjustments. And so we may adjust those figures in the coming quarters somewhat, but we feel we have done a significant part of the work is done already. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>What we see here is that really, the Fortis acquisition has given to the BNP Paribas Group quite a new dimension certainly as now a strong leader in the eurozone. The deposit franchise is now &#x2013; stands now at &#x20AC;540 billion making it the number one franchise in the eurozone for BNP Paribas. We're also number one in private banking with over 220 billion of assets. We're number one for securities services, and number five in asset management with over &#x20AC;500 billion. And I think in terms of retail customers, we now have 13 million retail customers shared between France, which is half of them with 6.6 million customers; Belgium 3.7 million customers; Italy only get 2.5 and Belgium &#x2013; and Luxembourg 400,000.</p>
          <p>And in the meantime, we have also very much strengthened in the last few months our position as the European leader in corporate investment banking with the number one position in euro-denominated bond issues, number one in global Export finance, but also we now stand at number seven for &#x2013; in euro for mergers and acquisitions, and certainly still a very strong leader in real estate. So BNP Paribas has now become a major eurozone bank altogether.</p>
          <p>Liquidity; liquidity wise I think we have significantly improved our loan-to-deposit ratio. At group level and including BNP Paribas Fortis, it stands now at 116%. It stood at 129% end of 2007 and 119% end of 2008. So this is quite an improvement over the last two years. CDS spread for BNP Paribas is still the lowest of its peer group at 51 basis points. This is certainly a reason why we have &#x2013; we are enjoying quite a strong position to tap the medium and long-term issue market to raise money.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; our program this year was to raise 30 billion. We already have raised 28 billion so far under diversified type of issues, distribution and type of investors. We are raising that number from 30 to &#x20AC;40 billion in connection of the BNP Paribas Fortis integration and our portfolio of assets potentially mobilized to central banks now stands at &#x20AC;160 billion. So from a liquidity perspective, we believe that we have a major competitive advantage confirmed for the group at the time of the Fortis acquisition.</p>
          <p>Regarding our Tier 1 capital, our Q1 capital increased very much in the last six months. It stood at 41 &#x2013; &#x20AC;41.8 billion as of the end of last year, 44.5 end of March, and it now stand at &#x20AC;60.3 billion. That increase in the last quarter compared to the end of March is for &#x20AC;15.8 billion, the bulk of it, &#x20AC;13.9 billion, comes from the Fortis deal, of which &#x20AC;6.2 billion are the capital increase, the 800 million are the badwill, and &#x20AC;4.3 billion relate to minority interest, and then &#x20AC;3.1 billion related to the hybrids that we have got through BNP Paribas Fortis. The remaining &#x20AC;1.8 billion related to the capital generation which stands at &#x20AC;1 billion after distribution assumption for the second quarter and the remaining 800 million relate to the payment of the dividend in shares where 72% of our shareholders have chosen the payment in shares.</p>
          <p>In terms of our risk-weighted assets, as a reminder, we have had a voluntary reduction target of &#x20AC;20 billion for 2009 that we completed entirely in the first quarter, actually the reduction of risk-weighted assets was 24 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;24 billion in the first quarter. We have had a new decline in risk-weighted assets for BNP Paribas, up to &#x20AC;19 billion in the second quarter, of which &#x20AC;11 billion in connection with market risk, and we are now integrating BNP Paribas Fortis for &#x20AC;166 billion, which makes the risk-weighted assets Basel II for the group including BNP Paribas Fortis standing at &#x20AC;651 billion as of the end of June. We're going to continue to optimize the managements of these risk-weighted assets under this new perimeter.</p>
          <p>Now, regarding solvency, because of this increase in <mark type="inaudible" /> capital and reduction of risk-weighted assets, we have a Tier 1 ratio standing at 9.3% as of the end of June compared to 8.8% as of the end of March and 7.8% as of the end of last year. The 50 basis point increase for this &#x2013; in this quarter are coming from capital generation in the second quarter, representing 20 basis point of improvement for the Tier 1 ratio. The payment of the dividend shares and other 15 basis point, the reduction in risk-weighted assets representing 35 basis point, and the integration of Fortis &#x2013; of BNP Paribas Fortis contributes to 20-basis point reduction because actually the BNP Paribas Fortis was standing at 8.4% Tier 1 ratio compared to the group ratio. But after this integration, once again, we're still standing at 9.3%. This gives us a significant and further improved safety margin. We do continue to have, as a medium term objective, to maintain a Tier 1 ratio all the time at above 7.5%, which we believe is a floor consistent with BNP Paribas business model and earning capacity.</p>
          <p>So altogether, the first half of this year in gaining market shares and in integrating Fortis has been a decisive milestone in the implementation of the BNP Paribas' European plans. We believe that we've been quick and effective in implementing the adaptation measures that we had announced, well, by mid-December of last year, therefore, keeping our strong profit generation capacity of our Group. BNP Paribas is a leading eurozone bank with diversified and integrated business model, and we believe that we're well positioned to take on the challenges of the new environment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Robin Down from HSBC. I've got one question on credit risk and then a follow-up question on Fortis, but maybe if I start with the credit risk question. Could you just let us know where you think you stand with the Ukrainian business? It looks like the charges have stabilized Q2 on Q1. Do you think we are now sort of past the worst with Ukraine or are we going to start to see charges dipping down from here on in?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jean-Laurent will answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe that considering the bank and looking at what happened, so let's say, three quarters to a year ago, I do believe that we have reached some kind of an equilibrium which means that cost of risk would be for the second part of the year more or less at the same level as for the first part of the year. This is our I would say, vision for the bank in this country and this is not a particular situation related to this bank; this is the market as a whole. Should we see some kind of better, I would say, evolution next year, I'm not so sure. These are severe crisis. So we assume that in the really economy, what happened should have again next year strong impact. So for the second part of this year, we should live with this quite the same level of cost of risk and to me next year could show some kind of an improvement, but I'm not so sure of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what &#x2013; just one that's that risk-related question. I think the Gulf write-offs you're talking about the 60 million in retail bank and 183. But I think you said both of those were one-off. Are they actually related to the same one-off in effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think we're going to comment on specifics, but &#x2013; on specific issues. But as I said, this is more of a one-off provision that have brought deterioration of the credit and loan portfolio <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on Fortis, I'm really looking at slide 30 here in the presentation pack. The adjustments that you made to the balance sheet and so this is more of an observation than really a question, because I mean it seems to me what you've done with Fortis is you started with a Fortis tangible book value on the left-hand side of circa &#x20AC;16 billion, and you've effectively taken about eight billion of provision with fair value adjustment through the course of the purchase accounting adjustments. And, sorry --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm including the crystallization of the AfS reserve as well, which -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, you're right, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And technically you're exactly correct to do that and that's the conservative way of doing it and that's what accounting person should do. But I'm just wondering how you're actually thinking about it because there aren't so many &#x2013; most credit <mark type="inaudible" /> this time around would say that a lot of the mark-to-market we see in the market are related partly to liquidity rather than just credit risk. I mean particularly if you start looking up things like some of the assets that go into in the AfS reserve. So I mean do you really see that eight billion total write-down being crystallized or is that sort &#x2013; in your mind, do you think that that's something that's in effect in large part going to unwind over the course of next two or three years, if these assets roll towards maturity and the impairment that's going to come through? The reason why I ask that is that obviously quite a big number in the context of your shareholders equity. And if that's what you've done as you've written Fortis down and you're just sort of buying it up 0.5 times on book. It's more an observation, though, I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on those provisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a very technical exercise. So, it turns out which is extremely <mark type="inaudible" /> all those issues. So it has been done the way it has to be done, and I can provide you with a few technical answers as well to your question. As I said clearly, one part of it is not going to be crystallized which is the second color, assets and liabilities at fair value, it's about a banking book.</p>
          <p>And you're right, for example, the credit book of banking book and retail book of Fortis has been extended at conditions margins, which are <mark type="inaudible" /> them are taking back from before the crisis. And of course, there has to be in that exercise &#x2013; they have to be revaluated at the level taking into account the market &#x2013; banking market conditions, the liquidity conditions of the 12th of May. And hence necessarily, this stock is going to come back through the P&amp;L over the time. It has started already in the few days &#x2013; six weeks, we had said that already 230 million that's come back. And there is a kind of drop over time and it's not linear amortization, but it's an amortization which is going to come back in the P&amp;L over time. So this is one thing.</p>
          <p>As far as the other, if we can come back to the other column please. As far as the other columns are concerned, a certain number are going to crystallized. The first one is just the kind of convention you write-off all the intangibles because you are replacing all them in one time by the badwill or goodwill at the end. So this is crystallized forever. Then as far as the market activity, so I'm in the third block, market activities, equity holdings and the same for the latent losses on the AfS, the dotted line at the beginning. That by definition is not crystallized because it's just the market value of today. So, as you know, it's a daily experience, prices for certain days were moving by 10% up or down.</p>
          <p>So by definition, it's something which is moving fast. So but it was &#x2013; it's the exercise that we have to do that with the prices of the 12th of May and not the 4/15 and not an average and it's that date <mark type="inaudible" />. Then the provision, the 3.2 about provisioning, so additional provisions here, I would say, the judgment is playing some role because it's more difficult, it's less mechanic &#x2013; mechanical. But while we &#x2013; well, it will depend &#x2013; I would say, it will depend on the economic environment in the future if the crisis is maybe milder than we think, maybe part of it will come back. If the crisis is worse, maybe it will even be &#x2013; we'll have to add other provision in the future <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me perhaps phrase it slightly differently and I'll give up the microphone, I promise. Things like that 3.2 billion AfS for the crystallization, if those assets had been BNP assets that you had acquired organically rather than acquired through acquiring a business, would you have taken that 3.2 billion adjustment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 3.2 billion had been taken by Fortis, not by ourselves. The 3.2 were already in the balance sheet of Fortis and we just looked at this and started the reasoning from the net level. It's a mark-to-market price. So it's supposed to be the price where we could have bought or sold those papers at that date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But every bank has a negative AfS reserve. And most banks will come out and say well, actually it's not impaired, their assets are not an AfS reserve but we'd expect to get back. But it just strikes me that, I'd say technically it's probably correct what you're doing, but what you seem to have created here is a huge reserve that we could see unwinding back &#x2013; back into equity over the next two, three years.</p>

          <p>Jaap Meijer from Evolution. I remember that your adjustments were actually higher and net adjustments were 9.3 billion. And now they are actually a lot lower at 6.2 billion. So what &#x2013; is this entirely the AfS reserves, crystallization of those?</p>
          <p>Somewhat follow-up questions is, could you give some color on recurring earnings capacity you're seeing for Fortis Belgium and on the ROI it must probably at least covering your cost of capital, I presume?</p>
          <p>And just an accounting thing. Your insurance stake, is this <mark type="inaudible" /> onboard? And finally, is there any risk that for the ABS portfolio, any securities would fall below the rating B+, which would mean that you will have to deduct it directly from Tier 1? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've not understood all of your questions. But I will just try to start with what I got and then you will complete your questions. As far as the 6.2 billion, which is the result of the capital increase in fact, it's highly dependent on the BNP Paribas share price at the date of the new &#x2013; of the issue against the 12th and 13th of May. And again, it's a beauty of accounting as you have to marketing at precise date. So when we were talking about the 9.3, I guess we are referring to the agreement, the first agreement time where the share price was at 68 or around. And in fact when we closed, the share price was at 46 or something like that. So all the calculations were made on the basis of this price, the price at the closing date. Then &#x2013; sorry, your second question was about --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's say that the work from any, I would say, exceptional accounting items, the operational result of the banks would be close to zero, zero plus Fortis share. But this is the current situation taking into account that the cost of risk is going to be pretty high this year. So this is the starting point of the company. And of course, over a certain period of time, we should get a more clear picture and maybe on the 1st of December, we could comment in more detail this point.

          <p>Well, as I have shown in the structured trade portfolio, we have &#x2013; well, we have on the out portfolio we have a very remote exposure which is not mark-to-market at all, because we are lending money to the vehicle. So it's something which is really not tied to the mark-to-market. And the in portfolio, we have transferred it &#x2013; at the moment of the acquisition, we have classified it as loans and receivables, because we don't intend to trade if this portfolio is going to be managed on an extinction mode. And so it's now in the banking books, and again it's kind of immunized against the noise of the mark-to-market movement.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a final question on your equity portfolio, because you have some losses on equity stakes in the quarter. What is your &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> that is on your total equity exposure that you have in your own risk, let's say, sitting in your insurance activities or &#x2013; in your corporate centers. How much is actually sitting as mark-to-market risk on equity as your proprietary risk so unhedged risk basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have a proprietary portfolio on the equity, on the assets, which is recorded in the corporate center. The main lines, I would say, on that &#x2013; I was thinking in Shinhan where we decided to impair this line this quarter. The other main exposure is our stake in AXA but we have a low and historical average cost. So &#x2013; and the rest is less significant. The total value &#x2013; current value of this portfolio is in the region of &#x2013; it's included I think in the region of &#x2013; except AXA and Shinhan the rest is something like 1.5 billion or something like that, I think market value. I will check.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm from Execution. I have three questions please. The first one is on the cost of risk. I was just wondering if you can talk a bit about where we are in the cycle and where you think how far we are from the peak and if you can talk potentially about some of the divisions?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in terms of capital management, you have continued to reduce risk-weighted assets. I just wonder if there's more to come? And then secondly with relation to that question, I was wondering I know most banks have given us more about what they expect the impact would be of the incremental risk charge on their risk-weighted assets in terms of market risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I understood your last question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of potentially stricter rules on market risk-weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, I was wondering on the Fortis contribution in the second quarter, if you're willing to say how much is retail and how much is merchant banking? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that regarding the &#x2013; well, consideration on the cost of risk, I think it's really very difficult to make some of forecasts to give guidance on where we really spend. My belief is that regarding the cost of risk as I said, at Group level, I believe that the 144 basis point, altogether of &#x2013; in relation to risk-weighted assets on the Basel I, and because this is still how we account for.</p>
          <p>Of the second quarter is high level and I would expect that we would not go really much higher, especially because I do expect that the counterparty and capital market figure should continue to come down. I still believe that the 23 basis points incurred in the second quarter is still a relatively high number. And if the normalizations of capital markets continues which has been my central scenario, then I would expect the 23 basis points to come down, and therefore the 144 basis point, I would hope and expect that this could be a pick.</p>
          <p>Now, commenting then division by division, where do we actually stand, and if it could still go for a few &#x2013; well, for a few basis points higher, and when and when the timing of this peak and I wouldn't &#x2013; I wouldn't go there, because I think that it wouldn't be serious management forecast, it would be somehow guessing, and I don't do that. I believe that altogether once again, the 2 billion &#x2013; the 2 billion figure naturally including Fortis' 100 million, 2.3 of this quarter is a high number.</p>
          <p>Altogether, I somehow believe that we should see this when we look back maybe a year, a year-and-a-half from now. I hope and expect that this will be around, well, with the higher level of cost of risk that, whether how quarter-by-quarter what will be exactly the cost of risk over the next few quarters, it's a bit easier Group wise, because then &#x2013; some of the thoughts, but then division-by-division, I don't think we can do that.</p>
          <p>And the other thing I want to say is that we're very much hands-on in how we manage risk at BNP Paribas. We've done several things in &#x2013; certainly in all of our businesses, I would say the quality of what we originate and that certainly is true for consumer finance. The scoring has been tightened, and we've seen, for example, in Spain, where the situation was &#x2013; has been difficult for a while that the &#x2013; the tighter scoring and therefore the quality of what we originate, the increase in staffing, in the &#x2013; in how we collect loans and the same goes for some workout teams in different parts of the Group. So we are really &#x2013; we're not spending &#x2013; we are not just watching and we are actively managing portfolio. So which should also contribute to, well, hopefully a trend on the cost of risk that should, well, see this level of provisioning to be in the high parts of this cycle.</p>
          <p>I think that in terms of capital management, the risk-weighted assets, the reduction of the 24 billion of the first quarter, the further reduction of 19 billion of the second quarter. These are big numbers because 24 plus 19 is 43, and 43 is like not far from 10% of the risk-weighted assets as they stood as of the &#x2013; compared to 528, 43 billion is like 8%.</p>
          <p>So I believe that we are &#x2013; I don't think that we are going to see further significant reduction of that magnitude in the next few quarters, because we &#x2013; simply because we have the opportunity to, well, I would say to lend at risk reward conditions that are really good at the moment. And as much as we &#x2013; we're not going to expand the risk, the loan portfolio, I would say very rapidly. On the other side, I don't want to tighten our belt on risk-weighted assets further than needed. We have a solvency ratio at 9.3, we have a liquidity situation, we have a loan-to-deposit ratio from the three perspective. We're in very strong shape. And I think those are our mission statement to our shareholders, is to create value as much as our mission statement to the economy is to finance the economy.</p>
          <p>So I don't &#x2013; we don't do it just because we want to be good citizens. But I think we can combine the fact that we are doing the job of financing the economy and doing it presently by choosing what we finance, the terms and conditions, the governance, the covenants, the maturity and do it in such a way that it is good business and we like what we put on the balance sheet and I think that if you do it very professionally it is in this part of the cycle that you can put on your balance sheet assets that are priced and that are &#x2013; I would say worth in a very professional way. So that's what we &#x2013; that's what we're going to do.</p>
          <p>So I think you should expect we're certainly not going to expand the loan portfolio at the kind of speed that we have had, well, a few &#x2013; in a different environment. On the other side, I don't think that it would be a &#x2013; it wouldn't be the best trade off for BNP Paribas shareholders to see the Group management somehow making the risk-weighted asset, well, smaller and smaller for no reason. So we are not in a &#x2013; I mean, other banks maybe have seen their business model put into, well &#x2013; put much more into trouble that we believe that we've been weathering the crisis. Certainly, we've not been immune, but we've been weathering the crisis in such a way and we believe we are &#x2013; our teams and the way we control risk at the Group level are consistent and we're going to continue to be financing, I would say, under responsible and professional terms. And so risk-weighted assets should resume a very much controlled &#x2013; actually controlled growth if I may say it should be the word that I could probably see that we are going to imply.</p>
          <p>And then it's going to be certainly in &#x2013; there are places where we're not in a trained, down some 5.2 billion to 4.2 billion, it's not going to grow any time soon. So that's going to be differentiated in the different parts of the Group, but I think that will be the policy. You had a question on the positive contributions...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I know. He just spoke about two or three provisions, but first the parameters of retail within Fortis under permits of the merchant bank, are not going to be the parameters who are going to &#x2013; is which who are going to run the bank for the future, who are going to change these parameters, so we're not going to comment. Let's say that again, business is related to market activities who were very good this quarter, as any &#x2013; as any other bank. And for the retail as for the commercial corporate bank the key point is that the savings deposit of balance sheet items went into good directions, so this is really the gone source, so the bank again is in the right direction and it's prepared to enter into development plans, so <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About your last question, yes, I think you should go through the slide 46, which was giving the breakdown of the risk-weighted assets by nature and you'll see that the market and forex risk is, market risk representing 25 billion in the risk-weighted assets. And by the way, you see when you see that you'll understand that may be it could be wiser to &#x2013; that to be a slightly higher proportion of the total. So, I mean the regulatory source make sense probably.</p>
          <p>Now they are in the process of being fine-tuned and we don't know yet exactly how much it will add to the requirement. But, well a kind of common metric, which is given by the street is that it could triple the market risk. So it gives you an idea may be &#x2013; well, I don't know it may be more or it may be less. I mean &#x2013; I think the discussion is under progress. But it is -- it should be less. But it gives you a kind of idea of 50 billion additional risk-weighted assets is equivalent of something like &#x2013; now like 60 basis points or something like that in Q1. So it's not a nightmare, it's probably a lot &#x2013; not a nightmare though.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our first question comes from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I was wondering if you could talk again about the risk-weighted asset reduction. You mentioned that market risk was reduced and just trying to understand how you did that, was it purely a risk reduction or was it some kind of accounting change.</p>
          <p>The second question is on equity derivatives. You had an excellent improvement in performance. Can you talk a bit about structured volumes? Are they coming back with this equity derivative flow business? And the third question is related to the CASHES of Fortis. Can you remind me on your position, how you are exposed to the Fortis' CASHES? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first question, yes. As we just said, as Baudouin just said, the risk-weighted assets reduction of this quarter has not been, I would say, a kind of decision of reducing your gains of risk-weighted asset, we had done &#x2013; we had already achieved the target at the end of the first quarter. I would say that while nothing is coming from accounting change, and I think &#x2013; I think it's a blend of passive factors and more active factors.</p>
          <p>The passive factors on the risk-weighted assets coming from market risk is that the parameters having improved a lot especially in June. The translation of those parameters into the measurement of the counterparty risk has been reduced and automatically it translated without changing anything any position or anything it has translated into less risk-weighted assets for the counterparty risk in the market.</p>
          <p>And it explains probably, while almost probably half of the 11 billion, the other half being just at the positions of &#x2013; the open position of the traders are somewhat lower than they were, but it's, well, it's just the result of the normal business. And we had another technical factor which is helping on the &#x2013; not on markets, but on the other part from the 8 billion coming from the credit books, which is the total decline, mechanically it creates also a reduction in risk-weighted assets as a significant factor our <mark type="inaudible" />. So again, it added probably something like 4 billion passive reduction. So this is what I think I can say about your first question.</p>
          <p>The CASHES, well, the CASHES is &#x2013; I'm not going to answer in detail the CASHES question, because it will require two hours or may be another conference itself. It's an extremely complex product which is a kind of &#x2013; it's a product which has been issued jointly by Fortis Bank and Fortis holding, which are &#x2013; which were at that time the same Group, but now are two separate companies. And so it creates a lot of complications.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; as such as we're concerned in the agreements, I mean we managed to get a guarantee from Belgium State that everything which would be owed by Fortis holding to us due to the CASHES would be paid. So it would be guaranteed by the Belgium State. And so we are fully protected if you want. And then the mechanism, it's a kind of balance between different items in the balance sheet which are balancing themselves &#x2013; offsetting themselves 100%. So for us, it's neutral, the product is neutral and that's it I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Yes, regarding your &#x2013; the answer to your question on the equity derivative activities, if we get back to slide 15 for a second, I think, I would say that &#x2013; two things. The &#x2013; in terms of type of activities, we have stopped doing some, I would say, or offering to the market some of the more sophisticated structured products that we used to offer. And by the way, either &#x2013; on the other side, we don't really see now the demand for such sophisticated product having resumed. So this is off. On the other side, we have seen significant demand in activity from institutional and also pick up from hedge funds for, let's say, less sophisticated structured products and also &#x2013; but also a strong demand for our flow product. And the last comment I would make is that the &#x2013; on the private bank side, there with &#x2013; the activity is still very fairly limited. So it's from institutional and hedge funds. That's what I can say on the equity derivatives activity for the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that leads us &#x2013; I would say we are &#x2013; we think that because of the improvements in the equity markets altogether, we believe that the activity &#x2013; we hope and believe that the client activity, well, should probably continue to be, well, let's say, improving compared to the last few months, that's in line with what we have seen in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I can ask two more follow-ups, just briefly on the CASHES, is the Belgium state guaranteeing them into perpetuity, the CASHES product? And if I may add one more on BancWest, do you see &#x2013; when do you expect NPL formation and basically provisioning for you to peak? Is this a process that we will see in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you repeat your question on the CASHES? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I understand that the CASHES are a perpetual product into annuity &#x2013; perpetual into indefinite, does that means the state is guaranteeing it forever?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The state isn't guaranteeing the CASHES themselves. The state is just guaranteeing to us, BNP Paribas, that if &#x2013; any credit risk we could have on Fortis holding stemming from the CASHES product. So but yes, it's forever, yes, of course, it's the states, and it's for the &#x2013; I would say, the minimum maturity of both BNP Paribas and the Belgian State, which is for a very long period.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of the U.S., if you could just comment on provisioning moves, and also, if I may, also on the margins, because the yield curves are so steep, so I would have expected that maybe the margins could improve going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

If this becomes a credit event, what would be the impact, please? My second question is on NPLs. Those were up 10 billion quarter-on-quarter to 29 billion and I wonder how much is due to Fortis please? And the third question is really when do you expect to pay back the French State if trends continue in line with the second quarter please? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will answer your third question. And then maybe Philippe will answer the two other questions. Regarding the paying back of the French non-voting shares, our analysis as of now stands as the following. I think that we're going to wait for the end of this year, and then we will consider, well, what will be the BNP Paribas results for the full year, and what will be our view at the beginning of next year of where we stand in terms of economic environment and overall environment. And then if &#x2013; then we might consider starting to repay therefore &#x2013; what was it? The first half of next to repay part of the &#x2013; gradually the non-voting shares have to be written down. So that's how we see things at the moment.</p>

          <p>Okay. And as for the increase in doubtful loans, out of the 10 billion, it's six from Fortis and four from the evolution of the BNP Paribas books, six plus four. And on Ambac, in fact, you have seen in the P&amp;L of BNP Paribas in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009, again significant amounts of cost of risk due to the monolines, and we report that regularly. And so we had anticipated the evolution of the monolines in general, and Ambac in particular. And so even if we never quote any name, as you know, well, we are &#x2013; it wouldn't change a lot. I mean, we have made the necessary provisions.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. I would have a few questions regarding the investment banking. First, regarding the cost/income ratio, you're speaking about a target of 60%. But over the last two quarters, it's definitely well below. When do you believe that potentially you're going to be on that level? Second one, can you give us a little bit of detail of what has been the turnover on your staff in the market activities. There have been a few articles saying that many people left and you were also hiring quite aggressively.</p>
          <p>Regarding equity derivatives, do you believe that on the Q2 performance, you have reached the &#x2013; your, I would say, natural market share that you had been looking for? And lastly, regarding the financing business, clearly you have suffered in Q2 due to the strong reduction of the risk-weighted assets. Can you give us a little bit more color about the margins on the corporate side please?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that regarding the operation efficiency ratio for CIB, well, I think that 44% is a very low number. And while it could go higher, but I hope that we're going to really do better, continue to do significantly better than the 60%. In terms of what we're seeing in staff, I would say poaching in the last few weeks, we certainly have seen the market becoming, well &#x2013; again, because may be of the strong results of capital markets activity in the industry, the market has changed and become again certainly more competitive in the last two weeks and the last few months. But altogether, in this competitive market, we haven't seen the number of people taking &#x2013; taken out or leaving BNP Paribas, changing in, well &#x2013; in a really significant way. That's where we're certainly keeping a close eye on that aspect of what happens. Regarding equity derivatives, I think, I would say that we are &#x2013; in the second quarter certainly, we've seen our level of activities and revenues picking up significantly. I think that, well, this kind of revenues &#x2013; with this kind of revenues, I think, we're pretty much back to our market share, and therefore the trend of revenues will &#x2013; for the foreseeable future will very much depend on the overall level of client activity in this &#x2013; well, in this markets and in this field of activity. Regarding the financing businesses, I think that altogether, margins remain favorable, and this is the reason why I answered to a previous question that regarding risk-weighted assets, we don't think that in this kind of environment it is necessary or even &#x2013; yes, it is even favorable to, I would say, be too strict on and continue to reduce the volume of our risk-weighted assets. So margin-wise, we still are in the favorable environment in for CIB financing activities.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, the feeling is it's certainly not increasing, but if erosion, it's still a mild erosion. So I think, the way &#x2013; I think, it's somehow &#x2013; it's a plateau or it's stabilizing may be with light erosion but at high level for the moment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that in terms of value at risk at &#x20AC;52 million, I consider that number now on rather a low figure. And when I look at BNP Paribas capital position, and I don't think we're not going to have actions to &#x2013; I mean, to reduce that number any lower. It used to be for a long time at 60, &#x20AC;70 million at the time BNP Paribas capital position was 40 billion. We now have a &#x20AC;60 billion capital position. But I don't see why we would want to have &#x2013; to reduce value at risk again there, I would say, beyond what's reasonable. I think that in &#x2013; so in this field, I think that it could be a bit higher in the next few quarters, and I don't think it would be a problem for BNP Paribas.</p>

          <p>Well, that &#x2013; the Italian economy is going through quite a severe crisis. So as we saw it 15 years ago, 2009 is a &#x2013; in terms of cost of risk is a very bad year, most probably it's the peak of the crisis, and well above 300 basis points as we were 15 years ago back in '80 &#x2013; '93, '92, don't remember exactly. So this is the situation. Unemployment is rising and obviously all types of products including, obviously the revolving products already hit by the situation of the economic crisis. So this is the story about Findomestic. This company as a consumer loan company do not have a special story in this market or as a consumer lending companies in the Italian market are going through this same kind of tough times.

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. This is Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois from Goldman. I just have a quick question again on the cost/income ratio of the Investment Bank. Just to follow-up, is there any effect to be expected by the end of the year that if your revenues stay relatively healthy as they seem to be at the moment, there would be an impact from deferred composition from last year? The second question related to this in a way is that was there any positive or negative effects in the revenues that used to be the case, impact of the crisis and things like that? For example, we saw this morning that UBS brought back some of its monoline exposure to positive contribution. My second contribution &#x2013; my second question is on commercial real estate loans. In BancWest, you have about 6.4 billion of commercial real estate loans and 200 million of provisions. I was wondering how comfortable you felt with that given the provision &#x2013; the extra provisioning we've seen at regional peers, same goes for the U.K. commercial real estate of Fortis. And lastly and finally maybe on BancWest &#x2013; oh sorry, on Fortis, I get to an underlying level of gross operating profit on the quarterly run rate according to what you disclosed and stripping out the one-offs of about 800 million a quarter, and I was wondering how comfortable you felt with that as a base run rate? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>About the crisis impact, if I am right. Correct me, because the line is not very good, but I have understood that this was your question. I think, we &#x2013; well, we have now, I would say, stopped publishing the kind of record of old specific impact of the financial crisis, because basically now as evidenced by old graphs they are showing the financial crisis now is kind of over and we are entering really in an era which is now back to the pre-Lehman level. And we &#x2013; yes, we had a few additional provisions or write-backs linked to the crisis, but for amounts, which are now not really worth mentioning and which are offsetting more or less each other. So I think there is nothing specific to mention. You are seeing that other banks keep mentioning figures, but I guess it's because their &#x2013; the impact on their accounts was and is much bigger than it was and is now for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that regarding the capital markets burn issues, we've been provisioning, well, for the first and for the second quarter, which we believe is adequate considering the &#x2013; I would say, G20 compliance ways we're going to compensate our capital markets people this year. And so, we believe it's adequate and I don't think that this sort of compensation should have a significant role this year. And anyway, the burn issues will be decided after a full year result for capital markets, so early next year.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the commercial real estate for BancWest, commercial real estate may be one of the sectors, where maybe the crisis is not yet at the peak, hasn't reached the peak, but all-in-all I believe that for BancWest, we should already be at the peak in term of provisioning and for Fortis, let's put it that way, after the purchasing accounting, we feel quite comfortable about commercial real estate, so this is BNP Paribas contribution.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. I've got some &#x2013; two questions. One related to the doubtful loan. You said that's four billion out of the 10 billion increase in doubtful loan related to BNP standard loan. Can you give the same breakdown for the provisioning? Because if you have four billion increase in non-performing loans, you should have had maybe three billion of provisions just to cover those. So does it mean that the Fortis non-performing loans are more than 100% covered? And the second question related to the tax rate, I thought it was a little bit low. I don't know whether you gave some explanation, but could you elaborate as to what we should expect? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, I have not catch the second question, but we can come back to that. The tax rate, the tax rate, yes, the tax rate it's &#x2013; well, if you take the &#x2013; well, I can start with that because it's easy. The tax rate, you have to keep in mind that the tax rate, the taxes are accrued with the calculation which is over the period, I mean, the year-to-date period because the taxes are not &#x2013; we are not taxed quarter-after-quarter, thanks god, it's only once a year. And so the accrual period is the relevant period to look at the tax rate. And the second thing we have to bear in mind is that, of course, badwill have no tax, and goodwill impairments are not deductible either, and so it changes a little bit the figures. So if you adjust for those, I would say, goodwill, badwill entries, and if you look at the half year figures, the tax rate is 25% this time, which is more or less in line with what the guidance we are saying I mean 26, 27% so it's not far from what our guidance.</p>
          <p>About the doubtful loans, I would tell you that the two things. First, yes, the Fortis doubtful loans are well covered clearly, especially, I would say, after the PPA adjustment. And second the additional doubtful loans in the BNP Paribas the historical period scope are also adequately covered file-by-file. We are not &#x2013; I mean, we are not trying to achieve a specific level of coverage; I mean the coverage is an a posteriori indicator. The way it works is that each file, each doubtful client is adequately covered through provisions committee which is deciding about the provision. And then we calculate a posteriori what's the coverage ratio which is coming out of that. And of course as you know, our policy is to cover adequately and even with the kind of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I have perhaps two very quick questions. The first one is on Findomestic, the acquisition that has been announced this morning. I was just wondering what was the motivation behind what seems to be a high price, just doing some quick calculation basically and what you pay is close to 2.6 times the tangible book value which seems quite high in the current environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that your ratio is correct. So, no. This transaction was necessary because the company couldn't stay any more in the situation where the two shareholders were mitigating, let's put it that way about the future of the company. So, the price we paid is priced through the cycle. This is not the price paid maybe two years ago in a more global transaction. It's &#x2013; these are the minimum price you could expect at that time of the cycle, but basically, it's a value, it's an additional price. On top of this, we will get a number of synergies especially with BNL, but not only with BNL. So we do believe this price is fair for both parties and that since we were consolidating in a very close market that is one of the four domestic markets for the Group, and that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would like to add that &#x2013; you know that we have financial criteria when we make an acquisition and one of the key criteria being that the return on invested equity has to beat the cost of capital of the target, of the bank acquired within three years. And in this case, this criteria is met. We have not made any exception, so it fits with the usual policy, acquisition policy, of BNP Paribas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Due to the high level of synergy I admit, but it's also something we have to consider when we buy something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I guess it includes synergies, because when I have a look at Findomestic in '07, '08, it contributed less than &#x20AC;70 billion of net income, which mean 25% at 500 million, it's close to 30 times, appears 30 times, which is also quite high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Put it another way I would say that being in litigation with a subsidiary which was a little bit block in its development, we had to share with the seller. We had to share the synergies, which is something which is a common practice in the market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Perhaps just another question on migration. You furbished the draft on the new IAS 39, which was particularly interesting, especially giving more details on what kind of asset could be included in <mark type="inaudible" /> mark-to-market value, and particularly the sales of assets in loan receivables could include only capital and interest rates, which could actually perhaps have an impact on stocks and also which are reclassified assets which were not included in this kind of specificities like <mark type="inaudible" />, where you have a kind of credit protection and so on. Do you think it could have an impact on the reclassification you've done late in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know we have made relatively low amount of reclassification. I think the question you should ask to the banks with high amount of reclassified assets. The total reclassified assets as far as we are concerned at the end of June are reaching only eight billion and the difference between the fair value and the book value is something like 200 million. So, I think, in our case, it's a question which has no practical consequence. That being said, I think we should take this draft as a draft, and not as something which is being necessarily going to be accepted, as such; and especially, it's somewhat surprising to see that after what we have seen in the crisis, it's a draft change which is increasing the proportion of assets having to be fair valued, which was not exactly what everybody was expecting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps just last question, you've probably already given the answer, but on the &#x20AC;20 billion of nominal value of the asset which are in the out portfolio of Fortis, could you just tell us what is noted as the current mark-to-market value?</p>

The big question for that portfolio now is what is going to be the loss &#x2013; at the terminal loss and how much is going to be repaid and how much not. And this portfolio again is now run on extinction mode and in the banking books and is not traded at all. It would be impossible anywhere to trade it. So it has to be looked at as a &#x2013; the relevant question, sorry, is not what the market value is.

I'm just wondering whether you can make some comments on the volumes in FICC in the third quarter. The second question is on Italy. We've seen a very strong performance both in terms of revenues and in terms of cost of risk at BNL, and this is very much in contrast with what we've seen for the other Italian banks. I'm just wondering what is your competitive advantage, and for how many more quarters you can sustain such a stronger performance? And finally, just a quick question on Fortis, whether you can confirm the 750 million restructuring costs, and when you're likely to book these charges, please?</p>

I'm afraid that we are still keeping quarterly and not weekly results, and so we're going to &#x2013; I don't think we're going to give details on the &#x2013; on either July or first week of August figures for fixed income. Regarding the Italian performance, Jean-Laurent?</p>

          <p>Yes. Well, BNL is a very nice bank. The problem with the bank that was for let's say 12 to 15 years, they just didn't invested in the domestic part because they were lacking cash flow. We've been injecting hundreds of millions of euros in this bank industry figures. Both in IT products, we are doing cross-selling, servicing customers; so obviously, the bank is expanding in terms of number of customers into retail, but also into corporate. When we bought the bank, for example, I do believe that we were number five or number six in the market for the commercial banking business, most probably today we're number three.</p>
          <p>We have start a number of, I would say, not so nice way of earning money from the starting point that is to say, for example, having very strong upfront fees on asset management products or insurance life products. So we stopped this two or three years ago.</p>
          <p>Obviously, if you look at other Italian banks, be sure, they are in a position in which for example, for this type of product, there is no new production, and you'll get a very negative effect of five to 6% of the new production you are lacking as compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>And I can give you a number of examples. So the performance is linked to basically to two phenomenons. One is the fact that the bank is expanding and this is normal, we have invested a lot in this bank. And second, from the beginning we have changed quite a little bit, let's put it that way, the way we earn money and revenues from the customer base. So this is also a very positive thing. So, how long are we going to expand? As long as we can. This is the story.</p>

          <p>With regard to restructuring charge. Let me again refer to the 1st of December, when we are going to release the industrial plan including a revised estimate of the restructuring charges. We have started expending money &#x2013; expensing money, sorry, for the restructuring. There are 20 million being booked this quarter in the corporate center of the restructuring charges 440. But this is only the beginning, and yes, you will have both the &#x2013; I would say, the total amount and the phasing of these expenses at the beginning of December.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Just two very quick questions, please. The first one, I wondered if I can ask a question about the sustainability of C&amp;IB revenues in a different way. If you include cost at 44% of revenues this quarter and your target is 60. Can I assume that that means that you assume the sustainable run rate of revenues is going to come down to about 2.5 billion? The second question is just on the dividend. Given your plans to repay the French government preference shares as quick as is prudent, should we assume that means that you keep the dividend flat or do you want to pay a progressive dividend at the same time as repaying the government preference shares obviously assuming that your earnings continue to growth? Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think. I'm not sure I understood your question on CIB revenues. The fact that this quarter, we have a cost/income ratio of 44%. You shouldn't derive any guessing from that figure to what we expect the CIB revenues to be in the third quarter and in the next few quarters. Well, I think that as a &#x2013; I think, in a quick summary, certainly, the second quarter revenues of CIB are very strong and we will see in the third quarter what they are, that's why there is no -- there is no guessing and it's possible from the cost/income ratio of the third quarter &#x2013; second quarter to what we expect over third quarter.</p>

          <p>Now, regarding the dividend. In terms of the dividend, we never give any guidance on the payout ratio. So I can't really answer a question about the dividends.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I just wanted to ask &#x2013; sorry, looking at Fortis, you've taken quite a big adjustment to your loan portfolio, and you still have high provisions around 142 basis points of risk-weighted assets in this &#x2013; if you know &#x2013; if you annualize your experience of the first &#x2013; of the six weeks. So I was wondering, why is it the case that despite the fact that you have written down so much, you still have higher provisions? And how do you see the proficiency evolving because there's a kind of warning in the way you present the slide that this is a significant risk going forward. Are we going to go way above 142 basis points in your view? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Well, looking at the banking beginning of October together with the Belgium Bank and management of the bank. So, well, we have, I would say, a clear understanding of where the bank stand in terms of cost of risk. We cannot say that's through the purchase. We are covered for years or even quarters to come cost of risk of the bank, this is just not possible. So we did on the 12th of May, what was possible to do, and <mark type="inaudible" /> and for the &#x2013; whether the bank is evolving if we are looking at the underlying business &#x2013; away of any exceptional items, I would say that Belgium, Belgium and Luxemburg more or less in the same mood as France bid at French Retail Banking, this is the same type of business.</p>
          <p>We should have more or less the same kind of evolution. Maybe one of the weak point is the European business center network that Fortis created five years ago. In these centers, we find two types of customers. One, are from Belgium, Benelux origin well known from the bank and the other part are more local, small and medium companies for which currently the cost of risk is rising. So maybe this part is to be monitored more closely, maybe also the leasing operation compared to the one Group of BNP Paribas is an operation that would cost more because of very quick expansion over the last four, five years. In a qualitative way, this is what we can say about Fortis at this stage and we will comment in a much more detailed way on 1st of December.</p>
