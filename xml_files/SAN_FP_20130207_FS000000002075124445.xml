          <p>Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to go. So good afternoon to those here in La Bo&#xE9;tie our headquarter. Just a little anecdote: I'm actually very proud to contribute to the cost savings plan of the company because this year we are organizing our full year results indeed in our own offices. That will lead to about &#x20AC;130,000 of savings on the IR budget.</p>
          <p>So, joke aside, welcome to our full year results. As always, I must draw your attention to the forward-looking statements. So, our presentation today will contain forward-looking statements which involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. I suggest that you look into our 20-F and document de r&#xE9;f&#xE9;rence to have more details on these.</p>
          <p>So with that, today the presentation will be divided in four segments. First, we'll have Chris Viehbacher, our CEO, who will share with you the key highlights for 2012. We will then have our CFO, Jer&#xF4;me Contamine, who will provide you with details on the financial results. Then we'll move on to a section where we'll review the performance of our growth platforms. This will led by Hanspeter Spek, our President of Global Operations. Also with Olivier Charmeil, who is our Senior VP for Vaccines. And Chris will be in his role as Chairman of Genzyme also coming back to talk about the Genzyme operational performance.</p>
          <p>Then we'll move to an update on R&amp;D with Dr. Elias Zerhouni who is President of Global R&amp;D at Sanofi. And finally, Chris will come back on stage to wrap up this presentation with his views on 2013 as well as the midterm outlook. We'll then go into a Q&amp;A session, which will last for about 40 minutes, and I will for those of us &#x2013; of you, sorry, who are following us on webcast, I will take questions also from the webcast as well as from people here in the room today attending live.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn the call over to Chris.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, good morning, everybody. Thank you for the savings, S&#xE9;bastien. I could probably add that actually part of our overall cost reduction measures, reorganization of Paris-based office space will have eliminated 100,000 square meters of office space with an annual saving of &#x20AC;50 million. So you can see that we continue to be cost conscious and focused on growing the business.</p>
          <p>You know, as I present to you today, I'm thinking about the very 	 that I did this in the name of Sanofi, which was in February of 2009. Back in 2009, we were looking forward to the patent cliff and actually on that day, that was the very first time we as a company admitted there was a patent cliff. And announced really a strategy about how we intended to deal with the patent cliff.</p>
          <p>This morning I was on TV and the journalist was very kind saying, you know you've never deviated a single line from that strategy, and I think that's true. It hasn't always been easy. Not everybody's believed it. But I would say today that we have successfully navigated through the patent cliff because if you look at all of the products that we lost, we have had certainly the most concentrated and deepest patent cliff of anybody in the industry. And I'll show you some numbers on that.</p>
          <p>The objective as we laid out four years ago, now it wasn't just to replace the sales of those products we were going to lose. It was to put the company on a completely different path. It was meant to provide long-term sustainable growth of the business. And you can't do that if you're really only ever going to be focused on R&amp;D and patents. So what we were looking to do were to create these growth platforms that had different barriers to competitive entry, whether it be capital investment, brands, know-how. But the idea was that really unless you got that long-term predictability of earnings, you were never going to get to a higher multiple.</p>
          <p>This industry has now for at least a decade underperformed the broader market in terms of multiples. In the last two, three years, last two in particular, Sanofi has closed the gap to its peers on multiple. But I would say that on an average multiple of around 11, 12 times, this industry is still at a discount to private sector, and largely that's around the perceived R&amp;D and the lack of long-term predictability. So what we were really looking to do with these long-life assets like vaccines and like Consumer Health Care and Animal Health and emerging markets, was to provide a platform of predictable long-term earnings.</p>
          <p>Now, it never was meant to eliminate innovation as the core of our business. But if you were doing research and development in the context of a company that can grow long-term without patents, then imagine the leverage effect that you could get if one of these products actually makes it out of R&amp;D. And imagine actually the predictability of a business that knows that it can grow even if in a particular year, a particular product doesn't make it.</p>
          <p>And imagine the discipline that you can have in R&amp;D if you're no longer dependent on meeting your 2014 number because a certain product has to launch because I can tell you, in my career, the thing that really drove me nuts the most was that we took compromises. We made compromises along the development path because we needed to hit certain expected net present value calculations on our portfolio, that we needed to have a certain number of projects in every stage of development, and I think that has led to poor-quality pipelines.</p>
          <p>And so the objective we have, and Elias will talk more about it, is to really be a growing company on a long-term basis and known for the science. Now, we're not entirely there yet but I think we've made a significant amount of progress, and I would submit that today the company is stronger than it was four years ago, largely because back then we had a significant amount of our sales and an even bigger percentage of our profits that were threatened by generic entry, and today we have probably one of the lowest exposures to generic entry of anybody in our industry.</p>
          <p>Now, we all know that Plavix had a big impact on our business in May of 2012 and it's going to take a year from May 2012 for all that to wash out. Eighteen months ago, we told you that the impact of losing Plavix and Avapro in the U.S. was about &#x20AC;2 billion on an after-tax basis and on a 12-month basis. That would be split roughly between 2012 and 2008 &#x2013; 2013. In actual fact, because of exchange rates and a few other things, it's actually about &#x20AC;2.1 billion, and so the effect in 2012 was &#x20AC;1.3 billion and it'll be &#x20AC;800 million next year, so it's about &#x20AC;100 million more than what we had expected.</p>
          <p>So as a result, we're going to be affected by comparisons to last year when we still had Plavix until the middle of the year, but once we're back into like-for-like comparators, we expect to be able to show growth in our business on both top and bottom lines. And of course everything that we are looking at in the business completely confirms what we thought 18 months ago. All of the businesses are performing as we had thought and so we are completely confident in being able to meet our 2012 to 2015 objectives for sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>Now what we've done, I think you've known, we moved from the blockbuster phase. We've just finished four years of extensive transformation. A lot has gone on in the company that you'll never see and it's completely invisible but it certainly has included investing in the growth platforms and diversification, cost management. And I think as we stand here today, I would say we start a new chapter. I mean really the major impact on results is finally getting rid of the generic drag on the business and just letting the growth platforms continue to perform as they have over the last three years.</p>
          <p>The other aspect that is quite exciting this year is, and most of you don't know Sanofi as a pipeline company, but if I've had any surprises over the last 12 months it's really that the pipeline has kind of crept up on us. We have not had the attrition we've expected. We've had interesting assets like the IL-4 suddenly come through and come through faster. I think the partnership with Regeneron, for instance, drives us at a pace that's probably faster than your typical big pharma pace. And as a result, I think we're actually looking at an extremely robust late stage pipeline.</p>
          <p>You've seen the number of approvals we've had even in the past week and of course all of those need to be properly funded. And, so, I think in addition to the growth platforms, you're going to see us increasingly become a story of launching new products and having a sustainable pipeline.</p>
          <p>Now in all of this, of course, we've been able to grow our sales. We started &#x2013; 2008 was the first year I presented. We had &#x20AC;27.5 billion in sales. I'll show you in a minute that had we done nothing, we would have certainly lost &#x20AC;5 billion because of generic entry. We're showing close to &#x20AC;35 billion in sales and so there's been a significant increase in sales and of course we all know that at least part of that is through acquisition. But I will tell you that it's at least a 50/50 split between what was acquired in growth and what we've been able to do organically through our growth platforms.</p>
          <p>If you look at, well, what has really left us over time? It's a pretty impressive list of products from Allegra all the way through Eloxatin. And you can really see this concentration. Sanofi really before 2010 had never really been faced with any significant patent expiry, and after 2012, as I'll show you later, really isn't faced with any &#x2013; at least any small molecule patent expiry till the end of the decade. But in those critical two &#x2013; three years of 2010, 2011 and 2012, you saw an awful lot of business at risk.</p>
          <p>So when I look on the right side of that graph, of course, you see this, the nine products that were really facing patent expiry and generic entry had sales of &#x20AC;7.6 billion roughly in 2008. &#x20AC;5 billion has walked out the door and so that perimeter is now &#x20AC;2.2 billion. Of course, we all know that that never really goes to zero and &#x2013; but there will be some marginal impact in 2013 of some of that business.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, the growth platforms that we just talked about have grown from &#x20AC;11.8 billion to &#x20AC;23.5 billion. They were 42% of sales and they're roughly around 70% of our sales today. By 2015, as we already said 18 months ago, they'll be roughly 80% of our sales. In other words, the emerging new Sanofi is really the growth platforms. And as you'll see also later on, we are able to grow those growth platforms close to 10% &#x2013; 9.9 % to be exact.</p>
          <p>Individually, emerging markets grew at 8.3%. We didn't achieve our double-digit target in 2012. I don't think that's for any fundamental market reason. This is principally as a result of, for example, Eastern Europe, which is growing slower. We describe emerging markets essentially as those countries that spend less than 5% of GDP on healthcare because we know that that's an underinvestment in healthcare. However, Eastern Europe continues to be principally affected by macroeconomic trends in Western Europe, but, and Hanspeter will go into more detail, you'll see that the key regions of Asia, of Latin America and Middle East Africa continue to grow at double-digits. My personal view is, and I have not changed one iota on this, I still believe that emerging markets is the single biggest growth lever that this industry has.</p>
          <p>Diabetes continues to perform extraordinarily well at 16.7%; Vaccines at 5.7%; Consumer Health Care, 9.9%. We were nowhere as a consumer health company four years ago, and today, I have to say I'm extremely proud of our teams in being able to say that we're the third OTC company now worldwide after J&amp;J and Bayer.</p>
          <p>Animal Health, an extremely important business, I think we continue to drive value since the acquisition of Merck's half of the business. If you think about Frontline four years ago, the patent expired; it is still a &#x20AC;1 billion plus brand, and there's a very exciting pipeline. We never talk about the pipeline because in this business you test the products in animals and therefore it's pretty fast for the competitors to chase you. So we tend to tell you about what's in the pipeline about five minutes before we launch it, as I say largely for competitive reasons but I think you'll see that growth accelerate in the future.</p>
          <p>New Genzyme &#x2013; and I'll go into some detail later, really a success story in the past year. Innovative Products at &#x20AC;611 million grew at 10% but we all know that that part really has been historically a weakness of the company and I think you're going to see that strengthen over the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>We were busy on external growth. It was one of our key pillars in strategy. &#x20AC;23.7 billion in acquisitions. We acquired 32 companies but of course the most notable was Genzyme; 91 in-licensing agreements and we entered into three joint ventures.</p>
          <p>You know, Genzyme really was a &#x2013; had a remarkable year. And this was a very, very delicate exercise. The biggest issue we had was how are you going to integrate an iconic biotech company? We're talking about one of the four original biotech companies ever created in the world suddenly being merged with a big pharma.</p>
          <p>People who work in biotech generally work there because they don't want to work for big pharma. Now we're going to take a French-American cultural exchange. We had a hostile bid to acquire the company. So the stars were really aligned against us in being able to integrate it and I think one of the first tests was the ability of the Sanofi team to work with the Genzyme team, who'd been working day and night for two years to really get that production back on track.</p>
          <p>And I think the fact that they were able to work together, get Framingham approved by both the EMA and FDA within four days of each other in January is an extremely important event. We also then saw that Shire did not get Replagal approved in the United States and that really allowed Genzyme to take advantage of the renewed manufacturing capacity and the open market in the United States and now also to reconquer market share in Europe, and so we're close to double the business in Fabrazyme. All of the other business is performing well.</p>
          <p>The other, of course, is that we decided to make new Genzyme. Remember, we took the oncology, the biosurgery, the renal business, put that into Sanofi where we had the marketing muscle to do more with those businesses. New Genzyme is rare disease and multiple sclerosis and I'll show you a little later on, but they've already launched Aubagio with success. We have Kynamro approved and of course Lemtrada has been filed in the EU and in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So this is just what I've said before. This is largely what we've said. We've had because of some tweaks to exchange rates and some other things, it's a slightly different mix from the &#x20AC;1.3 billion and &#x20AC;700 million. It's &#x20AC;1.3 billion and &#x20AC;800 million. But largely, this is a predictable event. We've seen it coming and I think we've managed through it.</p>
          <p>Of course, we shouldn't forget that we live in an extremely difficult environment. On the U.S. side, of course, we had healthcare reform from President Obama and these are mostly taxes that have impacted us. Those are expected to reach almost $500 million in 2013 for us. On the EU side, things are no easier. We all know about the austerity measures in Europe. These are measures to either increase generic utilization, decrease prices or increase the difficulty of getting new medicines approved. I would say Europe is probably the most difficult region in the world for the pharmaceutical industry today and is likely to remain so for a couple of years. That's about &#x20AC;300 million for us in the 2010-2013 period, on an annual basis, I would add. And of course because we are a traditionally rooted European company, we have a fairly large tail product business that gets affected by these measures.</p>
          <p>Now, this is the EPS picture, 12.8%, but if you went back to the &#x20AC;5.59 in 2008 and you calculate the generic impact, you would have seen that we would have lost 50% of our EPS had we not employed the strategy that we did. 12.8% is clearly down &#x2013; is nothing to write home about, but it's certainly a lot better than it could have been and I think a credible performance given what we faced in terms of patent expiries.</p>
          <p>Now, as we look forward, I think this comes back to this notion again. I think a huge amount of progress has been made on the R&amp;D front. I mean, nine regulatory approvals in the last year, and certainly we've seen a couple that are already off to a good launch start. We've got six new drugs and vaccines which have been submitted, so we're going to have other decisions and Elias will tell you what's in Phase III. But all of these are progressing well and as I say, we've had certainly less attrition.</p>
          <p>In terms of progression to Phase III, we've got the PCSK9 inhibitor and Elias will talk about the big ODYSSEY study. We've got our new insulin glargine formulation. We've got the JAK2 inhibitor. We've got the Fluzone quadrivalent ID, the Synvisc One for hip. As you've seen, the LixiLan device, because of a recent technical glitch, is not probably going to go into Phase III this year. For Phase III results reading out this year, we have the Lemtrada and this was back in 2012. We had Lemtrada, we had Lyxumia, we had eliglustat and we've just announced that the ENCORE study, which is the second Phase III, met its primary end point in efficacy.</p>
          <p>And one of the most important events I think was the ORIGIN study and the epidemiology study. I mean, we not only put to rest any concerns around safety, but now as we look at competitive increase I would submit to you that there isn't a product that has a more robust safety profile and efficacy profile out there in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So what are we going to see in 2013? Well we've already ticked the box for ENCORE. We've got the JAK2 inhibitor and you can see these products. I won't go into them in detail, because Elias will cover the pipeline a little bit later. But you can see that actually there's an awful lot going. What is also good for me is, you know, I've been a skeptic on R&amp;D for many years now. But I will say that when I look at a pipeline and I say, do we know mechanisms of action? Do we have a robust proof of concept? Do we have a high percentage which are biologics? And I can answer to all three of those questions a yes. That gives me a whole lot more confidence about this pipeline's ability to make it through to the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Now the dividend has been an important part of the value story of our stock, particularly as we've been going through the transforming. We wanted to make sure that investors continued to believe in our company. And so the best way that we could communicate our own confidence in the business was a steadily progressing dividend. And you've seen since 2008 we've increased steadily the payout, and steadily increased the dividend, regardless of actually the development of EPS to &#x20AC;2.77. That's a compound annual growth rate of close to 6%, and we intend to &#x2013; we still are intending to achieve a payout ratio in 2014 with the payout of the dividend in respect of this year.</p>
          <p>One of the untold stories of the company over the last four years, is it's not only just a question of transforming the business, of dealing with the patent cliff. We obviously had our key shareholder for very legitimate strategic reasons exiting the company. And they certainly did it on a sensitive way, trading every day. But nonetheless, we had 1% of the capital coming into the market every quarter. And depending the market cap that's anywhere from &#x20AC;500 million to &#x20AC;800 million every quarter, and that has meant that we've had to go around and find new shareholders. And the shareholding of the company has dramatically changed over the last four years. That's why it has been extremely important for investors to believe in the long-term story of the company, but also in the dividend, because I think we've actually been able to manage this part of the cliff equally well. I just want to confirm that of course, TOTAL is no longer a shareholder of the business today.</p>
          <p>So, to wrap up my part, if I look at four years, sales up to &#x20AC;34.9 billion from &#x20AC;27.6 billion. Key genericized product sales were 28.4% of sales four years ago, they're now 3%, probably again one of the lowest rates in the industry. The growth platforms, which were fledgling businesses back in 2008 now 70.4% of our business. Emerging markets business from &#x20AC;6.5 billion to &#x20AC;11.1 billion. Biologics, we had clearly been behind in biologics and I'm very happy to see that 48%, close to half of our pipeline, is in biologics and you may remember me setting that as a target three or four years ago. Earnings per share clearly not up as much as in sales, but still up from &#x20AC;5.59 to &#x20AC;6.20 in 2012, and of course the dividend up to &#x20AC;2.77.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine. J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon or good morning, everybody. So I will go quickly through a bit more detail on the financials.</p>
          <p>So I start with the sales. You are used to this graph, and I would say that clearly we continue to see this graph for another two quarters as long as we get out of the full impact of the patent cliff. So as we know, Q1, Q2 will still show a difference in 2013 as compared to 2012. So the lesson of this graph is pretty much all the same. On one hand we've lost over the years &#x20AC;1.3 billion of sales from this definite list of key genericized products, and on top of that, we terminated or it as agreed that we had to terminate our agreement with Teva and Copaxone. We have sold out our Dermik business in the U.S.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the growth platform has contributed for &#x20AC;1.6 billion of extra sales, on top of which we can consider that in 2012 another quarter of Genzyme which we didn't consolidate obviously in 2011, which leads us to basically a slightly increasing sales all-in-all on a consolidation sales basis. And clearly in to 2012 in comparison to 2011 but we know that it is always fluctuating. We had a very positive tailwind impact of foreign exchange rates, in particular because the euro was pretty weak in 2012 versus most of the other currencies, leading to this overall increase of 4.7%.</p>
          <p>Well, maybe a few more words on the currency impact. This graph is firstly here to tell you, to give you more details. I think that we presented this graph in the previous quarters. Also to show there is volatility in this impact. So in fact, the bulk of the tailwind impact was visible in Q2 on Q3. In Q4 the comparison was not that different. In fact, we had an exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the euro of $1.35 versus $ 1.30 in Q4 when the gap was $1.39 versus a bit less than $1.30 for the overall year.</p>
          <p>It's not only the U.S. dollar. We know that we are also exposed to quite a number of other currencies, which in a way mitigates also our risk. We are present in Japan. We are present in Brazil and Brazil went the other way around. I mean the Brazilian real went down last year. So this will go as it is but it's clear that since the beginning of the year we should not see such a positive impact on the like-for-like basis even if of course we don't know yet what we will be the final average trade of the U.S. dollar in particular. I remind you, and this has not really changed, that the variation of the one cent of the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar versus the euro leads to 0.3% variation on the business net income.</p>
          <p>As expected, Q4 has shown a low profit and a declining profit versus the same quarter of the previous year. And I can tell you today that it has been a tough quarter. So we know the term. We don't expect to have Q1 2013 be as low as Q4 2012 on the constant exchange rate basis, so clearly Q4 is a tough quarter even if clearly Q1 or Q2 because suffering from a difficult comparator will be still be much lower than Q1 or Q2 2012. So still two quarters to go through the cliff, not that we're going to lose more sales, but because for comparative reasons, the base will be higher.</p>
          <p>So as expected, we have delivered &#x20AC;8.20 per share, earnings per share for the whole year. And I think that is, you'll notice that we've been very much in line with what the consensus expected.</p>
          <p>So if I look at the overall P&amp;L for the full year, well it's clear that you see the impact of the patent expiries and in particular the impact of the patent expiry of Plavix. You see that and I will come back on the next slide on the other revenue, which is basically royalties, but also on the contribution of the share of profit from associates for the part we used to consolidate, we can, let's say formally still consolidating from our joint venture with BMS in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So this clearly is the big change. At the same time, we have managed our cost base in such a way that we have reached a business operating margin of 32.5%, which is somewhat higher, slightly higher than what we expected one year ago when I gave the guidance that we should be between 31% and 32%.</p>
          <p>Okay. So now I'll go a bit more in detail, line-by-line. So I start with this other revenue line and you see here &#x2013; and we try to make as much detail as possible. You see the contribution quarter-after-quarter on the declining contribution of the royalties coming from BMS, both on the other revenue lines. This is the higher part of the slide. On the income from associates, which is the lower part of the same slide.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, if I take the higher part, gray part is basically disappearing. We still benefited from &#x20AC;532 million of revenues this year, which we won't get next year in 2013. These are, of course, before tax. And the remaining is &#x20AC;478 million which unfortunately will still suffer from the end of a royalty paid on Amboil, which we are just now losing. So on the like-for-like business, the Amboil impact or also royalty from Amboil will present &#x20AC;100 million as compared to 2012. So in other terms, we should end up with something which will fluctuate between &#x20AC;300 million and &#x20AC;350 million of other revenues in 2013.</p>
          <p>Second is the income from associates. Well this was a big line in the Sanofi P&amp;L, which was a bit was unique for us. Well you see that it has complicated the P&amp;L and we are now &#x2013; we're basically coming down to zero.</p>
          <p>Cost of shares to shares ratio. As planned, we've seen an increase of this ratio still in 2012. This is a result of the business, the evolution of the mix of businesses and when it comes to Q4, the significant performance of our Vaccine business, where as you know, the gross margin is lower than the average gross margin of the group and will even more when we are selling more flu, which has an average growth margin which is somewhat lower than the average growth margin of the vaccine activity. This being put aside, and there is no exceptional in the Q4, and we are in line with the guidance I gave at the beginning of the year, which was to be between 31.5% and 32%.</p>
          <p>The important news is that what we expect from 2013 is that the business mix impact won't be that significant on that. On the other hand, we expect the productivity measures that we are progressively implementing into our industrial network on many aspects would lead to some improvement of the cost of sales to sales ratio. Not a huge improvement. This will be progressive. But we expect that it will be an extension point 2012 to 2013. Of course, still we have some exchange rate impact because we are producing more in the euro zone so with this exception, which could lead to some marginal fluctuation on a constant exchange rate basis, we expect in 2013 an improvement of the cost sales to sales ratio.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D, continuing to be tightly managed, trying to bring down the internal cost in order to give more headroom to invest in externally, both in partnerships but also in late-stage clinical trials, which we did in 2012 obviously and in particular during Q4 where we have embarked into the full recruitment of the number of Phase III studies which are ongoing under the ODYSSEY program in particular for PCSK9 but also for IL-6, which explains largely why there is a strict recap of the overall R&amp;D expense for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So all-in-all, R&amp;D expense for the full year have been within the guidance we gave to be somewhere below &#x20AC;5 billion. It's on the constant exchange rate basis down by 3.6% if you compare including Genzyme for the full year 2011. And this, despite the fact that we have started these large Phase III trials. For 2013 we expect to maintain our overall R&amp;D expense within the &#x20AC;5 billion envelope.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A, here again tight control on costs in mature areas, tight control on G&amp;A, which has been declining. If you are able to read the footnote, you would see that our G&amp;A expense on a ratio basis has declined by 3.1% on a ratio basis has declined as well. So we have reduced G&amp;A and this is really the result of Genzyme synergies on building our shared service platforms to be more efficient in our management of our IS and well as finance or HR platforms all over the group. At the same time, we have been investing behind growth platforms and also we have been investing in particular in Q4 to build our MS marketing and sales and marketing team, which explains why we've seen some increase of our SG&amp;A expense for the fourth quarter. So this being said, we will continue to generate cost reduction while continuing to invest next year, which I think is what is described in the next slide.</p>
          <p>So as you remember in September 2011 we announced that we had wanted to embark into a new cost saving program with directive to save &#x20AC;2 billion by 2015. This included the synergies activities to the integration of Genzyme, which were evaluated at the time around $700 million, i.e. around &#x20AC;500 million.</p>
          <p>So at the end of 2012, we have achieved 60% of this cost-saving plan, i.e. around &#x20AC;1.2 billion. And the Genzyme synergies are basically being reached. I mean, not exactly 100%. We will reach a bit more than 100% in fact during this first half of 2013. One third of these net &#x2013; gross cost-savings have been reinvested into growth platforms.</p>
          <p>Now when it comes to 2013, we will continue to generate a savings more than &#x20AC;500 million worth. We'll say at3 this stage at least &#x20AC;500 million. But it's fair to say that because of the new launches we are working on, as you know, we had just three approvals last week, we are going to invest more on new launches leading to reinvesting a significant part, let's say, of the &#x20AC;500 million of savings which we plan to reach in 2013. So we are entering into a period where because we need to shift both our growth platforms under <mark type="inaudible" /> around these, we are reinvesting a, let's say, significant part of the savings we generate. It remains that we will continue to generate savings in 2014 and 2015 both on OpEx but also on the cost of sales for all the programs, which I mentioned already, which is leading to improving productivity of our industrial network.</p>
          <p>Okay. I will go quickly, but still below the operating income line. So to start with the rest of the P&amp;L down to the business net income, so maybe here I'd like to make two comments. The first one is on financial expenses. I'd like just to remind you that in 2011 we just accounted for the net debt as from Q2 when we acquired Genzyme, which was just three quarters of that. When we had four quarters during 2012 on top of that for the fourth quarter, we took a provision on one non-consolided asset we had for a minor amount. So this leads to a stabilization, let's say, of financial expenses for the year of 2012, assuming the same level of debt.</p>
          <p>In terms of tax, we end with a lower tax rate, that's what we expected. We gave at Q3 the guidance that we should be at 26%. Actually we end at 25.5%. And there are two reasons for that. The first is that, the development of the group leads to increased revenues, which on profit which are generated in countries which have a lower tax rate than the tax rate which we incur both in France, as well as in the U.S. So the fact that we are developing more in lower tax-rate countries is helping, a bit more than expected, our tax rate and on top of that, we have the full effect of the agreement we had with the Japanese tax authorities, which is again leaving a certain level of profitability in Japan and bringing back the rest in lower-tax countries.</p>
          <p>So for 2013, of course this may be a question you may have, we expect to have the tax rate to be between 26.5% and 27%, so an increase and obviously, this results from the fact that we have less revenue from royalties, which are taxed at a low tax rate, but still a limited increase.</p>
          <p>One word on the new accounting rule, when it comes to pensions, well this is an IFRS rule, which has a negative impact from a P&amp;L standpoint, but not from an equity standpoint. So basically we cannot count anymore in our P&amp;L expected profitability of the assets which we manage, but thus we account the revenue on these contracts which are &#x2013; we are using to discount the liabilities.</p>
          <p>So the impact for 2012, and I think this has been posted on our website and you had some indication already in December, has been &#x20AC;78 million on the BNI in fact it has not been included <mark type="inaudible" />, it would have been and so it's not continued to 2012 BNI because this norm will be applied as from 2013 representing &#x20AC;0.06 per share. In 2013, it's a bit difficult to access exactly how it will represent, it should not be very far, but probably slightly higher, maybe &#x20AC;0.08 to &#x20AC;0.09 &#x2013; everything being equal.</p>
          <p>From the business net income to the IFRS net income, while, I don't think there are many comments here. The first one is if we continue to have an amortization of intangible assets, which is pretty stable at &#x20AC;3.3 billion. The last part is coming from the Aventis acquisition on the assets or the intangible, which was allocated &#x2013; the goodwill which was allocated to assets at the time. Another part is coming from the more recent acquisitions with Genzyme or Merial, and you have the detail in the press release.</p>
          <p>We have very limited impairment on intangible assets. It's mainly on ombrabulin and the termination of the compound, which we were developing coming from Exelixis. The fair value remeasurement of contingent and consolidated liabilities is the revaluation of the CVR based on the actual market price of the CVR and you see the impact on the restructuring cost line of the reserves we took for the French plan during Q4, which here again you can read in details.</p>
          <p>So all that leads to an overall net attributable income to Sanofi shareholders of &#x20AC;4.967 billion, which is a decline of 12.8%, which is pretty close to the evolution of the business earning per share.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, we continue to generate strong cash flow despite of the loss of the revenue on the cash flow generated by Plavix since May. We generated &#x20AC;7.3 billion of free cash flow after paying for working capital variation on capital expenditures. We have reduced and put under control our capital expenditure program. Also some big investments are somewhat coming to an end, or close to the end, such as for instance <mark type="inaudible" /> facility in France. And I think we have got &#x2013; we have put in place a tighter control on our working capital requirement, so that in fact we managed to reduce the level of receivables while controlling the evolution of our inventory just by increasing inventory at Genzyme, which clearly was required.</p>
          <p>Cash returned to shareholders in total represented &#x20AC;4.3 billion. This includes a dividend for &#x20AC;3.5 billion but also share repurchases which represented &#x20AC;800 million. So all-in-all, the net debt has decreased, decreased significantly by &#x20AC;3.1 billion, showing the capacity of the group to generate cash flow and I mean giving us the flexibility to increase firstly the dividend when the profit is somewhat declining, so this was clearly anticipated and probably will discuss later on this question of allocation of capital.</p>
          <p>Okay. With that, I will hand over now to Hanspeter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me. Good afternoon. Good morning. I'm here to give you some more insight into the performance of 2012. As you have heard, 2012 has been mainly marked by the strong, by the good performance, by the performance as expected of our growth platforms. This represent no more than 70% of our sales. You see that those growth platforms were outstanding in the first quarter of 2011 for &#x20AC;4.6 billion in the last quarter for &#x20AC;6 billion. They are composed of a still small but growing share of other innovative products evidently New Genzyme, Animal Health, CHC, Vaccines, Diabetes, and the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>What has changed also and what is a premiere in our reporting, for the first time the emerging markets becomes most important part or important piece of our business. As you see from the chart, we have achieved &#x20AC;11.1 billion. This of course you have heard already from Chris, 8.3%, and this represents 31.9% of our total business, which means the emerging markets have overtaken the United States and by far also Western Europe. Remarkable also since the share of Europe continues to decrease for reasons you understand. You see that we have a decrease of 9.3% invest in European sales and the sales in the United States have been stable in 2012 and by the way, we expect the growth as of 2013 in the United States.</p>
          <p>How did this all happen in the emerging markets, you see that we always had a strong position. I have mentioned many times before that to some extent this is even a historical effect due to the early entry of companies like <mark type="inaudible" /> in those parts of the world. We had 2005 approximately $5 billion sales, but nevertheless you see very impressively over the last seven years sales have increased to more than &#x20AC;11 billion and the growth in recent years has accelerated mainly by increased efforts in those markets by reallocation, which means we have reduced our efforts in Europe and also to quite some extent in the United States and have reallocated sales resources to the emerging markets. One highlight we have today, more pharmaceutical sales representatives in China than in the United States, where in 2005 we had about 10,000 and today it's approximately half of it.</p>
          <p>Now also Chris had mentioned, since why only 8.3% of growth in front of our commitment to 10%. You see from the chart on the right side that this is largely due to the definition of emerging markets because for historical reasons and in order to remain comparable, we continue to integrate Eastern European countries, which in their overall macroeconomic development but also in their healthcare development get more and more close to the Western European markets. But you see then that outside we have a growth in Africa and Middle East of 10% in both markets together. We achieved &#x20AC;1 billion of sales also for the first time each. You see that in Asia including of course China, we have another 10% growth, obtaining sales of &#x20AC;2.8 billion, and in Latin America growth of 11.3% equal to &#x20AC;3.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Now the Diabetes platform also has seen a record year in 2012. You see then once again for the last three years how sales really continuously developed from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and yes, evidently Lantus is a flagship product inside obtaining sales of nearly &#x20AC;5 billion in 2012. And this with a growth rate of 16.7% and on the right side of the chart you see that we have obtained 22% of growth with Lantus in the U.S., 25% in emerging markets for sales approaching the &#x20AC;1 billion mark. Western Europe at least 5% growth in an otherwise overall flat market environment and in the rest of the world part, 20.6%. It's not only at all Lantus. It's also Apidra came back to a very strong growth and we had an excellent fourth quarter in 2012. You may remember that Apidra was suffering from a stock-out situation due to production problems in 2012 and the product is really very nicely back on track in 2012.</p>
          <p>You have also heard about Lyxumia. Lyxumia is for us a major launch. I say it's a major launch because we intend of course to launch the product in Europe, in Japan and in the United States with two different speeds. You may remember that the FDA has asked us to submit cardiovascular data, safety data, as the respective study called ELIXA underway and is performing exactly according to schedule. Consequently we intend to file the product during the first quarter 2013.</p>
          <p>In Europe, very, very recently, within the last week, so to say we have obtained the European approval and we start launching the product as of the second quarter 2013 in the usual launch pattern. We launch first, we have early access, which historically and classically will be Germany and the United Kingdom and towards the end of the year all other major countries including France.</p>
          <p>We have also heard that we had a &#x2013; Chris called it a glitch, a technical glitch with the device for a combined application of Lantus and Lyxumia. This of course is unfortunate. Nevertheless, it's part of our business, technical problems that occur. I believe that it is less severe because we have to establish anyways the product first in a single dose.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless the product will be dosed in combination from the very, very first day because as you see from the charts the whole development program was built in the direction of combining Lyxumia with oral anti-diabetics and for us more importantly with insulin. We know that approximately 25% to 30% of all Lantus patients also get GLP-1 so it was a major aim of our development program to show that a combined dose of both molecules achieves additional effects and according to the clinical program, we could prove this, and consequently we also have obtained an adequate indication. So we will exploit for the next years the product solely but of course in a joint recommended dose together with our insulin products, Lantus and to some extent also Apidra.</p>
          <p>And as a recent introduction is Zaltrap, a product which we have launched since autumn in 2012 in the United States. Zaltrap is indicated in the second and third line treatment of colon cancer. This is for Sanofi, to some extent, yes, I may call it, a historical indication. You may remember that we have been first offering any treatment of this disease with Eloxatin. To some extent, we now come back. Also, there's a totally different way of treatment. We have also, quite recently, within the last couple of days, obtained European approval, and the rollout starts as of today in the major European countries.</p>
          <p>Now this product I carry here in my pocket because I think it's really always worth to show it to you. I understand that some of you have received a training sample from our Investor Relations. It is a product which is really new because it speaks, it really instructs a patient how to use this product in a very dramatic situation indication, which is anaphylactic shock. It is a significant market. As you see from the chart, it is a market in the United States of <mark type="inaudible" /> round about 1 billion and there is a single competitor on the market, which is EpiPen from my Mylan so we have a really and easily attackable target and this has of course caused some reaction also from this target.</p>
          <p>As you see, the two inventors made it to the front page, the inventors of the product, which we have licensed in a week. We have made it to the front page of The New York Times, underlining this product is really a breakthrough in terms of safety and convenience. We are very optimistic for this product, which is a true innovation, as I've outlined here, from The New York Times.</p>
          <p>Merial is in a face-off. Stabilization, we have obtained nearly &#x20AC;2.2 billion sales in 2012, which is a growth rate of a little bit more than 3%. We prepare a basic renovation of the portfolio of Merial, which consists, as you see from the chart, mainly of pharmaceuticals for companion animals, amongst Frontline. Frontline selling about &#x20AC;775 million in 2012.</p>
          <p>We have developed over the last 5 years to 10 years major new products in these fields, the field of flea and tick, which presents significant advantages in terms of convenience, outdoor activity and safe dosing, and we will be launching those products as of the end of 2013. So 2013 will once again see a performance approximately in line, perhaps a little bit accelerated, as compared to 2012. And then in 2014, we expect a significant increase of sales for us due to the various new products, which we intend to launch as of the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health Care, another very positive result in 2012. We have obtained more than &#x20AC;3 billion of sales. The portfolio is growing by 9.9% which is a good growth I believe. The overall OTC market is growing at 2012 about 4%, 4.5% and you see that we have obtained the third rank I believe and we really started to concentrate on Consumer Health Care. We have the seventh or eighth ranking company. So we do well, we do well also by acquisitions but we can say that the major acquisition we have made in Consumer Health Care which of course is Chattem continues to do very good and not only with Allegra but we also made the interesting acquisition. You may have seen that we have acquired from J&amp;J Rolaids, and we plan to relaunch the product, which has been absent of the American markets for production problems on this side of J&amp;J. We intend to launch the product by the end of 2013, which will further accelerate the performance of Chattem in the United States.</p>
          <p>Now I pass it over to Olivier who will continue this very positive figures out of 2012 for our Vaccine division. Olivier?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Hanspeter. Good afternoon. Good morning. I'm afraid I have nothing in my pocket but I'm happy to report that Sanofi Pasteur ended 2012 on a very high note. We had a very strong fourth quarter with our sales up 20.5% with a strong growth coming from the emerging markets where we show a very strong performance with sales up almost 24%. For the full year for Sanofi Pasteur our sales have reached &#x20AC;3.9 billion, up 5.7%. We continue to drive our profitability up due to rigorous management of our OpEx and targeted investments beyond our growth drivers. Our profitability has gained one point, one percentage point from 20.4% to 29.5%, getting closer to the profitability of the rest of the business.</p>
          <p>After a couple of years of very sluggish sales in Europe with our joint venture with Merck, now we are happy report that we have regained some momentum. We had a very strong fourth quarter, with a growth of 9%. And for the full year, we show a growth of 6.8%. For 2013, we get prepared now for the launch of our hexavalent vaccine, which is expected in 2013, at the end of the first half. And it will be an important growth driver for 2013.</p>
          <p>Sanofi Pasteur had another very good flu campaign in 2012. The history of flu is very different each and every year. We are the undisputed leadership on the flu market both on the mature market but also in the emerging market. In the U.S., as you know, the business activity has been a little bit late in a sense that it came at the end of Q4 and beginning of this year. And we have continued to ship, even although for small quantities, in January.</p>
          <p>Overall, in terms of number, those &#x2013; you see the flu campaign 2012/2013 is very similar to the flu campaign in 2011/2012. We continue and we are very happy to report that our differentiation strategy works in terms of average selling price. Our average selling price has increased, and in an environment that is extremely competitive on the regular doses  and of course with our differentiation strategy we are happy to show that on our Fluzone High Dose, that is for the elderly and also our Fluzone ID we are able to get value upgrade.</p>
          <p>Looking to the future, we will be launching mid this year our Fluzone Quadrivalent, which is also important for our differentiation strategy. Fluzone Quadrivalent is under review of the FDA, and action date is June 10.</p>
          <p>Looking to the emerging countries, we are happy to report that despite our very high market share in Latin America, for example, where we have a market share above 75% and also very strong market share in other parts of the emerging countries, we are happy to report that we continued to grow 5.1%. And we see significant progress in terms of flu immunization in countries like Brazil and Mexico.</p>
          <p>Looking to our growth, so Sanofi Pasteur has delivered growth in mature and in emerging markets, despite supply constraints. In the mature markets we are very proud about our performance of Menactra. We continue to hold a significant market share; and we are close to 80%. And our sales growth by IC recommendation for booster dose for adolescents between 16 and 18 years of age.</p>
          <p>With regard to Japan, Japan was the country where we had almost no sales back two years ago, and I'm very happy to report that we had the most successful launch of a pediatric vaccine with Imovax on the Japanese market. It's not a one-off. Now IPV is a routine &#x2013; part of routine immunization, and we will continue to grow our business, especially with the new combination that we will be launching.</p>
          <p>I'm happy to say also that despite the supply limitations that we faced in 2012, we are getting back on track and we will get back on track on Pentacel end of Q1 beginning of Q2. And on Theracys where we had to renovate the facility, and we are expecting to get back to production in September this year and to be back on the market at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We are very happy with the momentum of our service provider platform, VaxServe, that allows us to leverage our portfolio and to be very close to our customers, both retail and of course primary care coming in our network.</p>
          <p>Looking to the performance of our emerging markets, 9.1%. Our franchise &#x2013; pediatric franchise, is very much driving this good performance. We are very happy with our performance in China with the launch of Pentacel. Again, it's the best launch ever in the Class 2 market, the private market, and we continue to benefit from the launch of Pentacel as well in Mexico. And we launched a couple of months ago the IPV on the public market in Brazil, and things are moving very, very smoothly.</p>
          <p>Also, good performance of Menactra not only in the U.S. but also in the emerging market. We continue our rollout &#x2013; today the product is licensed in 37 countries &#x2013; and we continue, and the product will be approved in a couple of years in almost 100 countries. So very strong growth of Menactra driven this year by Chile, but also Saudi Arabia.</p>
          <p>2013 will be an important year for our combination vaccine, Hexaxim that will be launched in some international markets. We got the license in two countries of Latin America at the end of 2012 and this will represent a significant opportunity throughout 2013 and 2014, onwards.</p>
          <p>So overall for Sanofi Pasteur a strong fourth quarter. Very solid underlying performance and it's despite the supply limitations we faced. And of course significant growth driven by the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>So I'm now going to hand over to Chris in his capacity of Chairman of Genzyme.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. A number of these points I've mentioned earlier, so I'll go quickly. But as you can see, a very strong performance of all of the products within the Rare Disease portfolio. Clearly the United States with no competitor for Fabrazyme was a significant opportunity for the company, taking advantage of now the increased competition, I think it's very good though to see a strong performance of Cerezyme where the competitive situation is different. And this is where I think you start to see the importance of the Genzyme business model, the real proximity to the patient.</p>
          <p>Now we've had good news on both Phase III studies on eliglustat, then I think eliglustat becomes another element to add to really allow Genzyme to regain leadership in the Gaucher market. Then of course Myozyme growing also at double-digits. So I think in addition to the financial success, what I can tell you that within the &#x2013; around the corridors of Genzyme being able to fully supply the market has had a huge morale boost and I think has been a factor that has allowed us to really successfully have Genzyme come into the Sanofi family.</p>
          <p>Now the other was a trickier proposition. We put Multiple Sclerosis into Genzyme, no real experience in Multiple Sclerosis. We actually had to build a team from scratch, which we have done. It was actually a very significant investment and it's fair to say that Aubagio did not have a very significant awareness level coming into this. However I think when we started seeing the first data, we were encouraged by the launch. Personally I like to see a little bit more than a couple weeks of data to get excited, but you know, here we have four months of data and what you can see is clearly that the Aubagio launch is tracking at least as well if not slightly better than the Gilenya launch.</p>
          <p>80% of MS specialists now have prescribed Aubagio. One in five patients were treatment-na&#xEF;ve and then obviously the rest were switches, mostly from Copaxone and Avonex. Doing some of the initial market research, one of the key reasons is actually tolerability of treatment. So I think this augers well because this also says that we have a team that should be in good position to launch Lemtrada. It is a, obviously, a huge opportunity that we have to be able to put two significant new medicines into an important area like MS. This is a market of some $14 billion worldwide.</p>
          <p>So with that, now to talk about the future in research and development, Dr. Elias Zerhouni.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Chris. I think as you've heard through the presentation 2012 has been an extraordinarily busy year for R&amp;D. It's probably one of the busiest years the company has known. I think it's the result of a very driven strategy starting in 2009 when we focused on first reinforcing the late-stage portfolio, second transforming R&amp;D and third, reinventing the model for R&amp;D over time. I think what you've seen the past year is nine approvals, six registrations, and what I would like to talk to you about is what is it that we are currently executing on and what is it that we intend to do over time.</p>
          <p>First and foremost, we thought it was very important to have a focused portfolio. And therefore we pruned the portfolio. Currently we have about 64 new molecular entities in development, but the key to the progress was to focus in areas where we knew we had already great investments in platforms that were destined to grow, like vaccines, like diabetes. In addition, we thought it was very important to build new therapeutic areas in areas of strength that we have, for example immunology and inflammation, with multiple sclerosis, with anti IL-6, IL-4 monoclonal antibodies. We knew clearly that we had to maintain our competitive position in oncology.</p>
          <p>So what you will see today is a portfolio that essentially aligns to the seven strategic areas that we decided to focus on over the period 2012, 2015, and trying to execute along those specific lines. So in Multiple Sclerosis, you heard about Aubagio. I'm going to tell you about Lemtrada. In Diabetes, you heard about Lyxumia. I'm going to tell you about the new glargine. In Oncology, we have a JAK2 inhibitor that I will tell you about. Eliglustat in Rare Diseases. Cardiometabolic is an area of legacy for the company, and we're trying to reinforce that franchise with PCSK9, the monoclonal antibody, and otamixaban. And then Immunology's an emerging area, where we think we have actually strength because of our experience in vaccines, our experience in protein engineering and our rising experience in antibodies through our partnerships with Regeneron and others. And so Immunology, or Immunomodulation, is emerging as a strong theme of our portfolio. And obviously Vaccines.</p>
          <p>I will also note that out of that portfolio, nine out of the molecules that are coming are biologics, three are small molecules, again illustrating the various strategic intent of equilibrating the R&amp;D portfolio to have a diversity that allows sustainability over time.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me go to Lemtrada. I think it's probably one of the new medications that is going to truly change, in my opinion, the management of Multiple Sclerosis patients. As you know, there are effective drugs out there and the demand of the patient population now is towards quality of life and improvement in the tolerability of the treatment that they're receiving. You heard about Aubagio and its launch, and Lemtrada, we filed in Europe and we filed in the U.S. We just heard that the file was accepted by the FDA. And if you look at Lemtrada, the reason we think it's an important component of the armamentarium in Multiple Sclerosis, is that it does reduce significantly relapse rates against comparators, not against just placebo. And it also significantly slows the accumulation of disability over six month.</p>
          <p>It's a completely different mode of administration with injections at one year apart. So it's almost like a vaccine in many ways. The patients do not have to come back every week or every two weeks to get injected. And therefore it's a really manageable drug from the standpoint of the physicians. It's manageable also in terms of its safety profile. Some infusion reactions, a little higher infections, but &#x2013; autoimmune events are the ones that have been mentioned &#x2013; but all of them can be detected and managed conventionally. And the &#x2013; so we have great hopes here. We will hear about the regulatory decisions in the course of 2013.</p>
          <p>Again, I think that R&amp;D has to also support existing platforms. In Diabetes what we're trying to do with the R&amp;D strategy is to support an integrated solution set for the patients with Diabetes, from oral to GLP-1, to insulins of all different kinds so that we can in fact provide this comprehensive solution.</p>
          <p>In terms of Lantus and glargine, we discovered that a new formulation of Lantus called U300 actually didn't &#x2013; wasn't just more concentrated but it provided us with a PK/PD profile that was much flatter than the original Lantus. So we decided to launch a development in the new glargine formulation with two Phase III Trials, first in patients who have &#x2013; high insulin dose users. In this trial, a result is expected in the second quarter. Also patients who have Type 2 Diabetes plus oral therapies. And we started a second set of four Phase III trials in the second half of 2012, insulin na&#xEF;ve, basal and also Japan we started the studies there, because we do believe that that offering is going to be necessary. As Hanspeter mentioned, 30% of patients are not at goal in basal therapies; we need to really improve the ability for the treatment protocols that we offer to reach a greater level of compliance with HVA1C levels that are expected to reduce the number of complications later in life.</p>
          <p>So JAK2, the JAK2 inhibitor is also novel in the sense that it's a very selective JAK2 inhibitor. It has extremely promising Phase II response rates in patients with myelofibrosis. As you see on the right-hand side, there's a dose response with over 60% reduction in one of the primary parameter that we see in the spleen volume. And the percent of patients with that sort of reduction is quite large: 35% reduction in 60% of patients is what I meant. And so we are in Phase III, two doses, 400 and 500, the enrolment's completed and we're expecting the headline results in the second quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>And we have two Phase IIs ongoing in related conditions called Polycythemia vera and also myelofibrosis patients who were previously treated and failed therapy with ruxolitinib. So it's important to see that the &#x2013; the strategy, if you will, is to continue to be strong in what we call liquid cancers, the leukemias, the hematologic malignancies as well as continuing to build our portfolio in solid tumors, especially in prostate.</p>
          <p>When you look at the eliglustat it is an example of Genzyme research at its best. Cerezyme is obviously a very effective therapy, but when you really look at the new way of performing R&amp;D, the approach is to look at a systems biology approach, and in this particular case &#x2013; looking not just at the missing enzyme, but looking at the enzyme upstream and downstream of the process. And in this particular case a novel, very potent substrate inhibitor, meaning that it really acts on the enzyme above the defective enzyme and reduces the amount of ceramide that is produced in Gaucher's Disease. And than oral therapy eliminates challenges of infusions. We've had positive results against placebo in the first pivotal Phase III trial engage and we have just received the ENCORE Phase III study which is a comparative study between eliglustat and Cerezyme with &#x2013; and we met the primary efficacy end points. I cannot tell you more because the data is being analyzed and will be published soon at a scientific meeting with a significant and comparable change in spleen volume in those patients.</p>
          <p>In addition, as I said, we're trying to reinforce our presence in the Cardiometabolic area. And we try to do this by selecting programs within our research that would fit with our historical legacy in Plavix and other areas of cardiovascular care, Aprovel, where we have quite a bit of experience. And this is why we chose PCSK9 as one of the topic of our collaboration with Regeneron in 2009 and accelerated its development. We're now, as you know, in Phase III as a first-in-class fully human antibody targeting PCSK9, a novel mechanism that was discovered through genetics research where in fact we showed that loss of function of this particular enzyme actually created a reduction in the risk of coronary disease and then a huge reduction in low density cholesterol, which is the main risk factor.</p>
          <p>So you're seeing here, for example, the effect of the dose response. And you can see a flattening of the curve with minus 40% to minus 70% reduction in the level, sustained over a period of time with injections every two weeks at different doses. So when you really look at the impact of this, you have to ask yourself, where is the place of such a therapy in a field where statins have been quite effective? The target populations, when you really think about it, it's about 21 million patients globally. What is it composed of? First, the patients who are familially very susceptible to hypercholesterolemia because of genetic differences. The second are the significant number of patients who cannot tolerate statins, who have complications from statins, muscular or others. And those two populations make about 3 million, 4 million patients.</p>
          <p>The big population that we are targeting in our Phase III trials is the population of secondary prevention. The patient who was treated, who has been followed and who comes to the hospital with an acute coronary event. That patient is known epidemiologically to be at a very high risk of recurrence of the event and death. So these patients in secondary prevention make up almost the bulk of these patients, with 12 million, 13 million patients entering into that category.</p>
          <p>And then we know that we have patients at high risk because of diabetes for example, or underlying conditions, and those would be the primary prevention target.</p>
          <p>When we look at our strategy, ODYSSEY is the name of the large Phase III programs that we have launched that will be 22,000 patients and those involved in these particular categories, this target category that I just defined for you, and we are going to go after that in a sequential fashion. So we've already enrolled our monotherapy trial, for example we'll read out during this year. And we're going to expand into our ability to understand the impact of this approach in terms of benefit in the patients with acute coronary syndromes.</p>
          <p>So this is an important pillar of our strategy. The second pillar, that is real, that is here and now, that you can evaluate is otamixaban. Now otamixaban responds to a need which has been identified for years. And the need is the following: how do you know how to manage a patient who comes to the hospital, who's been in the ambulance, who's come to the emergency room, has come to the interventional with an acute coronary event, and how do you manage that patient? The problem is the ambulance may have injected a drug, heparin for example, and the bleeding times have changed, and then you come in and you don't know when to stop, when to start.</p>
          <p>And so we know that there is a huge demand for a very predictable IV therapy that has a very fast onset of action and a very fast fallout of the actual decrease of the action, so that this is the onset/offset strategy that physicians have been asking. And so we believe that otamixaban, because of the strong Phase II results that showed not only improved control but a direct reduction in the complications including death and myocardial infarction, very hard end points, we thought it was very important to develop this product, so we accelerated its development. It's now in Phase III study with results expected in the second quarter of 2013. Our hope is that this will become a new standard of care from the ambulance to the emergency room to the intervention suite to the operating room. And so this is why we pursued the selected &#x2013; this particular molecule for accelerated development.</p>
          <p>Another area of franchise that we want to develop is Immunomodulation. Again, we are not doing this alone; as we said, we want to enter the field of biotechnology, the new biologics. We've done this with a lot of discipline. And I think that's what we are starting to see here with the anti IL-6 receptor molecule antibody. And the reason again is that we know today that the response to existing therapies cannot be one size fits all, it's not going to be homogenous across all patients. In every intervention we do realize that there are patients who react better to a certain type of therapy, who do not respond. In this particular case about a one-third of patients do not respond to current therapies.</p>
          <p>We also knew that IL-6 had significant advantages as a sort of core molecule in the inflammatory response, and that's why we decided to continue its development with two pivotal Phase III trials: the MOBILITY trial, which is fully enrolled; the TARGET trial, which is recruiting as we speak; and new studies to start in the first half of 2013 with very significant results observed. And already we can tell that this is a molecule that could position itself earlier in the treatment cycle of these patients because of the response rates that we're seeing and the type of response and the sustainability of the response.</p>
          <p>Another molecule we have great hopes for because of strong positive proof of concept data is the IL-4 receptor alpha monoclonal antibody. From the scientific standpoint, this is a very interesting way of approaching multiple targets at once. If you really look at the molecular structure of the IL-4 receptor, if you allow me here, the IL-4 receptor has two components. It's what we call the alpha components and the beta components. The alpha component is actually also common in the IL-13 receptor. So think of two receptors having one half of the &#x2013; part of the receptors being common between the two. So the idea here was to develop a monoclonal antibody that would be against this common part of IL-13 and IL-4. And therefore with one agent we're hitting two targets.</p>
          <p>And because we do this we are really able to see effects, which will be presented at medial conferences soon, with very significant proof of concept data in asthma and atopic dermatitis which give us the courage to go forward faster; as Chris said, if you know the mode of action, you have a demonstrated measurable effect in human populations, that's when you should invest at risk but because you know that you have de-risked molecule in this particular stage. So the Phase II re-initiation will be &#x2013; is expected at midyear.</p>
          <p>Clearly Vaccines is a major growth platform; we focus a lot of effort, we support the Vaccine development very aggressively across global R&amp;D. We found ways to work across the different divisions to enhance our ability to do this. The best example obviously is Dengue vaccine, which was truly an innovative vaccine launch because of the major demand worldwide, due to the growth of Dengue around the world. And the expansion of the geographic zone of Dengue from the sort of tropical region now to the south and north even reaching for example Florida. We have now cases of Dengue in Boston from patients who traveled from Florida to Boston and it does affect 220 million people with 2 million cases of hemorrhagic fevers and about 20,000 deaths per year, so it's a large public health demand.</p>
          <p>The Dengue vaccine was quite an original vaccine from the molecular standpoint. It was a chimeric virus and we're reading the Phase II re-results this year where we found it was safe. One of the big questions we also have in Dengue vaccines is whether or not a vaccine is actually going to provoke a very hemorrhagic second infection, because as you know in Dengue the first infection is usually well tolerated; it's the second one that really hurts the patient.</p>
          <p>So when we did this we were happy to see that it was safe and well tolerated. It was effective against three of the four serotypes in Thailand; it's not effective against the second serotype in Thailand. Our Phase III trials have been started and ongoing &#x2013; we'll read out in 2014 &#x2013; both in Latin America and Asia, so it will allow us to understand what is the circulation of these serotypes and how exactly to position the vaccine relative to its markets, and the prevalence of the serotypes is something we need to define.</p>
          <p>And this year we're going to enter Phase III with the C difficile toxoid vaccine. In C difficile it's not the organism that hurts the patient it's the toxins produced by the organism and therefore we're trying to develop a vaccine against the toxins, which we have been able to do with good Phase II rated results with very broad protection. So we're going to start a multi-national Phase III trial in the third quarter of 2013 with Olivier Charmeil's team in Sanofi Pasteur, and we're going to target patients at high risk. This infection is growing not only in the hospital environment, but also in the community environment, and so we do believe that the need is going to grow over time.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I think you know from in the presentation we have 18 projects in launch phases, hopefully within the next three years. You have the list here, as I went through those, that are still in the works and Hanspeter covered the ones that are already approved. We will continue to change R&amp;D and to really reinvent it. We do believe that the models of the past have to be different. The operating model has to be different. We cannot do this without, either, a new philosophy, new people and a new strategy.</p>
          <p>So we've been recruiting extensively great talent to the company. This year we recruited eight top scientists to come and really change the way we do science by bringing translational research very closely to the process at the bench within our company, and using open innovation. In other words, the idea that we can access the best new ideas because they are not necessarily all within ourselves, and make sure that our internal research team, like the team here, can work with the external team in a very, very collaborative fashion. This is what Gary Nabel, the new Chief Scientific Officer, is going to help us. He's a world-class researcher, led vaccine research for years at the NIH. Andrew Plump, he's our new research &#x2013; Deputy for Research and Translational Medicine; and many others. In the past two years, 20 of the 27 leaders of R&amp;D at Sanofi have been newly appointed.</p>
          <p>So we are really going through this reinvention of the model and focusing on a very disciplined strategy. You heard that we have one of the most active portfolio but yet we have established cost discipline, we've stayed within our budgets by extensive reorganizations, by creating synergies, by improving the R&amp;D cost structures.</p>
          <p>But from the strategy standpoint, we've also changed our medical strategy. We just don't believe that me-toos are going to be effective and so we are focusing on very high value projects and focusing on the selection, the quality and the execution of these projects by guiding a very rigorous prioritization of what we do or what we do not do, which is sometimes more important in driving these &#x2013; this model of innovation, and again enhance the value of external opportunities, have no pride of ownership. It's okay if it's not invented here, we will go wherever the best invention here and make it work for Sanofi.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'll turn it back over to Chris who's going to conclude.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. We'll close here. I think you've seen the strategy. Essentially an integrated healthcare leader, we have increasingly got a pipeline and we're bringing those products to market. We will continue to have an acquisition strategy, but I can tell you that it's getting tougher and tougher to find good value items out there. And of course we need to continue to adapt to our future. So with respect to guidance what's in the background of the guidance? Well, you already know that we have &#x20AC;800 million of overhang from Plavix coming into this year.</p>
          <p>But essentially when I look at the business, it is going to continue to perform as it has been. Growth platforms will continue to be strong, and I don't see any change, any disruption in the business. We are &#x2013; have an awful lot of launches this year. We've suddenly seen things like the IL-6, the IL-4, the C difficile vaccine come into our program. That's all very exciting for the future, and we clearly want to support that so we are going to reinvest &#x20AC;500 million of our savings this year into the future of the company.</p>
          <p>We don't want to get into underlying growth rates, but essentially if you look at this guidance and said, all right, let's take out Plavix of &#x20AC;800 million, the underlying business is growing at 5% to 10% on the bottom line, and I think that just demonstrates the confidence we have in the underlying business that's going on. So taking all that into account, our 2013 business EPS is expected to be flat to 5% lower at constant exchange rates, always barring major unforeseen adverse events.</p>
          <p>So the longer-term guidance, everything we still see is completely aligned with that. We do increase our operating margin in our plans. We've got EPS there for growing on a leveraged basis, and we still intend to obviously have our dividend payout ratio, achieve the target of 50% in 2013.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to invite my colleagues up onto the stage here and we'll be happy to take any questions obviously through webcast or through here in the live audience. So come on up, folks.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Phillipe Lanon from <mark type="inaudible" />. Three questions if I may. First one, can you make a comment on LOVENOX in Europe, which is quite a big drug still for you? And we have new proposed guidelines that while they again restate that there is a lot of hurdle, does not close anymore the door to susceptible generic?</p>
          <p>Number two question for J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me, maybe on R&amp;D. If we extrapolate the trends in Q4, you have a number of drugs in Phase III now, how confident are you that you can stay within the &#x20AC;5 billion threshold? If we extrapolate the Q4 trends that needs a lot of restructuring.</p>
          <p>One question maybe more general on -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Enough Phillipe, maybe that's the last one. We'll try to limit questions to one or two at a time, so that we can get as many people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, you are absolutely right. There is a guidelines for biosimilars in Europe out which touches LOVENOX. We have been consulted in this process. We are overall, I would not say satisfied, but nearly satisfied with the outcome. The outcome is rigid, it's stringent. As far as the definition of those products is concerned, we believe that it will not be easy for everyone to overcome those hurdles. Clinical trials are needed, but they can be waived, but it will not be easy to waive them. So overall, we believe those guidelines are okay, and they are okay because they are safe for the patients.</p>
          <p>Independently, and I have said so over the years, I don't believe that the European market will be extremely sensitive to generics for LOVENOX. The European market for the last 20 years has seen a multitude of low molecular weight heparins, so the market situation is not at all comparable to the U.S. market. And let's not overlook that even in the U.S. market, the penetration of generics has been relatively slow, very slow in special side of the hospital market where LOVENOX, even today, controls about 50% in terms of volume.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Phillipe, I will give you a financial answer. So if you look at the fourth quarter 2011, where we had a ratio of 15.2% to sales in terms of R&amp;D expense, you have told me, I mean how on earth can you get to 14%? And we did. So in other terms, I mean this will be a combination of further full impact of the optimization, which has been put in place in 2012. And of course there are things which are increasing, such as PCSK9, but then those are only &#x2013; if I look at the overall Phase III expenses for Dengue as compared to the previous <mark type="inaudible" /> so the cost will be somewhat lower. So there are things that goes up and down and you know I can just confirm what I said, that we will stay within the &#x20AC;5 billion envelope.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Somanier from Exane BNP Paribas. I have two questions please. The first one is on your guidance for the long-term, and especially in emerging markets in the current context of 8% growth at constant exchange rate in 2012 and also in the current context of let's say uncertainties in a lot of countries everywhere, is it fair to continue to assume a double-digit growth in that part of the world, even if, as you say, this is the single largest opportunity for the pharma industry, but maybe high-single-digit is better than double-digit?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the biosimilars of insulins you are launching. So you're talking about two Phase I projects. Can we have more details on that? Are you talking about human or analog incidents, long-acting, short-acting? Maybe a biosimilar of nouveau-rapid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I &#x2013; Hanspeter can talk also more about the emerging markets. Look I think we are barely scratching the surface yet on really achieving penetration into these markets. People get a little concerned about seeing maybe the Chinese economy slowing down, but it actually doesn't have an impact on the creation of middle classes. We grew double-digits in our key areas last year, as I say, you can count Eastern Europe in or out. I actually think over time Eastern Europe will come back because it is clearly under-investing. These are much more &#x2013; there's 80 countries in the emerging markets, you've got multiple layers of wholesalers and it's never going to be as smooth as what you all have been used to in seeing in Europe and the U.S. But from a potential point of view and given our product profile, I'm not prepared to cede on our target on that yet.</p>
          <p>In terms of the biosimilars, we don't really want to say an awful lot because of competitive reasons. They are not biosimilars of our own molecules, obviously, since we've had that question come up, so you can pretty much figure out what they might be. You want to add anything on emerging markets?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jo Walton from Credit Suisse. A couple of questions, please. 18 months ago or so when you were talking about your long-term guidance, there was a view that 2012 would be the trough year. It doesn't seem that that's the case now. Would it be fair to say that Genzyme has perhaps done better in 2012 than you had originally expected so you haven't go the incremental benefit to come through in 2013 to offset what was always clearly going to be the second half of Plavix and Avapro? And if you could just tell us a little bit more about why 2013 isn't going to be the sort of start of your growth period? Because that's what you were originally hoping for.</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you also talk a bit about what you're going to do with the cash going forwards? A lot of companies tell us that they just can't make big acquisitions because they don't have any particular advantage and they're just massive bidding wars; they just can't make the sums add up. But clearly investors are very worried about one or other of the big few companies going for a deal. So I wonder if you can just tell us where you think you can best spend your money going forwards?</p>
          <p>And finally a very quick R&amp;D related question. Now that we have a Quadrivalent flu vaccines, do you think the relevant authorities are going to mandate four different strains to put into those vaccines so that the three of you who have the four-strains this year will actually gain market share? Because at least one of the major suppliers hasn't got a four-strain vaccine? And is it going to slow down the manufacturing? I always understand that the issue is that you've got to make all four strains and put them together. So if you're making four strains rather than three, perhaps it just slows things down? So perhaps you could tell us what the real advantage of four strains in a vaccine will be?</p>

          <p>2012 trough year, 18 months ago. You know first a guidance of flat to down minus 5% doesn't actually preclude 2012 from being a trough year, so let's have a look at the end of 2013 as to where we get to. Second is, in my experience the worst thing you have is when you've got a flat anywhere in your guidance, because it only requires a little bit of here and there of things like tax rates, of a slight shift in 2012 to 2013 of Plavix, that starts to make some of those things that you said 18 months ago a little less precise. If I look above the operating profit line, I don't see anything that's changed. And when &#x2013; so I say you tale out that &#x20AC;800 million if you want to get into the underlying growth story. I mean you could see that that business growing at 5% to 10%. So we have continued confidence in the underlying fundamentals of the business. Now the tax rate was unexpectedly lower last year, and we did have a settlement with BMS on Plavix, and that shifted a little bit. But as I say, the guidance doesn't exclude 2012 from being a trough year.</p>
          <p>But fundamentally as I look at the business, and I'm not really looking at it any differently than I did 18 months ago, with the exception that actually we have a whole lot more in R&amp;D. 18 months ago, IL-4 was not on my radar screen, the C difficile was not our radar screen, the ability to actually move as quickly we did on PCSK9 into Phase III, I mean remember we only opted into this with Regeneron in March of 2009 and here we are three years later in a major Phase III program. So &#x2013; but, actually those are good news items and a lot more robust than I could have even hoped for.</p>
          <p>So what to do with the cash? You know first is we're generating, just to make round numbers, roughly around &#x20AC;10 billion in cash. You've got around &#x20AC;3.5 billion possibly going to up to &#x20AC;4 billion going into the dividend by the time we get to the 50% payout, I think it's about &#x20AC;1.5 billion goes to capital expenditure to keep the company operating and keep quality in our factories. I think it's pretty easy to say we'll continue to do &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;2 billion in bolt-on transactions and our objective is to have over time roughly &#x20AC;10 billion in net debt. Now we're already below the &#x20AC;10 billion at the end of this year, and so we're either going to have to find transactions that can add value, and I've consistently said my preferences to continue to invest in the business.</p>
          <p>Equally, I would say that if you look at our track record over the last four years the acquisitions that we have done have generated value. I would agree with you that it is becoming increasingly difficult. When we did Genzyme it was a unique opportunity, but unfortunately the biotech index has risen 82% since we did Genzyme. So there's not too many more Genzymes out there.</p>
          <p>We do find value in non-BRIC emerging countries. The BRICs have become much more competitive, but we're one of the few companies that's present in non-BRIC. But you can't spend that much money; I can't go spend &#x20AC;10 billion even if I want to in non-BRIC.</p>
          <p>So I think it's a question that you're going to look at over the course of the year. How do you use your capital is a strategic question that you explore with the Board, but we're not about to go anything that doesn't drive value. Remember half of our equity compensation is based on a return on investment metric and that pretty much precludes you from doing what some of our colleagues have done in the industry.</p>
          <p>So, you know, our job is not to accumulate cash, our job is to invest in the business, but it's our job to invest in the business that benefits Sanofi shareholders not someone else's shareholders and I think you can also judge us on the deals that we haven't done even over the last year. With that I'll turn it to Olivier on the Quadrivalent vaccine.</p>

          <p>So predicting the right strength is always a very difficult exercise. And it starts in February and we have seen years where at the end of the season the strain that's circulated and has changed. So it's a little bit premature to say what ICs recommendation are going to be. What we could say is that in the last couple of years is there has been some mismatch, especially for strain B. So to have two strain B will offer a better protection.</p>
          <p>In terms of manufacturing, it's not going to have a significant impact. The way we view the impact in terms of manufacturing is more of the fact that of course it will be &#x2013; put pressure on capacity. Which means at the end of the day, because to manufacture four-strain of course you need to have an installed capacity that is a little bit larger that for three-strain. Which means that we are expecting less price pressure for the whole market, in a Quadrivalent market than a Trivalent market.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Michael Oystren from Barclays. If I could just go back to the emerging markets. The slowdown really seems to be in the rump EM [Emerging Markets] business, which is not your growth platforms. And if I look at it full year, that business was broadly flat and then down 3% in Q4. Can you help me understand how much of that is structural as to temporary? I.e., how much of that was just some sort of price pressure in 2012 that may annualize in 2013 [inaudible] how much of that is really structural?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, overall, we have seen in the marketplace in the demand and acceleration in the fourth quarter, if I take the example of China IMS, which has to be handled with very much of care, because it's only selected for the market, but nevertheless has seen a strong rebound in the last two or three months of the year, so I'm talking about demand. What we have seen and what has weakened our performance in emerging markets in the last quarter from a structural point of view was OTC consumer healthcare. We have faced difficulties in China and in Brazil: in Brazil for Medley and in China, mainly for one of the brands, which is a multivitamin brand.</p>
          <p>The reasons for the slowdown in the fourth quarter were quite different from market to market. You could say in both markets we had channel issues, but then intrinsically of very different origin. We had a problem in Brazil which is specific for one chain of pharmacy chain, which is accelerated by a local problem with VAT; there was a significant change in VAT in the state of S&#xE3;o Paulo, which unfortunately is the major market for Medley so far.</p>
          <p>So we have to act to it in a structural way, which means we have to dislocate our resources and get to markets where this VAT problem &#x2013; is just a problem for the consumer, for the customer, not for us &#x2013; does not exist. In China we have a situation where second and third tier distributors have severe financial problems. They have lost most of their margin and so the distribution system to some extent collapsed, which we also have to address from a structural point of view, which means we are today in a reselection of our customers. We work with different customers; respectively we will drastically reduce the number of partners.</p>
          <p>All of this should lead to a reacceleration of our performance in CHC during the second half of 2013. Beyond I see no structural change. I fully underline what Chris said before in emerging markets, that this trend will continue. Some of the markets will replace others. If I look to markets like Indonesia or Vietnam, they are just at the beginning of their real growth period.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think your question was around the growth in the non-growth platforms, so just to complement what Hanspeter said there was a withdrawal of a product in Mexico, for example, which is a one-off. And in these price reductions in China the Oncology piece, which is not included in the growth markets, there was an impact on Taxotere and Eloxatin. So the Taxotere and Eloxatin clearly carries forward in China, but the withdrawal of the products is essentially a one-off. But I think fundamentally there's no real difference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Two questions, please. Just thinking about the cost savings that won't be realized in 2013, so 2014 and 2015, presumably with the pipeline coming through and new launches, that &#x2013; those will be reinvested as well? And then just thinking about that underlying growth of 5% to 10%, what do you need from sort of M&amp;A to come through, pipeline to come through to maintain the growth at that sort of level, or even accelerate it from the bottom line?</p>
          <p>And then just one question on Diabetes, just thinking about Lyxumia as it comes to the market, have you managed to gain any insight into the cardiovascular profile of Lyxumia from the data you've submitted from ELIXA to the FDA? Clearly the confidence interval should be relatively below 1.8%, how should we think about that maybe impacting the launch of Lyxumia and the sales of that? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me, maybe you could take the cost savings question, and Elias the Lyxumia question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so you're right, Richard, that as we said, we are going to reinvest a large part of our cost savings in 2013. Well, it doesn't mean that we will do exactly the same in the coming year, as there is a sort of bullish effect in 2013. If you think about all the launches, which we all know, which are just starting or are being prepared for, like Lemtrada, and we have a sort of seasonal effect then. Today we are clearly investing more than we will generate in sales in 2013, which by the way, one of the reasons why you need to keep a particular range in terms of guidance, because you don't know exactly when will be the exact timing and what will be the pick-up of let's say Lyxumia in Germany or whatever. So there is a certain degree of uncertainty.</p>
          <p>But as long as you go into the next year, hopefully we will get more sales, why we have no reason to build up another sales team for instance for Aubagio. So leverage effect will ultimately come from these launches in 2014. So we don't really consider that. Yes, we're going to continue to generate savings in the next years. This will be firstly on the industrial side, because as we know each measure you take on industrial takes a bit of time to be implemented and to be visible into the P&amp;L, also because it goes first into the inventory before going into the P&amp;L. But second, there is a leverage effect, which will come over time just as a result of increasing sales from the new launches, which means that &#x2013; I mean the success of these launches is by far the most important thing when it comes to the evolution of profitability of &#x2013; or let's say the thing of attention when it comes to the evolution of our performance in the two years to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And of course sales of new products are notoriously difficult to forecast. I think it's fair to say in 2013 launch costs exceed the sales of those same products by about a two-to-one ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the cardiovascular risk for Lyxumia, as you know in the EU we could file. In the U.S. the FDA requested to have the ELIXIA study recruited significantly to be able to file. So we filed in December, and they have to do an independent study, which is blinded to us, of the risk ratio, and then determine acceptance of the file or not, which we're expecting in the first quarter, as Hanspeter described. So I &#x2013; this is an independent study that has to be done on an interim basis by the third party.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just, because you'd also &#x2013; part of your question was whether we'd need to do an M&amp;A to make the 5%? And the answer is I don't think we have to do anything. If you go back to 2012 we got a &#x20AC;23.5 billion business called the growth platforms that grew at 10%. I mean if you've got that size business growing at double-digits that's quite a momentum that you've got going, and it really, when you look at our sales forecasts, actually nothing really has to happen in terms of sales growth. The main reason that sales go up is not because the growth platforms are growing any faster, it's just that every year we have less dilutive effect of the stuff that's come off patent. So in some ways just waiting actually causes the sales to go up. We don't have to buy anything, we don't have to launch any new products to get there, it's just a mathematical effect of that.</p>
          <p>Now the only wobble factor in there is how much do austerity programs cost us? But we've already baked into our numbers an assumption that the austerity measures have an ongoing impact on our business.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Odion Kees from Olivier Just coming back to the flu vaccine. I mean we know that since 2009 there has been recommendation for universal coverage, but still your flu vaccine has been down 5% in 2012. We know that there is maybe a delay effect that, that could recover in the first quarter. But we have seen that with also competitive companies with flu sales being definitely down. So you guided in 2011 for U.S. flu vaccine to grow by double-digit number going forward. Is this guidance still realizable? Or maybe a bit too bullish?</p>
          <p>And then on eliglustat, I mean it has definitely the advantage of being an oral formulation to overcome the challenge of infusing patient and then that is typically what also arrived in the childhood. So did you actually enroll patient &#x2013; or children in this study? Or do you plan to do so in your two studies, put in some children?</p>
          <p>And finally, I don't know if you can maybe talk about the different shaping factors for your JAK2 inhibitor versus in market JAK2 for example?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over the last two years, in the last two years we have seen very low disease activity on flu. You have seen that especially in the U.S. but also in Europe in the last couple of months the disease activity has increased significantly. So it's obvious that after two years after the panacea with relatively low activity we have not observed a significant increase of the vaccination rate. We have seen, since the beginning of December, this is one of the reasons that we have been able to ship until the last couple of days, a significant increase in terms of vaccination.</p>
          <p>To get back to &#x2013; more precisely, to your question, what we are anticipating and we continue and there is no reason to change the guidelines, what we are anticipating is, as we move forward, we will be able to do better than the market with our differentiated forms. Now we are very happy with our performance with the Fluzone High Dose for the elderly people, that is growing more than 55%. We have invested very significantly on our Flu ID, our small-needle device, for &#x2013; it's a lot more friendlier for the people that are reluctant to get their shot each and every year. And of course we are anticipating to get a price premium when Quadrivalent form will be launched. In the long run, we are also anticipating, and this is an important part of our strategy, when we get the efficacy data for the Fluzone High Dose  we &#x2013; this is going to be an important boost to our Flu franchise in the U.S.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for eliglustat, obviously, when you design the trial, the first trial was designed against placebo. And because of the medical issues of, you know, do you offer the treatment in children? With the established treatment versus a placebo, you obviously cannot. So you limit the exposure of children in the first trial. The second trial, I don't have the exact numbers. As I said, the ENCORE trial just came out. We just have the top-line efficacy end points. I don't know the specifics; it was in that trial so I'll be happy to share them with you as I discover them, as they are analyzed as we speak.</p>
          <p>On the JAK2, the differentiation, as you know it's a more selective JAK2 inhibitor. Our hope is that the very &#x2013; the key factor of differentiation is whether or not you reduce fibrosis. Because myelofibrosis basically the outcome is driven by the growth of fibrosis over time, and if you can stop or reduce that, you will have a significant change in the outcome, we hope. Now in terms of the existing competitor, the target is about the same. The selectivity is the only difference at this point. But this is the &#x2013; the question is fibrosis, and we're looking at that in a different way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Barry <mark type="Inaudible" />, Garnier. Two set of questions. First, to put 2013 in the context of your mid-term guidance. First in revenue, last year revenue was flat and mid-term guidance is above `5%. Where do you see 2013 in this journey? Is it fair to assume a progressive trend, somewhere in between? Or is it already achievable to think about 5% and to see how much that leaves for 2014 and 2015?</p>
          <p>Second on core EPS, same kind of questions. Mid-term is above the 5%. This year is between 0% and minus 5%, which suggests double-digit for the next couple of years to reach at least 6%. Is it granted? Or under which conditions do you think double-digit will be achievable in terms of  extended growth, share buybacks or whatsoever?</p>
          <p>And the second question relates to GLP-1. Should weekly GLP-1 become standard in monotherapy with ceemaglatide, Demaglatide, albiglutide on top of biurial? How do you plan to address this point with the existing agreement with Zedent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me, you want to take that one? The mid-term guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah on the mid-term guidance, so I'll try to do some math with you Eric, so we start from 2012. In 2012, you're right, I mean we have been basically flat on the constant &#x2013; slightly increasing on the constant exchange rate basis. Now if I look at 2013, while we're still going to lose &#x2013; well, you can do a calculation by yourself. So while &#x20AC;1.2 billion to &#x20AC;1.3 billion of sales from these key products, which have got to nice size in 2012 and this is mainly on first year Eloxatin. And of course we'll have to beat that by growth platforms and then by how much, I mean it's a bit early to say. The only thing I can say is that there are all reasons to consider that these growth platforms should grow at the same pace as last year, plus the launches we discussed before; we had basically no new launch contribution last year, we just had &#x20AC;7 million of sales booked for Aubagio, so we need to think about that. I mean, you say there is some addition which could come from that.</p>
          <p>Now if I go into 2014 and 2015, obviously the negative element coming from the loss of revenues coming from the genericized product would be much, much lower. So still, as Chris said earlier, the uncertainty remains around the impact of cost containment measures, as an example. We know now, for instance, that in Europe, year-on-year, whatever happens, I mean, it is in the range of &#x20AC;3 million <mark type="inaudible" />. And then, of course, it's a bit hard to predict more in detail, but it just gives you that &#x2013; and still in 2013, and this would be mainly the first half of 2013, so the change in the curve, the inflection point would be really in the second half; because the first half we'll still see from the top line at some point the full impact of Eloxatin and a bit of Taxotere as well as Coaprabib in Europe. And then you will start to see that fading away quarter after quarter.</p>
          <p>On the earning per share, well I mean along with what we said before, we are not counting on acquisitions to meet the guidance. I mean we said already one year ago that we have tried to stress test guidance to a certain number of events, in particular in terms of pricing trend on the evolution in European countries in particular. So far, so good. I mean In other terms, we still feel that we can meet this guidance without any acquisitions on no specific share buyback beyond buying back shares in order to compensate for the dilution arising from exercise of stock options.</p>

        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It looks like you don't have a weekly GLP-1. So how should you address the standard of care moving to weekly GLP-1 if all products in Phase III/regulatory Phase succeed?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically I think there is a panoply of needs that needs to be fulfilled. We do believe that if you have, as we've obtained with Lyxumia, indication Lantus plus Lyxumia being approved, and you have to give the Lantus injection on a daily basis, there's no once-a-week insulin. So I think there's still going to continue to be because of the side effect potentials and so on, a significant demand for daily GLP-1 Lantus, or. In terms of the once-a-week, we're looking at several options there and are not ready to comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think it's also fair to say, let's see if it becomes standard of care. We've seen two already fail. And my experience, when you've got two failures in the class, I wouldn't bet on the third one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Chris, maybe a couple of questions from the U.S. There's one from Steve Scaller at Cowen. Basically he's asking what type of potential do we foresee for Aubagio? Where is the business coming from? What are the main products from where we see switches? And basically have &#x2013; what kind of percentage of the opportunity has already realized? Obviously it's still very early days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When I look at this, what's interesting is &#x2013; you know I spent a fair amount of time with neurologists; this is a conservative prescribing audience. I mean this is the &#x2013; these are the people that went through the Tysabri withdrawal and reintroduction. You're talking about patients who are diagnosed young in their life, often in their mid-30's for example, many women, people who are going to be on medication for many decades. And therefore there's an awful lot of discussion with the patient that goes on. There are questions around safety, there's questions about efficacy, there's a question about convenience.</p>
          <p>And so for me the number one factor is how quickly do physicians become comfortable with the tolerability profile of Aubagio? We know that Aubagio has at least the same efficacy as best-in-class interferon on rebif. So there's no reason why anybody's going to go through injections if they can take an oral therapy once they become comfortable with the safety profile. What is interesting, I think, is the fact that actually this is a metabolite of leflunomide, actually helps us, because the risk of suddenly a side effect coming out as has been seen in others is dramatically reduced because this is a molecule that has a known history.</p>
          <p>And I think the fact that one of the main reasons for switching is tolerability is actually an extremely important sign. A lot of the products are coming from &#x2013; the number two &#x2013; the two main products that we're drawing from are. I look at this tracking Gilenya. That says that actually we're not really taking any product &#x2013; we're not taking any patients from Gilenya. So then the question then in my mind is what happens when BG-12 comes along? We'll have to wait and see what the profile is and there's some speculation around that, but my personal view is when I look at the Aubagio launch is I'd be very worried if I were selling interferon today. Because I think there is a faster acceptance than I might have expected of oral therapy here and that says to me that people are getting comfortable with this.</p>
          <p>So I think what you're going to first of all do is say, I think the oral segment becomes an extremely important segment. You've got a $14 billion market here; you don't need 50% market share to make Aubagio a big product. And I think the fact that it's tracking Gilenya can certainly help on where we think the product could go.</p>
          <p>It's certainly &#x2013; we're extremely satisfied with this, and as I say the number one factor for me is that I think this product is really &#x2013; it's just getting acceptance on the part of the prescribing community in terms of its profile.</p>

          <p>There's a quick question for J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me from Tim Anderson at Sanford Bernstein where Tim is asking how do you see tax evolve with the loss of royalties on Plavix and Avapro? Not just for 2013, but beyond that? The tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so first I just gave what we expect for 2013, which is, I can just repeat it, between 26.5% and 27%. While going forward it's clear that we will still see &#x2013; into the short-term, because in the long-term it may change again, but we'll still see basically a disappearance of the royalties taxable at low taxes currently based on the French tax low. But on the other, on the royalties evolution of the location of our sales and then our profit, is moving to world regions which have an average tax rate which is lower than both the normal French tax rate but also the U.S. tax rate. So if I put all that together and look at what we can do to manage that, we are still heading to an increase, but I aim to have this increase to be by &#x2013; certainly below 30% and probably somewhere between 29% and 30%.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Are there any other questions in the room? Yeah. We can go back to Phillipe. And then I have a couple more also from the web.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One question on R&amp;D again on Diabetes, because some of your competition, Noro-Nordisk is now developing new generation, at least in Phase I, there's the one-<mark type="inaudible" /> injectable and oral insulins. When we look at your Phase I pipeline, there doesn't seem to be any long-term relay or to  launches today? So do you have something looking for the long-term view on Diabetes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I heard your question correctly, you're talking about what is our strategy beyond what we have today, right? And what's coming up? And so when you look at our strategy for Diabetes, there are two sections. One is obviously controlling hyperglycemia, and the better way in the greater percentage of patients is something that you will have to do at integrating care around that need is continuing to be our goals. With existing products or enhancement of existing products, like U300 basically for certain patients, we really cannot be at goal that easily. So we're going to continue that class of work. Second, if you talk about the GLP-1 or all our anti-diabetics, we are definitely entering that. You may not see it in the published portfolio, but it's clearly something that we need to be stronger at, and we are certainly starting that. As you know, we recruited some new heads of research and we are definitely looking into that.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, I do believe that there will be a significant demand for peptides with &#x2013; co-peptides with additional actions that will be of great benefit eventually. This is the direction that we are also taking internally. So I think that the expectation is that, that you're pointing out to, is that pretty soon you're going to see some of the emerging portfolio that currently is not published. But we are definitely working into that sort of multi-pronged approach to diabetes that integrates vertically between all of the components we currently have and then adds what I call the pre-hypoglycemia, the post-hypoglycemia issue that you deal with, including better cell preservation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>There's another question from Graham Parry at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me, about the cost saving plans, you talked about 60% being achieved by the end of 2012. Also about the fact that about one-third of that was reinvested in growth platforms. You announced an additional &#x20AC;500 million for 2013. Graham is asking, by 2015, how much of the &#x20AC;2 billion savings planned could fall to the bottom line basically? So what would be the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that question, the end of the question, is how much at the end of the day are we going to save by 2015? And if adjust <mark type="indiscernible" /> of trend, you could say maybe we are going to save a bit more than the &#x20AC;2 billion. Maybe it's a bit early to really be estimative in that prospect. The second question is how much we're going to reinvest. So I mean, this year while we can pretty clear when it comes to 2013, I mean, depending upon opportunities in terms of which new launches and so on, it's a bit more uncertain the coming year. So there will be a net increase of the cost savings beyond 2013 into 2014, 2015. How much exactly, well, it's a bit early to say, but I can say that while the &#x20AC;2 billion is clearly something we will obviously achieve, and &#x2013; well I'm not really in a position to give a higher number today, but I think obviously it will be on the high side.</p>

          <p>Okay, Jo?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jo Walton, Credit Suisse. I've got two general and one specific question. The specific question first. Your attitude to getting involved with diabetes testing, you've talked about making as broad a possible offering in diabetes, and it was an area that you could go into. I wonder if you could update us on your thoughts there? And two general questions, you've talked about your R&amp;D pipeline and how you've had more success than you might've expected, lower attrition. Do you think that we're going to see that generally across the industry? That the quality of knowledge when you put things into Phase III means that you have a better chance of success at the end? Or is that matched in an opposite direction by the increasing novelty or the pipeline so that investors probably won't see a market difference? Sitting on this side of the fence, we're only seeing about a 60% success industry wide in Phase III, and that just still isn't good enough. So I'm interested in your thoughts there?</p>
          <p>And the other general question is about launch trajectories, and particularly given the different way that you're promoting drugs now. So you point to having half as many sales reps in the U.S. now than you had a few years ago. Well, lots of the industry is like that, and lots of the industry is like that cause they've had almost nothing to launch. So if we are moving back to a period with more launches, are we going to see you're going to need to put more sales reps in the U.S. just generally? And do you think we should be expecting generally slower ramp-ups because of all the extra problems that you have of getting access around the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, in terms of the diabetes testing, and Hanspeter can talk maybe a little bit specifically about the business, but in general the idea that we had behind that is not actually just to go and compete against J&amp;J or Roche or whomever. But our view is that there is a growing tendency, not so much in Europe, but elsewhere around integrated care, where people are actually starting to look at having those who supply care be reimbursed on the basis of outcomes and not simply on the basis of volume uptake. So increasingly people just don't want to buy a pill or pay for a doctor visit or pay for a hospital visit. But there is increasingly some element of what did you actually achieve in terms of outcomes? In diabetes for example how many people actually got to their A1c goal?</p>
          <p>Accountable care, organizations are driving down that path, but you're also seeing some of these being incorporated into some emerging markets. The real, if you're going to get into that, you have to actually understand what's happening to a patient between the touch points of the healthcare system, because the way the healthcare system works today is you go in, you have a prescription, you walk out and then you don't see a physician for maybe three to six months. Well, we all know that outcomes are going to be based on a whole lot of other factors, including whether the prescription ever got filled, whether the person is paying attention to nutrition and activity. And mobile phones are having a dramatic impact. And you're seeing a whole host of characters actually getting into this because this is something that we all have with us. I'm impressed that not too many people are actually looking at their Blackberry even as we speak, but generally most people's Blackberries or iPhone or whatever device it is you carry is not very far away. And suddenly you have an opportunity to communicate with a patient that we've never had before.</p>
          <p>So for us, this diabetes testing was in a sense, getting us prepared for some of this. And you're certainly seeing a lot of moves to marry digital technology with therapeutics. So we've dipped our toe in the water. We've certainly made mistakes in this area and learned what we don't know about software development. But equally, I think what we have learned has provided us with insights as to where this could go. How fast it goes, we'll have to wait and see. But everywhere I go, there are signs that this is actually accelerating. I used to think this was kind of a 2015 and beyond theme. I actually think this will come a lot faster than that. So if you like, there's a strategic element to this and not just a business segment. But you might just want to add on the actual tactical piece here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. On the diabetes piece, I have really nothing to add. We have learned and we continue to learn and I believe that therefore we are a little bit further advanced than others. But I have not the slightest thoughts that this integrated model for diabetes as for other chronic diseases is absolutely to come. And the question is only time and who finds the fastest, the right doors to go into it and learns the lessons we had to learn.</p>
          <p>To give you a little anecdote, we had been totally hit by the facts that the latest iPhone does not more fit into our IBG start device, which is a way of marketing of the iPhone inventors. So we had to learn this the hard way. And the next time we know it. I would like to say something on the field first question. It's without our truth that the number of field trips also because of lesser opportunity to launch. But I think the major reason was that the decision model on prescribing has dramatically changed in the traditional markets like the United States and Europe. And coming from this, talking about our own head count, I believe yes, there may be little increases depending on the PCSK9 be a product for a <mark type="indiscernible" /> or not but overall I'm convinced we will never go back to the 10,000 we had in the U.S. because it's a decision making on prescription has totally changed. It moved upstairs. It went into treatment guidelines and the lists coming from the healthcare providers. On the other end of the geographical scope I never believe that we will have 10,000 reps in China either because as we said decision making and also because the way information is being handled is not the same as it has been in the 1980s and 1990s in the United States. But the fact is we have to pay in Japan &#x2013; in China same as U.S.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Elias, do you want to talk about attrition question, does this get offset by novelty? How do you see that developing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as we mentioned I think our portfolio is pretty amazing in the sense that attrition has not occurred to a significant degree. But I think if you look at general trends in the industry I think first of all look at the FDA approvals, last year, this year, they're up. So clearly the base hasn't changed and therefore there is more approvals. So you can tell that there is something happening.</p>
          <p>The second biologics have an inherently higher rate of success, lower rate of attrition and as you change your portfolio more towards biologics you have a lower attrition by nature because they have intrinsically lower rate than small molecules. The reason being that with a biologic you need to understand the biology. You need to understand the target and typically with an antibody or replacement enzyme is very specific and therefore you don't really have a lot of off-target effects and therefore you have a lower attrition rate, both on efficacy and success rate.</p>
          <p>I think the other point is that I think that the selection process is changing and to inside of R&amp;D. In other words in the past there is many shots on goal. Any target that comes out from the literature is a good one to go after. You have the tools, you go after the target. Today it's an inverted process. We are adopting the translational strategy which I have been advocating for a long time, which is the goal not just from bench to bedside, but from bedside to bench. You understand the disease biology in humans before you make a choice to go into a large expensive Phase III. So I think you're going to see a redistribution of the attrition rates. Hopefully more attrition early, less attrition later.</p>

          <p>Yeah, well thanks, everybody, for being here. Thank you all for your patience on the webcast. I could tell you personally I'm very happy to have 2012 behind us. This is the first time in 17 years that I can look forward and I don't see a patent cliff anywhere. I think we've also been able to surprisingly build an R&amp;D pipeline of a degree of robustness. So as we look out through the medium term of the business we continue to have the confidence that Sanofi gets back to growth in the second half of the year and beyond. So thank you very much for your support over the years particularly during the tricky patches in this business, and we look forward to your support going forward. Thanks very much.</p>
