          <p>Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Q2 Results Announcement Call. There will be a presentation followed by Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like to introduce our first speaker, Mr. Jeroen van der Veer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell second quarter conference call. Peter Voser, our CFO, and myself will update you on the results, petroleum activities, and exploration. And then we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>First, a disclaimer. Thank you. We delivered another sample of competitive results in the second quarter. This was helped by good operating performance. CCS earnings were 7.9 billion and earnings per share, excluding identified items, increased by 15% from the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Pay out to shareholders was 3.8 billion. Oil and gas prices were high during the quarter, and supported upstream. On the other side of the business, downstream margins remained under pressure for our industry. At Shell, the strategy is all about good operating performance and competitive returns to date, and making some significant investments in the company for the future.</p>
          <p>We are generating large profits. And we are making large investments to create value for our shareholders and to play our part to provide safe, convenient, and competitive cost energy for our customers. We have the largest investment program in Shell's history under way today, and one of the biggest in the world. Key projects are on track for start-up as planned, with 1 million barrels per day at upstream under construction, and 300,000 barrels per day downstream.</p>
          <p>We are increasing our investment program with new short-term drilling opportunities and new long-term positions, both upstream and downstream. For the most part, these extra investments are going into countries where we see acceptable political and physical risks. And at the same time, we are increasing our asset sales program. Peter will give you all the details in a moment.</p>
          <p>And if you put it altogether, I expect net capital spending this year to be 35 to 36 billion, assuming we are successful with the Duvernay acquisition. This is an increase in our net capital spending of some 60% from 2007 spending levels. Our strategy remains on track. We are maintaining strong capital discipline and focusing on creating long-term shareholder value. Cash flow is a competitive and we are making significant returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>We are making good progress with the construction of new projects. For example, in the Gulf of Mexico, the Ursa-Princess Waterflood project came on-stream in July. This will add some 30,000 barrels per day, to extend the field by another &#x2013; by further 10 years. The field that has already produced over 400 million barrels.</p>
          <p>Over the next 18 months or so, we expect to see start-up at a further five important new projects. In total, these projects should add capacity of over 250,000 barrels per day of oil and gas. And 3.6 million tonnes per year of LNG for Shell. In Nigeria, despite the operating environment, we expect the Afam Gas-Fired Power Plant project to come on-stream in the next few months. It's good to see a success story in this difficult area.</p>
          <p>In Deepwater, we made good progress with the BC 10 development in Brazil, and the Perdido project in the Gulf of Mexico. We built Perdido's spar in Finland, and this 22,000 tonne facility has now arrived in Texas. The BC 10 floating production and storage facility should leave Singapore for Brazil later this year. These are high-tech projects, which will produce water depths up to 2000 meters from complex reservoirs.</p>
          <p>At Sakhalin, we expect year-round oil production from this winter. LNG production should begin in early 2009. And of North West Shelf, Australia, Woodside expect first LNG from Train 5 by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>We have stepped up our spending on new growth options for the future. Let me give you some of the highlights so far this year. In downstream, Shell has joined PetroChina and Qatar Petroleum International as a preferred partner to assess plans for a new refinery and petrochemical plant in China. We have increased our stake in Iogen, which is a Canadian company involved in cellulosic ethanol, a biofuel made from straw that can be blended with gasoline. This is a so-called second-generation biofuel. In upstream, we signed a preliminary agreement to buy into assets belonging to Arrow Energy and to develop coalbed methane projects with them in Australia and across Asia.</p>
          <p>Turning to exploration, we have added important exploration acreage positions this year. These include blocks in the Chukchi Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, Peru, Colombia, and Australia. In total, these leases cover more than 40,000 square kilometers, which is roughly the size of the Netherlands. We have made four discoveries in the first half of this year. These wells were in the Haynesville area in the U.S., onshore, and in offshore, Nigeria, Australia, and Brunei.</p>
          <p>Our technical people are reviewing these results in detail, but early indications are positive. And we have launched an offer to buy Duvernay, which is a Canadian tight gas company, for some $5.9 billion Canadian. Tight gas is an attractive play for Shell. With tight gas reservoirs, resources can be very large, and production can last for decades. However, what we call reservoir quality is very poor. So the production flow rates from the wells can be very low. So there are some technical and economic challenges. So you need to have a manufacturing mentality, where you standardize the best technology and procedures over hundreds of wells and many years. This is in order to keep the costs down.</p>
          <p>Shell has a good track record in tight gas operations. We start in Wyoming, at Pinedale, with some small acquisitions in 2001. Since then, we have grown production substantially and at the same time, set new standards on efficiency and environmental footprint in the area. To put it simply, we hope to repeat the success that we have had at Pinedale with the Duvernay assets.</p>
          <p>So I think overall we are making good progress with our strategy. With that, let me hand over to Peter and the results in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeroen, and hello, everybody. We had another set of competitive results in the second quarter '08. Oil prices have continued to reach new highs in 2008. However, industry refining and chemical margins declined in most regions, quarter-on-quarter, due to limited transfer of oil prices into product prices. U.S. refining margins saw the sharpest declines versus 2007 in the same quarter. Industry refining margins declined in the first week of July, whilst industry crack margins remained under pressure.</p>
          <p>Excluding identified items, CCS earnings per share increased by some 15% compared to Q2 2007. Excluding working capital movement, cash flow per share increased by 54% from Q2 2007.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, oil and gas commodity market prices increased significantly. This had two accounting impacts. Firstly, working capital increased by about 12 billion, mainly due to inventory valuation effects and increased net accounts receivable. Secondly, there were non-cash charges of some 750 million in oil products and gas and power, as required under IFRS accounting for commodity derivatives. We usually include these non-cash P&amp;L impacts in results, which are part of normal business for Shell, and normally not material. I highlight these figures for you today because the impacts are rather large in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Dividend increased by 11% to $0.40 per share, and share buyback for the quarter was 1.4 billion. Bringing the total payout for the quarter of 3.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me talk about the business performance in more detail. Let's start with upstream. Upstream earnings increased by 84% to 6.8 billion. Shell's oil and gas realization remained competitive compared to industry market price. However, there are continued pressures industry-wide from operating costs and tax. Underlying quarter-on-quarter oil and gas volumes were unchanged from year-ago levels.</p>
          <p>Volumes were supported by stronger European gas demand, combined with growth from Ormen Lange gas in Norway, West Salym in Russia, and other small ramp-ups, such as Starling in the UK North Sea. These smaller projects can be very profitable, with great payback in current oil market conditions.</p>
          <p>LNG volumes decreased by 5% q-on-q, due to the cargo delivery, shed shelling and some impact from planned maintenance and reduced FICA. Q3 to Q3 energy volumes are expected to decline slightly due to the plant's maintenance.</p>
          <p>In oil sands bitumen production declined versus a year ago levels with earnings offset from higher prices. Bitumen production was reduced due to the mining operations in lower grade oil layers. So far in Q3 '08, mining and upgraded performance has been satisfactory. We expect Q3 production to be at similar levels to Q2.</p>
          <p>Turning to downstream. Downstream earnings declined by 70% to 958 million. Weaker industry refining margins in most regions led to a reduction of oil product earnings. At Shell, refining earnings were around 60% of oil products, 0.9 billion earnings in the second quarter of 2008, compared to around 50% in Q2 '07. Earnings from retails loops and B2B activities declined from year ago levels. Marketing volumes increased by some 2%, excluding the impact of disposals, especially navigation, where we have signed up new customers. Refining availability in Q3 '08 is expected to be around 92%, a similar level to that of a year ago.</p>
          <p>Chemicals earnings were impacted by feedstock cost pressure, especially in the United States. Chemicals availability in Q2 '08 was 95%, and we expect that availability in Q3 will be similar to year ago levels, which was 94%.</p>
          <p>We continue to make good progress with asset sales. So far this year, we have completed 2.7 billion of disposals in both upstream and downstream. We have sold from 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent today of upstream production capacity this year, and I expect this to reach over 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent capacity per day, by the end of the year, as disposals continue.</p>
          <p>We have also completed the exit from the 300,000 barrels per day French refineries, and the pipeline assets in Canada. Total disposable proceeds since '04 have reached over $28 billion. I expect disposal proceeds of &#x2013; to increase from 4 billion to 5 billion in 2008, as we have stepped up the pace in upstream.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about cash. Both the upstream and the downstream segments continue to generate cash flows above the capital requirements. At the Group level, operating cash inflow plus asset sales over the last 12 months was around $64 billion, including 5 billion from asset sales. Over the same period, we invested some 45 billion in cap &#x2013; acquisitions and payout to shareholders. But the cash flow position remains a healthy one. Gearing stood at 14.5% at the end of the quarter. That excludes the impact of Duvernay acquisition and the Arrow deal, which we hope to close during the third quarter. Gearing at the end of the second quarter would have been around 18%, including the impact of Arrow and Duvernay deals.</p>
          <p>This is a satisfactory balance sheet position. You can see an updated 2008 capital spending plan on this chart. This assumes the successful outcome of the Duvernay deal. The figures include the impact of industry inflation, and exchange rates, where, as I have said before, that there are considerable pressures in the industry. It also includes acquisition costs, plus CapEx associated with these new assets, and some discretionary investment in short payout drilling activities.</p>
          <p>We are making large investments for the future, which of course does impact near-term ROACE. Returns overall and on an underlying basis, remain healthy. Net capital spending since 2004 is some 74 billion, and we have returned more than 60 billion to shareholders since '04. As you know, we are committed to get a good balance between investing in the business for the future and paying competitive returns back to our shareholders, which is a good sign of the confidence that we have in future profitability of the company.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll return it to Jeroen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. So to recap, I think we have delivered another strong set of results in the second quarter, helped by good operational performance. We have made good progress with the portfolio. We have the largest investment program in Shell's history under way, and one of the biggest in our industry. Now our strategy is on-track. Operational excellence, competitive cash flow, capital discipline. With that, let me stop here and go for &#x2013; and of course, we go now to your questions.</p>
          <p>Operator, you can open it for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And the first question comes from Edward Westlake. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon; it's Ed Westlake, Credit Suisse. Two questions, if I may. You were talking about a new, sort of stable higher plateau for CapEx, and I understand the reasons for the increase. How much additional scope is there to hike CapEx even more to capture opportunities, and are you seeing any signs that the cost inflation is slowing? And then secondly, just on the exploration side, can I presume from the appraisal success, for this &#x2013; the term significant &#x2013; that these are above the sort of 100 million barrel range? Or could you talk a bit more about the reserves? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me start, and to see what Peter likes to add to that. If we think about capital expenditure, then in our thinking at Shell, we define that is organic CapEx, and organic CapEx may include small acquisitions, real small ones, probably below your radar screen, and a kind of once-off of acquisitions. If I take those organic investments, is that there we are very careful that we don't like to ramp them up too fast, or the other way, if you will &#x2013; would be on a too high level you don't like to bring it back suddenly. Why is that? Because to spend this organic CapEx you need a whole cadre of professionals, working systems and what have you. And I think it is not good quality investments if you ramp-up all the time fast, you are up and down. You never get very high quality project management, and so on.</p>
          <p>Now the balance, of course, can be large acquisitions, and of course you have to look whether you like to be an operator or non-operator. So it not only balance sheet arguments, both we do with our organic CapEx. Having said that, if you would like to have a relative pattern of organic CapEx in activity levels, then you have to look at your cash flows over time, the policies for returns to shareholders, and of course the strengths of your balance sheets. That's how we look at it, and we feel that this year 35 to $36 billion that compounds to the combination of the organic program together with the net balance of the acquisitions we do and the divestments. Yes. Let me stop there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just after the CapEx discussion, so I think if you look at organic spending plus after sales, then I expect a relatively steady trend of net spending going forward and Jeroen and I like the acquisition part, which is a very opportunistic way of looking at opportunities. I think what I would like to add is the valuation around inflation, foreign exchange impact, and timing effect, et cetera, but let me stay a little bit with inflation. I think we have seen 20%, which is the number Altazera is quoting.</p>
          <p>I have said previously, it's around 10% when I look at what we do across the board in the company, and I think I still stay with the 10% in that sense. But I would like to add that I still have a question mark how much of the inflation at higher oil prices, and we have seen a ramp-up, I don't think that's already in the prices, so I would still have that a little bit as a question mark at this stage on how inflation will impact. But I think as a kind of a general policy of organic spend those off taxes are relatively steady trend that will be the right number to go forward. We said disposals typically 2 to 3% of our capital employed, but it will decrease over time, as we are ramping up the capital employed.</p>
          <p>Your question about the reserves. I think this is a little bit too early to say. I think we are happy with the progress so far, the first half a year, from an exploration point of view. We drill these things as big cuts quite clearly now, we are into data analysis in the four which we have mentioned. So I think you need to be with us for a while on this one before we can give you a better insight on what that means. So I think as we normally do, we give updates twice a year on the exploration, so we'll quite clearly come back on those once we have more information.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Theepan Jothilingam. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. It's Theepan from Morgan Stanley. Couple of questions, actually, just firstly, could you talk a little bit about the reasoning on the acquisition of the position you've taken on Arrow Energy, and sort of in particular talk about your view, in terms of the Asia-Pac gas markets, and how the LNG markets are evolving, both shorter term and in the medium-term?</p>
          <p>And secondly, in terms of the CapEx increase of this year, you talk about opportunities in terms of &#x2013; in the short-term. Could you give a bit of flavor where you've seen those drilling opportunities and what sort of returns you're getting off them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I take the first one, and then Peter can take the second one. Arrow Energy is again, this is what we call another play in this unconventional gas. This one is in Australia, a bit is outside Australia, as I mentioned. We think that if you look at the markets as we see that in Asia. Say, if you look at expected cost and technology developments for these kind of unconventional gas, we see that as a strong, growing business. So implicitly we say that the gas coming out from those developments is a combination of domestic gas and export gas. Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll take the second one on the opportunities. Yes, we have some areas where you can drill wells quickly and relatively cheaply, and get a quick payback, so kind of one year, especially in current macro conditions. Examples are U.S. tight gas, for example, where we have kept 13 rigs, versus planned 10 rigs, so we have actually gone up there. We had whole steam tightback in Europe, we have curlieu see supsee tightback, and some others. All of these projects are screened using normal criteria and not step up in macro deck, so from that point of view, they are obviously very, very profitable to us.</p>
          <p>We don't give precise production guidance for these incremental drillings. But it's clearly we are pursuing them as much as we can, given current prices and given the current status of our balance sheet and the capacity which we have. But they, too, actually rank and have to perform in the same way as all the other projects, so they are screened in the same way. So we are not taking any kind of forward curves type of views on this &#x2013; they have to fly under normal criterias which we are screening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Theepan. Next question, operator.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Jon Rigby. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Yes, quite.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, sorry about that. I'm a quietly spoken guy. Two things, one on the disposal program. I'm just interested in how you're kind of matching up further assets to sell. To what degree are you bring forward disposals that may have happened in '09, '10? And to what degree do you have flexibility about what you sell, and what changed your mind about what is appropriate to be disposed of?</p>
          <p>And just following on from that, how should I think of the way it affects your upstream production outlook? Can I think that your additional organic CapEx plus some of your acquisitions balance off against the capacity that you're selling through the year?</p>
          <p>The second question was about Nigeria, Nigeria Train 6, in particular. To what degree should we assume that essentially Nigeria LNG produces LNG under its nameplate capacity? What has to happen before we can assume that the LNG coming out of that facility looks more like the potential that it can actually produce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Basically, Peter shall answer the questions. We will see how we deal with Nigeria.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I start, actually, with Nigeria. So all contracts so far, Jon, have been met from Nigeria LNG, and we expect that to be the case for at least the rest of the year. I'm referring to these, really also because of the security stuff, or situation. So obviously, we can't foresee problems, but that's our current planning assumption. The gas feed comes from a diversified grid, with several fields and supply pipelines. So actually, we have always expected Train 6 would be running this year at reduced rates, and there are some economic benefits as we switch feed gas into it when there is downtime on the other trains. So the major new project to supply T6 gas is Cabar Anuviez. We are making some progress there on the negotiations with funding, because that play is all there on that project, and construction continues at the site at this stage.</p>
          <p>We don't have a precise start-up date for the Cabar Anuviez and full capacity at LNG Train 6. Since there are physical and security uncertainties. So we have put it into the 2010 and '11 timeframe. This assumes we are successful in the funding negotiations, which are, by the way, progressing very well. So several fields, both Shell and partner-operated, have been identified to backfill current production and to feed future growth. So &#x2013; but the timing of the development is also depending, as I said already, for those projects on funding.</p>
          <p>On the disposal side, as we said, and I said, this is part of our portfolio management. And there is a constant screening of our projects, or our assets, in that sense, this is concentrating also from the market point of view, so prices being paid for the barrels which we have, et cetera. So I think you can take it as that we have got more assets in our divestment list than we normally take. Let's say our forecast at the early part of the year, because we want to keep some flexibility. So I wouldn't say that actually we are selling earlier our assets in 2008 and therefore in 2009 and '10 would have different guidelines. So, from that point of view, I stick to my 2 to 3% in that sense.</p>
          <p>We have done a little bit more last year, as you can remember now, it's a little bit less this year, kind of half, but we are still happy with the progress. I think 40,000 barrels will be our using this year that's coming out of the divestment process. So that you need to take into account when you look at to the &#x2013; this year's production. I think it's a little bit too early, as I said already, what is quick payback bring, what impact Nigeria has, etcetera. But when we go through the quarters, we will update you on these ones. But I think, if I look at the first half year for example, we are seeing some better uptick or demand upticks in Q2, whether in the first half, we have seen a little bit better in Nigeria, but we have seen much higher prices, and we have these divestments filed. So far we stay with the guidance or the description we have given for 2008 production.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, it is Irene Himona, Exane BNP Paribas. You decided to disclose for the first time the mark-to-market effect of derivatives, due to the large size. Should we expect ongoing quarterly disclosure of that? And my other question relates to LNG, could you possibly tell us what percentage of cargos you are diverting, and has that changed year-on-year? And my final question on CapEx, in the face of the 50% increase that you mentioned in net spending since 2007, can you help me understand how I should interpret your reference to strong capital discipline? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with a &#x2013; we have the LNG on the cargo. I think I'll start there. Good afternoon. Sorry for that. We typically move some 55, 60 LNG cargos every quarter, most from our joint-venture companies. So typically, we are diverting 10% of cargos, so that's a kind of the rough estimate. I can say that we had in the second quarter slightly more this year than last year, but it is not that many in that sense. So I think that was the one on two, can you just repeat me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark-to-market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark-to-market, let me &#x2013; this is, in our case, as I have always said, trading is based on physical, so we are coming out of our normal business stream, and we are dealing with physicals, where we put derivatives '08 in order to take the sharp price falls and movement out. Typically, in a normal quarter, we have got 50 to 100 million swings on this one. Normally GP is around 50 and 100 million in oil products. We do not &#x2013; we do see this as normal business for us, and these amounts of 50 to 100, we just absorb them normally in our normal results. If we go significantly above stats, above the 50 to 100, I think you can expect us to be very transparent and show these numbers.</p>
          <p>Now you obviously will think about Q3, the way I look at Q3, having had these big ones, this quarter, and certainly on the oil products side, most of the contracts will expire somewhere in the third or the fourth quarter. We will be very transparent on the effects there, so you can take it that we will be open on these ones. But if it is normal business for us, then we will just keep it in our normal results. It works for us from time to time, and against us in some other cases.</p>
          <p>Then you have had also the capital discipline one. I think I take, I give you two answers there, which is first a little bit of either on what we have done since '04. We have a net CapEx spending and I've always put emphasize on the fact that we are doing gross CapEx, we are doing acquisitions, we are doing divestments.</p>
          <p>So we are constantly turning over our portfolio, so net CapEx was 74 billion, payout was 60 billion, and we had 28 billions of disposals. And the capital discipline process is actually quite strong and I think you can see that. It goes to why we explained the gross CapEx, which is increasing by 2 billion, has actually three particular parts to it, so obviously, inflation and FX, and that is actually experienced everywhere in the market. Then we have said we have more CapEx because we have done certain acquisitions. They come with CapEx. Right, and then the third one is short-term opportunistic investments.</p>
          <p>Now the 2 billion you can take it roughly and a third each, and I can tell you they all are screened in the same way. And we have screened our capital now for many years in that sense a very rigorous process, and I think that's what I called capital discipline: maintaining the discipline in spending and maintaining the discipline on the returns, and on balance sheet management.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's Colin Smith from Dresdner Kleinwort. My question just is on succession. There has been quite a lot in the press that looks very well informed about succession to the CEO position, and obviously we're now less than six months from Rob Routs's retirement, and I wonder if you could great comment on those reports, and at least give us some visibility on when we may get some definitive answers on what might happen there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I give you a bit of same answers I gave to Shell's staff, because not only media, but of course Shell's staff likes to speculate a bit at the coffee machines, as well. And the first answer is: how does it work. When the unified company two years ago, we made clear that it is the primary lead for a Chief Executive succession or Executive Director succession, it was the nominating committee.</p>
          <p>Now for good order, the nominating committee pulls our all non-executive directors. So I'm not biased on nominating committee. Then the nominating committee advises the Board, the total Board, about succession of course, but if it is my own succession, that I'll stay out of that debate, and so that is the process. Now both has the nominating committee makes public, basically two things. First of all, and they are correct, as I can confirm, about I retire on the first of July, next year, and Rob Routs, our Downstream Director, retires at end of this year. The nominating committee, ourselves as well, we expect to announce the succession of the Chief Executive in the first quarter, next year, and they have notes up that they &#x2013; when they will announce the successful <mark type="inaudible" /> and it's good and if you look at our past, we will do it before Rob, of course, retires.</p>
          <p>While I said to our staff as well, this is not an American election, and there's no need for, to campaign or to gain votes, there is no need to appoint running mates, and what have you. So you waste your time to speculate on it, and my request is, that I will probably only partly successful, don't spend your time on it. Just wait on the day that the Boards will announce who succeeds in which capacity. That's my answer, Colin.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question, operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Lucas Herrmann. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much, gentlemen. Good afternoon, it's Lucas Herrmann at Deutsche Bank. A few if I might, the first is you've kindly taken the opportunity to inform us of how certain of the CapEx programs are developing, but you've omitted probably the two largest and most significant, namely Pearl and Athabasca Phase I. So I just wonder again if you could make specific comments on the timing of those projects. Initially they were indicated first production in 2010, and also how CapEx is progressing, whether it is still within budget.</p>
          <p>Second and following on, and I really appreciate some serious considerations I'm sure you'll give anyway. If I look at the amount that you are investing in your business, and that you've invested in your business over the last three years, and I look at your share price performance, what seems to be &#x2013; what's strikes one is that, in part, shareholders are voting with their feet, and by and large, if we are investing 60 billion or so of capital into your business over the last however long, you know the net increase you've seen in equity, or we've seen, in the equity of Shell is up 13 billion, and that's after allowing for buybacks. I just wonder whether you really feel that you're getting the balance of the distribution of the very cash that the business is generating at the moment. Yeah, correct between investment for the future, and return to your shareholders at the present time.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, just as a follow-up on inflation, because there is something I don't quite understand &#x2013; I'm sure that when you put your CapEx budgets forwards for the year, you've got an inflation figure in mind. If the inflation figure, or if the CapEx is now expanding by 2 billion, of which a third is for inflation, is it simply correct to assume that actually inflation has been worse than you had anticipated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good questions. Peter starts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for the questions. Good afternoon. Start with Pearl and Athabasca. Timing-wise I would say they're both on track. We are not immune from inflation, or in the case of Athabasca, also not immune of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. So that give us pressure, but I think we are still in the area of where we have profitable project in the Athabasca case. In the Pearl case, we are actually where we have been clearly when we took FID. So from that point, if you progressing on track in both areas, which, as I've said we are not immune.</p>
          <p>From production impact, I think I can confirm that on the Athabasca side, I would say that the production impact, as a full-year will be firstly seen clearly in 2011, the full year production impact. I think on the Pearl side, just take into account the same, in the sense that we have got a 12-month ramp up period. So I think you will then, towards the end of the year, clearly have the full ramp up and then see &#x2013; the total capacity certainly being there in 2012. They are both timing-wise on-track, but I think you know how this works from a ramping up basis; it takes some time, like we have in any other projects.</p>
          <p>On CapEx, in general, I think you, or let me talk about inflation, you talked about a third is inflation, on the SED, we take inflation into account. We take inflation into account for various price decks, quite clearly. The price decks have been clearly going more up than what we anticipated, but I would say that inflation is not our major adjustment; it is actually quite driven by foreign exchange. That's where the, quite clearly, the weakening of the dollar and the strengthening of some of the currencies where we invest has been more than will be anticipated. I wouldn't put, I think, too much on the inflation for us, but actually quite a bit on FX.</p>
          <p>On the shareholder side, I think we try to keep the short, the medium, and the long-term balance in terms of capital investments for the longer term, with the right returns in order to have a long-term shareholder value. We are obviously building the project pipelines on a constant basis for the next five to 10 years, and that's what we're doing. We have, as I said, returned a significant amount back to shareholders, and we have clearly always said that the priorities are a dividend which increases at least by inflation in U.S. dollars. It has the organic growth, and it has a balance sheet which is kind of &#x2013; has some flexibility in it, so that it can go through the cycle, and then we decide clearly on &#x2013; at the end, between special dividends or dividend increases, buybacks, acquisition, organic growth, and we take further organic growth, and we take the yields out of this into account when we take decisions.</p>
          <p>So I think we are optimizing this well at the moment, I would say, but there is no doubt over last two, three years, we have clearly with our projects, which are bringing on-stream, and we have heard Jeroen saying that we are looking at 250,000 barrels coming on-stream now, in the next 18 months that we are now getting in to the phase where significant barrels coming into production which will deliver obviously quite clearly significant cash flows. And top of that, we have got the 3.6 million tons per year of LNG. I think that answers all the questions, if I'm not mistaken. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. That the next question comes from Chad Potter. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chad Potter with RBC Capital Markets. Two-pronged question here, I guess. First off on the Haynesville shale in the U.S. Can you comment or spread a little additional detail on the discovery wells, kind of their location and test rates, as well as your acreage position in the play and activity plans? And then second, just on a higher level, just your thoughts on shale plays in the U.S. in general, and the potential to make a concerted effort to step up activity here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, only as a way of introduction is that you see that we have been quite active, if I would include Dupamay in all kinds of activities around natural gas in North America. And I hand over to Peter to ask you for the precise figures you asked for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think your question has a kind of two parts of it, which is one on the production and the other one specifically on Haynesville. I think if I look at tight gas today, Shell is around 80,000 barrels a day and we still ordinarily would add 20,000 to that and then some 70,000 &#x2013; that will grow to some 70,000 by 2012. And obviously, we are also ramping up in that sense, Pinedale, also. I think it's becoming a very sizable business.</p>
          <p>Now in Haynesville, as well, Shell and EnCana have an exploration agreement to explore the significant leasehold position in North Louisiana, salt face in Jurassic shale gas plates. Each partner has 50% working interest, covering roughly 300,000 acres of an area of mutual interest. We have an agreement to, which commits to a 10 well exploratory program. Following that, each party will have the right to operate 50% of the total acreage. So from that point of view, we have been very active there, as well. It's a little bit early to &#x2013; to give you more details on the production there. I would go as far as saying that the signs are actually positive of what we have seen so far from the wells, what flow there at the early stages. So we'll clearly update you later in the year again on this one. Or it's a very active area, like Jeroen has said. We are pleased with the progress we have made over the last 12 to 18 months.</p>

          <p>And the next question comes from Neil McMahon. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein. Just a few quick questions. Maybe just going back to refining and marketing, and the current trading conditions? Maybe you could give us a sense of operational hedges that could have been in place during the second quarter. What I mean is sort of purchasing crude and selling it forward on the futures market. Do you think in the timings of product making from the refineries versus liquid purchases. So maybe if you could go into that. And if you could give us some indications on Nigeria, as well, in terms of how you're looking at that going forward given the disruptions from the oil side, not the gas side, that's happened so far this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with Nigeria, Neil. Peter can think a bit about your question about how those hedges affect and what type of hedges they were. In Nigeria, the problem is that the area where we operate the oil site, so SPVC, the onshore, is as large state as England. And what we a bit see, if you put it in those terms, then you have a production disturbance or staff can't work, for security problems in Newcastle, but you can continue to operate in Cornwall. And then some months later, you work with the local chiefs, local governments, sometimes a butcher government, and you find the solution that people can work safely and we start in Newcastle. But then in the meantime, you've got a problem in Cornwall. So there does not have the same few out of action all the time.</p>
          <p>So we talk about west idea, east idea, specific pipelines, et cetera. So that even if we say that the order of magnitude of oil out of production, say in the second quarter this year. If I compare that with the previous quarters, it is not the same fields or the same lines. Right, it is all the time a changing scene. Now, how that will go forward, we don't know. I like to recall you that we have substantial progress of less production shutdown in the fourth quarter last year, but we lost part of that in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>And even then &#x2013; if I look, sorry, then what was irritating you, but I like to be open about that is this Bonga attack, there was an attack on the offshore production facility, 120 kilometers away from the coast. This was relatively new, this is taken extremely serious by all those operators who have offshore facilities. We talked to the government of course a lot of measures taken, preventive measures. We don't publicize that, of course. But we were quite taken back by it, especially by the safety and security concerns, because we had not expected that in such a way. If I look at the production impact of Bonga that was taken off of the second quarter, only 6,000 barrels per day. So that's mainly a safety concern. I hand off to Peter for your other question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeroen, just before Peter comes in with, I'm sure, a great explanation telling me I'm probably wrong. Just back on Nigeria, given the fact that there doesn't seems to be one core area or one core field that's on all the time. Maybe you could give us your feeling, as a CEO, in terms of what is going on in the evolution of getting the whole province sorted. It really doesn't appear that a solution is anywhere imminent in the next few years. And I'm &#x2013; this is all thinking about how we should forecast oil production from Nigeria going forward, at least in the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't &#x2013; I'm being very open about it, Neil. I don't dare to give any guidance on that. What I still see that &#x2013; of course you have to change from government, to the one president, to the other president, and let's hope this president is finally reconfirmed in his job, and come September, <mark type="inaudible" /> Nigeria, and that process will certainly not go on longer. I have to say we have had many contacts, including the most senior alapa in Nigeria this year. The eyes of them is really on the ball, but this is a very complex to get it right. And I think there is not a certain moment that they get it right. But it is not true to say that people don't do anything, or they are not actively involved in thinking and trying to do things to improve that security situation. There's very good awareness how serious it is, that's of course where it starts, and we now need the follow-through of basically good ideas that the government on the various levels that they have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Maybe just add to Nigeria, to give you some numbers, so that you know where we are from a balance point of view, at this stage. So average outing in Q2 was 195,000 barrels a day. The first three weeks, I'm talking Shell's share now. In the first three weeks were 178. What happened earlier this week with the pipeline blowups, which we had, that would add up to 40,000, 42,000 &#x2013; Shell's share &#x2013; to it. So that's a little bit what we are dealing with at this stage, and may also explain why we are slightly careful on how we describe our annual production numbers.</p>
          <p>On your first question, which is obviously could be an evening-filling question to discuss that. I think I need to speak clear on the one side, we are not like some, let's say, smaller or medium term players; we are not selling our production forwards and actually take the prices and hedge them in.</p>
          <p>So that's not our business; we are big enough to actually just take the pricing risks on that side. But quite clearly on the refining and marketing sides, we have typically activities in these businesses that are backed by physical products. And in some areas we need actually facilities to storage like storage and pipeline. But it is a business really dominated by physicals. So I think it will be normal as part of risk management that we set up some derivatives, a hedge contract on the product, which protect us from very large movements.</p>
          <p>I think this is very standard practice. So, I would use the example, you store in summer and you sell forward into the winter, and you have got the margin there, etcetera. And I, under IFRS rules, we have no other choice than to do the accounting as we have done it, and I already said while these things are per quarter for G P and for Oil product. I think that's as far as I can go. So you should not see us a big kind of hedging company, taking the price risks out of our business. We are quite sizeable, then we can actually absorb the prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Maybe Peter, just back on the IFRS, it certainly &#x2013; it's not made it any easier forecasting numbers for companies with exposures to long-term contracts, like UK Gas, etcetera. Have you given the IFRS any feedback, from a CFO point of view, on the volatility this causes to numbers, and maybe if you could see any discussions that have been going on with regards to mark-to-market accounting of long-term contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe too long, because let's be clear that on the U.S. GAAP you have got similar issues, though, it's not just with the IFRS. I think it's &#x2013; the accounting versus economic reality, what I call it. And yes, we have made this clear of what we think about the volatility, and I know some of my colleagues have done the same. So I just tell you when we look at our results internally, you look at the economic reality, and not at the quarter end kind of driving price, and just as a cycle, when you have seen on the whole reserves discussion at the SEC. Now they're also re-thinking of not using yearend pricing; using something a little bit wider. So quite clearly, this is an issue, and what you get from me is just, but it is big and you need to know it, and then I will tell you. But I can't take the market volatility away from you, but yes, we are talking with corresponding kind of authorities. But I mean, you all new guys we all sit in banks and share value accounting, etcetera, a big issue there as well. So, it's not just the oil industry, it is a wider issue, which I think everybody is focusing on.</p>

          <p>Jeroen, if I may add a personal comment at this teleconference. I think it is really, even if it is already difficult for analysts to forecast the figures, or to analyze the figures. Then try to think about the normal media. They yield figures of today, of 11.6, then you go to CCS, then the year a figure of 7.9, then you take a usual the 7.8, and then you talk to our Investor Relations and you say well, that is how you have to see it, and the line figures 8.6. This does not help. Not only the public, it even doesn't help me. Yes, and I fully &#x2013; I have a lot of sympathy for your comment, this is kind of coming on about make a better system. So this is just a personal reflection. So we go to the next question, Operator.</p>

          <p>And the next question comes from Mark Iannotti. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen, it's Mark at Merrill Lynch. A couple of questions, you attribute a portion of your 2 billion increasing CapEx to step up in drilling activities, where you can get quick payback. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more detail behind where you are drilling, how long you could continue to drill, assuming prices stay high &#x2013; other opportunities, and certainly what difference it can make in the short term, to what's been flat volumes now for some considerable time.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, maybe this is a question for the management next year, but I will ask it anyway. Marzen, this afternoon, has admitted they're much smaller integrated than yourselves, has indicated that it is going to start a review on the potential merits to share holders of de-merging the business. Are there any circumstances in which you would consider this type of review, and if you've done one, what were your conclusions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second. And Peter will do the first. This depends on your business model for the future, Mark, is that if I look at Shell, we already started quite some years ago now. This all about technology to make sure that we are at the forefront of technologies, and then the ability to do multi-corp, large, integrated projects, not only to construct them, but to run them as well; all the time there's world-wide learnings. Now take the examples, I will give you three examples like Pearl, the gas to liquids projects, take the oil sands and what it needs to have an acceptable footprint and working up to bitumen off the oil sands, and take the things that will come over time as sour gas.</p>
          <p>I could have added Shell gas, or further conventional gas. What you see all the time there, that we combined upstream and downstream know-how and we combined that with basically operational experience of new technology we develop ourselves. So what I tried to say, the business model that we have chosen, we strongly believe in an integrated company. Now other companies may prefer to play different business models; that's their view. Having said that, and I think Peter will say clearly on that, having chosen for a large integrated business model, it does not rule out that from time to time, you sell certain parts of the company, as we have been very active over the past years. And basically we indicate, we expect that to continue. And so that's how we look at the business model. Peter, the question about drilling activities there, and how long you need to process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mark, thanks for the question. I think it's a little bit too long to remind the question. I am not going forward and give you kind of price assumptions, but I would like to use the Pinedale example of running 13 rigs, for example, versus 10 rigs. The beauty in all of this is you can actually run it, if you need, or if you want to slow it down because prices are where they are, you can actually slow down, and I think that's exactly what we're looking for.</p>
          <p>So we have some of these plays going. Some of the work which we are doing is also then related to appraisals. So we drill these wells, we look at it, and then we take a further view on how long we should continue this one. So this does add quite a bit flexibility to us, it does add or gives us, let's say short-term paybacks and that's what we are driving. So I have used Pinedale as an example but quite clearly we have some others. We already talked about some other North American gas business like in Haynesville and Texelle, where you can apply obviously exactly the same. So that is part of our strategy to get more flexibility into that &#x2013; that you can actually do more short-term payback, but when times get tough, you can actually also again slow down, if you want to.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I realize there are still probably some questions left. I would like to say I have a really hard stop in seven minutes from now. So we will try to give the remaining questions relative short answers. Back to you, Operator.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The Benchmark Company. Good afternoon gentlemen, couple of things. First, Peter I believe you called our attention previously to the potential implications of LNG contract exploration roll over and renegotiation. Could you give us a bit of an update and a quantification, if you can, as to anything that's occurred in this regard, over the course of the first half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Mark, thanks for the question. Yes, this is indeed ongoing on a permanent basis, but because of commercial kind of confidentiality, I can't actually start to talk about individual areas of contract. Many of these negotiations are also actually led by our joint venture companies, so that makes it even a little bit more difficult to talk about it. But I can repeat that this is in full swing, given that where prices are, our contracts are recent. So this is a positive upside for us &#x2013; for us and that continues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Peter, could I ask you just to clarify something that I thought I heard in your direct remarks? Did you suggest that Q3 volumes were both LNG sales and bitumen production were likely to be roughly in line with Q2, and if you did, I'm not sure I quite understand, given the normally low levels in Q2 for both of those items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, indeed, I did and we are &#x2013; I have said that in the LNG case we have maintenance coming into the third quarter, so this is according to our plans, just normal. And that I am &#x2013; so, these planned maintenance are higher than last year, and I think that's why I wanted to flag it, because that may not be known, entirely. And that we're working through our low ore levels in the mining. We would expect it to be more or less on a similar level using the same loyalty calculations that we had used in Q2. But as &#x2013; I think I would also like to say that we are thinking our sales through that, down that path in the mining, and once we are out on the other side, we will let you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one more, if I could, please. You've had some exploratory success in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, in terms of Vicksburg, Shiloh I think you're drilling Fredericksburg currently, which you did not mention. How do you stand, in terms of a commercial development project in the Eastern Gulf with the success that you've had?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Mark on this one I can't go into details at this stage. So I suggest you call our IR guys, if they can give you any more details on that one, because I have nothing in my material at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, just one more. Is it correct you and Exxon have pulled the Infinium sale, which previously I believe you intended to sell? If so, if it's true, why did you reach that decision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have done a strategic review with Exxon, and after that strategic review and certain market testing, we have decided to actually continue to operate ourselves. That means, Exxon and Shell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Peter. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Mark. Operator, next question.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from Lucy Haskins. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Lucy Haskins from Lehman Brothers. Perhaps it allows you a chance to wrap up, actually, Jeroen. Because what I was going to ask you about was an outlook statement, in the near term. And in the past, you have expressed some satisfaction that demand has been relatively robust to higher prices. Is that still your view? Obviously one of your competitors was perhaps a bit more bearish about the near term outlook, particularly with reference to the downstream and product space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lucy. We said deliberately that we see a reaction to the high prices and that reaction is basically North American states and Europe. Of course, Far East is a different story. If you look at our worldwide market share, we are some millions of barrels in a total market of 85 millions of barrels, so a lot of our outlook, if I look at the margin side is of course, yes, if it is total, let's say, if you get substantially more supply then amount of margins will suffer. But we are relatively a worldwide market share. We are not that big, so first it is simply a lot of tasks, simply to do it there, especially without being better than the competition. That's how we make our money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you give a &#x2013; I can understand that, but is the problem not that you may be competitive relative to just a very poor &#x2013; I mean, what would be your view about the general market trend over the course of last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have learned some good lessons other past years. Usually if I thought that I have a pretty good at somewhat forecast but turned not to be true, Lucy, so I'd be more modest. And I try to guess all the people our company that they are prepared for all situations. And I can give you an example. Think about refining, and what do you see? Far East, increased amount. The new production capacity coming on-stream. How will it work out? But you see in the West, there of course yeah, maybe even some lower demand, you see demand shifts, gasoline to middle distillates.</p>
          <p>But in different companies are different place. By the way, we are quite good place to such a shift. On the other hand, there is hardly any expansion of refining capacity or even closer of smaller ones. How it all will work out, and how markets will anticipate on that as well, is very tough to see. Being who I am, I always try to assume, not to be optimistic, but our company should be prepared for all different kinds of markets.</p>
          <p>Operator, may I ask you to go to the last question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir, and the last question today comes from Jason Kenney. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jason from ING, glad to be the last, I suppose. I was just wondering if you could enlighten us, as the future operator of cash again. If you'd had any initial thought on CapEx for that first phase development? And then secondly, I am still curious about the about the Infinium exercise. Do you envisage you being 100% of Infinium in the future, or are you likely to exit from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not yet. I think detailed capital statements for cash accountables, even exactly Phase 1 or Phase II or experimental phase. We have not given, at least this company has not given any specific guidance, nor do we intend to do that. Of course, we are big, and as you can see, a well picked up, and this month the whole joint venture is under restructuring, and the various shareholders will pick up various parts to do in the future. But even there, all the details have still to work out. Infinium, it is a joint venture for years. We reviewed it and I think that, as far as I can see, and I know with this model, the intention is that we run together with Exxon, and we continue now to run it.</p>
