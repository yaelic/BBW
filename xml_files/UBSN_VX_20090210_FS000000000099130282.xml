          <p>Good morning and welcome to UBS' Fourth Quarter Results. At today's meeting we're going to have three presentations. First up will be Marcel Rohner, who is going to provide a management overview of the Group. Then John Cryan will take you through the financials. And then Jerker Johansson will explain the details of the IB repositioning. As in all results presentations, we now have to look at the caution regarding forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>It's an important disclaimer so please take a few moments to have a look at it.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Marcel Rohner, CEO of UBS. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Philip and good morning ladies and gentlemen to our fourth quarter result presentation. The fourth quarter ended the worst year in the history of our bank. It also marked the worst point of an ever worsening financial crisis in 2008. As we previously stated, we have always applied one principle to all our decisions, protect the safety of our institution as the basis to protect our clients. This was the fundamental driver behind our agreement with the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss government to enter into a transaction to shift a substantial amount of liquid and other assets into a separate entity, the stabilization fund, and to recapitalize the bank to offset the resulting write off with the help of the Swiss government.</p>
          <p>As the developments of the fourth quarter have shown, the decision was both timely and appropriate. We are deeply grateful to the Swiss Confederation, the Swiss National Bank, and the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority for their decisive action, their support, and pragmatism. We have utilized the timing of the fourth quarter to navigate through the worst possible environment, to clean up as much as we could and to accelerate the renewal of our Bank, to make us fit for a challenging environment.</p>
          <p>The market conditions for the financial industry have changed and will remain different for the foreseeable future. We have adjusted our businesses such that they can operate profitably and grow sustainable earnings in a new environment. We have taken provisions and write downs where required. We have set money aside to complete the restructuring of parts of our business and we have reorganized key parts of our Group to optimally position ourselves to address the challenges ahead.</p>
          <p>This also involves the appointment of two new members to the Group Executive Board. Whilst we leave a bad year behind us, we can therefore nevertheless report substantial progress on all fronts.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter can best be summarized by its two key features, an adjusted operating loss of CHF 2.8 billion and a financial loss of CHF 8.1 billion. This leaves UBS with an annual loss of CHF 19.7 billion. The difference between the 2.8 billion adjusted operating loss and the financial loss consists largely of three major items, two of which we have pre-announced on the 4th of November.</p>
          <p>First, the impact of the transaction with the Swiss National Bank, secondly the partial reversal of our own credit, and third, the substantial restructuring charges. John Cryan will provide you with more detail on all these items. Related to the fourth quarter, I would like to highlight three more critical and important issues. The first one is the balance sheet reduction and the capital position. The second one is the net new money development, and the third one the variable compensation payments.</p>
          <p>We have made substantial progress in balance sheet reduction and we have achieved a very strong capital ratio of 11.5%. Due to the strong reduction of our trading assets, we had an average FINMA leverage ratio of 2.6% through the quarter, that's the new leverage ratio as introduced by the Swiss Financial Markets who provide the authority. And we had one leverage ratio of 3% using the balance sheet data as of the end of December. So we thereby already substantially meet the new minimum requirement assuming that our balance sheet continues to reduce as planned.</p>
          <p>The net new money number was slightly more negative than in the third quarter, this is of course disappointing. The underlying trend however is very encouraging. The net new money progressively improved throughout the quarter and was positive in January. We are grateful to all our clients who are starting to put back the trust in UBS. Again John will give you more detail about the net new money development later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Before I provide you with more details on compensation, I would like to make an introductory remark on this topic. Our compensation system addresses the needs, the requirements, market rules, labor laws and competitive compensation practices in over 50 countries who pay nearly 78,000 people around the world, with a variety of different instruments ranging from cash to deferred instruments which are blocked and tied to material restrictions. The one thing which is completely inadequate is the attempt to express this complexity in only one number.</p>
          <p>The most important aspect of this table on compensation is that it demonstrates the strength and power of the system of variable compensation. This system allowed us to reduce the overall personnel cost by CHF 9.25 billion in 2008, 36% reduction. We did this in order to preserve a strong capital base which we consider in agreement and aligned with our regulatory authorities, the necessary condition to successfully compete in the future. A variable compensation model is predicated on comparatively low fixed salaries and progressively higher portion of variable components, the highest the total compensation amount. The reason why the financial industry was introducing such models was to keep some flexibility in the cost base as the average personnel costs are high, but the revenues are cyclical.</p>
          <p>Our fixed commitments have a variety of origins, larger parts stem from acquisitions such as Pactual or businesses which have pay systems tied to their specific profitability such as hedge funds. Another important element relates to people we hired during the year and where the total compensation is fixed for the first few months of their new employment. A part of these fixed commitments are deferred compensation elements in the form of shares and options which are blocked for several years and are only attributed to staff who are still with UBS when these instruments rest. Because the payment is conditional and therefore uncertain and if it takes place it will only be in the future, it will only be accounted for once it materializes.</p>
          <p>We've reduced our discretionary cash compensation to the bare minimum, a total of CHF 1.161 billion. The contractual commitments amount to CHF 994 million. We do benefit from a credit of 400 million due to accounting changes which leave the total variable compensation amount at 1.743 billion for 2008. Why would I call this reduction a reduction to the bare minimum? In the variable compensation fix, the fixed component is by design kept below what it otherwise would be. For many employees this component has been deliberately kept constant for many years.</p>
          <p>There are also no additional elements such as a certain salary, as is customary in many countries for example in Switzerland. Because we have reduced the discretionary cash compensation to the lowest possible minimum, we also used the existing option plans as in previous years and we introduced a new deferred instrument which is linked strongly to future performance under very strict restrictions. The total amount of CHF 900 million of the conditional variable compensation plan was allocated. This plan will only vest over the next three years and only if UBS is profitable and if UBS does not need new state aid and if the planned recipient is still with UBS.</p>
          <p>We believe that we struck the right balance between the protection of our capital base and the alignment of our employees with our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Let me talk briefly about our investment bank. We have shaped our investment bank to be fit for a challenging and substantially different environment. Aside from the few problematic areas, we have several core businesses, each with a longstanding track record of profitability, market share growth, and strong client relationships. Equities, investment banking department, foreign exchange, money markets, rates, and flow credit, and our cross product presence in the BRIC countries and in the Middle East. Our Investment Bank will be a leader in these businesses and this leadership position is the foundation for long-term sustainable earnings growth and value creation.</p>
          <p>We have accelerated the closure of all businesses, which we considered either non-core or which have substantially diminished prospects of being profitable in the foreseeable future. This allows us to reduce the size of our Investment Bank, the necessary infrastructure, and the complexity of the operation. It also enables us to run the Investment Bank with a much smaller balance sheet and therefore less capital and funding resources.</p>
          <p>The runoff portfolios are taken together in the repositioning group and adequate provisions to implement these changes have been taken and accounted for in Q4 of 2008, results with only minor additional costs to come. Jerker Johansson will provide you with more details later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>The Wealth Management business too faces major challenges. Most importantly, the profitability levels have dropped substantially throughout the industry, due to a depressed asset base and changes in the product demand. Managing for efficiency is therefore becoming ever more important. Apart from a deteriorating economic environment we also have to address specific strategic challenges in all our Global Wealth Management and Business Banking businesses.</p>
          <p>As a result, we concluded that it is critical that we create a management and organizational structure which allows us to focus on the most pressing issues and minimizes management distraction. We also wanted to broaden the Wealth Management representation at the Group Executive Board level and particularly elevate the highly profitable and dependable Swiss business. The new leadership team stands for our commitment to the business and marks a handover to the next generation of management.</p>
          <p>The flat tire brings the people in the businesses closer to the top of the house. The creation of the Swiss Wealth Management International Business unit allows us to maximize efficiency on the Swiss operational platform, and to focus on the growth areas in the international Wealth Management market. The concentration of the centralized and expert skill based corporate and institutional banking businesses enables us to further improve our client services. The formation of the Swiss Bank unit which looks after the Wealth Management and private clients in Switzerland and includes the services for small and medium sized enterprises. The sole proprietors and professionals is the basis to rebuild our reputation and recognition in our home market, to which we are deeply committed.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management Global focuses primarily on our domestic businesses outside the Americas and Switzerland. After a long period of investment spend these operations have to be managed for profitability without a cross subsidization from our highly profitable Swiss platform.</p>
          <p>In the Americas, Wealth Management US will continue to increase its scale and profitability in terms of larger asset base and we continue to develop our domestic business in Brazil and Canada. And the recent past has shown a return to growth in the US.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to John Cryan, who takes you through our quarterly results and then to Jerker Johansson with more information about our Investment Bank. John, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcel. And I'll begin, if I may by recapping on the highlights of the Group results in Q4. And the picture is mixed. The attributable net loss for the quarter was CHF 8.1 billion compared with a small profit in Q3. A number of substantial items impacted the results, but the adjusted performance was nevertheless unsatisfactory. Results in our Wealth and Asset Management businesses were weak reflecting tough market conditions, and the trading performance in the Investment Bank was poor.</p>
          <p>Clients' net new money outflows totaled almost 86 billion in the quarter, but the monthly trend was encouraging. Following the announcement of our transaction with the Swiss National Bank in October, we saw gross outflows slow significantly month-on-month. The outflows we did see have clearly impacted the balance of clients' invested assets, though by materially less than market price movements.</p>
          <p>We continued with our program to resize the cost base. We exited certain businesses in the Investment Bank and responded to generally lower client activity across all our divisions. We reduced our total head count by almost 1,800 largely as a result of involuntary redundancies in the Investment Bank. However, we are continuing to invest in our Wealth Management business and we hired nearly 400 financial advisors in the US in Q4 alone.</p>
          <p>We made good progress in managing our balance sheet. Put-ins at the end of 2008 were marginally higher than they were at the end of September, but this belies the results achieved in the Investment Bank, where trading assets including collateral trading balances fell by CHF 270 billion in the quarter. This reduction was masked by a 50% increase in the carrying value of derivatives resulting from market movements in interest rates in most major currencies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and the general widening of credit spreads.</p>
          <p>Risk weighted assets fell by almost 10% as a consequence of our de-risking exercise in the Investment Bank. More than half of the decrease was attributable to the sale of assets to the Swiss National Bank. Our tier 1 ratio ended the year at 11.5% compared with a restated number of 11% at the end of Q3. The improvement reflects both the reduction in risk-weighted assets and the CHF 6 billion of new capital we issued to the Swiss Confederation in December.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to the full year picture, we report an overall loss of CHF 19.7 billion for 2008 compared with a loss of 5.2 billion in 2007. And I suspect I need saying nothing more on that front.</p>
          <p>I mentioned that Q4 was influenced by a number of significant items and the next two slides are intended to help you separate the effect of those items from the underlying performance of the Group.</p>
          <p>On an IFRS basis, we showed negative revenues for the quarter of CHF 4.1 billion, with expenses of 5.6 billion, producing an operating result with a loss of 9.7 billion. But this loss includes significant items totaling 6.9 billion which I've bracketed together into five categories and which you can see more graphically on this next chart.</p>
          <p>The first of these items is an own credit loss of 1.6 billion. This was mainly the result, not of our credit spreads tightening in fact they widened slightly in the quarter, but of the significant volume of redemptions and repurchases of our debt that took place. You should bear in mind that in our own credit figures, we not only reflect the UBS credit spread but we also take into account changes in fair value of our own liabilities that are attributable to factors other than credit spreads. And those factors include things such as benchmark interest rate curves, Forex rates, index prices and so on. And we call this economic own credit and we've restated prior periods accordingly.</p>
          <p>The impact of own credit calculated in accordance with the guidance provided in IFRS 7 produced a gain in the quarter, not a loss, a gain of CHF 158 million. And that's because IFRS guide to the calculation of own credit using only the change in credit spread as applied to only the closing fair values of our liabilities. The difference between IRFS credit of 158 million and the loss of 1616 million shown on the chart, i.e. 1773 million, is the economic own credit loss due to the reduction in fair values of our liabilities during the quarter.</p>
          <p>In our IFRS disclosures, the 1773 million is included in negative trading revenue. For more information on this admittedly complex subject, may I direct you to notes 3 and 10 of our quarterly report.</p>
          <p>The second item on the chart is the net effect of the SNB deal and of December's MCN issue. I have lumped together six line items totaling a 4.2 billion loss, which is the accounting effect of the SNB transaction and the related capital raising. The principal impact here flows from our agreement to haircut the assets that we sold to the SNB in exchange for a right that we received to purchase the SNB's fund at some stage in the future subject to certain conditions having been met.</p>
          <p>And I have included a slide in the appendix which details of all six line items and reconciles the overall charge of 4.2 billion. I'd also like to talk in more detail in a minute about the SNB transaction and the changes to it that we and the SNB have jointly announced today. In Q4 we also made a number of small disposals. The most significant of these were first, the sale of our stake in Bank of China for a CHF 360 million gain and second, the sale of our fixed income commodities businesses at a CHF 133 million loss.</p>
          <p>In the IB we incurred an additional 737 million in restructuring charges, and that 737 million was made up of 435 million in severance costs and 302 in premises costs. Finally during Q4, under the terms of our settlement in relation to the sale of auction rate securities by our Wealth Management US business we posted a registered offer to our clients to purchase their securities at par. These settlement rights that we offered, having been issued to and accepted by clients, are deemed to be a derivative instrument for accounting purposes. And so as a result the ARS settlement liability was reclassified from provisions in G&amp;A expenses to the trading account where it's held as a negative replacement value.</p>
          <p>In Q4, the increase in provision before reclassification to fair value was 545 million. That was recorded in G&amp;A expenses. Post reclassification, marking the option to fair value at quarter end led to an additional trading loss of CHF 60 million. And so if you adjust for all of these significant items, you wind up with a pre-tax operating loss for the Group in Q4 of CHF 2.8 billion.</p>
          <p>The next slide breaks down the Group's operating -- adjusted operating loss by division. We booked most of the net effect of the SNB and MCN transactions and part of the Bank of China sale proceeds in corporate center. We took the 605 million net loss in option rate securities in Wealth Management US, and we booked the remainder of the significant items in the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>Factoring in these adjustments at a Group level, we had adjusted operating income of 1.6 billion which I'll cover later in the presentation when I look at the underlying divisional performance, and we had adjusted expenses of 4.4 billion which I'll take you through now.</p>
          <p>On this slide, you'll see that the reported Group operating expenses fell quarter-on-quarter by 6%. Eliminating the ARS settlement provision and the IB restructuring charge, adjusted expenses fell 28% quarter-on-quarter as a result of cutting back on variable compensation. The quarterly underlying run rate of expenses at 4.4 billion is not indicative of future levels, as we intend to resume accruing for variable compensation at market levels in 2009. However, fixed costs don't yet fully reflect the impact of our head count reduction measures. Non-personnel costs were higher in the quarter, thanks mainly to higher legal and other professional costs.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, personnel numbers fell in the quarter by nearly 1800 or 2.2%, mainly in the Investment Bank. We're now expecting that the overall Group head count number will fall to around 75,000 as a consequence of some of the changes that Jerker will discuss with you.</p>
          <p>We continue to look to hire client advisors in Wealth Management. We've seen considerable success as I mentioned in the US where all of our major competitors are undergoing integration or merger dislocation. There we saw a net quarterly increase in the number of financial advisors of 274.</p>
          <p>The balance of our clients' invested assets fell by 18% in the quarter, but over 80% of that reduction was accounted for by market factors including negative Forex translation effects. More than 50% of our invested assets are denominated in US dollars.</p>
          <p>Net new money outflows in the fourth quarter amounted to just under 86 billion, of which 58 of that 86 billion were in Global Wealth Management and Business Banking and about 28 billion in Global Asset Management. Of the 28 billion of net outflows in Asset Management about half of the total was lost through the UBS distribution channel and that means that it's double counted in the figure for Wealth Management.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management, all regions except the USA saw net outflows in the quarter. Client de-leveraging was a major reason for money outflow. Global Wealth Management and Business Banking's gross lending portfolio fell by 19 billion in the quarter mainly from a fall in Lombard lending balances in Wealth Management International and Switzerland.</p>
          <p>As an exception to our normal approach we are showing you on this slide monthly data, because we wanted to illustrate the progress we've made since October. In January 2009 we recorded net new money inflows in both Global Wealth Management and Business Banking and in Global Asset Management. But market conditions do remain challenging, not least because of, a lot of clients are continuing to reduce their own leverage and because poor markets don't encourage clients to invest new money. We'll show you the monthly breakdown for the first quarter when we report to you in early May, but we don't intend to provide this level of detail in subsequent quarters.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the balance sheet. Trading assets including collateral trading were down CHF 270 billion in the quarter or 220 billion after accounting for foreign exchange effects. This represents a further 15% reduction over September's underlying balances. Since June 2007 when the crisis started we've brought down the funded balance sheet by around CHF 1 trillion. Our balance sheet footings were flat on Q3 at around CHF 2 trillion due to the spike in replacement values in our derivatives portfolio which I'll address on the next slide.</p>
          <p>On this slide I also introduce you to the FINMAs leverage ratio. You may recall from my third quarter presentation that the ratio is calculated using an adjusted asset base and our Tier 1 capital. We provide full details in the fourth quarter reports so I will only touch on the key points here. First, we calculate the relevant adjusted asset balance as the mean of the three month end totals. And so for Q4 that means the October, November and December month end balances. Each monthly balance is adjusted by deducting first of all, the difference between IFRS and Swiss GAAP positive replacement values, and Swiss GAAP here is similar to US GAAP. We then take off our loans to Swiss clients as well as cash and other balances with central banks. And then finally we deduct those balance sheet items that are already deducted from Tier 1 capital such as goodwill for example.</p>
          <p>You see from the chart that our average growth balance sheet for the quarter was higher than the period start and the period end balances. And this was mainly due to the spike in PRVs in the quarter but also because collateral trading balances can typically inflate into a quarter. And based on the average balance sheet adjusted for the deductions I just mentioned, we had a FINMA leverage ratio for the quarter of 2.58% against a minimum target of 3%. But, if we were to take the adjusted balance sheet on 31st December rather than our quarterly average and apply the closing Tier 1 balance including our December MCN issue, our leverage ratio was already just over 3%. So we remain confident of meeting our targets soon, and in any case well before it becomes a regulatory measure on the 1st January 2013.</p>
          <p>This slide shows the breakdown of the balance of positive replacement values and their movement in the quarter. The increase of just over 50% was mainly attributable to the falling interest rates in most major currencies. An example of this would be for instance when we received fixed payments under a swap transaction. When interest rates fall, the replacement value of the receivable under the swap increases.</p>
          <p>Other factors that drove the increase in PRVs were foreign exchange rate and volatility movements, credit spread widening, and extremely high levels of volatility in the equity markets. This slide also contains information on the netting of positive replacement values under Swiss GAAP. You can see that our positive -- netted positive replacement values increased by just 16% in the quarter. The notional value of all our derivatives fell by 12% in the same period while the notional value of our credit derivatives fell by 20% as we continued to pursue tear-up opportunities.</p>
          <p>This slide is one you probably recognize from earlier presentations. It traces the movement in regulatory capital ratios from quarter end to quarter end, and we have restated the opening balance for application of the change in the calculation method for own credit that I mentioned earlier. In the quarter, the slight net reduction in Tier 1 capital was more than offset by the progress we made in bringing down our risk weighted assets balance. Even though we continued to derisk our balance sheet, no assurance can be given as to the direction of risk weighted assets in coming quarters as they are exposed to credit rating migration, to foreign exchange risks, to operational risk charges, and to calculation methods that influence their value but that are not necessarily under the control of UBS.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to move on to our risk disclosures and to start with explaining the revised deal we have agreed with the Swiss National Bank. By the end of Q4, we had concluded that it was no longer appropriate for us to sell our present and our future student loan auction rate certificates to the SNB's fund. Instead, we now intend to hold our student loan ARCs on our balance sheet for the foreseeable future. We will reclassify them from trading account where they're held at fair value through the P&amp;L, to the loans and receivables account where they'll be accounted for on an accruals basis and tested periodically for potential permanent impairment.</p>
          <p>And as and when we acquire auction rate certificates from our Wealth Management US client base, we'll apply the same treatment and book them as loans and receivables. In addition we've decided not to sell to the SNB, the assets currently ensured by monoclines, and instead we will reclassify those as loans and receivables where it's possible to do so. The overall amount of the SNB facility has therefore reduced by more than one third to just over $39 billion, you remember it was $60 billion. The table on this chart sets out in some detail the positions affected by the revision to the original deal.</p>
          <p>Now, we remain exposed to two categories of separately disclosed risk concentrations that could continue to impact our profitability. The first is our leverage loan portfolio where our net exposure at the end of December stood at $4 billion. Of that 4 billion, 2.3 have been reclassified as loans and receivables and will be held on our balance sheet for the foreseeable future and the remaining 1.7 billion continue to be held for trading.</p>
          <p>In Q4, we took permanent impairment charges and write-downs of $1.2 billion on our leverage finance exposures, mainly on loans extended to the now bankrupt divisions of the petrochemicals concern LyondellBasell. The second of our separately disclosed risk concentrations are our exposures to the monoline insurance companies as a class. The vast majority of our exposure to the monolines is in the form of credit default swabs which we purchased to hedge long asset positions. On 31st December the total value of the CDS protection purchased from the monoline insurers against these positions was $5.3 billion, and that's after a cumulative credit valuation adjustment of $7 billion. In Q4 we incurred a loss of $2 billion from increasing the CVAs on our derivatives exposures to the monolines.</p>
          <p>You recall that at the end of our Q3 presentation I told you that we decided not to take up the option that was available to us under the new amendment to IFRS, to reclassify certain of our assets out of the category held for trading with retroactive effect to the 1st of July. We have, however, exercised this option in October in respect of the majority of our previous risk concentrations, which you can see on this slide. These are risk concentrations which we held on trading account, but which we did not sell to the SNB StabFund. All assets reclassified in this way relate to businesses that we announced at the beginning of October that we were exiting.</p>
          <p>And the chart summarizes the position as reclassified as of the 1st of October 2008's fair values and they represent positions then carried at $15.8 billion in total. In respect to these positions, we took permanent impairment charges in Q4 of $1.2 billion. As I've already mentioned, this was largely related to our exposure to LyondellBasell.</p>
          <p>Now, if reclassification had not occurred, a trading loss of $4.2 billion would have been incurred in Q4. And that represents the difference between the opening fair value, the $15.8 billion and the closing fair value of 11.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Taking into account the 1.2 billion impairment charge and about $300 million of interest income that accrued in the quarter on the reclassified loans, the Group's pre-tax operating profit for the fourth quarter would have been $3.2 billion lower had the reclassification not occurred.</p>
          <p>Now turning briefly to the divisional performance, Global Wealth Management and Business Banking recorded pre-tax profits that were down 7% quarter-on-quarter. And that excludes the net impact of the reclassification of the auction rate securities to a derivative held at fair value.</p>
          <p>On the same basis, the revenues were down 10% reflecting lower client asset balances and lower client activity levels. Excluding the ARS provision, expenses fell 11% mainly as a result of lower bonus accruals. Credit losses from collateral shortfalls against Lombard lending amounted to CHF 370 million in the quarter. These losses were concentrated in October and November as equity and bond markets plummeted. And since that time we've not experienced any further material net losses from Lombard loans.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management International and Switzerland, underlying operating income declined 14% quarter-on-quarter or 27% after charges for credit losses of CHF 362 million. Expenses were managed down by 20%. The gross margin at 93 basis points fell 2 basis points on the corresponding third quarter figure. Lombard lending balances fell by 16 billion in the quarter contributing to net new money outflows of 58.3 billion.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management US, pre-tax profits were up 30% in Swiss francs on the third quarter excluding the additional ARS provision. The business had net new money inflows of over CHF 4 billion in Q4 aided by the recruitment of almost 400 new financial advisors.</p>
          <p>In Business Banking underlying results were stable. The reported numbers here are flattered somewhat by gains of around about CHF 100 million on certain equity participations. We saw minor credit recoveries in the quarter, so the slowdown in the Swiss economy has not yet made itself felt on the figures.</p>
          <p>Results in Global Asset Management reflect lower balances of invested assets feeding through to lower fee income. This effect was offset by significant reductions in personnel expenses. The division reported a cost income ratio of 50.6%, which compares very favorably with the industry peer group. Inflows into money market funds have been strong and continue to be strong into January. None of the division's 2a-7 funds in the US and none of the other core money market funds broke the buck, i.e. fell below par value in Q4.</p>
          <p>The Investment Bank's adjusted pre-tax loss was 4.5 billion francs. This is after taking into account the significant items that I covered at the beginning of the presentation. We experienced losses in both of our remaining risk concentration categories, credit loss expenses totaling 1.9 billion francs including 1.2 billion francs now leveraged to finance exposures, and 2.3 billion francs of increased CVAs on our monoline exposures. But the result also reflects weak trading performances in all of the client facing businesses, with the exception of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Total personnel expenses fell by 72% quarter on quarter to 293 million, reflecting restructuring charges of 435 million and a substantial reversal of bonus accruals.</p>
          <p>This I promise you is my final slide. I have provided here a reconciliation of the performance of the IB's business areas to the Group adjusted operating income where the contribution from the IB was negative revenues of CHF 3.688 billion. Investment Banking generated adjusted operating income of CHF 417 million, this was principally the result of a decline in advisory revenue in lower market volumes, and in debt Capital Markets also of lower market volumes. Elsewhere in the Investment Bank credit loss expenses in the fourth quarter were CHF 610 million excluding any benefit from credit hedges. The losses were mainly driven by new allowances on real estate loan provisions -- positions and securities financing transactions.</p>
          <p>Equities recorded adjusted trading income of positive 156 million significantly lower than in the prior quarter. We saw negative derivatives revenues across all regions, negative equity linked revenues, falling volumes in the cash market and a decline in commission income in Asia and Europe.</p>
          <p>The FX and money markets business on the other hand had a strong quarter with revenues only slightly down on the record third quarter. Elsewhere in fixed income, however, trading results were poor such that the net trading revenues for the business as a whole were negative CHF 2.3 billion.</p>
          <p>And that concludes my presentation on the fourth quarter results. And so with that I'd like to hand over to Jerker.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As John has covered, the fourth quarter was a difficult and disappointing quarter in a difficult and disappointing year for the Investment Bank. This is true for all our constituencies, our shareholders, our clients and our employees. Compared to most of our competitors, we were hit early and as a result we took actions early. Now three core strengths sustained the Investment Bank through this very difficult time; our client focus and strength of our client relationships, our global platform, and lastly the strength we derived from being part of the UBS Group.</p>
          <p>Now despite the challenges of the past year, there are a number of achievements which should not be overlooked. These include having the number one cash equity business with a global market share of over 11%, in other words more than one in every 9 shares traded around the globe is traded by UBS. During the year, we had the best position ever in global M&amp;A where we are now top five and our Investment Banking business was ranked top three in some of our key markets including Asia, UK and Switzerland. And lastly our foreign exchange business had a record year in terms of revenues and profits and we consolidated our number two position globally.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to turn to the work we've done in putting in place the structure for the new Investment Bank. Together with the Board of Directors and the Group management we have completed an extensive review of the business and articulated the type of investment bank that we want to be. We have three guiding principles in designing our new investment bank. Our business must be manageable, it must be fundable and it must be profitable. And with all the hard work we did last year we now have an Investment Bank which is delivering based on these three principles and I will now discuss each in a little bit more detail.</p>
          <p>I would like to start with what we mean by manageable. Let us look at the recent reorganization of Fixed Income. Making our business model less complex was the key driver behind the changes we made. Our old product groups sat in silos, were complex and were predominately trading rather than client focused.</p>
          <p>Our new and less complex model preserves and builds on our core strength and client franchises. We've down sized or exited businesses with excessive risk and/or balance sheet usage. We've sold our commodity business excluding precious metals, which will continue to be an important part of our macro business, and have announced our exit from municipal securities, prop trading, real estate and securitization and exotic structured products. The repositioning group contains position from legacy or closed operations and this group also includes the residual position from our earlier established workout group.</p>
          <p>As previously announced we've recruited two new co-heads of our Global Fixed Income business Carsten Kengeter and Jeff Mayer. And under their leadership, we have built an entirely new management team in Fixed Income, which has also given us the opportunity to bring up the next generation of leaders from within UBS. And with this new structure, we have a sustainably profitable client focused Fixed Income business.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to discuss what it means to be fundable. We have streamlined our business and dramatically reduced our balance sheet usage and risk. Now first, let's look at the UBS trading portfolio. Year-on-year the Group trading portfolio is down over 60% from CHF 774 billion to CHF 312 billion, and that's in all trading products. The quarter-on-quarter reduction of the trading portfolio assets accelerated as we went through the year and in the fourth quarter it was down by 32%. Now in that fourth quarter debt instruments were down by CHF 92 billion, equity instruments by 39 billion, traded loans by 9 billion and lastly precious metals by 5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now the majority of the decrease was related to the Investment Bank's overall balance sheet, but it also included the initial 16.4 billion asset transfer of our liquid and other assets to the Swiss National Bank. In terms of risk weighted assets, they are down 13% year-on-year and we are targeting a similar reduction for 2009. Now John described accurately how difficult it is to manage this number, but it is the target that we have set for ourselves.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to internal funding. In the past, the Investment Bank enjoyed the benefit of funding from Group at below market rates. This is no longer the case. We now pay market rates for all our funding. Now in the past the substantial part of the Investment Bank's balance sheet was funded by excess funds available from other parts of UBS. Reducing the Investment Bank's balance sheet has continuously reduced the need for the internal funding sources and as a result we are currently at the lowest level ever of such internal funding. Year-on-year this was reduced by 72%. Now being fundable means that we want to reduce the internal funding to zero. And we are targeting to achieve this goal during 2009. Year to date in 2009 we are already well underway towards that goal.</p>
          <p>In summary, we want the Investment Bank to have a funding structure which is based on its own business portfolio, while benefiting from the strength of the overall UBS Group.</p>
          <p>Lastly, reduction of head count, at the end of 2008 we had reduced head count by approximately a quarter from the peak in the third quarter of 2007. Today we are announcing additional head count reduction. The aim is to bring head count down to 15,000 by the end of 2009 with most of this reduction communicating by the end of the first quarter. This target excludes approximately 500 employees dedicated to the repositioning group which number is expected to decline over time.</p>
          <p>Now we believe that the hard work in terms of head count reduction will now be behind us and that 15,000 is the right staffing level for our new Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>Now let's now talk about the business mix that will bring us back to profitability. Our goal is to be top three in all of the businesses we are focusing on. We are already there in a number of them. Our business portfolio is centered on flow products such as cash equities where we have the leading market share, Foreign Exchange, where we are ranked number two and lastly rates, flow credit and derivatives, where we can provide our clients with the most comprehensive product offering of any of our competitors.</p>
          <p>In Advisory we are providing our corporate and institutional clients with an M&amp;A product which is ranked higher than ever before. And in Capital Markets, we continue to act for our clients both as underwriter and provider of financing. And lastly in structured product, we are simplifying our business and are now focusing on cross asset class offering for our own Wealth Management clients and to other private banks.</p>
          <p>The aim of all these actions is to get the optimal balance between profits, risk and balance sheet utilization. In conclusion, we now have an Investment Bank which is manageable in terms of the scope and the complexity of our business, it's fundable in terms of balance sheet usage, and it's operating at good profitability consistent with our goal of returning to profitability for the full year 2009.</p>
          <p>I now turn the presentation back to Marcel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Jerker. With our new Investment Bank and the new structure for Wealth Management and our Swiss business we are able to operate in a very difficult and challenging environment. We have first broadened our leadership team and I'm very pleased to have Franco Morra and Juerg Zeltner joining our Group Executive Board and I congratulate them with their appointments. I'm confident that they will successfully navigate their business through the changes ahead.</p>
          <p>My thanks and my deep appreciation goes to all our staff around the world for their loyalty and commitment during the most difficult times. We have worked hard to address our challenges and I can confidently say that we made substantial progress on all fronts. Our businesses are well positioned for a challenging future. Our net asset outflows are coming to a halt. We had an encouraging start into the New Year, but the environment will remain very difficult and volatile as the real economy has not seen the worst yet.</p>
          <p>With this, I conclude our presentation and I open now the question-and-answer session by taking first questions from the telephone audience and then from the audience in the room. Thank you very much.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question from the telephone is from Mr. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I have a few questions. The first one is related to tier 1 movements, I was wondering if you could go back to slide 22 and you could run through it in a little bit more detail. I'm also very interested in your FX impact on risk-weighted assets, the option value with the SNB in your tier 1, and how much the additional $22.7 billion of assets that you will reduce, will have an impact on your risk-weighted assets in the first quarter?</p>
          <p>The second question is on Note 16.B which is related to the US cross-border litigation issues, if you could give any timing issues as well as any additional color on how this litigation is progressing, especially in light of your litigation provisions not increasing. And the third question is on Lombard lending, the provisions you take, could you explain to me the rationale for the provision as I assume you could have done further margin costs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me just start with two and three and then I'll hand over to John for all the capital movements and all these issues. First of all, on the cross-border case, same as we previously reported. UBS is continuing to work very diligently towards an appropriate and also mutually satisfactory resolution of the US government's and the DoJ's ongoing investigation of our UBS cross-border business. That's all we can currently comment on this issue.</p>
          <p>On Lombard lending, it is a very straightforward point. We obviously do have margin calls but if there is a drop in prices and be complete illiquidity, this market &#x2013; this proceed should essentially lead to uncovered balances and that's why these 370 million concentrated in October and November. That's what the remaining balances are. Part of that will obviously recover over time. We do not know exactly how much of that and when it comes back because clients will cover these losses with new assets. Or we can work out the position where we have kept the assets and leave it at the low level and wait for recoveries.</p>
          <p>There are various ways how you can work out. But this is just essentially taking that amount of money which is uncovered now between the lending balances and the value of the underlying assets into a provision. And this is also why it has not repeated anymore. Now as you have heard, the total Lombard balances have reduced by 18 billion and this in itself has reduced entire portfolio exposure considerably. So, in order to get to the underlying earning power we can almost now add it back in to the revenue number to see what the profitability level of the business is.</p>
          <p>Now, on capital movements and slide 22.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Kian, we've got slide 22 up on the screen. If I just walk you down the Tier 1 capital then the risk weighted assets, the 8.1 billion should be non-controversial, it's the Group attributable results. Within that though there are some own credit issues. There is an own credit item in relation to the fair valuation of existing liabilities. There is also a movement for the MCN, so when you look at the number within the 8.1 that's attributable to the SNB transaction, there's an element of own credit in the revaluation of the MCN. That's included in the 1.3, so that's mostly own credit within the MCN issue. And then most of the other is attributable to Forex losses on our capital position.</p>
          <p>The 17 -- moving over to the risk weighted asset column, the 17 billion is clearly just the sale of assets for cash. So, these were assets that were largely on our banking books, some trading assets, and they just sold for cash. So that reduces risk weighted assets. The market risk is a combination of two things. It's mainly a reduction in volumes, because our regulatory VaR which feeds through to the multiplier and our backtesting exceptions you will have seen went up. So the market risk is just a function of reduced volumes, and then the risk weighted asset reduction is partly the result of the dedicated attempts in the Investment Bank to reduce risk, and there's also an element of foreign exchange movement that's in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the remaining balances of the SNB transaction that's already included in the --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The remaining balances, the way we treat the SNB transaction is that we've deemed, the sale has actually taken place, it went unconditional when we received shareholder approval to issue the MCNs. And what you may be confusing it with is actually closing these tranches, we call them internally waves of assets. And we sent over the first wave, which was predominantly the cash type of assets and that closed on the 16th of December. There's a second or third -- and maybe third wave which would be the more derivative based assets.</p>
          <p>Those transfer across later this quarter, but the sale has actually taken place. This is really just a transfer to these SNBs custodian which is Northern Trust. So that has not happened in relation to the derivative assets yet, but the sale took place and to reflect that we have what is effectively in technical terms a total return swap with the SNB, to pass over the benefits and the disadvantages of the relative -- the assets in the fund to the SNB as of the date the deal was struck, which is as of the 31st of September 2008.</p>
          <p>So the deal has actually happened in its entirety, simply what hasn't happened is that that has not been recorded yet in the books of the SNBs fund.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Jon Peace, Nomura. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi morning everybody. I have two questions please. The first one is on the net new money in the private bank, I just wanted to understand what the normal seasonality is in that business on a monthly basis, in other words, how much of the improvement is your turnaround of the franchise versus seasonality and do you think you'll be able to maintain this positive inflow in January through the rest of the quarter?</p>
          <p>The second question's just related to trying to get a better understanding of the profitability of the Investment Bank. I see that you still have a little over 100% of your tangible equity allocated to that business. The risk-weighted assets you're saying will only come down by about 10%. Do you think in 2009 or 2010, you'll be able to generate let's say around 3 billion of after-tax profitability to cover your cost of equity in that business? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First of all, there was seasonality in the past to what extent seasonality can be detected in the environment we are currently operating, I think is highly questionable. And first of all, we ourselves with our issues, the transaction, the write downs have obviously distorted the normal picture. Secondly, the financial crisis has distorted the normal picture. And thirdly, the de-leveraging which is massive and has never occurred that way has also distorted the picture. For these three reasons, it's very difficult to say what it is.</p>
          <p>When we look at the trends, I think it is obvious we told you what we have seen to the end of January. I'm obviously not making a money forecast now for the quarter, that would be unwise and then our legal department would come and tell me that I should not do that thing. We are very transparent. I think the trend line from October to January is very clear and speaks for itself, and particularly as it relates both to Wealth Management and also the Asset Management business, which is important growth.</p>
          <p>Profitability of the Investment Bank and I said it this morning in a call, we said last year we see 60 billion revenues to operating costs and in a normalized environment. Well that was in March and I think everybody fully agrees that the environment we are now living in is far from normalized. It has continuously deteriorated. It has culminated in the Lehman issue and obviously we all found ourselves in the most difficult of all environments, I think the industry has generally seen in the financial markets.</p>
          <p>And this is why we have reacted so quickly, and Jerker has led you through what that means. And if you actually look at the cost base, the underlying cost base, which is 99.5 billion, this is far below what we said last March. And the reason for that is to be profitable in this extremely challenging and not normalized environment. We do believe that over time we can go back to these profitability levels which we have seen, but this will take considerable amount of time and then we will also see pre-tax or post-tax profit numbers in the order of magnitude have seen, also with smaller equity portion. Jerker, you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that the Investment Bank is totally focused on getting back to profitability during this year, and then to get back to a position where we can then grow our business going forward with the new architecture that I outlined in my presentation. And I think that getting back to profitability in itself is going to have a lot of good coming with it, both internally and externally. And that's why we are so focused on that target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, can I just make a quick point in relation to our equity position. The total equity as at the end of the fourth quarter was 42 billion, and had 13 billion of goodwill. But what you need to take into account and I should have probably mentioned this in my presentation, is that the MCN that we issued in December is held as a combination of debt and negative replacement value in our balance sheet, and that's unlike the first MCN.</p>
          <p>The first MCN became an equity instrument for IFRS purposes, when after the rights issue it became convertible into a fixed number of shares. The MCN to the Swiss Confederation is still convertible into a variable number of shares and that therefore booked in the balance sheet outside of equity. And so, to get from our total equity to our tier 1, you need to add back the 6 billion of MCN and then the allocated equity to the Investment Bank which is 26 billion isn't 100% of our tangible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Elad Ben-Am, Bank am Bellevue. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I have three questions please. First of all, on your decision to reduce the amount to be transferred to the SNB funds, could you elaborate a little bit on your rationale behind that and why you decided to reduce this amount?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the goodwill, I remember after Q3 you indicated that there might be a goodwill charge in Q4, now it looks like there was no charge, what are the reasons for that?</p>
          <p>And the third question is if I look at the level of employees, you have now around, as are the management which are broadly in line with your 2004 levels, but you still have some 50% more employees. Even if you reduce it to the 75,000 you are aiming for, it's still some 11% higher. Now I appreciate it's a simplified way of looking at it, but my question would be are these 75,000 employees a level you would feel comfortable with going forward, or do you think there is more potential to reduce this number? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll do one and three and then I'll hand over to John for the second question. On employees, yes, we do feel that what we know and how we see the current environment that 75,000 is the right size for our Group. That's how we want to position ourselves for the future. You have seen that we believe that this returns the IB to profitability. We also believe that this does not reduce our capacity in Wealth Management which we want to retain for the recovery whenever it comes. We continue to work to increase efficiency strongly. This is an efficiency point, that was one of the points why we actually have reorganized ourselves, and that's why there are also some reductions to come as previously announced on the Wealth Management side.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Swiss National Bank transaction, there are two reasons. First of all the purpose of the transaction was the stability in the financial market and for UBS. We have analyzed this situation and asked the substance of this paper is government-guaranteed strong paper. It enables us if we hold them to maturity to no longer utilize the facility of Swiss National Bank to achieve that goal. So, we feel comfortable holding these assets. We have taken an additional 600 million provision to be on the safe side with everything, we have already provided at the beginning of Q2.</p>
          <p>We have then subjected them to a very detailed cash flow and fundamental based analysis of what their carrying value is. And we feel very comfortable in holding these securities with a positive carry actually to maturity. And that's why it was no longer required to put them into the fund which has -- because we can solve the problem with these additional provisions ourselves and do not need to burden the Swiss national stabilization funds in this new paradigm. And the same is true for on the underlying monoline related assets which we also don't need to transfer. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on goodwill the answer is simply that the way that we assess goodwill is the standard way of designating a number of so-called cash generating units within the Group. And some time ago we designated the entire Investment Bank as a cash generating unit and that means in assessing it, the goodwill we carry against the Investment Bank which is CHF 4.3 billion at the end of Q4, we need to look at the future profitability of the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>And when we take into account the changes that Jerker has introduced, the reason he is introducing them is obviously because it improves the Investment Bank and we see a profitable business going forward. And the present value of those future profit streams and cash flows more than supports the maintenance of that balance of goodwill against the unit. So it's as simple as that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Chris Wheeler from MainFirst Bank. Couple of questions, again back on the SNB transaction, first of all, could you just confirm whether or not the level three assets you disclosed take into account the whole of the value of the assets you intend to transfer or whether we still have the 22.7 billion to take effect in one form or another? And similarly just to confirm that those risk-weighted assets do include the whole of the transfer you're planning? That's the first question on the SNB.</p>
          <p>The second question is, you obviously had this $1 billion first profit piece that the vehicle had, given that you're transferring in less assets, have you renegotiated any other terms of the transaction or are they as very much dated back in the autumn?</p>
          <p>And then perhaps moving on to Wealth Management, a couple of quick points. If we look at your Swiss business it's clear that I think in the first nine months of the year, you had 8% outflows in terms of your annualized outflows compared to invested assets. That's gone up to 13% for the year as a whole. Can you perhaps give us some clue as to whether that has also calmed down during the latter part of last year and January this year?</p>
          <p>And then finally perhaps, you've mentioned the word scale two or times in talking about the US operation. You are now one-third the size of your two biggest rivals, following the two mergers that you discussed. Clearly you have had the benefit of picking up good people I am sure and picking up money. But in terms of the long-term view on that, you have been very firm for the last five years that scale is what matters and you are now actually not a scale player compared to the biggest players, could you perhaps comment on that? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Let me just, to all, I mean Swiss National Bank is clear, everything is fully accounted for so it's off level three and it's off risk-weighted assets. So I can confirm that point. And the terms are the same terms, so we provide exactly the same 10% first loss protection as we have agreed. Simply the green shoe is potential additional assets, which we do no longer require plus the one student loans position, which was in there. That's all it is.</p>
          <p>And then on Wealth Management business, yes you are right in terms of the percentage amount. That's obviously a reflection of our challenges in this country. At the same time I can reassure that they clearly have calmed down considerably in line with the trend, slower than the rest of the world, but the trend line is the same.</p>
          <p>And then the issue on the US, well, you're right, that's what we always wanted to do and we still want to do. Unfortunately, the one in a thousand year financial crisis came in between and that doesn't mean that we now no longer would have that objective and goal of creating scale. And yes it is a fact that the industry has rearranged and we obviously observed that closely, at the same time it is also clear that it allows our very independently positioned buy-side driven Wealth Management businesses to show its competitive advantages and strengths against the rest of this very large unit. And as we have shown this has also enabled us to attract quite good people and that's how we want to continue to build and grow that business. Yes please, over there.</p>

          <p>Kilian Maier, NZB Neue Z&#xFC;rcher Bank. It's on Wealth Management International and Switzerland, you lost 182 client advisors, that's of course a net figure. Can you elaborate a little bit on the gross figure? And probably also your view on full year '09, what do you expect in that respect?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do expect that number to be approximately stable. The gross number we have said last time and previous quarters that we had roughly constant fluctuation rates, now they are maybe two percentage point higher. At the same time we also had a situation where we obviously lost assets and clients. So that enables us to optimize the business that's particularly true in Switzerland, where we have made sure that we have the same ratios in terms of client advisor and the capacity we allocate. And for 2009, I would say that's a roughly constant number with minor fluctuations. Now, you had a question over there?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Huw van Steenis, Morgan Stanley. Firstly, the impairment of the loan book in the Investment Bank went up from 1% to 3%. I'm assuming this is the leverage loans being transferred, but I just wondered if you could clarify that, and the coverage ratio seemed to slip to 62%, are you comfortable with that level?</p>
          <p>And then secondly and relatedly, the difference between the fair value and book value for the leverage loans is remarkably high. Could you clarify if there are any residual Lyondell exposures at the yearend or rather are there other positions we should be concerned about?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly on monolines, given you have chosen to retain the monoline exposure, should we assume you still expect to have a commutation process this year, and what sort of -- any color in terms of your outlook there, because I think we were all surprised that you haven't chosen to pass that on to the Swiss state? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on monolines, it's important to know that we obviously have a contract which we actually can't, and pass it on to the Swiss state means only the underlying assets, but obviously not the other ones. The underlying assets, we feel in our case are extremely low valued, which obviously effects in the fair value of the credit default swap against which we have taken another 2 billion. So we think we are very highly provided already for this, and obviously we are in discussions even when they play -- they take place to commute some of these trades. We have actually done so in one case, very successful equity at that level which we had it valued, and we will see how this development goes on.</p>
          <p>But of course if you take the fair value of the swap and if you take our provision the difference is 5 billion. The fair value is 12, we've provided seven and the difference is five and that's why we are showing this exposure. But the option related to the underlying exposure and once we hold the underlying exposure at the current value, especially where you have high grade CLOs valued at 70 points or something like that then we feel very comfortable to actually hold these loan exposures to maturity.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; we obviously have a remaining LyondellBasell exposure because we were part in the restructuring transaction and have provided for this in a --</p>

          <p>Yes hello, it's Teresa Nielsen from Bank Vontobel. I have my first question, it's on the SNB transaction. I've seen that there is a 309 million price differences on securities sold. I was wondering where these are coming from because as I believe that the price was fixed in September 2008?</p>
          <p>My second question is regarding your loan exposure to Russia, if you have a number, how much loan exposure you have to Russia?</p>
          <p>And my third question is non-performing loans to total loans, if you can give some guidance to how much you expect this to rise in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on the SNB valuation transaction procedure, there was a very strict valuation procedure where we created groups of assets and were then subject to an independent verification. And should such an independent verification have a slight negative, it goes to the benefit of the Swiss National Bank. If there is a slight positive, it does not go to our benefit. So it's always the slight negative.</p>
          <p>And you see that's less than 2% of the total value of the assets, which is basically confirming the valuation as we had them for the stake in the slight negative deviations which can come through that process. These are in parts very liquid assets, very hard to value, very wide bid offers, but this was a mechanism to protect obviously the Swiss National Bank in taking the stabilization fund and taking them over. Loan exposure to Russia is not material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the only guidance I can give you is ancient history. In the '07 annual report we gave a number of 1.6 billion as the loan exposure to emerging Europe. So it'll be a subset of that, but other than that, I have nothing new.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Non-performing loans to total loans, I think it is important to view our credit portfolio in the two major markets. One is the take and hold exposure which we have in the Investment Bank, and the other one is the Swiss loan book which is predominantly a mortgage portfolio, largely residential than commercial and it has the underlying corporate loans. And for these, as we said at the moment an economic downturn has not materialized, should that come, we will clearly see a pickup, a channeling of the loan portfolios of extraordinarily good quality across the board. So we would not see a very large pickup there. And then the same is actually true for the Investment Bank where we feel comfortable with the take and hold exposures as we currently have them.</p>

          <p>And the other thing is the level of profitability in the medium term besides your goals of 2009, what do you expect on the UBS -- for the US as a satisfying level of profitability in the medium term? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have never sent any unclear signals. We have seen that some other people have sent some signals, but it was not us. We were always very clear about the business, our commitment to the business and where we want to grow it. That's clearly the case.</p>
          <p>In medium term, it has to grow to a 20% margin as everybody else who has scale, but we recognize the fact that we are obviously substantially delayed through all the challenges we had at the beginning of the year where we suffered from being an outlier among the competition in terms of the issues we had. We has a reverse due to very fundamental industry changes, but generally the asset level dropped due to the crisis and it will just delay the process to get there, but it is still our clear objective that with sufficient scale we will get to 20% margin. Yes?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may. One is on US Wealth Management, if I remember correctly there was a target of trying to reach, I think it was a trillion in invested assets. I saw the Q3 figures, you were just below 800 million. I'm just wondering whether this target of one trillion is still there? When are you planning to achieve it and are you just going to achieve that by acquiring client advisors as you're doing now?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on this, let's say lawsuit, which relates to your role as a custodian bank in some Luxembourg based funds and this is all related to the Madoff scandal and I'm just wondering whether you see any risk of material impact from that particular lawsuit? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all on the lawsuit, no we don't because we think it is crystal clear from our perspective what the role was and what it wasn't. And with respect to the asset base, yes one trillion is what we felt is what you need to achieve a 20% net margin in this business. And if you look at the asset-based fluctuation, what essentially happened is that we have a year where we lost a bit of assets from outflow, not materially given the whole asset base, but the asset base itself as everywhere else dropped by 20, 25% due to the market fluctuations.</p>
          <p>And this has basically delayed the achievement of that level and now you can make forecast of what do you expect the asset base to grow and what do we expect the net new money number to come in. If it's once normalized and then you put that these two things together and you add it up year by year, and then you see that is probably roughly again from where we are a three year plus, minus period to get there, depending on the market development, it's essentially what was in 2006 when we stated this target. The asset base is pretty much where it was when we put it together.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, three quick questions please, firstly, I just wanted to come back on to the private banking discussion maybe in a slightly different way. Do your conversations with clients confirm the trends shown in your chart i.e., that the period of outflows is now substantively behind us? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, could you give an indication of how many clients were involved in the Lombard loan losses, is that one oligarch or is that a series of smaller losses across multiple clients?</p>
          <p>And then finally on the self-funding of the Investment Bank, presumably when the Investment Bank funded itself externally it benefits from parent group support. Does it pay the parent group a market price for that support?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will pass the funding then to John, well, it actually does, that's the whole point. In the old days we obviously had an advantage because we funded very cheaply, now this funding advantage does no longer exist when you look at the price we have to pay. In that sense, any of this internal mismatch has gone away, but even if we would return to much more lower levels then we would have a -- the cash curve of UBS with no cross subsidy utilized to fund the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>No it's not one oligarch, what we can say it is concentrated in Asia because in Asia we had a much higher portion of Lombard lending and it is distributed to a few, maybe two, three handful of cases altogether. Now the conversation is clients look, this is a very diverse picture and of course it is way too early to say anything and we have to work very, very hard to confirm each and every step of progress we make. But when we look at various indicators, assets, fiduciary deposits, client deposits and when we compare them over the past six months, we see a very clear strong case that measures taken, predominately in October with the transaction and thereafter, have had a very positive effect and continue to return the clients to UBS.</p>
          <p>I will not say that this is all over unless we have been able to establish a clear dependable track record of inflows. It's way too early now, but that's obviously what we are committed to. We are encouraged by what we see. It gives us the motivation to work even harder with our clients to bring it back. But it is obvious that after such a bad quarter and now a strong trend over four months that this is too early to say that we really know where it all goes, but I think it's an encouraging and very positive sign into the right direction.</p>

Couple of questions, firstly on your IFRS shareholders equity base, I'm just wondering if you could give us a figure for what it would be on a look through basis, so once the mandatory converts, say if we assume no further price movement in the UBS share price? Just wanted to see if we should just be adding 6 billion to the 34 billion figure at the end of the year, or if there are further adjustments that should be making to reflect the derivatives accounting?</p>
          <p>Second question, just whether you calculate a US GAAP total assets figure. Presumably it's somewhat similar to the Swiss GAAP total assets figure? Any thoughts or figures there would be appreciated.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, on Investment Banking targets, this time last year you were talking about a four billion pre-tax profit target in normalized markets. Clearly, markets haven't normalized yet, but just wondering how that will have been adjusted down for changes in ambition since then? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the MCN issue, the 6 billion is in the bank and that's the amount against which we ultimately issue shares. At the moment, Swiss Confederation is locked up until the second week of June, then they have the right to convert. And the only outstanding issue is the question of how many shares they convert into, which is a function of our share price.</p>

          <p>US GAAP, Swiss GAAP replacement value are practically the same. They are very close. We have shown you the Swiss GAAP numbers you can assume that this balance sheet will be largely the same under it.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as you mentioned this was a target that we used at the beginning of last year and the world has changed quite materially. I would say though that the new Investment Bank that we now have in place over the medium to longer term can still achieve that kind of profitability and that would very be a target that we have. But it's a much longer term target than what it was previously.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I actually have two questions. This morning there was some news on the tape that EU Commissioner McCreevy was stating that the 30:1 leverage ratio which banks have operated is a thing of the past. And so if you read into those comments perhaps the EU goes the way of Switzerland and adopts a leverage ratio, but certainly 30:1 is a thing of the past, they would have a much higher required leverage i.e., 4% or something. In that environment given that Switzerland's always been very proud of its banks, capitalizations, and the safety of its balance sheets et cetera, what kind of probability do you put on Switzerland changing the 2013 requirements, maybe you can give us some insight there?</p>
          <p>And then just a follow-up on, I guess it was Jeremy's question earlier on, the cost of capital charged to the Investment Bank, and I understand that your parent company is not funding as cheaply as it use to be and whatnot. But can you just talk us how you -- talk us through how you calculate, what is the appropriate cost of capital for a standalone Investment Bank, since they seem to have gone the way of the dinosaur here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure this is a dinosaur, I think it's the future, so there will more dinosaurs come to follow. We do -- we have a risk adjusted cost of equity framework internally where we -- whereby we calculate what we believe are the appropriate hurdle rates for all the various businesses, and based on last year's plan that was 13.4% for the IB as a whole. I do believe that this is coming to drop because we actually have less risk, less leverage and therefore the hurdle rate needs to come down a bit.</p>
          <p>And then on the leverage ratio and how it develops, I think we have always said from the outset that we do acknowledge that we had too high a leverage, that's why we have very substantially reduced our balance sheet and that's why we always felt that we are aligned with the notion that in order to return confidence to the financial system we will need more capital and we need also an agreement that leverage can't grow indefinitely. That's why we felt that we are aligned with the Swiss regulatory authorities who spearheaded this very, very early in the process.</p>
          <p>As in Switzerland, it was obvious that one has to be careful not to create an instrument which then puts a restriction on the very fundamental activity of bank, of lending money. And I think that's the dilemma everybody is in here now. On the one-hand strength in balance sheets needs to return, on the other-hand nobody wants to undermine the abilities of the banks to lend money. And I think all the regulatory authorities around the world will strike a careful balance between these two objectives of achieving more capital, lower leverage but not undermining the very fundamental purpose of the banking system in funding the economy. I do expect that we will find global consistency because I think the regulatory authorities around the world are highly committed to come up with consistent regulation around the world.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I apologize in advance for a couple of technical questions. Firstly, I just want to understand the reclassification of the monoline exposure and how it is then treated in your monoline disclosure on slide 44? My previous understanding was consistent that you cannot transfer it to a bad bank, but I also understand that you could not transfer it to the loan book. So, I wonder if you could just give me a little bit to understand that?</p>
          <p>And secondly to come back to the shareholders' equity question, you may have already explained this, but I'm trying to understand the 3.6 billion decline in the share premium related to the MCNs placed with the Swiss Confederation, and how we should treat that in relation to looking at a pro forma shareholders' equity? I think so far you've said we add 6 billion to the reported number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On monolines first, everything which is a derivative comp we reclassified, and that means only a part of the underlying assets which are actually securities can be reclassified and held for sale. And as I said, this refers predominately to collateralized loan obligations of very high quality which we feel are appropriate to do so. And the rest are either synthetic CLO underlying which is a derivative contract and of course the monoline insurance contract itself, which is a credit default swap, cannot be reclassified and has to be treated under fair value accounting, which we did.</p>
          <p>So what you see on the table is the underlying &#x2013; it's the underlying exposure, exactly consistent with what we did before, where we have securities underlying. We would hold these underlying at their carrying value on a loans and receivables basis. Shareholder equity?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way the MCN was accounted for was that it was deemed by and large, a compound financial instrument with a debt host <mark type="audio gap" /> complicated. And the postings on inception of that are to debit the cash account with the 6 billion we get in. And then a debt component is set up which is the carrying value of the liability. Now because the coupon is quite high, you have to split the coupon between debt and an equity component and that has an implied debt component of 7.733 billion. So you credit debt with 7.733.</p>
          <p>You then have to take the derivative component which is the option &#x2013; or the two options within the MCN, because it has a booster option and a conversion option. And that's booked in negative replacement values, and that was 1.425 billion, also a credit. And the debit is the remaining equity component and that's the debit that goes to share premium pending the issue of the shares. And that was a debit of 3.158 billion. Now when the shares are issued, you credit share premium and credit share capital. And that will back out that share premium amount.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, two questions if possible, in the past you've talked about running with a very large liquidity buffer in the Investment Bank which has hurt fixed income. And I think in the last call you said it was costing you about 100 basis points. I wondered if you could talk about whether you brought liquidity buffer down, and whether you're making more money on that in 2009, because of where the yield curve is, so to what extent that will help fixed income?</p>
          <p>And then the second is on the gross margin in the private bank where it -- I think recurring has gone down to 70 bps. Do you think that that's actually somewhat inflated because of the timing of the assets coming down, so the underlying margins are even worse, and do you think that could get worse before they get better? Because I think you were pretty negative on the margin outlook previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah first of all what was the one, the...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The liquidity buffer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Liquidity buffer, point is, yes it's still around 100 basis points and actually it has increased, has become bigger. And we remain very, very cautious and continue to carry very, very large liquidity up until the point we really feel that stability has returned into the financial markets. And so far it will obviously cost us money, but we believe it's money well spent. It will not be part of the fixed income result going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just come back to why it's still costing so much? Because I thought the yield curve had slightly flattened, or is it just the duration, you've got some duration --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the gross margin, you have an effect. Obviously you're right, delaying that, because it's based on monthly, mid month or end of month averages when we calculate the fees. But at the same time you have seen currency movements in our favor which create a positive fluctuation so we are not particularly negative on a gross margin outlook from where we currently are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you explain &#x2013; I meant to ask as well in terms of the structure of the assets, so one issue is deleveraging but in terms of clients moving out of more complicated high margin products, do you think we've now at 10% of assets from 20, have we got there in terms of derisking?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look it's hard to say. A lot of that has already happened because people that are moving out of discretionary products were redeeming complex products, are using structured products less frequently and we clearly see that as a result of the crisis that this has had an impact. To what extent this might continue or not, I think we have seen a very substantial part of that happening in last year and would not expect a very substantial continuation of that trend from the current levels.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. My question is basically related to your inflows in January, you said that you've reversed the trend last month, so maybe you could just give us a slight outlook of what you expect the next months to be, and what you've done in January to actually reverse the trend has been quite dramatic in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are not going to comment on post January, that's what we said. But looking at it is never an action in one month which triggers money in the same month. This is always lagging many, many actions cumulative effect of all the actions we take, and what you actually see is there was this massive uncertainty but there was a very drastic and substantial action in October which has essentially demonstrated that the bank is sound and safe, and this has brought back the trust of clients in this very difficult time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when you say trust of clients, do you refer both to wealthy clients and as well as retail clients in Switzerland. Have you seen...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I could say that it will take us longer to regain the trust and confidence of our retail clients in Switzerland. That's clearly a longer-term issue and part of what we have done in terms of reorganizing ourselves should help actually accomplish that.</p>
          <p>Now, thank you very much and we now have more questions from the audience here. I have seen Mr. <mark type="inaudible" /> you had a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to ask, for those of us who are not very familiar with these accounting tricks about the regulatory basis of this reclassification. If I have understood this correctly you can just decide that you want to hold to majority a position that was a trading position before, and then forget about valuation at the market price and put in just whatever value your specialists believe.</p>
          <p>Now if this is correct, my second question is why haven't you done this before and spared us all these horrible figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thanks for the question. It's actually not that we can just put in the value we wanted. There are very important conditions which need to be met. First of all these are businesses which we exit, so there is no longer any trading.</p>
          <p>And secondly there is also no market, which provides you really with any reliable value in a very liquid environment. You can, however, only do that at the value we had it on the book. So we can't put a different value than the one we actually had on the 30th of September on our book, that's the value at which it's transferred.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly you then have to verify if this carrying value is supported by the underlying asset. So you made actually a fundamental analysis the way you would do it in a credit impairment test. So is it likely that all of these -- of the value at which we hold it will actually be returned over the lifetime of the instrument through the cash flows.</p>
          <p>And that's very thoroughly vetted but that's what we have to done in a very, very thorough procedure. Why did we not do that before? Because only on the 13th of October, the International Accounting Standard Board has actually allowed a financial institution under IFRS to apply these options and under these very restrictive conditions, in order to exactly not do what you implied in the question that you could put on &#x2013; a specialist could just put on a value. That's not what is possible in this procedure. Yes, last question over there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question on the SNB transaction again, you're now transferring less assets to the SNB and it looks like you're keeping the higher quality assets. The 10% rule of underlying equity hasn't changed, for me that looks like the deal has become a little bit more attractive for UBS, is that a fair assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's an unfair assessment. It is not the case -- as you have seen, we have actually taken 600 million additional provisions on these assets, which shows you that we just felt with the treatment we have now chosen to apply, and the additional provisions we have taken, that we can deal with this problem ourselves so to speak and do not need this facility with the Swiss National Bank. That's one thing.</p>
          <p>And secondly, the portfolio is still a diversified portfolio which is not materially affected by that. And thirdly, as you have recognized there is also an underlying monoline exposure, the green shoe, which we have taken back in conjunction with this monoline. So I think the nature of the transaction is exactly the same as it was before with the same purpose and the same risk characteristics.</p>
          <p>Yes, <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Germany you said that you get the <mark type="inaudible" /> of CHF 3 million from the Swiss Confederation. Now as I understand you have here in the income statement you have tax expense minus CHF 6 billion. So, is there another <mark type="inaudible" /> or principally when do you pay tax again in Switzerland? So I think next 10 years or there will be no taxes or what is the horizon here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did and one of the differences this quarter is that it's not just Swiss. In fact we had losses in a number of jurisdictions against which we've taken tax credits. So it's not just Switzerland.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
