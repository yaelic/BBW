          <p>[Foreign Language] Good evening everyone and thank you for attending, once again, the presentation of our performance for 2008. We will give you the figures for 2008 and some idea as to what to expect in 2009. Although there's quite a bit of uncertainty around that. In spite of it all, the performance in 2008 was very good. The press release has been published, revenue is up 4%, organic growth is 7%. You have to see that in 2008 the foreign exchange effect was negative, even though the U.S. dollar went up but overall the effect was down.</p>
          <p>Return from recurring operation is up 2% and we have to remember that we're looking at an already strong performance in 2007. In the third quarter, revenue was up 4% and, since on a number of occasions, and this was pointed out in the past, Louis Vuitton was able to continue its growth and indeed both profitability and revenue. So profitability up 2% and, on a like-for-like foreign exchange basis, the monetary growth would have been 6% and so that shows the effect of ForEx.</p>
          <p>The operating margin is high, above 21%, and the net income is stable at 2 -- above &#x20AC;2 billion. In the present state of affairs, when we are looking at the financial crisis, banking crisis -- it is not for me to remind you of all these details &#x2013; we're lucky enough to have a sound balance sheet, which of course, gives us room to maneuver in what is after all a difficult environment. And this sound financial base enables us to face a challenging global situation while maintaining our development, our investment and indeed our new launches in products and activities. And of course our Group has displayed its ability to generate profitable growth regardless of the economic context.</p>
          <p>Now, such a sound performance in a context of economic decline, significant economic decline -- of course, the second half of 2008 was something we hadn't seen in the 20 years we've been running this was indeed, indeed before, I think this -- we are looking at the most severe economic crisis since the 1930s and the performance of our Group has shown its ability to respond to what is again a most unfavorable environment.</p>
          <p>Now a few reminders of our main strengths that enable us to pull through. First we have a very good economic or geographic balance between points of revenue. If one country is -- some/swing down, others can pick up, for instance Japan has been sorely tried by the economic activity, by the economic declines, and the business has been experiencing negative growth in Japan, but this was offset by a booming business in the U.S. in 2008. Indeed, not just in the U.S. but also Europe and the rest of Asia, excluding Japan. And so this geographical distribution enables us to balance out the various risk areas.</p>
          <p>Now of course businesses also compensate for one another. Some businesses were more affected by the economic decline than others. For instance, Watches and Jewelry were more severely hurt by the decline than other businesses. Having said that, we should consider that in difficult times some of the stronger brands were able to work through. Some of them, indeed, with big names, were able to reaffirm their leading positions in our brands; we have a number of stars which were able to keep ahead of the game and indeed stay several edges above the competition. The Louis Vuitton brand in itself was able to pursue its truth while many of its competitors are not in such a fortune position.</p>
          <p>Actually at Vuitton, we've launched a number of new collections last year, in particular those lines produced by Marc Jacobs and Richard Prince. We have a new -- aligned with a new artist, whom Marc Jacobs knew quite well, unfortunately he died a few years back, <mark type="inaudible" /> Stephen Sprouse. We have Damier Graphite line, of course, it's the well-known checkerboard pattern in various shades of gray, and new launches with Christian Dior, Dior Homme Sport, Escale a Portofino, Guerlain Homme for Guerlain, so many new launches in 2008.</p>
          <p>The trend, the interesting trend is the growing strength of emerging economies, in particular, China which accounts for a larger and larger share of revenue. Our Group, of course, is entering new Asian territories and emerging territories and of course lots of our revenue growth was in these markets, in particular in China; in 2008, China was the largest market for Cognac Hennessy.</p>
          <p>Now for the year 2008, Sephora was also very dynamic that, the Sephora shops, were number one, they are the number one in Perfumes and Cosmetics in the United States, and they stand out as a single brand, as it were.</p>
          <p>But of course, when the crisis hit us in the second half of 2008, we adapted our costs and of course our retail prices inasmuch as the decentralized structure of the group enabled us to do this. And of course in 2009 we shall try and continue coming out with new products, opening up new shops, while keeping costs down. Of course, what we try and do in these situations is expect the worst, adjust whatever we can for a worst-case scenario, of course, and hope for the best, of course. But of course, if we have been too pessimistic, then of course we can only be pleasantly surprised and in fact that is exactly what happened in January, where things have been pretty good. We have seen growth in January, I will not give you details because of course I don't want to give you false expectations, but January again, was not a bad month, far from it.</p>
          <p>Having said that, visibility over the year is limited. If we turn to economists around the world, they come up with different scenarios, some expect recovery at the end of 2009, they are in the minority. Many, a larger minority, expect a recovery in 2010. Another minority believes the crisis will last for another three to six years, but let's hope they are wrong. But in any event, if you look at all the stimulus packages here and there, there is some agreement as to how things will pan out in 2009. Well, all we can say is again, let's get ready for the crisis, as we were able to in 2008,  and for the time being, we keep our investment, we keep launching new products and like we have in any crisis, and indeed, this is a more severe crisis than we've had before, but again we will steadily increase market shares. And again we will come out even stronger on the world luxury goods market. And our strategy so far has been very successful in terms of dynamism and innovation, this has borne fruit and my colleagues will tell you more in a minute.</p>
          <p>We will be launching new products, at Vuitton we have the collection, we have come out with better, of course Mr. Carcelle will tell you more about that. In Perfumes and Cosmetics, likewise, we have many new innovations in our plans at Giro and Guerlain and others. We have many shops that will open <mark type="inaudible" /> all over the world. And unlike some of my competitors, we are not going to cut down on advertising, because of course advertising is what enables us to show customers around the world that we always have fine shops, fine products and we are very confident.</p>
          <p>Now in -- at the end of 2008, what struck me and some of you who went to the U.S. may have seen this as well, is the huge sales so early in the year, before Christmas. Now, of course for big department stores, this may have been necessary except for Le Bon March&#xE9;. Bon March&#xE9; is a very successful department store. But if you look at American department stores, if you went through these stores towards the year, before Christmas you had sales discounts down to 40 or 60%. So of course, when people purchase high-quality luxury goods, this leads to major disappointments. Because if you buy, say a luxury good, a bag, for instance, what is supposed to be a luxury brand just like when you buy a dress or a &#x2013; or shoes, if you find the same thing 50% off three weeks later, that's rather disappointing. And Louis Vuitton &#x2013; Louis Vuitton is the one brand in the year that never gives any discounts.</p>
          <p>And paradoxically this was very beneficial, I have seen many of our customers coming to our shops and saying, well, the one good thing at Louis Vuitton, when we buy something for yourself or when you buy something for a friend, you don't end up with this present having lost half its value in the following weeks. And that is one thing that makes us different. We are the one brand in the world that never gives discounts. And I think again we will come out of this crisis in a stronger position. I'm not saying we will pull through in 2009, I'm not making any forecasts for 2009, it would be very presumptuous to do so and it would be certainly not well received. We will try and do our best and you'll see where we are six months hence. Thank you.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language] Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. I'd like to now give you a few figures on FY'08. I will first of all give you the presentation of revenues and then the balance sheet. First of all, let's look at revenues. There you have it -- as Mr. Arnault has told you, our revenues have grown by 4% in euro, 7% organic growth. The 4% is accounted for the exchange rate impact and therefore it shows once again the ForEx impact has been very true plus a 1% scope effect linked to Hublot, and its acquisition.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at the different groups, and of course brand leaders will tell you about it, Wines and Spirits have managed to finish up okay, up 1% despite the euro environment. Fashion and Leather Goods 10% increase and a two-digit increase across the year. Perfumes and Cosmetics has experienced 8% growth. Watches and Jewelry, it was much more difficult, they had a more difficult environment from September -- August and September mainly in the United States and Philippe will tell you more about that later on. And despite significant two-digit figure &#x2013; or two-digit growth, organic growth over the last few years, we nonetheless have an -- euro growth linked to the Hublot acquisition. And then we have in Selective distribution very good results, 9% growth mainly thanks to Sephora in the U.S. and China.</p>
          <p>Now let us look at the breakdown per region. Not much to say about this here, apart from the fact that there's a two percentage points drop in the United States on last year related to the drop on the currency exchange front, small drop also in Japan and therefore -- an increase on Europe by one percentage point and a one percentage point increase in Asia also.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at revenue per region in local currencies. Let's look at the United States. 2% increase on the whole year even though there was a significant slowdown at the end of the year, as you can well expect. But Fashion and Leather Goods and Perfumes and Cosmetics are putting up a good fight.</p>
          <p>In Japan, it's still pretty difficult, there is a 10% drop in yen over the year. It's true across the board particularly for Wine and Spirits, so pretty sluggish across the board in Japan. Conversely, in Asia, very good increase, 19% increase in local currencies, there is a slowdown in Q4, I mean it was plus 21 at the end of September, it's plus 19 at the end of the year, so it's still pretty good. And then in Europe, there's been an increase on the year of 7% in euro in the euro area, of course, but there has been a slight drop in the currency, in sterling and Eastern European currencies. And therefore on the whole, not too bad with the 7% growth.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the revenue, it's the usual thing, an increase in 4% in revenues, I won't expand on that. 5% increase on gross margin, it's now 65%, and I think it's the first time we've reached this tremendous figure in the history of our Group. And indeed the growth is good, slightly better indeed than revenue. Selling expenses not as good, they have grown quite slightly faster than revenues and this is particularly due to the rents we paid particularly in travel retail, and indeed the rents have gone up faster than revenue. And in some instances, we have had drops in revenues and increased or stable rents. And therefore, you have a growth of 6%. Generals and admin, fairly constant, in line with our revenue. And our profit from recurring income, and that's the important figure, has gone up 2% on -- across the year.</p>
          <p>Look at other issues, income and expenses, similar to last year, 143 million down, 80 million for reorganizing and restructuring, and 60 million for amortization and depreciating incorporeal assets. So, it's not that much given the balance sheet. Net financial expenses,  not that good -- I'll expand on that later. Taxes is 28%, it's slightly worse than last year, it was 27%. One of the reasons is that we've basically run out of tax deficits to carry over. Then minority interest, right, slightly down, particularly linked to DFS and Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy. So, on the whole, Group share of net profit is pretty much the same as last year at 2.026 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at profits from recurring operations per business. So Wines and Spirits, the figures are pretty good. As I said, the sales in euro, down 3%, but in fact, in euro it's pretty stable and therefore we have managed to protect our business despite the environment.</p>
          <p>Fashion and Leather Goods pretty good there again, 5% growth, Vuitton has maintained its tremendously high margin. Perfumes and Cosmetics, excellent figures, 13% up, including 8% increase in euro. The first time the margin is beyond the 10% mark. Not quite as easy in Watches and Jewelry. First of all, there has been a slowdown in business, as I've said, and Philippe will tell us later on &#x2013; late us on also, but we have had to provision for -- make provisions for inventory at the end of the year. Well why? Well, quite simply because there is some lead time between the moment you start seeing your sales go down and the impact it has on production lines. So it's a fairly standard provisioning, but it is -- it does have a negative impact on it and it takes into account the expected turnover. We hope to offset them when the environment is better.</p>
          <p>And then look at Selective distribution, I almost forgot that, that went down 9%. That refers back in fact to rents in travel retail, once again Sephora has been very good and their margin has not been affected by the environment in 2008, indeed it's actually gone up slightly. Travel retail was actually more difficult, there was a fairly negative impact mainly DFS. Some very profitable concessions came to an end in Incheon Airport in Seoul for instance. And we now have the standard less profitable retail program. So it's a mixed impact.</p>
          <p>Final slide on recurring operations. And this is the ForEx impact. It's a negative impact by 143 million, not quite as bad as last year, I suppose, 250 million, but 143 million is still about 4% of our operating profits from recurring operations.</p>
          <p>Let us now move onto financial results. I usually look at four items, first of all the cost of net financial debt, this has gone up &#x20AC;50 million. The reason is that there has been a slight average increase on debt, a slight increase on the interest rates and an increase on <mark type="inaudible" />, and I am sure you will understand why that happened especially at the end of last year. So cost of net financial debt has gone up.</p>
          <p>Hedging, I think you're familiar with what hedging is all about, hedging is an art but something that is inflicted upon us, we've got 64 million, it's fairly standard, I suppose as compared to 97 million last year. And then other financial instruments -- other miscellaneous gains, I suppose you could say, is 53 million. And that's gone up slightly on last year. And the miscellaneous has gone down slightly for 2008 and that explains the difference between the two figures.</p>
          <p>Let us now look at our balance sheet. There was a 43% of equity last year, now 44%, and this is related to the increase in the yen and dollar currencies, quite simply because we have some assets held in yen and dollar. I will give you figures later on. Second impact &#x2013; the second reason is in fact that we've had an increase in inventory, which has gone up to, what is it, 18%. I think I can read. Then you have the cash flow from operations and this is, as usual, a very valuable chart.</p>
          <p>Look at for instance, the net cash from operating before changes in working capital. For the first time, we have gone beyond the 3 billion mark. It's up about 3% on last year, which is in fact very good and shows that the profit from recurring operations is in fact related to sales and cash operations, and not more difficult things to identify. The working capital requirement has increased significantly on 2007, quite simply because of those inventories as we've said.</p>
          <p>Now, of course in inventories there are things we want to increase, there is our inventory in Wines and Spirits, there is replenishment of inventories; in Louis Vuitton, for instance, in 2007 at year's end, our inventory was not tenable from a commercial point of view. And then we opened of course, a significant number of Sephora stores in 2008, and therefore we need to have stock and inventory for them.</p>
          <p>Now, this is what we expect it to do, but for Watches and Jewelry, of course, there was less business and therefore increase in inventory. And we needed some time to adjust our production lines and production levels and therefore mechanically increased our inventory. And this is going to be an area of focus for senior management across 2009.</p>
          <p>CapEx, operating investments, nothing much to say as compared to 2007. And on the whole, we have 1.331 billions worth of free cash flow, a little down on the previous year, but fairly standard and very respectable given the environment. And we will propose a dividend per action of &#x20AC;1.60.</p>
          <p>Let's now move on to debt and equity. You see here a chart, over a few years, we have 3.9 billion as compared to 3.1 billion last year that is in part due to paying out dividends, but also to the acquisitions we made over 2008, Abiel and Hublot. But we're still at 28% gearing and that is very acceptable.</p>
          <p>Now there are two slides I don't usually present, but because there are so many questions about debt, I thought it might be useful to put them to you all the same. And that is to give you a debt analysis per currency. Initially you can see that 72, 75% of our debt is in euro. And this is directly related to our assets, not necessarily to our profits.</p>
          <p>I think it makes sense to have a debt that reflects our assets. Then we have almost a 50% &#x2013; 50-50 relationship in fixed and variable rates. And then we have two-thirds of our debt above one-year's maturity and one-third below one-year and we've been trying to increase our maturity beyond one-year.</p>
          <p>Final slide, looking at financial flexibility and cash flow and the credit lines we have. At the end, at year's end, we had 3.8 billions worth of credit lines, we've drawn 400 million and the &#x2013; that left 3.2. Now let's assume that we have 1.6 billions worth of credit lines come to maturity in 2009, we hope that the bankers in the room who are our usual bankers will extend these facilities once again in 2009, we hope that.</p>
          <p>But if we go down the conservative route and expect or assume that they will not be resumed, we still have 1.8 billions worth of facility as compared to 700 million current commercial paper programs, after that the one billion free cash flow, all this leads me to conclude that the cash flow situation, the financial flexibility of our Group is very good and there is no call for concern.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Good evening, and so we start off with the mysterious look of Monica Bellucci, who was of course an ambassador for Parfums Christian Dior is a nice introduction to Perfume and Cosmetic. Revenue in this business has shown organic growth of 8% and in terms of, profit from recurring operations is up 13%.</p>
          <p>Now 2008 was a successful year for our long-term strategy, which is looking at strong growth in revenue, irrespective of what the market is doing, with also an improvement of the operating margin, which has now reached 10% for the first time. The encouraging thing is that our market shares have been growing all over the world.</p>
          <p>The revenue is also growing on the well-balanced way. The star of our portfolio, Parfums Christian Dior, has shown exceptional performance under the leadership of Claude Martinez, in the fifth year running, revenue and profitability have reached new records, and the important thing is this goes hand in hand with our commitment to high quality and creativity.</p>
          <p>If you look at the various perfumes, you have J'Adore and the novelty perfumes have shown tremendous dynamism, good development with makeup with Diorshow, the mascara, Diorshow Iconic, and the Addict line. And also we have another line of cosmetics known as Capture. This is the new <mark type="inaudible" /> of Shalimar, this breathes new life into this old classic at Maison Guerlain, it's successful in the line Orchid&#xE9;e Imp&#xE9;riale. It has enabled Guerlain to celebrate 180 years of creation, and of course this is the fourth year of profitable growth for Guerlain.</p>
          <p>Also Parfums Givenchy has been doing quite well on all product lines, Very Irresistible is enjoying steady growth and Play has started its debut in various parts of the world. In the makeup department, the Phenomen'Eyes mascara has been so successful that we had to produce more than expected. And then the &#x2013; Benefit cosmetics has continued in its very profitable niche market in 2008, in particular it was very successful in China.</p>
          <p>Now in 2009 we have to expect declining or stagnant markets with two exceptions in of course retailing, always retailers try to keep their inventories down, but our strategy hasn't changed, we want to acquire new market shares and we are looking more specifically at key markets, but this also will require stringent cost management to remain profitable. Again the priority is for Parfums Christian Dior and our vision is to improve the quality of all expressions of that brand. First, we will promote the star &#x2013; the flagship items such as J'Adore and Miss Dior Ch&#xE9;rie, we are also being very creative in terms of makeup with the Couture Dior, then also we have a line of franchise Capture which encapsulates our knowhow in high-quality cosmetics.</p>
          <p>The other objective is to keep our profitable growth for other brands; Givenchy of course has an aggressive expansion plan, likewise, Play, overseas and all the makeup lines in France. We are looking at the big pillars such as Shalimar, Terracotta, Orchid&#xE9;e Imp&#xE9;riale and Guerlain, again in Europe, and Kenzo Parfum and Make Up For Ever emerging in China and Benefit is emerging in Russia.</p>
          <p>Now for Selective retailing, we can see that we've had good organic growth in revenue, up 9%. However the results from recurring operations is down because of travel retail.</p>
          <p>DFS has acquired new market shares in Asia and enjoyed good growth in revenue. Japanese tourism has been down because of the economic context, but this was compensated by good economic activity elsewhere in Asia, especially in China. We have new developments in Macao, Abu Dhabi, Mumbai and Ho Chi Minh City and that put DFS in a good position for future growth. But of course, this indeed is a short-term profitability, we have a negative economic context and the start-up costs are high and this has prompted us to start a cost control, reduction campaign for the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>You can see on the screen, the growth in market shares of Sephora in France on the left and the U.S. on the right, you can see that France has been doing extremely well, and likewise the United States. This illustrates the success of Sephora in 2008. Of course, we were extremely dynamic both in terms of revenue and profitability on the like-for-like basis; the sales in shops were up in all parts of the world and online sales were growing at a sustained pace. If you look at the new shops openings, we have as many as 142. A few shops were in fact closed, but we have new countries, in particular, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuwait.</p>
          <p>The other strategic event is our acquisition of shares in Ile de Beaut&#xE9; in Russia, and that of course strengthens our position for the future. Of course, Sephora always tries to be innovative, people come to us to discover new things and our ambition is to be ahead of the game with new products, new services, exclusive services and we have our own brand, Sephora brand, which of course prides itself in offering good value for money.</p>
          <p>The selfsame culture is that embodied by Le Bon March&#xE9; department store, 2008 saw the beginning of renovation work in the household department, but we also have a new, very original site of sales. You have a website where you had a picture on the screen, just now. In 2009 we propose to maintain our long-term strategy, which is to acquire new positions, new market shares in Asia. We have a new site in Macao, we have a &#x2013; which we are expanding our flagship store in Hong Kong, we are completing the shops in the Mumbai and Abu Dhabi airports in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>We are trying to, of course, capture bigger clientele. But of course as the markets stagnate, we also have to work hard on keeping costs down, what with the new openings, which always generate new costs. Regarding Sephora, our objective in 2009 is to improve and build on our momentum and improve our image as the leader in selective beauty shops. We'll be more cautious in terms of new stores, we'll be looking at high profitability territories and of course the main concern is to try and ensure customer loyalty.</p>
          <p>The developments in 2009 will always emphasize creativity, but they will also look more specifically at the value aspect of things, because of course in the present state of affairs, customers are always keen to get good value. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to comment on the Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy figures. As Jean-Jacques has already told you, our revenue has increased slightly and it's slightly beyond 3 billion. On the face of it, it's a 3% drop but a 1% organic growth. We've managed to, on the whole, maintain the profit for recurring operations at last year's level with a 0.2% increase. Champagnes account for &#x20AC;607 million and cognac and spirits, 453 million.</p>
          <p>So what's the highlights for 2008, well, our sales have gone up except for champagne and revenue has grown. We all know that in a difficult financial and economic environment champagne suffers, if you look at the breakdown per category, champagne has experienced a 4% drop as compared to '07, wines have gone up 4%, cognac, Hennessy brand has gone up 4% and other spirits have increased and grown 13%.</p>
          <p>We have implemented our price increase policy that we had announced, about the -- on average, a 7% price increase across the board, and we have, and that's very positive, identified increased market shares. As you know for cognac, we already have a significant market share. We've gone up from 43 to 43.8 percentage points in terms of market share. And for champagne we've gone up to 20.4 to 20.6, that's in volume, but in value, the increase in market share has actually gone up further.</p>
          <p>We have experienced business contraction in Q4, everyone would have expected that. But on the whole, there is good resilience of our profits despite the slight decline in revenues in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now, on our markets, in fact I'd say that there is a significant contribution to our results from emerging markets, I think you can say in Europe, the market has resisted pretty well with 3% growth. In the U.S. and in Japan &#x2013; in the U.S. where the crisis has been prevalent for quite some time, and as I was saying, in the U.S. and Japan, there has been reduced demand in the economy that we know, but there have been true emergence in emerging markets, high potential markets, of course Asia, the usual suspects, we have seen continued strong revenue growth, 17%. China also, as was said earlier, China is the largest market for Hennessy and we experienced a 22% growth on last year and it's the second contributor to profits in Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy and the first indeed for cognacs. 18% growth in Russia, and there were other areas that have had very good performances, Middle East and Latin America, plus 23% on -- over 2007.</p>
          <p>As we have said, there's been a very diverse performance depending on what sort of products we're talking about. As I've said, there were difficulties for champagne mainly in the U.S. but our champagne brands have experienced significant, sustained growth in emerging markets, in China for instance. In China, quite clearly we're footing the foundations of a true champagne market. Central Europe, also, where we opened new subsidiaries last year, Latin America, Middle East.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, there's been a slowdown in Q4. However, there is a good piece of information relating to inventory and as you know, champagne sales are seasonal, but in fact, we have been very good in managing our inventory. There has been, as far as we can tell, no increase in the inventory. There is also growth in spirits as I've said, Hennessy has had very good results, strong increase in Asia and significant market share gains. I said earlier that it accounts worldwide for about a 1% market share increase.</p>
          <p>But look at what happened in China. Last year they increased their market share by three percentage points. So quite clearly, what this says is that Hennessy is obviously the leader on the cognac brand. There is Glenmorangie also, and for Glenmorangie we're trying to be less dependent on the U.K. market and to branch off internationally. There is good results in Asia, very much so in Taiwan. Then Millennium, that's our vodka brand, indicators are sharing that although the market is pretty flat in the U.S., the Belvedere brand has gained market share. So quite clearly our programs are bearing fruit.</p>
          <p>Look at our rising stars, Ruinart has experienced growth, plus 11%, and this in force- and actually will continue despite the value strategy, and indeed for wines we are positioning our wines upmarket, further up in the market. For 2008, we intend to reinforce our global leadership of the high-end markets of Wines and Spirits. We took a number of initiatives from a marketing and commercial point of view, there were many innovations; as you can see on the screen, we have Glenmorangie, which launched a new product, completely revolutionalizing the pure malt whisky market, this is a malt &#x2013; roasted malt whisky, which really does change the taste and is well worth trying. There is the Krug Clos d'Ambonnay 1995, I mentioned that earlier; then there is the Hennessy Diptyque, which is very interesting also.</p>
          <p>And also selling; we've started commercializing our latest Spanish wine acquisition, Numanthia Termes. As you know, our commercial network is instrumental in carrying out our strategy across the world and in 2008 we have strengthened our worldwide commercial network, mainly in China and as you have seen, we have had good results. We have about 400 people working promoting the Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy portfolio. We also established commercial training programs so that salespersons can actually sell the whole portfolio and not just brands from our portfolio. And we've also strengthened the off-trade channels, mainly in the U.S. As you know, our consumers are changing their consumption patterns. Consumers are increasingly consuming at home, so we therefore have to start focusing on this domestic consumption and we need to try and make sure that our teams are familiar with these potential opportunities.</p>
          <p>So what is the outlook for 2009, it's still early days of course, but what we can say is that Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy teams across the world are focusing on our age-old strategy, focusing on value and top range products, that's our strategy. And therefore there's nothing else to do about strategy, but our teams are working on the ground, in the field, to accompany our brands and markets across the world.</p>
          <p>We will go on increasing our prices in a targeted marketing initiative, selective price increases indeed. In 2009, we will launch a number of new products under the Hennessy brand, under the Ardbeg brand. And incidentally, I'll remind you that with the second year running they have been awarded the Best Whisky Award. Then Belvedere and Glenmorangie will launch new products, as I said earlier.</p>
          <p>Now in the current economic environment, it makes sense to restructure, reorganize our workforce, our strength and that's exactly what we started to do last year. So at the end of last year, so that all our team and all our resources are focused on implementing the plans and the choices we made at the end of last year. This means therefore that we focus mainly on sales forces, sales teams and supporting them on the ground. We are also reinforcing our off-premise distribution channels, so as to make the most of this opportunity with increasing number of customers drinking their wines and spirits at homes.</p>
          <p>As I said, we have really to intensify innovation, but we also have to get ready for the next phase, for the pickup of the economy and prepare the future when the economy picks up in the U.S. And so we have to lay the ground for 2010 and that's what our teams are going to do here in France, in Scotland and in Poland. If you look at our champagne portfolio, the fact is that despite the difficult economic environment, our champagne portfolio is varied and far-reaching and can meet any of our consumers' needs, be it champagnes proper or sparkling wines.</p>
          <p>We are going to go on focusing our efforts on our major markets, the more important ones, so the U.S. and Asia generally, but China more specifically. And also we will be maximizing organizational strength, finding and identifying synergies so that we can share our knowledge and go on improving across the board.</p>
          <p>Let me say, to wrap up, that of course we are determined to increase our market shares and be acknowledged as the global leader on the premium Wines and Spirits market and lay the ground for the future. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]. Good evening. In a negative context of certain decline in the second half of the year, we maintained our ambition to gain market shares while being ahead of &#x2013; or being proactive on possible difficulties. On the left-hand side you have Tourbillon Big Bang black platinum watch,   exemplifies the merger &#x2013; the merging of noble materials.</p>
          <p>And on the right-hand side you have the Grand Carrera Caliper timepiece, which has an El Primero Zenith movement, which was &#x2013; which got the watch competition in Geneva. Now in what has become a difficult context, this particular business line was able to maintain good growth, 6%, but organic growth unfortunately was negative, down minus 2%, as Jean-Jacques was saying earlier on.</p>
          <p>But you have to remember that average organic growth was more than 20% for three years running. Now there was a slowdown, as we saw mostly in the U.S., but there were other three other factors that determined this negative performance.</p>
          <p>Number one, there was a sudden slowdown in purchases from multi-brand retailers not just in the United States but elsewhere as well. There were obvious credit risks that we wanted to avoid &#x2013; and we decided not to deliver to customers who might become insolvent because of the crisis. And then some of our wealthy customers decided to postpone the purchase of high value timepieces, also hoping for prices maybe to come down.</p>
          <p>So unlike other competitors this is what we did. Number one, we gave a priority to those activities to promote sellout on behalf of retailers, rather than forcing them to acquire new stock. We maintained our prices, our conditions, but also our profit margin as well, including in jewelry. In terms of jewelry, we found that our icon timepieces did extremely well, especially those whose tag price was 2 to &#x20AC;10,000.</p>
          <p>I don't know if this is entry level or mid-range, but they did quite well. Regarding the profit from recurring operations, it's &#x20AC;118 million, i.e., 13.5% of revenue, it was down compared to last year. This was partly due because we've been billing less in the last part of the year, but as Jean-Louis was saying earlier on, we had to make allowances for excess inventory, because of course we were not able to deliver as much. But there were additional significant provisions, not just for inventory, but also for some restructuring operations. I'll tell you more about that in a minute.</p>
          <p>What were the highlights of 2008 for watches? If you look at the various regions, the performance was strong in Asia, and not including Japan, plus 19% in local currency. There were more significant growth in China and India up 19%, in Europe 30%. In Europe growth is good as well, up 20%, in the U.S., we were down to the tune of 14%, but the end of the year was worse than the rest of &#x2013; the first three quarters.</p>
          <p>I have just received the statement for revenue in the U.S., on the &#x2013; on watches, compared to the entire industry I can confirm, I'm happy to confirm, that not only have we not lost any market shares, indeed, we have gained more thanks to TAG Heuer, which is of course significant, because this is the number two brand in the U.S. So people felt that high end was selling better than the mid-range, but in fact in this respect, TAG Heuer did quite well.</p>
          <p>Now, Japan of course was slightly down, but we've mentioned this, this is true for other products as well. Hublot, in our portfolio, has confirmed that it fits in very nicely with the rest of LVMH, its performance was outstanding. We are looking at a double-digit growth, there were new products launched under that brand. What I can assure you is that retailing suffers no excess stock, we are working on a zero stock basis in Geneva. Hublot showed its new collection and its orders were significant. The delivery will begin in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Regarding TAG Heuer, we are looking at a &#x2013; progression of that brand, especially for entry-level watches, in spite of difficult economic circumstances. We've been very successful with Grand Carrera, which was extremely successful. Also, quite successful were the new TAG Heuer telephone, it's called Meridiist, you have it on the right-hand side of the screen; it was distributed in very selective retailing on a test market. So we sold some in November and December in London; in the White City shop we sold 50 copies of that phone, which sells for about &#x20A4;2,300 apiece. We sold twice as many watches in the same time in the same shop and that's of course, the sort of diversification worth pursuings.</p>
          <p>And Zenith continued its position. You have a picture in the middle there, this Tourbillon Zero-G, the two first copies were manufactured at the end of 2008. And then on the other side you have the Chronomaster and Class Elite classics that sold best in terms of volume in 2008; that brand also started to -- selling in China and indeed opened three points of sale in India.</p>
          <p>For Dior, the big success came from Christal with more watch-like items with &#x2013; you had the first wheel-type movements and the automatic movements, you have dazzling blue at the bottom of the screen. We also started a joint venture with Dior Couture, enabled us to generate synergies between Dior Montres and Dior Jewelry, not just in terms of the management, but retail as well.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side you have watch and jewelry shops, they are small shops; that's very useful for our business model. You have Westfield in London for TAG Heuer. We've also opened six additional shops of that kind in 2008, usually with franchises, in China, in Hong Kong, in  &#x2013; Jean-Christophe Babin, the head of TAG Heuer, was in Delhi to open <mark type="inaudible" /> this second shop in India, we also opened a TAG Heuer shop in, more recently Jakarta. And we have as many as 65 shops of TAG Heuer, 52 of which are run by franchise operations.</p>
          <p>We have the fifth Hublot boutique that opened in Geneva. We have now one in Paris, one in St. Tropez, one in Kuala Lumpur and one in Hong Kong. And that has been open ever since we acquired Hublot, always using major retailers locally, and we are also working with franchises so as to avoid spending too much on capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>Now the high points of jewelry, Chaumet has also gained new market shares in France but also in Japan. We also strengthened our presence with 10 new shops in Hong Kong, in China, in the Middle East and in Russia. Chaumet took back 100% of its joint venture in Korea and the collection Attrape-Moi si Tu m'Aimes, shown on the right-hand side with Sophie Marceau, did extremely well on the 10 to &#x20AC;50,000 segment classified as mid-range jewelry. De Beers strengthened its position and the same in 2008 with 12 new shops, including five in the U.S.,  also Taiwan, Taipei, 101, the Galeries Lafayette right here in Paris, Westfield in London, Riyadh, Jeddah and with DFS we also have Macao and Waikiki.</p>
          <p>De Beers did well in the first half of the year in high jewelry, but second half of the year, we've seen good resistance of classics such as wedding rings or engagement rings and solitary rings on the second half of the year. Then Fred did well in France throughout the year. We have renovated shop Place Vend&#xF4;me and its new advertising campaign with Kate Moss.</p>
          <p>A few examples of retail stores, you have the Chaumet boutique in Eleanor, called Elements in Hong Kong. You have the same type of shop in miniature version, Le Bon March&#xE9; department store in Paris, or indeed if you go to Macao, in the DFS Gallery.</p>
          <p>Further down, while you have to remember that Chaumet, and it's worth pointing out, has as many as 41 stores in its own name and 17 with franchises with different partners around the world, people, where we did not &#x2013; partners with -- whose retail operation we did not want to take over. Wilmot in Westfield shows an interesting new type of architecture that you have now in as many as 31 stores in our own name and ten in franchises.</p>
          <p>Now what are expectations for 2009 and our priorities in what is after all an uncertain context? We are still keeping the course to acquire new market shares and our people have done a very good job in 2008 in what was, after all, a difficult context. They are, as I said, staying the course. Our marketing investments are very specifically targeted towards the most promising brands and territories. Indeed in some markets we have increased our advertising investments, even though overall, we will be trying to keep these costs under control. We are not opening many new stores of our own, with a few exceptions, such as Chaumet in Singapore or TAG Heuer in Ginza. But our priority will be to try and improve the productivity of existing shops. And of course what we'll try and do is open more partnerships with franchise stores, which will of course improve the picture both for CapEx and the industrial performance for TAG Heuer and Hublot. This is of course where we want to focus our CapEx, we will have a TAG Heuer shop in April.</p>
          <p>And then we will keep our operating costs down in 2008, we are trying to keep our costs down and also our head count down. We have restructuring allowances, these provisions were started as early as January, because what it is is we have to recalibrate our output capacities &#x2013; we were &#x2013; we  had some excess inventory because we were making more than we were billing.</p>
          <p>There is also automation of the billing process, we are also selling more high-end products; that means fewer all told, but more in sales. And we are, in a way, streamlining our collections. And now, the one trend to remember for 2009 is that we are looking at more creation especially on the Icon timepieces and Jewel but of course, going back to the big classics that we inherited from our mother or parent companies. We have to remember the two previous shows &#x2013; pictures where we had the standard Hublot collection, you had this model which looks as a combination of Big Bang and what is what's known as the fusion of materials. And then the Chaumet ring, of course, this is a very classical line and of course, every year, we come up with new models. This one, of course, sells for &#x20AC;15,000 and it was, of course &#x2013; well, you may remember that it was taken out of a front page picture on the daily newspaper. It should never have been there in the first place, but in any case there were lots of gossip about that.</p>
          <p>2009 will also be our opportunity to celebrate 40 years of Monaco, of course the -- Steve McQueen there is a legendary figure. We have also 40 years of the Primero movement, Invincible with its 36,000 movements. And we &#x2013; you may remember that the first shop here &#x2013; first watch here was first introduced in 1969. We have, as ambassadors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Moss. Leonardo DiCaprio has joined then Tiger Woods, Maria Sharapova, Lewis Hamilton and  Shah Rukh Khan.</p>
          <p>Leonardo DiCaprio is of course a great defender of the environment, he is the only top U.S. actor who accepted to advertise on the U.S. market, unlike Brad Pitt. And then we have one figure who we did not sign, Barack Obama, 15 years, he was faithful to TAG Heuer until of course the Secret Services asked him to wear an obscure Secret Service watch which he is wearing right now.</p>
          <p>The interesting thing is that websites and blogs took that rumor greedily and so now there is a pair-up between the watch worn by Barack Obama, the TAG Heuer you have there, which has been republished &#x2013; reproduced since and then the watch worn by McCain, the loser of the election, I will not name the brand, but maybe it's just a matter of generation.</p>
          <p>In any case we are looking at a difficult year.; we have highly motivated teams. We want to keep our costs under control, we are maintaining our advertising budgets, we will be looking at 2009 in a tactical way. In a few hours time, Chaumet will start a new collection of jewels first for Valentines Day. Love does remain a safe bet and as Barack Obama would say, it is not easy but, yes we can.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, and as you can see, Sean Connery is welcoming you here. So we're good with older customers and the traditional values of Louis Vuitton. Now you've seen the figures once already; I won't expand on those, I think, we all know that across the board, we have experienced gains in market shares over our competitors. What's more important is to try and understand why that happened. As has already been said, there has been an excellent performance in the U.S. and in Europe. Although it certainly wasn't the case in Japan, where, as we all know, we all have to handle a difficult economic environment of department stores that, well, they're not terribly dynamic, let's put in that way. And that would have enabled, maybe, luxury goods to put up a fight in Japan.</p>
          <p>In any case, we recently experienced once again a double-digit organic growth over 2008, this has been in part due to the tremendous Chinese clientele growth; it's already the second largest clientele of the brand worldwide, greater China, that is. And we can expect that to become the largest customer base in the next few years. Greater China accounts for 20% of our revenues for 2008. We now have 425 stores at year's-end, 35 net openings; we've opened new stores in four new countries, Finland, Qatar, Romania and Bahrain.</p>
          <p>We said earlier that we'd launched the Damier Graphite line, very important personally because it's pretty, actually. It was also launched in the beginning of the year's Cat's Walk and this enables us to look at this across the board, not only as Fashion and Leather Goods and not only focusing on men's wear. As we know, there is a special division in the Hankyu men branch in Japan and a special fifth floor for men's wear in Omotesando in Tokyo.</p>
          <p>Of course, it's all well and good to launch new lines, but we have to make sure that they live on; this is true, for instance, of a number of our lines, Damier Graphite and others, and we are launching new models, Palermo, Tivoli, Trevi, Galliera, for instance. We're establishing new collaborations, new cooperations and novel, I suppose, and unexpected we are working with Rei Kawabuko who is the designer from Comme des Gar&#xE7;ons and she wanted to think back to the 1978 opening of the first store in Oyama in Japan, although it didn't last for long.</p>
          <p>Then we have a very significant cooperation with Richard Prince and Takashi Murakami with Stephen Sprouse. And of course the reasons why they were chosen is that Marc Jacobs knows and knows them well. And then we have the new collection with Takashi Murakami <mark type="inaudible" />, we've had a very good progress in accessories, we now have a management unit doing this whether we are talking belts, kerchiefs, fashion jewelry or ties, all line accessories have in fact driven growth.</p>
          <p>We're also still focusing on the environment and making sure that the EO center, our main storehouse, is environmentally-friendly, well then you've also got ISO 14001 certification for headquarters in the Pont-Neuf. And then of course, and this brings us back to Sean Connery, one of the reasons why we're still very positive about our <mark type="inaudible" /> says that of course we are unique insofar as we know ever put our products in the sales, the fact is that that was quite clearly a strategic differentiation factor. The other reason is also that we have launched our communication and advertising programs two years ago and having Mikhail Gorbachev, Keith Richards, or Sean Connery is very important. As you know, it's the first time that we had a short film, an institutional short film, to communicate once again about these eternal values of Louis Vuitton.</p>
          <p>On -- out of 90 seconds, we only have a few short pictures about our products, but we get a clear understanding on what our values are, and then we focus on the major architectural programs because our stores are instrumental in communicating. Some of you were with me in Dalian when we opened the store in Manchuria. What's interesting is that in 1978 we had 100 square meters in the hotel, then 300 meters and then, now more than 1,000 square meters still outside Peking and you can see that the facade or the design is fascinating and exceptional, quite simply because we never compromise on location and on the design of our stores.</p>
          <p>We always want for -- storefront or facades that are twice or three times as big as our competitors. Let's go on looking at other brands. These have gone on in experiencing profitable growth with rapid growth in Europe and Asia. Fendi refocused on its historical values, the Baguette, handbag, the Selleria line also, because saddle-making is also significant in our history.</p>
          <p>There is also grand success of ready-to-wear and we now have 180 stores at year's-end 2008, two new countries Qatar and Mexico. Donna Karan also experienced a very good year, record highs despite the difficult fourth quarter, good progression in Donna Karan Collection and the DKNY line. Marc Jacobs, Marc Jacobs here is driven by Marc by Marc Jacobs line. We had the first store open in Paris, I'm sure you've been and visited it.</p>
          <p>Givenchy, with the strong growth of women's ready-to-wear in the -- Europe and the U.S. and confirmed success of the Nightingale leather goods line. In Berluti we've launched the new shoe collection, L'empreinte du loup, and the new leather goods line, Cervo. And Kenzo is -- go on refurbishing its store network. And then in Celine, Pucci and Loewe, we've got three very good designers, Philo Phoebe, <mark type="inaudible" /> and I think that these 30-year olds can &#x2013; will bring us a great success for the next three years.</p>
          <p>Outlook for 2009. Well, here again, and as my colleagues have said, it is difficult to say anything sure, but I think we can expect continued profitable growth in Fendi, innovation in leather goods reinforcing iconic products and selectively developing new stores. And I'm sure also that we will strengthen the foundations of the basic principles of other brands, vitality of creative terms, the selective investments, hyper-selective investments indeed, in the store networks.</p>
          <p>And finally for Louis Vuitton, as you know, we had a very significant, very strong innovative moment at the beginning of the year. The -- we had a collaboration, cooperation with Steven Sprouse in 2001, he unfortunately passed away in 2004. But in fact we run back to it because of a customer approach, the British &#x2013; the owner of a gallery in 2000 -- in Soho came to us. in 2007 saying, I'd like to put up a show about what Steven did in his paintings, his drawings and -- but I also feel that we should have some of his vintage products in fashion wear and could you join us?</p>
          <p>And we turned to Marc and asked him about it and Marc with -- thoroughly excited about it, felt that indeed he wanted to pay tribute to his friendship with Steven, showed how back in the 80s, early 80s Steven &#x2013; Andy Warhol pictures could be used in fashion. We therefore got involved in the exhibition that opened up early January, we also had a book come out in the beginning and then when the rose that Steven used to paint at the end of his letter, they came up in all our stores across the world. It came up in neon lights in our store in the &#x2013; on the Champs Elysees. This was of course very impressive and not just communication or just a PR stunt; it was related to our friendship with him and our involvement in this exhibition. And I think it's very good to begin the year with this project.</p>
          <p>We will go on extending our store network, maybe less than last year, but we expect to have anywhere between 25 and 30 new stores this year, including some very spectacular ones, indeed will have the first global store in Yekaterinburg in the Urals in Russia. Then we will also have a second one in Singapore on March 1, two in China, in Shenzhen and Ningbo. And we are also &#x2013; hoping to open either late in 2009 or early 2010, two stores in London, New Bond Street probably and one in Rome, and that is going to be a bit of a surprise for you all.</p>
          <p>And then we will start using our new production site, I told you that a couple of years ago, we have started building, we built 12,000 square meters of production room for ladies' shoes. Then a sneakers plant and that used to be outsourced and now we have a fascinating plant, probably the most impressive shoe factory, luxury shoe factory, in Italy. And then we will have a third workshop for loafers and thirdly for elegant men. So I think this location in Fiesso will be extremely good and this will support our strategy and help us increase our market share in luxury footwear.</p>
          <p>Marc Jacobs, back in October, organized a tremendously fascinating presentation and he wanted to illustrate it for his fashion campaign with pictures of his friend, here, Madonna, and basically this sums up what I wanted to tell you.</p>

          <p>Regarding external growth, I can't give you an answer, regarding prices &#x2013; well, price, there might be opportunities, some collections are up for grabs people have lost money, you know that there were a number of scandals. Of course, if people have good bargains to offer we might consider them. I don't know if paintings or precious stones will go down in price. I don't know. Regarding our labor position, we have no actual plan, of course, we try to control our operating costs as much as we can. As you know in situations like this one, we always have to expect the worst but we -- of course time will tell what &#x2013; how things pan out. We'll try and do the best with out creating hopefully too many problems. Any further questions?</p>

          <p>Well right now the &#x2013; it depends, it's still in the making. We haven't come with a final number but we'll let, of course, the unions know first. But whatever happens, the numbers will be low.</p>

          <p>Antoine Belge, HSBC. Three questions gentlemen. Could you first give us the figure for the organic growth for Q4, for the group as a whole and the divisions and clearly distinguishing between champagnes and cognac. Secondly, cost management in 2009, the revenues went down by about 1% but margins went down by 100 basis points, which is probably not as bad as in other places. Do you expect 2009 to be &#x2013; or are you looking at 2009 in the same spirit as you were at -- in the beginning of S2? CapEx was about one billion, if you look at the figures, are you looking at similar figures where again. And third question on emerging countries, could you tell us more about the most recent trends in these, and could you tell us how confident you are vis-a-vis these emerging countries and how much you expect them to cushion your drop in revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first question but we cannot give you details as to the numbers. Well, maybe you can buttonhole him during the cocktails afterwards, but normally we don't give a breakdown of growth per business area. The fourth quarter showed growth, organic growth was nil, December was better than the two other months of Q4, because of course of the holiday period, but that's as much as we can tell you, but there were another specific question.</p>
          <p>Yes, the question you have about trends in revenue and profit margins, your implication there was that there was no cost control in the second half, that's not true. I would need to get into the detail of each division. I won't do this now but there were provisions, there were a number of things that made that, that brought the margin down. But for the trend for 2009, we have no comments on that.</p>
          <p>Ah, then about CapEx, though, you did -- also questioned -- in the second half of last year, we had brought CapEx down compared to the previous year and indeed we have confirmed this in other presentations. What we're trying to do is, we are going to invest to develop our brands but we are looking more specifically at key brands in key markets but we will be going down. Yes well, CapEx will continue, but where it is more profitable and we will see how things look in the second half, we might actually change courses then.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Lucas Occa . You said that you might increase or improve on your cash flow and focus mainly on -- or rather working capital requirements, and on inventory. How do you then, what sort of actions, and how do you want to handle equity?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Gerard. Well, we are looking at all the brands and we are trying to see how we can better organize procurement and to streamline inventories, so as to be &#x2013; so as not to be -- to have too much excess inventory at the end of the year. Of course for those items that need to be sold out, we will of course do that.  Those items that can be kept in stock we will, but stock management is something that is very much part and parcel of our management file.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Marco <mark type="inaudible" /> of Bloomberg. Could you tell us what the trends were on cognac sales in the U.S., beginning of this year as compared to the end of last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, cognac sales are still looking up. Well, the outlook is rather good. But I mean one month is not much to go on, January usually isn't very significant. Isn't that a perfect answer? Yes, of course. Knowing that, but we haven't even got the final picture, figures for January 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions if you'd allow me. First of all, on your price policy, you say, you don't put any of your products in the sales.  But are there any adjustments, hopefully, or even hikes? And you spoke about margins also, we can understand why your margin has gone up slightly on watches. But could you tell us more about the so called one-off? I think that if my figures are right and my calculations are right, we are at minus 940 base points on watches, is that right and is it significant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well of course, Watches and Jewelry are much more cycle-sensitive. The other businesses have got much less and it's just the &#x2013; when you have what we call the cyclical activity, it means that you have ups and downs, regardless of the economic cycle. Here we are not looking at a downturn in the economic cycle.</p>
          <p>It's a downright disaster and yet, we are pulling through, and whether it's double-digit or not, we are still looking up. On watches, yes, well, if you look at the gross margin for Watches and Jewelry, if you &#x2013; the margin for each brand is in line with expectations, give or take 1%. However, the effect that you have on lower profitability is due to the provision allowances that were made. Regarding price increases, well, we look at monetary fluctuations, we will be pushing prices up in Russia and likewise in Britain where the pound is going down. If currencies go up, well, we bring the prices down. But we have been doing this for the past 20 years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Emmanuel Bruley des Varannes, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Three questions. Could you tell us a little more and be a little more specific for your CapEx budget for 2009.  You said there'd be about, what, 28 to 30 store openings at Louis Vuitton.  Could you tell us maybe what about -- what would be happening in Sephora?  They usually have quite a few store openings? And maybe Fendi also. I'm not sure that there are store openings planned for the other brands? Second question, emerging countries.  Could you tell us where you've got to in terms of exposure <mark type="inaudible" /> in 2008, I think it was 27% this year's-end '07. We are forever hearing that China is fairly comfortable, that although there might be a slight downturn, the situation seems more uncertain vis-a-vis Russia and the Middle East.  But what have you noticed? And thirdly, again about Sephora, I think you purchased the company, what, 10 years ago. You've done quite a lot and it is fairly impressive since you bought the 57 initial stores. How far will you go? What are the, what's the new frontier for Sephora?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's first take the -- this question about CapEx. I'll try and be more specific. Altogether as Yves said for Louis Vuitton, with Sephora, we have 898 shops; I think we'll try and have &#x2013; to reach the 1000 mark. So that's an additional 100 shops will open, at least that's what we expect to do. The -- we are focusing our CapEx on our main markets, Parfums Christian Dior and Fendi, but the costs and type of CapEx we are talking about is consistent with the previous years or maybe a bit less. Overall, we are looking at minus 10 or 15% compared to last year. For Sephora, specifically, where we have come a long way as you pointed out.  But while it's a long way, the best remains ahead of us.</p>
          <p>And if we look at some of our competitors, I mean they started as small as well. So we have some ways to go. We are only present in 23 countries and we've only just started opening stores in China. And of course, if you look at the history of Louis Vuitton, you can see that there is a &#x2013; the fields are wide open.  We haven't even dented Russia and we are only just gaining majority market shares in the few big countries.  But of course, depending on the economic context, we certainly hope to generate profitable growth. But in any case, we propose to be profitable and to grow in what is a big business and the sky's the limit.</p>
          <p>Regarding emerging territories, if you look at revenue, they account for &#x2013; it accounts for 28% compared &#x2013; that's up 20% compared to last year. You have mostly Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and South America. That's where -- no, you were referring to China and the Middle East, there has been no slowdown in the fourth quarter. It's been business as usual with strong growth figures.  Russia's less visibility, something of a slowdown, but we are still looking at wholesale mostly in Russia. So is there less demand from wholesalers because end users want this.</p>
          <p>Well, maybe one final question then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But don't you fear, you can go on putting questions to them during drinks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Partners, three questions if I may. The first question is on Fashion and Leather, I was wondering if you could confirm whether or not Vuitton brand was also double-digit in the fourth quarter, and whether you are seeing any change in trends in terms of concentration in sales between price points or existing versus new lines? Secondly in Watches and Jewelry, I was wondering if you feel, based on the current trends, that you have been quite conservative with the initial provisions or whether, if we see trends continue to worsen, if there is room for further provisioning near term? And then third, in Wines and Spirits, I was impressed by the margin performance in the second half, and I was wondering what role cost-cutting played in that performance and whether that was more fixed or variable expenses? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Vuitton was double digits in Q4. Well, on provisions, I think our provisioning policy is fairly conservative. We take inventory, we look at inventory turn, expected sales and in expected sales, of course, we factor in the drop in business and anything beyond a certain limit gets provisions. So of course it's fairly negative in '08 for us. But it helps us avoid any unexpected negative surprises. We discussed this with Philippe and others. And at the end of last year when we looked at -- when we closed the accounts, we were fairly busy about this. As for margins in S2, I think we all made a significant effort across all business units and activity units. There is a slight ForEx effect, but that's not much of it. There is more or less a ForEx mutual effect in S2; it was 117 million in S1, 140 in S2, so pretty stable there again. So basically the impact was, sort of keeping costs in check.</p>
          <p>Thank you and please join us for drinks.</p>
