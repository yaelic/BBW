      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will start. I will make a very short comment before Pierre-Andr&#xE9; will comment on the figures. Just a few words, I just have to answer to the question to journalists. The question was whether I'm happy with the result of the company and the answer is yes, if you don't listen this radio this morning.</p>
          <p>Obviously I'm happy because of the result and the financial result but also I'm really happy because the most important thing for me, and I explained that last year, was to be sure that Danone will not only suffer from the crisis, but let's say we'll leverage the crisis to reinforce our position. If I look at the market share of, and even the volume market share of all our brands in every countries, in every businesses of Danone, let's say 90% of the country and the businesses we gain market share. So that the best answer for us.</p>
          <p>The second one which is perhaps more important is the adaptability of the Danone management. True based on very strong brand, the good businesses, the good geographies, the good countries, okay, but on top of that the flexibility of the management not to change the model, but to adapt it to the new context is something very, very successful in 2009. And again that's the reason why I think we will be less secure at the end of 2008 looking to 2009 than now looking to 2010.</p>
          <p>So we are in a very difficult context everywhere, if you just look at what are the discussion about Greece and this and that. But clearly for us if we look at 2010 we are more confident in our ability to deliver what we expect than when we said in 2008 the crisis is there. And if you remember, we were one of the first to say, no, no, no, no, listen, even in the emerging countries there will be a slowdown.</p>
          <p>Now because of the job we did, what we call the Reset, and I will not comment again the Reset, but it's a fact that we find our way to do the Reset for all our brands. I even want to say for the group, not only in term of pricing or whatever, we Reset totally the group and we did it in a context which was more easy than the context you will have tomorrow, because it's a fact that we decide to use or to leverage the positive impact of the raw material to develop the volume of our brands. Those who are going to do that next year will have more trouble to execute. So the strategy was a good one for sure, except that the most difficult thing is not to express a strategy. The most difficult thing is to deliver the results you expect from the strategy.</p>
          <p>And when I look at the figures we have in 2009, or the result we have in 2009, clearly the management of this Company find their way to deliver what we expect from the strategy. So if you look at the trend and you will see that the trend quarter-per-quarter about our volume and obviously I am a little bit in advance than you. I am confident and the fact that if we are continued to work correctly as we are doing, 2010 will be a good year for Danone. With a huge pressure. I'm not saying it's going to be easier, I'm just saying I think we control better what we expect than at the end of 2008, because the visibility was far more difficult for us within the Company than it is now end of 2009.</p>
          <p>So I'm positive on 2009. I'm confident on 2010 and the best example to illustrate this confidence is the fact that last year we didn't give you target in term of top-line growth. And this year, as you saw, we gave mid-term target and we reconfirm for 2010 this plus five top-line growth, sales growth for 2010. I think that's the illustration of the, let's say, different mindset from last year.</p>
          <p>So now I will let Pierre-Andr&#xE9; going within all the figures and at the end with Emmanuel we will answer to your questions. Pierre-Andr&#xE9;?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Franck. This is Pierre-Andr&#xE9; speaking. I'll run you through the presentation on 2009 and then I will hand over to Emmanuel for discussion about the key assumptions and key priorities, we see for 2010.</p>
          <p>So what about 2009? I'll start with the snapshots on the result of the year, which as you can see can be summarized in three elements. The first of them is a strong, solid, very solid operational performance. You can see that when looking at the growth of the operating income on a like-for-like basis, which has grown 7%, when you look at the growth of the net income, which has grown 7% reported and 11% like-for-like. And of course when you look at the strength of the operating free cash flow, which has grown more than 20% on the reported basis.</p>
          <p>So that's obviously a demonstration of the strength of this year but on top of that you have two additional elements which have impacted the numbers. The first of them is the impact of different exchange. As you know, a number of emerging currencies plus the pound have depreciated strongly toward the very end of 2008. We have therefore been going through a very different base of comparison on the currency basis in 2009. And this has impacted all of our figures, ranging from three to 4% depending on which KPI you look at. You can see that for instance in the difference between the evolution of the like-for-like sales growth and the reported sales growth.</p>
          <p>The third element is obviously the rights issue which we have going through in May and June of this year, which obviously have an impact on the EPS, diluted impact of 7% as we expected, which of course has benefited us in terms of reshaping of the financial future of the group. With the net debt at the end of this year, which amounts to &#x20AC;6.5 billion, down by more than &#x20AC;4 billion versus a year ago and down versus the one &#x2013; the level we had at the end of June by approximately &#x20AC;500 million.</p>
          <p>So all these elements, of course, shape very much the performance of 2009. There is another one, which is not visible on this screen but I will go through it and that's obviously the acceleration of the top line and the real transformation I just note we've gone through in 2009.</p>
          <p>If you look at the evolution of the sales, you can see right away the impact of the foreign exchange, which has been a negative 3.4% on the reported sales. This is a direct consequence of the translation of our accounts in &#x2013; of results in Brazilian reais, in Latin American currency, generally speaking, in ruble, in zloty, in Indonesian rupiah, which have all depreciated against euro throughout the year 2009 and therefore had impacted on sales and other KPIs on the reported basis negatively.</p>
          <p>Next to currencies, the deconsolidation of Frucor, our beverage operation in Australasia, which was disposed during the first quarter of 2009 has equally impacted the sales by 1.4%. And then you come to the operational performance, the like-for-like evolution of sales, which is 3.2 with another noticeable difference versus what we've been going through for the past few years. And that is the fact that the volume growth has been higher than the sales growth and this is of course reflecting predominantly the Resets plans, the adjustments we've made through the Reset plan, principally in our Dairy division and principally of course in the second half.</p>
          <p>When you look in fact at the same chart for the last quarter, you see very much the same picture but with different numbers. On the currency side, to come back on that and this will be the last one, an impact which is even stronger than it has been as an average for the year. This is due to the fact that on top of the depreciation of emerging currency, Q4 has been marked by a weakness of the U.S. dollar. Obviously I was saying this is probably the last time we show that kind of impact, because as we move to 2010, we'll be moving to comparison basis, which will be very different and therefore having very different numbers, neutral or slightly positive, if I take the assumption of the current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>So consolidation is no different, and the operating performance is of course of the same nature but very different as growth of sales has reached in Q4 5.5% versus 3.2 as an average for the year and as the volume element has reached a growth which is outstanding at 8.9% for the quarter. The acceleration of sales has allowed us in Q4 to show reported sales which are in line with that of last year and not negative anymore.</p>
          <p>The key chart perhaps of this presentation and this year is the one here on the screen at the moment, so it's Page Six. This is the reflection of the adjustments we have made to our model throughout the year. With again it's applying growth trends, which have gone from a low 1% in Q1 to a 5.5% in Q4.</p>
          <p>And this adjustment has been achieved through Baby and Medical Nutrition being substantially at the same speed as before. Now there are some differences but in a sense still being very resilient and growing. But on the other hand, Water business, which has accelerated in emerging and stabilizing in Western European countries and therefore is showing in a quarter which is not impacted by weather condition, positive sales evolution.</p>
          <p>And the Dairy division which has simply gone up by six points from minus one to &#x2013; minus 1.2 to 4.6% of sales and is now growing at close to 5%. So this is obviously key and it's key when we think about 2010 and the pace of growth which we have when entering into the year.</p>
          <p>I'll now go through the performance by division starting with Dairy. So again a solid performance, particularly in Q4. An outstanding volume growth, 9.9%, which has been translated into 4.6% growth of our sales. The key brands as usual have been driving the growth. This is the case of Activia, this is the case of Danacol. This has been the case of Actimel, which was weak at the beginning of the year and is now back to significant growth pace. This is the case in overall of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>When we look at the countries, I told you in Q3, we had now been moving to a positive volume and value growth in the vast majority of the country. This is obviously confirmed for Q4 with some further improvements, in particular in countries, which I mentioned on the screen i.e. the U.S., where we have definitely back to double-digit growth of our volume and sales are doing very, very well.</p>
          <p>With Brazil that's been continuously okay. With China, where we have now built a market share of more than 15% in the region of Shanghai with Europe, with Japan which remains extremely strong. So an overall performance, I mean a strong performance, which is not only true at the level of the division, but true in again the vast majority of the countries, if not all of them.</p>
          <p>This is reflected obviously by the market share, which importantly we think has been improving. And this improvement is a long-lasting improvement. We have improved the market share in, again, the vast majority of the markets. Obviously not in exactly all of them and you can see Argentina, which has shown some decline, but for the rest of the market, whether it's France, Poland, the U.S. importantly Czech Republic, Germany, U.K. and even Russia, we are clearly on positive trends for the market share and this is helping the growth.</p>
          <p>Obviously all that has been the direct translation of the Resets, which mean an exercise which has led us to adjust the range depending on the countries to be a bit more strong in promotions, to change formats, to launch new products, to launch new format with bigger format in some cases. And it has led not only to a strong rebound in the growth of our volumes but also to some negative pricing impact.</p>
          <p>What you see on the chart is very important, i.e. that having now completed the Resets, and we have done everything which we had to do by the end of 2009, we are now at the peak of this negative pricing effect with a 5.3% negative and we are now going to move progressively back to a zero level as we enter progressively quarter-after-quarter to the first anniversary of the Reset. And for instance in Q1 will be the first anniversary of the Reset in Poland and then we'll be progressively moving into the same basis for different countries.</p>
          <p>What I said about the repositioning also translates into innovation, innovation in our key brands. With Activia, which we keep stretching, and this is a fundamental element of strength of the brand, you can see Activia sales, which is being launched in U.S., you can see Activia Breakfast type, which is predominantly launched in Western Europe but also now in some other countries.</p>
          <p>You can see Danonino, which is typically a cheese product, a fresh cheese product, but which we are now going to launch in yoghurt form, which means that we can stretch the brand as well in this case. You can see it as well with Densia, which has been a success this year in Spain and is now being tested in the south of France for a launch we hope in 2010.</p>
          <p>So we're innovating, renovating in many of our key brands. We also make a force of innovation, renovation locally. And you can see for instance the single serve Light &amp; Fit in the U.S., which is one of the elements which has participated into the performance. The single serve is of course a format which is very specific to the U.S. and depending on the market, market-by-market, we also make an effort to adapt to formats to the local taste.</p>
          <p>Same thing for Russia, where we have launched an Eco Yoghurt, which is working pretty well as we speak. So this is for Dairy. Again a lot of things and a very positive performance in this fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Waters is equally important to remember that we have been going through a negative sales trend at the end of 2008, very beginning of 2009, under the pressure of the market in most of industrialized countries, i.e. France, U.K., Germany, Spain and Japan. We've done a lot ourselves plus with the industry to try and defend the category, which in our view is a very important and useful category.</p>
          <p>And I have flagged that in Q3 we started seeing some results. This is absolutely confirmed in Q4 with trends in terms of consumption in France, U.K. and Germany, which have stabilized. So obviously there is still work to do. We need to consolidate that. We need as well to address the situation of the Spanish market, which is being very difficult but we are now getting, as we expected, the result of this strategy with the stabilization of trends in industrialized countries.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, and that's the second element which is very important, emerging countries keep progressing and they keep accelerating in fact with the rate of growth of sales which has reached &#x2013; which has exceeded, sorry, 15% in the fourth quarter. So overall this is obviously putting the division into dynamic which is improving with time and which allows it to deliver, absent from the impact from the weather condition, and that's important, a positive sales growth in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Baby Nutrition, again a very solid and positive quarter. Solid and positive because as you remember we have a very challenging comparison base in Q4 for business in China. That's been the case, which means that this 7% is reflecting the strength of our performance in China but also in the other part of the world.</p>
          <p>The food segment continued to be under pressure and being weak so the improvement is mainly coming from the formula markets, and in particular from the fact that we are now putting a lot of effort behind the second brand of IFFO [infant formula and follow-on milks], which is Bebelac. Bebelac is being rolled out progressively in different countries and that's participating to the performance.</p>
          <p>I would just add in the case of Baby that Indonesia has had a really very, very good quarter this quarter with a performance of growth of more than 20%. And this of course has helped the result of the division, which are again very positive for the quarter.</p>
          <p>When talking about innovation, again we have the same approach. So we keep innovating with three things to be mentioned. You can see Bebelac on the top right in China, which has been introduced at the very end of Q3 and is progressively giving results.</p>
          <p>With Gizikita, which is being tested at the moment in Indonesia with very positive result. Gizikita is a product which is addressing the levels C and D in terms of categories on the permit. So people with low income and which is providing them an alternative, completing our range while we already have Nutricia on the premium side, we already have <mark type="inaudible" /> on the plain side, and then we complete that with Gizikita.</p>
          <p>On the bottom right, you can see an attempt to launch a fresh dairy Baby product, which we called Bobovita Yoghurts in Russia. We think that's a promising initiative. Of course it's very early to comment on performance, but that's an important launch. And as in Dairy, we innovate as well on the local basis with extension of the Bio line of our products in Germany, which is of course pretty important and with Les Id&#xE9;es de Maman for instance in France, as you can see on the bottom left.</p>
          <p>Medical Nutrition is the last of our division. Well I mean just to confirm that this division has very strong and resilient growth trends performance of 13.6% this quarter, which is probably a bit in access of the long-term trend growth of this division. But again it remains very solid.</p>
          <p>One of the events for the year has been the launch and therefore the contribution to the result of Fortimel Compact, which has been an innovation. There are many other innovation in the pipe in many different fields and we'll continue trying to grow this division at the same pace. So let's keep on the innovation, you have for some of them already seen them.</p>
          <p>I've said that one of the important elements beyond the evolution of the top line was the fact that we have an improvement and a good performance consistently across the division. We also have an improvement and a good performance consistently across the geographies.</p>
          <p>Asia obviously remains strong as it has been for the past quarters. But we have, versus the beginning of the year, improved in Europe. And when we say improved in Europe, it's throughout Europe, in Western Europe and in the rest of Europe, so a solid performance of the European market. And we have as well very importantly improved our performance in the Rest of the World, being for a major part of that Americas with the U.S., of course, but also with Latin America.</p>
          <p>I'll now switch to comments about the operating income and margin. You can see on the chart the operating income of the group, which is for this year 2.5 &#x2013; &#x20AC;2,511 million. This is composed of two elements, elements which we called as other operating items, which are non-recurring in nature with an amount of 270 million. I'll come back on that. And trading operating income amounting to 2,294 million, which means that we are delivering this year a margin of 15.31%.</p>
          <p>On the other operating items of 217 million, this is composed of mainly two items. One is the capital gain on the disposal of Frucor for an amount in excess of &#x20AC;300 million. And the second item is the contribution to the Eco &#x2013; Danone Eco System Fund at the beginning of the year for an amount of &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>So an evolution of margin which is as well very marked this year. First of all steep improvement. Secondly negative impact from the scope with Frucor, from the translation and country mix of course with the faster development in countries which have suffered from weak currency this year. And then a like-for-like evolution of 61 basis points, which is composed of two main elements.</p>
          <p>One of them is the evolution of input costs and when you read the evolution of input costs you should notice that two parts contribute to it. One part, approximately two third of it is the evolution of the nominal price on the market. One third of that is productivity, which has been delivered by the purchasing, the industrial departments of the Group.</p>
          <p>In front of that we have of course progressively throughout the year reinvested these amounts and given that, part of the benefits from the lower, mid-price for instance to the consumer through the Resets. And this gives you an element, other, which is negative for 301 basis points, and which is mainly composed of this pricing and format adjustments. Again this leads us to 15.31% margin for the year.</p>
          <p>When you look &#x2013; and that's a very important chart as well to look at our performance for the year. When you look at what this means in terms of dynamics for the past two years it means that we have in two years improved our margins on a like-for-like basis by more than 110 basis points, being the additional 53 last year and 61 this year, so that's obviously a very strong improvement.</p>
          <p>And in terms of reporting margins we have improved by 200 basis points. The difference between 110 and 200 being obviously questions of perimeter scope and in particular the integration of the new &#x2013; of the two new divisions of the group in the perimeter. So that's for the evolution for the past two years.</p>
          <p>Obviously another point which is to be kept in mind is the debalancing, strong debalancing of the margin this year, which is easily explainable as we have for the whole year benefited from lower level of input cost, but we have progressively and predominantly in the second half reinvested these elements in &#x2013; to fuel the topline. So a very strong margin in the first half, more that 16%, margin in second half which is 14.6. And therefore accounts for next year which will be significantly debalanced.</p>
          <p>Again, if you look at the evolution of margins by division &#x2013; Page 21, sorry. If you look at the evolution of the margins by division and by geography you can see that the improvement of margin has been consistent throughout the geographies with approximately the same level everywhere, a little bit faster in Asia.</p>
          <p>By division, Fresh Dairy has improved the margins on the basis of lower cost of milk, productivity and on the other hand the reinvestment have been mentioning. The same applies in terms of cost of milk to Baby Nutrition, but with no real reinvestment. And on the other hand, with the last part of the synergies of acquisition of Numico in the first half of this year, this leads to an improvement of 200 basis point for Baby Nutrition.</p>
          <p>In the case of Medical Nutrition, the negative, which is essentially driven by the first half. The margins in the second half have been growing slightly and which is driven by some limited one-off. The underlying margins of the Medical remain stable or slightly growing.</p>
          <p>And last Waters. Margins have been growing, which means that the positive mix effect since the level of margins in emerging countries is now very significantly higher than the level of margins in industrialized countries. So the positive mix effect plus lower cost of plastic essentially have been stronger than the negative leverage which we have continued to suffer, in particular in the first part of the year in the industrialized part of the business.</p>
          <p>I'll now move to the last part of the P&amp;L. Moving to Page 22, from operating income to net income, so the structure of the table is the following for 2009. You have the full year 2009, which is being split into two parts, the underlying part on the extreme right and non-current items on &#x2013; in the column in the middle.</p>
          <p>On the non-current items, I've already given some explanation about the 217. The 105 negative on the financial charges is a reflection of the cost of restructuring of the debts, which have allowed us to lower the cost of debt for the second part of 2009 and the following years, and to adjust the structure to the new total amount of net debt we have. The net income of affiliates reflects the capital loss on the disposal of Wahaha, which is obviously an accounting topic but which is for an amount of approximately &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>The second element being an impairment on our investment in Huiyuan, which as you know, following the removal of the offer from Coke and the anti-trust decision from the Chinese authorities has lost significantly on the stock market. So an overall amount of minus 51, and then underlying income, which I've already covered for the margin part.</p>
          <p>One other comment about the financial items, which obviously decreased very significantly from 584 to &#x20AC;384 million. This is a direct result of two things, to get an increase on one hand, and obviously the restructuring of the debt for the other.</p>
          <p>One word about the tax rates, which has been stable versus last year as at 23.5% &#x2013; 23.4% on an underlying basis to be complete. We're seeing here and there some increase in the tax base or &#x2013; in the tax rate or in the composition of the tax basis. So we anticipate that this rate is going to be in the range of 24 to 25 for next year, so slightly up.</p>
          <p>This leads us to the EPS, so a few comments about that. First of all, the growth of the underlying net income at 1,412 million. But of course on the other hand a sharp increase in the number of shares on a diluted basis after &#x20AC;549 million shares diluted average for the year 2009, which lead us to an EPS of 2.57.</p>
          <p>On this basis the Board has decided to propose to the AGM of the 22nd of April a dividend which will remain stable at &#x20AC;1.20, which means an increase of the payout, but we think it was important to mark this sign of confidence we have in our ability to drive our cash flow up and in our financial structure.</p>
          <p>If we move to the next slide to see the evolution of the EPS, I think it better explains all the movements which had impacted it this year. You can see on the extreme left the reporting number of last year, &#x20AC;2.74 per share, which has been restated at 2.66 to take into account the distribution of preferential rights which has been made during the time of the capital increase.</p>
          <p>So the new basis is 266. We end up at 257 with different elements. Number one, dilution again in line as expected of 7% of the capital increase. Negative impact from the currency, 3.6. Scope 2.5. And then an underlying performance and underlying growth like-for-like of the EPS which has been just above 10% as we had flagged to the market for the year 2009.</p>
          <p>So the performance has been in many respect positive. There is one field in which it has been really outstanding and that's the growth of the operating free cash flow, which has reached &#x20AC;1,427 million on the reported basis for the year, which means that we have delivered an increase of more than 20% again on the reported basis and despite the impact of the currencies, which has been of approximately &#x20AC;80 million.</p>
          <p>The cash flow from operating activities is growing very strongly. This is made of the operating income plus some additional elements, in particular on the management of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The change in working capital shows a negative 92 while the working capital when you look at the balance sheet is improving by 100 million. So there's some accounting elements explaining that. But clearly this 92 has been impacted by the implementation of the LME in France, the Loi de Modernisation de l'Economie, which regulates the payment terms. And the FX which we have been putting in front of that which are positive can be found in the cash flow from operating activities.</p>
          <p>Overall the working capital again has improved and it has improved thanks to significant improvement which has been implemented in the Baby and in the Medical division. And the CapEx have remained about stable at 4.7% of sales and &#x20AC;700 million versus last year.</p>
          <p>When you look then at the rest of the cash flow statements, so you start with the free cash flow of &#x20AC;1,427 million. We have next to it disposed of several businesses this year. This is the case of Frucor, of course. This is the case as well of Wahaha. This is the case last of Britannia and overall this has represented a total proceeds of close to &#x20AC;900 million.</p>
          <p>Next to that you can see the effect from the capital increase of course. And then an investment of &#x20AC;148 million, which represents from most of it the buyback of the minority interest in Clover at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Altogether this has translated in a reduction of debt which amounts, which have exceeded &#x20AC;4 billion. And you can see that. I will conclude with it on the balance sheet where we now show a debt which is of &#x20AC;6.6 billion, which is down compared to the level we had at the end of June. The rest of the balance sheet remaining overall in line with the previous level, with the exception of the working capital again, which has improved.</p>
          <p>I will end my presentation of 2009 at this point and hand over to Emmanuel who is going to talk to you about the assumption and priorities for 2010. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. That's obviously not the button I should have pushed. I don't know if you can help me on this.</p>
          <p>Maybe a quick flashback on the last few quarters. In November 2008, we shared with you the fact that our main assumption was that the financial crisis was going to be an economic crisis and at some point in time a social crisis. And we said that we felt emerging markets would not be immune against these effects. This was the last quarter of 2008 and at that time we had been delivering a fourth quarter of plus 6% like-for-like growth, sales growth.</p>
          <p>Then we entered into several quarters of transformation. We took decisions in the Q1 of last year, '09. We executed those decisions in the Q2, Q3 and Q4 of '09. And I think I would say Q4 plus 5.5% like-for-like sales, welcome back to Danone's world.</p>
          <p>The reason we're now confident about the outlook is because in about nine months, we've been able to turn around the overall volume growth and equation &#x2013; value equation of our product offering while maintaining the growth of our margins, obviously leveraging the environment. But the environment had been significantly negative as you know from a milk-price standpoint in the previous year. So we are basically back now on our feet at a point where every item that we had assumed in terms of environment about a year and a half ago is unfolding as we felt it would.</p>
          <p>So in a sense on this Chart Number 30, you have what &#x2013; or how we look at our environment for 2010. What you can see is first of all we do not expect any solid rebound in consumption worldwide. We believe that the social issues, the job situation in the U.S., in Western Europe is actually going to create even more pressure on consumption than it has in the last 12 months, including because the fiscal stimuluses &#x2013; which occurred last year, will not occur this year and also because the jobless situation is starting to affect now the revenue of consumers.</p>
          <p>If you look at the U.S. for example, there has been an incredibly fast growth of or extension of the period of jobless for people, which today is creating concerns on their ability to consume. So we do not believe that 2010 is going to a year of rebound. Yet if you look at the top right chart, we believe emerging markets are going to continue to have a significant GDP growth gap versus Western Europe and the U.S. That has started to be the case already in the second half of last year and we think it will continue or even actually accelerate in 2010.</p>
          <p>Third point, input costs have been favorable, obviously after the very unfavorable situation for us in '08, has been favorable in '09. We believe they will be unfavorable in '10. And in particular when it comes to the milk price, our best estimate at this point in time is that there will be and there is already an increase in the skimmed milk powder price overall. We think that the peak of this is going to be somewhere in the first half of this year because there is no significant pressure from demand at this point in time.</p>
          <p>And in terms of fresh milk, which is most of our supply, we believe it's going to be more in the Q3 of this year in terms of peak. Same thing, we do not expect that there will be much pressure from the demand side this year. Overall we are expecting price inflation of roughly five to 7% in the milk situation.</p>
          <p>Currencies, maybe a year where euro will stabilize against a number of currencies. We would welcome that obviously. And for the time being this is what we are more or less forecasting in terms of environment.</p>
          <p>How do we look at our key priorities for '010? Basically three priorities: continue to strengthen our top-line growth; second, sustain our operating margins; and third, maintain our free cash flow focus. On the first one, we will look at continuing to strengthen our competitive positions as we have shared with you before in the vast majority of the countries where we operate.</p>
          <p>In 2009 we have gained market share and if you look at the blend of our geographies, we have indeed increased our market share in Dairy of 0.7 point of market share in 2009, more than one point in Baby food and around the same in Water. So 2009 has really been a year of steady, broad-based improvement of our market shares. We do not want that to change. So we will continue to be extremely competitively driven in 2010.</p>
          <p>Second, the negative value growth will gradually fade away for the obvious reasons with the Reset plans having taken place anywhere between Q2 and Q3 in most of our key countries in 2009, the comparison basis will gradually fade away. You should though expect overall probably still a negative price and mix effect on the full year basis, but this will be focused on the first half and the first half is likely to be two to three points negative in terms of mix and value and price effect.</p>
          <p>As a pure &#x2013; again as a pure mechanism of the basis of comparison, all our Reset plans are now behind us and we are now executing and unfolding the strategy. So it will mean that gradually we will emerge in the second half of 2010 with, I would say, a going situation in terms of management of the mix and value effect in our total portfolio.</p>
          <p>Third aspect, we will continue to strengthen our new geographies and seize new opportunities, in particular in Baby food and in Medical Nutrition. We've seen in 09 and we've shared with you in Amsterdam that we've been able to leverage the Danone presence in a number of countries to expand the geographies in which Baby food and Medical Nutrition are present.</p>
          <p>We think this is going to be a continued opportunity for '10. And we will invest, because that's a cost, we will continue to invest in growing our geographies and our businesses. You've seen that in 2009 there was a negative country effect of about 10 basis point. You should account for that to continue in '010. This is built in our assumptions today.</p>
          <p>Second big aspect of what we want to do in '010, sustain our operating margins. First of all, we shared with you last year that we had embarked into unprecedented programs of productivity within Danone, more about &#x20AC;500 million last year, which will have a long-lasting effect and some of them will have a trading effect into 2010. So we are already starting with that in our pocket, I would say, or in your pocket to start the year. And second we will continue to push hard. It will be a key priority. It is a priority to counter the effect of the cost inflation that we are forecasting for this year.</p>
          <p>Second assumption, we will be competitive in terms of selling-price management. We do not have today in our model any significant price increase. So this is something that we think is going to be a significant competitive advantage. It also means that we have some room for maneuver if we need to have. We were adamant I think in Amsterdam that we felt our competitors would probably have to raise prices before we would have to and this is what we see in the market currently.</p>
          <p>Third aspect of the margin, there will be a much more balanced margin equation for 2010 in H1 and H2. You've seen the more than 16% margin last year in the H1, 14.6 in the second quarter &#x2013; second half, sorry. And we expect to have a more balance, which mean that you should expect due to this basis of comparison, a significant decrease of the margin on H1 and a steady improvement on the H2. We've already given you I think this morning the overall equation and Franck reminded you earlier, we expect our margin to be stable this year and I'll come back to that.</p>
          <p>Third and last aspect, maintain our free cash flow focus. You've seen the very, very strong cash flow generation of 2009. We expect the focus to continue to be the same. It's been 10 years of focus for Danone, improving cash-conversion cycle, which is a unique Danone pattern in the whole food industry with a negative cash-conversion cycle. We've been converting our ex-Numico friends faster than we felt to this religion and we believe that we will continue to progress on that one.</p>
          <p>The last aspect of it is that we have restated our financial structure, balance sheet structure last year through the rights issue that we went through. We believe now this is absolutely the right balance that we have going forward with the volatile environment, uncertain environment that we have.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that we have what we need in terms of built-in, bolt-on, I would say, additional acquisitions to support the number one priority on this chart, continue to support top-line growth. So we believe we have what we need to make add-on acquisitions in emerging markets. The sort of acquisition that we did with Clover at the end of last year is really what we are looking for in our key emerging geographies.</p>
          <p>And as we've done over the last 10 years, we've been active on share buybacks, as you know, as a balancing element of our financial structure. The board yesterday has authorized the Company to reopen when and if we felt this was appropriate, the ability for us to do share buybacks exactly in the same way as we did in the past. So this is not an objective per se. This will be a balancing element and it's a sign for us of our board's confidence in our ability to both generate our free cash flow and maintain our financial structure with our acquisition plan as it stands for today.</p>
          <p>If I turn a little bit more specific in terms of numbers for 2010, it means that we will be delivering more than 5% top-line growth for this year like-for-like. We expect our free cash flow to be beyond 10% in growth and this is in reported, so hard currency euro, the same way the 20% was in 2009.</p>
          <p>And we expect our EBIT margin to be stable, which again if you look at it from our perspective, it means that H1 will be the final transformational half year for Danone through these significant changes of our environment. And we will emerge with the second part of the year being ongoing situation from our growth EBIT margin and cash flow standpoint.</p>
          <p>The last thing is that &#x2013; sorry, I go back. The last thing is that this is in the context of reconfirming obviously the mid-term perspective that we have shared with you in Amsterdam which is that we expect for the next three years to deliver year-after-year more than 5% top-line growth, like-for-like each year, year-by-year. And we expect our cash flow generation to reach &#x20AC;2 billion by 2012.</p>
          <p>We believe 2009 and our confidence in 2010 on that line are a good signs that we have a credible roadmap on this objective. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay. Do you have questions.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. <mark type="inaudible" /> Securities. I had a few questions on some one Emmanuel has answered well, which was concerning the management of margin in H1. The first question is concerning your guidance in term of EBIT margin for the full year '010, because if we look your expectations in terms of milk prices, which is between plus five to plus 7%, and if we regain the rebound of those materials, I fully agree that you have been treating good cost, it's not so huge. On top of that you have productivity gains and on top of that you have &#x2013; you are expecting continuing volume growth. And so we could expect positive operating leverage from this volume growth. And so could you guide us a little bit more on how you expect to manage the margins during the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question which is related to the first one. Do you expect progressively pricing effect going to 0% in Q2 or in Q3? Have you some expectations concerning mix price effect we can expect quarterly for the year?</p>
          <p>And the last question is, you spoke about increasing competitive pressure, but are you quite cautious concerning margins for full year '010 mainly because you want to take more percentage in term of gaining market shares? Or are you fearing about an increase of further competitive pressures in some local markets arguing the fact that last year probably it was more difficult for some local competitor to respond to your Reset prices. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will start and my colleagues may complement. I think the main reason why margin will decrease compared to last year in the first half is due to the Reset Program. Everything that you've said is true in terms of cost inflation. The fact is that I said roughly we will have two to three points. If you say, 2.5 points negative out of about &#x20AC;8 billion of sales on the first half of this year, means roughly you will be at a bit less than &#x20AC;200 million negative. So this is given and this is the reason why there will be such a debalance in the margin equation in terms of growth, change in the margin in H1 versus H2.</p>
          <p>Overall, we expect that H1 and H2 will be rather balanced in terms of what the margin will be. If we tell you it's about 15.3%, this should be not far from 15.3%, each of the two halves years. This is not a guidance. I'm just saying it will be much more balanced than it was last year, in terms of where the margins will unfold due to the fact that there is no big change this year, we're just executing.</p>
          <p>I also said that we expect the full year to be slightly negative in terms of pricing. It means that if you have minus 2.5 somewhere in the H1 you will have less than this positive in H2. At this point in time we won't be more specific, but it also means that we will be therefore positive in H2. And that's why I'm saying H2 we would emerge on a sort of going situation having taken into account the fact that so far we have not built in any significant price increases in those numbers. So it will be more mix than price, obviously for the second half of the year. Anybody wants to add anything? Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A follow-up on this first question. First, can you come back just on the reason why the &#x2013; after the minus 2.5 effect in H1 you'll have less positive in H2. Is it because of a strong impact in &#x2013; I think you had Spain and Russia to address in Q4. Will this &#x2013; how do we explain such a situation in terms of pricing is not neutral in 2010? But the more important question is, beyond 2010 you say in H2 we'll come back to a normal situation after the Resets. How do you see, given the new price positioning in your business, volumes that came back? How do you see the kind of margin expansion you can reach in normal years, assuming no rebound in consumption? Just offsetting these pricing impacts 2009, 2010 can we continue to assume margin growth in 2011, 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question, I will make it clear again. We expect pricing to be overall slightly negative this year with a negative 2.5, but don't quote me on the exact number for the first half, and therefore positive on the second half. The only reason why this is, is because most of our Reset programs have been achieved during Q2 last year, a bit in Q3. So we will emerge from that with a comparison basis that will gradually fade away and therefore we will be back to normal. And I said, there is no price increase and therefore most of the gains on that front in the H2 will be coming from value and mix, not price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of where we go, I think we all understand that Danone model is about profitable growth. We haven't guided on margin for the mid term so do not expect me to give anything more than this, but this is what we have always been working on and that hasn't changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[French] Sorry, guys. Hi. It's &#x2013; my name hasn't changed, Cheuvreux. The slide is Number 10. I have one question. It's always a difficult exercise to split what is mix and what is price in your value factor. Should we assume that mix throughout the quarters in Dairy has been basically constant? And what is the number, if I may? The second question is actually on Spain. The put option has gone from 2.9 to 3.1. I know there are various bits and pieces here, but it suggests that Spain has actually grown profit or at least net profit while not gaining share, if I look at Slide Number Nine. So could you just update us on what has been going on in Danone Spain Dairy market share-wise, profit-wise? It will help us reading what may happen to that put. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take the two questions actually. On the first one, it's the mix element has indeed been stable throughout the year between the 0.5 and the 0.7%. And that's the case in Q4 as well, so in positive of course. For Dairy absolutely we have positive mix element in Dairy, 0.5 to 0.7 throughout the year.</p>
          <p>With respect to Spain, so to start with the business first, I would say that in Q4, as in all the other quarters, Spain has been very resilient with one exception, which is the Mercadona situation as you know, which has improved a bit. But excluding this situation, Spain has maintained market share, has maintained sales with overall flat sales and therefore has maintained its overall performance.</p>
          <p>What you say about the put is, of course, valid for not only Spain but for the sum of the puts. So you can not read directly the amount of the increase allocated to Spain. But indeed Spain has been one of the elements growing and this is due to the formula, which is not as straight as a number of times of the current profits but a bit more complex than that. It's basically a multiple on an average and this explains the reason why this is &#x2013; this keeps growing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps just one point on Mercadona. It seemed that this retail campaign changed positively for us, in view about the number of brands, let's say number of SKUs per brands, still playing the leading brand, but coming back to more SKUs and that was last year. So very new information, which is good news obviously.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Susanne Seibel from Barclays Capital. I've got two questions. Could you give us a little bit of your indications what retailers, your trade partners in Europe are doing? You'll be looking back on a highly promotional 2009 and clearly that was also part of the Reset Program. How do you see the retail landscape, the promotional landscape unfold in 2010 and beyond, given all the development on consumer confidence and consumer spending that we see? My second question is, would you please give us a little bit more of an indication about your situation in emerging markets? You've been talking about improving your footprint in Asia and in Latin America. Maybe you could give us a little bit more color and what is happening right there? What you're doing? How you progress in these markets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To have a clear vision about the retailers in Europe is not so easy. First of all the last five years everybody was saying brands are dead and hard discounts are gaining share and everything is dead. And it's like for the human being at the moment of time you must react, not because of us, but even within the same retail company you see how they have to deal, for example, in France with the hypermarket channel. And they react and they gain share, and the hard discount are not declining but let's say stabilized. Means within this, brands are gaining market share. So again the context is not so easy for retailers just running after being the lowest price proposition for the consumer, which is putting pressure because they have to find the money to achieve that kind of target. So obviously they ask money to their supplier to help them.</p>
          <p>But it's, as I said, since now, I don't know, 20 years, it's a classic game. But that's the reason why we always said that we want to be number one with a gap with the number two and this country-per-country. Even if Emmanuel gave to you global market share figures at the world level or at where we are in the country we are, basically we follow that country-per-country and because we know the end game. The end game we'll be the number one perhaps <mark type="inaudible" /> was number two. And at the end private label and what we call in France first price. And it's already the case, if you look at Spain for example.</p>
          <p>So the vision we have is, or the vision I have is a positive one, because more and more, both of us, we can't find a solution just within our company. We must work together so perhaps that was a wishy washy few years ago, but clearly now if I look at the way we work with Carrefour, with Leclerc, with Walmart, with <mark type="inaudible" />, all of them we have business plan, we have long-term objectives and we know what do we have to put behind this to deliver the result.</p>
          <p>And it's direct linked to your second question, what are we doing in the emerging countries? Exactly the same, if we look at for example what we did in Bangladesh with Yunus, okay. You just think that because the price is lower you will sell more, wrong, wrong, wrong. If that was the story everybody will develop top-line growth in volume. And we have quite good example illustrating to you that it's not so easy. Obviously we don't disclose the, what I call the kitchen, the way we do, because that's the secret. That's the secret de fabrication, how to implement.</p>
          <p>You are talking about promotion, question before. Promotion, what is it the promotion, to reduce the price? No. It's to increase the quantity you sell per unit, which is far better for your margin and better for the consumer. So the knowledge of the consumer is a real battle, especially in the emerging country. Pierre-Andr&#xE9; explained to you the success we have in Indonesia. Do we reduce the price in Baby food? Answer, no. Because especially in the emerging country where the buying power is less, if you reduce the price of your Baby food products, you will lose market share, because it's a question directly in between quality and price. So is it a reason not to look at the consumer having not the buying power to buy your, let's say, expensive product? No, our job is to find the right answer to the consumer and that's the reason why we launched this product in Indonesia. And obviously as usual in Danone, if it is a success in a country we will roll out in the other one. Because the only thing we know, the best we know is to roll out the best practice and we are organized to do that as quick as possible.</p>
          <p>So in the emerging countries, and I will not give you the figures but when I look at the Reset we did, for example, in Mexico, now we grow in Dairy in Mexico double digit but the first trend is not to one, even not two, could be in some months a three in term of volumes. So the way we look the emerging country is, yes, that the place we can rebuild top-line growth and margin because the best answer &#x2013; all the answers of Emmanuel was very good, but the best one for me is, no, no, we didn't change profitable top-line growth. That's our only objective but to do this, we have different ways to achieve. And is it more difficult for us or for the other next year? No.</p>
          <p>And I come back to the previous question about competition. Is it easiest for the competition to answer to our Reset plan next year? That was easier last year. That was definitively easier last year, because everybody, everybody, every companies, was benefiting of the raw material impact, the positive one. So tomorrow you will have to answer not having the positive impact of the raw material, so it's going to be tougher to deliver a Reset plan. Not for us. It's done. So that the way we use a question to, as usual, to answer to many users. But that the way we are looking to 2010 and that's the reason why we are, let's say, more confident in our model for 2010, even if the model was also good in 2009.</p>
          <p>But just to come back to the emerging country, if you take Water, okay everybody was saying the last two years that Water is dead. If I listen everybody, everything is dead anyway, so. Except that, okay, good news this year, the seasonality was okay. I just remind that seasonality is part of the characteristic of the Water business, as all beverage business. Second, obviously we have now, as Pierre-Andr&#xE9; said, a very nice vision because we just inverse the equation, margin are better in the emerging country where we grow double digit. First of all because we work better, second because we achieve critical mass, which help us to improve margin, and yes, because in the major country it's tougher. I would like to have the right equation without what I said on the major country, but it's a fact.</p>
          <p>Does it mean we have just to focus on emerging country? Yes. And we have different tools. Obviously we have Mexico. We have Indonesia. We have China. But we have also the very nice story we had right now is Bonafont not in Mexico, which is very nice story, but in Brazil. In Brazil in the region of Sao Paulo, we are now leading the market. We test the same concept in Poland, and we test the same one in China. So we are going to leverage this positioning in emerging country, but every time we find a solution to stabilize in a major market, we increase the leverage and the growth we have in the emerging country. So we will continue to drive both emerging and mature one.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Fran&#xE7;ois Digard from Natixis Securities. My question is maybe a follow-up to Franck's comments, and you mentioned your intention to size opportunities. In the meantime you refer to bolt-ons, which are rather small in term of size and the wish to balance your cash equation by buyback. So clearly the intention is not to do large acquisition. So when you think about sizing opportunities, I guess it is something about competition and competition landscape. So could you elaborate on how you could use the fact that you have already visited that some have not on that &#x2013; in which market do you see significant opportunities to not kill, but at least leverage your scale over your competitors? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think kill is not the right wording. No, in term of acquisition I think we already comment this. As Emmanuel explained, basically we want to open new countries. Are we going to open two, three, four, five new countries? Obviously the context impact us. It means last year we open, I think, two or three countries. We will continue to do it. The question is how are we going to open the countries with, let's say, starting from scratch? We did it. For example like in Egypt, we bought a very, very small, small, small company, not because of the company itself, because that help us to grow faster because you get the energy, you get the facilities, you get the trucks, you get the warehouse. In some countries you go much more faster by buying somebody, even if it is a very small one, than to start from the scratch.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we can also look at if there is somebody who help us to be more national than just regional. When we are talking about China, when we are talking about India, when we are talking about Russia, even the U.S. or Brazil, we are talking about continent. We call it country, but it's a continent. So if &#x2013; I'm just giving you very frankly example. If there is a small guy in the Northeast of Brazil helping us to go faster to develop or to roll out the Bonafont concept, yes, we can take over this one, if he wants obviously. So that will classify mid-sized acquisition.</p>
          <p>Now about the big, big one, and I'm always saying the same answer. You know better than me the food business. So I will transfer the question to you. Just give me an example of a company fitting with the strategy of Danone, which is totally impacting the balance sheet of the company. Me, I don't know one. Perhaps you know one. Okay, I know everybody is talking about this American baby food company and I already answer. I said no, spare part, which is exactly what I said previously. Perhaps, but it's not the situation. So the answer is no comment. We don't have to comment on that.</p>
          <p>So that said, how are we going to build the future of Danone? That will be new geographies, through acquisition, small average. I really don't know what does it means until we clearly have a target. Starting from scratch, launching new product, opening new country with our classical product or, even more important, country where we are but where one of the businesses is not. For example, when we launched Bonafont in Brazil, we leveraged the distribution system of the Dairy business. So more and more we are going to see how we can open new countries by launching new product or product existing in other countries but not in this one, leverage the organization we have.</p>
          <p>The only new vision we have about countries is &#x2013; was just explained. For me to go in the Eastern part of Russia is a new country, even if we are already very strong as you know in Russia. To be very strong in another part of China than Shanghai is a new country for me. And we are ready to build a structure, means &#x2013; you know that we are organized through business unit per business per country. I have a business unit Dairy in Shanghai. We are ready to create a business unit in another city, or let's say, region. If you look at Shanghai, at the end that will be three times Belgium, so it's a country. So that's the new vision we have.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Warren Ackerman from Evolution. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Warren Ackerman here at Evolution. Three questions, first one, can you update us on the growth in Q4 on your Dairy blockbusters? Particularly interested to hear about the improvements in Actimel. Secondly, on cash flow, obviously a very good performance, very impressive. What's driving that improvement in cash flow? I didn't understand the point on the working capital. And what was the actual underlying working capital? And finally could we get an update on the EFSA situation? You gave us a helpful update in Amsterdam but since then there's been a lot of media coverage on infant nutrition and on Actimel and Activia. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Emmanuel speaking. Thank you, Warren. On the blockbusters, they have continued to drive the overall growth of the Dairy business in Q4 as before. Activia is double-digit growth and Actimel is back to growth, double-digit in volume but significant pricing negative effect as we are exactly at the worst period of comparison since we started the Reset programs. But Actimel is growing.</p>
          <p>In terms of the EFSA, we are in the middle of the process with our dossiers on Activia and Actimel being reviewed as we speak, so I think we will learn more in the coming few or several weeks, possibly months, but maximum month. I think by the end of the second quarter, we will have a clear view of what the EFSA opinion is on these dossiers. That's in essence where we are with EFSA. We had a negative opinion on one of the claims on Baby food, which is one &#x2013; which we use on a quite limited basis. It's about &#x20AC;200 million of sales in total. For us the process that took place for this one just shows that EFSA process is not yet optimal to say the least. We've been advocating for, as you know, since about a year actually, a change in the process and in the way EFSA has a dialogue with applicants. We are actually in the dialogue phase on that particular application with them. So it's an overall learning process on both sides.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cash flow, it's really the improvement is really driven by a combination of three elements. First of all the operating income of course, secondly by the working capital improvement we've made in the Baby and Medical division with the working capital, which has now reached minus 2% &#x2013; sorry, with the cash flow, yeah, with the working capital which has reached, sorry, minus 2% in percentage of sales. So we are now negative on the sum of the two divisions and this is primarily driven by the Baby division, which means that overall the working capital of the group has improved further going from 6% of sales to 7% of sales negative i.e. being a resource for the group. And the last element in which we have operated improvement is the management of tax, not from a P&amp;L standpoint, but from a cash standpoint. We have in some countries tax credits to recover and we've activated that. So altogether these three elements have participated to the improvement of our free cash flow by 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And &#x2013; sorry the 92 million outflow, what would that number have been excluding that one-off you were talking about in France? It sounds like it would have been a big improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, that would have been positive for about &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the average free cash flow would have been nearer 1.6 billion than 1.4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon Marshall-Lockyer from Cheuvreux (sic) [Jefferies International] . Just three questions, please. One, on Baby, can you give us an update? You showed a very nice chart in terms of market share progressions in Fresh Dairy. I just wondered whether you could give us some indication of how you exited 2009 in terms of your Baby shares maybe in Europe and Asia, just in terms of the regional progressions, which seem to have been continuing and if anything, stepped up? You commented at the time of the seminar regarding the fact that Nestl&#xE9; doesn't seem to have reacted very much so far and we've been anticipating that since the Numico deal. We are still waiting. Could you &#x2013; have you seen any movement there in terms of any change in your major competitor, maybe?</p>
          <p>Second question is on CapEx. Given the fact that you seem to be stepping up the investments that you're making in emerging markets, you are putting a big focus there. Should we expect longer term in the mix of your CapEx that, that CapEx rate is likely to rise, although it's already, what, 4.7% currently run rate of sales. Do you think that implicitly, the step up of growth and investment in emerging markets means a rising trend of CapEx spend?</p>
          <p>And finally for Franck, in the first half last year, you had that deep discounted rights issue raising &#x20AC;3 billion, approximately. Now the management are indicating that the cash flow situation is so much better, you're considering share buybacks. Obviously today the share price is around &#x20AC;50. At the time it was quite a deeply discounted rights issue. How do you bridge that? Obviously, there's been a lot of water under that bridge, but maybe you could help us think about that in terms of shareholder value? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll take dues. On the Baby issue, that we've seen Nestl&#xE9; coming with more aggressive stunts, with more innovation, among other things, and that's been a real positive for the market evolution, i.e. the efforts put by Nestl&#xE9; and by Danone together and the other players in the market have, we believe, been a factor of strength of the market.</p>
          <p>When you look at the evolution of our market share, as Emmanuel indicated during the speech, we've been &#x2013; we've continued progressing for about one point on our geographies this year. We've not shown the charts simply for reasons of space, but we basically keep gaining market share everywhere. That's been true-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Especially in France.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In France, that's been true in Indonesia, that's been true in China, following the melamine crisis, that's been true in the U.K., so that's been true in 99% of the geographies. Perhaps there is one which is not where we find that, but none which is a major one. So we keep being on the market, which is, I think, well animated by the food players, among other, Nestl&#xE9; and Danone, and in this environment, we keep gaining market share in this market.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx, that's a fair question which I believe we have answered in Amsterdam saying that we target the medium term CapEx rate around 4.5. Around 4.5 means it can be 4.7, it could go up to five some years, but with no significant step-up considering the current strategy. Why? Because, yes, this will require additional CapEx but A., we have in the past three years developed ways to enter new geographies at a cheaper cost in terms of CapEx. We have decreased the cost of entrance in terms of CapEx return. And number two; we keep improving the rest of the CapEx equation. So overall, we are still targeting the same, i.e. around 4.5%.</p>
          <p>Then before maybe Franck complements, if he wants, on the rights issue and the share buyback, first of all, the stock price is not yet, I hope it will be soon, but not yet at 50. Secondly, no, no, it's fine. But it's a good guess. Secondly, we've &#x2013; there is two significant factors which have changed since then and these two factors are the acceleration of the generation of free cash flow, which I've mentioned, and which have led us not only to a steep increase this year, but also to a guidance medium term of &#x20AC;2 billion, which is equivalent to a double-digit growth and frankly, this is a result of the acceleration of the progress we've made in Baby and Medical in particular in the past six months. So this is a result.</p>
          <p>And number two, we've been able to execute some disposals which we did not as certainly have at the time of the rights' issue. I am taking Wahaha as an example. So overall, the strength of the cash flow puts us, we think, again in the possibility to manage our balance sheet as we have done it in the past, through share buyback, among other things. And I think that's very important because when we came to see you during the rights issue, we said that we had for the past been adjusting our financial structure with our buyback and that we will continue going in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think I have anything to add on Pierre-Andr&#xE9; said and especially also on what Emmanuel said during the presentation. But as I explained within the introduction, let's summarize that everybody is talking about the Reset, thinking about the brands. When I am talking about Reset, I am thinking about the Group.</p>
          <p>So the Reset and because of the crisis, so we leveraged the crisis not only resetting the brand, not only the price positioning of the brand, but I think we totally reset the company, not changing the mindset of the people, but just giving us all the tools we need to continue to build and to accelerate the building of the company. And the balance sheet is part of that. And if you listened what I said, clearly, there is no reason not to come back on what was the way we drive this in the past. And at the end, I think it's a real good illustration of the confidence of the Board on the ability of the management to continue to build the company mid-term, long-term. That the way I translate with my words.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, all. Three questions I had. Just firstly, if I look at the absolute organic profit growth development in the second half for Dairy, you're about 60 basis points down in margin, it looks like that went backwards in terms of organic profit growth. Can you just talk about whether your guidance that you talked about today assumes that you will actually get organic profit growth within the Dairy division in 2010 given what you also talked about in terms of the raw material movement?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just in terms of the growth profile next year, I guess what worries us a little bit is the consumer's got used to price point declining, the price point that got you some brand equity and brand support. All that's going to be maybe be different next year. They won't see a sequential price declines. What gives you the confidence that you continue to get movement in volume growth without that kind of optical price point reductions that you have enjoyed this year? And I guess tied into that, you talk about two to 3% positive pricing mix in the second half. So you're basically saying you have positive mix rather than price. I just wonder why you think you can get the mix level up from the current sort of 0.7% that you mentioned previously?</p>
          <p>And then finally, sorry, just a final question. Just in terms of the margin progression for 2009, you obviously guided to 60 or 70 basis points fairly close to the end of the year. You delivered on that clearly but it was your lower end of that range. The market was looking for perhaps the higher end of that range. Did anything change from the guidance in the end of the year that meant that you came at the &#x2013; nearer the 60 level than the 70 level? Was there anything that happened that was unexpected? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll take them, maybe the last first. We just guided 60 to 70, we're in the range and I think that's as simple as that. There is nothing to be read into that, absolutely nothing. On the price point declining, which I think is an interesting question. I would answer twofold. Number one, there is something which is extremely interesting to look at, it's the price per ton index of the Dairy division across the years.</p>
          <p>If you take an index of 100s in the last part of 2007, and you look at what it is today, i.e. in the last part of 2009, so two years after, you will find that this index has become 105. So in other words, the price per ton of dairy products today are 5% higher than where they were. Before, we had to manage the ups and downs of the milk and they went through a higher level at the end of 2008 of 111. But it means that overall, we have not a decrease of pricing, but we have just managed the ups and downs of the milk and at the very same time, our key brands have kept being shrunken, performing better than the average of the range. So I think that's a key point to have in mind.</p>
          <p>The second element which gives us confidence when we look at 2010 is the fact that number one, we are in a very fast-moving industry, so the effect of price adjustment movements and so on are being captured extremely quickly, because the rotation of dairy products is by definition very fast. This is the reason why we have seen the acceleration as we have seen it in 2009.</p>
          <p>This is the reason why as well when you look at Poland, which was one of the first Resets executed in the first quarter of last year, so it's about nine months ago or close to one year ago now. And when you see the performance of Q4, which has been positive both in volume and value and exactly at about &#x2013; exactly at, sorry, the same level in terms of sales growth as the one we had in the past. That's, yes, indeed, makes us very confident about the resilience of the actions. In other words we do things, but it's not like we change the portfolio, we adjust the pricing and it has a short effect. It has a long-lasting effect and we have seen that with Poland and that's of course, building up the confidence we have looking at 2010.</p>
          <p>On your question about the margins for Dairy, I am afraid I am not going to be able to answer. You know the factors that Dairy is going to face, i.e. the increase of the cost of milk, i.e. the full year effect from the pricing adjustment, i.e. as well as for the rest of the Group, the fact that we have now costs in foreign currency which are hedged on a different basis and a more expensive basis than they were a year ago. But in the face of that, of course, we assume for the moment no pricing and we have the flexibility to manage that.</p>
          <p>I am not going to give further details on the margin by division than what I just gave.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Just one question, so you are kind of guiding for kind of flat stable margins in 2010. Given that your higher margin divisions are again likely to grow the fastest, that implies that you should see some margin contraction elsewhere. Can you maybe give us sort of a feel of how divisional margins should perform in 2010? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Emmanuel, I am back. I will make a short answer, which is back to what I had said earlier. Essentially, we are talking about a negative mix and, sorry, a negative price comparison on the first half overall for the Group of about minus 2.5%, which obviously if you focus on Dairy, is even more than this, significantly more than this, Dairy being half of the Group and being the division which is mostly affected by this negative comparison.</p>
          <p>So absent this, clearly we would have an improvement of the margin on the first half of the year. So there is no secret reason or anything. It's simply that we have a very serious comparison basis on the pricing front in Dairy Reset countries and this is what we are currently, as we speak, going through and in four months' time, this will be over.</p>
