      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator and good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Craig DeYoung, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications here at ASML. I'd like to welcome you to our investor call and webcast.</p>
          <p>As the operator mentioned, the subject of today's call is ASML's 2010 first quarter results. Co-hosting today's call from our headquarters here in Veldhoven, The Netherlands, are Mr. Eric Meurice, our CEO, and Mr. Peter Wennink, ASML's CFO.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and in our first quarter results presentation, both of which you can find on our website at www.asml.com. This Safe Harbor statement will apply to this call and all associated presentation materials. As a reminder, the length of this call is 60 minutes.</p>
          <p>And now, I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Eric Meurice for a brief introduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Craig. Good afternoon, good morning. Thank you all for attending our quarterly &#x2013; quarter one 2010 results conference call. First, Peter and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the quarter. And as usual, Peter will start with a review of the financial performance with added comments on the short-term outlook. I will complete the introduction with some further details on our position &#x2013; current position as we close the quarter and head into 2010. Following the introduction, we will open up for questions.</p>
          <p>So, please, Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric and welcome to everyone. As Eric mentioned, I would like to take a moment to share some observations on the events of last quarter, as well as some details on our first quarter results.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter sales came in at &#x20AC;742 million versus &#x20AC;581 million in the fourth quarter of last year, which is well within the range of our guidance. We shipped a total of 34 systems, 23 of which were new. Our new system ASP of 25.8 million is a significant increase from the &#x20AC;19.7 million in Q4 and it indicates a shift back to a richer mix of immersion tools. The mix of the prior quarter was impacted by the demand from foundries for capacity-related tools.</p>
          <p>Our service and field option sales came in at &#x20AC;110 million, which can be considered normal given our current business conditions.</p>
          <p>The company's first quarter gross margin was 40.3% versus 38% in Q4. And this reflects an improved coverage of our fixed manufacturing cost and cost reductions. We continued our focus on R&amp;D with a spend of &#x20AC;120 million in the first quarter. SG&amp;A came in at 41 million, slightly higher than Q4, but that's in support of the growing level of sales through the course of 2010.</p>
          <p>On higher sales and improved gross margin in the first quarter, operating income improved to 18.5% from 11.8% in Q4. In the first quarter, despite the working capital ramp, we generated &#x20AC;50 million in net cash. With that, we again maintained a cash balance comfortably over &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>The first quarter net bookings met our expectations at 50 systems valued just over 1 billion. Net immersion bookings of 24 systems demonstrated a continued focus on technology investments driven again by DRAM and the foundry market segments. But in addition, we saw KrF (sic) [ArF] bookings of 17 systems, indicating a continued need for more non-critical systems in support of the leading edge production ramp and is mainly in the non-memory applications.</p>
          <p>First quarter bookings pushed our backlog to over &#x20AC;2 billion, containing 85 systems, which is by the way the highest backlog value in our history. Worth highlighting, also, is the fact that there are 58 immersion systems in the backlog, 28 of which are our newest immersion product the TWINSCAN NXT:1950.</p>
          <p>As for our outlook, we continue to increase factory production capacity in order to meet the growing demand, as indicated by our Q4 and Q1 bookings, and our Q2 bookings guidance. The latter, we expect again to be at the level that is approximately the same as we saw in Q1. With this level of bookings and the ramp-up of our production capability, we've clearly created the potential to record a top line revenue number for 2010 that will exceed the previous peak revenue of the year 2007.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter of 2010, we expect net sales to be about &#x20AC;1 billion, gross margin for the second quarter is expected to be around 42%, R&amp;D expected to be around 125 million and SG&amp;A around 42.</p>
          <p>With that brief summary, I would like to turn back over to Eric for more on our view of the coming quarters. Eric?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. So as said, Q1 sales and bookings came in as planned with high bookings expected to continue also into Q2, giving us adding confidence in a prolonged recovery of the semiconductor industry. Such an upturn can last two to three years, if one replicates the profile of historical cycles. Of course, our challenge is to remain cautious as to any signs, which may signal a correction to this trend but the two main drivers, IC unit demand and technology conversion CapEx requirements currently remain in positive territory. In fact I would say IC unit demand is in positive territory, and technology conversion CapEx requirement is in very, very positive territory.</p>
          <p>Indeed the large first half revenues continue to be driven by technology buys from the earlier adopters in the DRAM market segment, currently, converting capacity from their 65 or 55-nanometer products to 40-nanometer node. And in the foundry segment building up at this moment their 40-nanometer capacity.</p>
          <p>The second half of the year, we'll see this trend continue in particular as the second tier vendors are ramping in those same segment, with also initial demand for 30-nanometer NAND Flash capacity starting. This NAND Flash has been fairly weak so far. Our 2010 revenues could therefore exceed our previous &#x20AC;3.8 billion peak annual revenues achieved in 2007.</p>
          <p>Demand for IC unit is still forecasted to be robust as up to 15% above 2009 and importantly the technology transitions that we discussed are requiring a significant increase of immersion lithography layers. That is the numbers of lithography passes per wafer processed using these new immersion lithography systems.</p>
          <p>Immersion layers will respectively double for the DRAM and Logic products and increase by about 40% or more for the NAND product. Considering that there was a reduction of almost 20% of the memory capacity in the form of 200-millimeter fab, which were retired in 2008 and 2009, we are comforted that the significant and prolonged lithography tool delivery level is absolutely necessary, without creating overcapacity in the industry.</p>
          <p>To enable these technically aggressive node transitions, we have now shipped nine NXT:1950, which is our most advanced TWINSCAN dual stage scanner, having proven critical dimension imaging uniformity, well below 1-nanometer and overlay of less than 2-nanometers, which is industry-leading performance of course.</p>
          <p>At the end of the Q1, we had 28 NXT systems in backlog, 22 in memory and six for IDM's Logic. We expect to ship 11 of those 28 in second quarter and we will still grow our NXT backlog in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>On the technology front, as immersion processes are extended by the use of complex double patterning techniques, we are deploying our holistic lithography product suite, which enables the widening of critical process windows on one hand and allows for tighter process control in the fab on the other. This capability further significantly differentiates our TWINSCAN immersion product from competition.</p>
          <p>For the next generation technology, we continue our EUV development and are on track to ship our first TWINSCAN NXE:3100s this year and have now received our sixth order for this tool, confirming the interest of now older semiconductor segments from DRAM, NAND or Logic arena.</p>
          <p>We will ship the six pilot production tools in the next 18 months and are currently planning with all the industry leaders the 2012 production ramp for the new version of this machine called the NXE:3300. Orders will be taken already for these production EUV tools by mid of this year.</p>
          <p>In summary, we expect this cycle to be sustained by the normal technology transition of the early adopters and the subsequent technology conversion by the second tier DRAM makers by the next Flash memory upgrade cycle anticipated for the second half of 2010, as well as the Foundry's structural capability &#x2013; capacity built under advanced nodes.</p>
          <p>In view of the technical requirements for immersion layer growth, which I mentioned is go as far as doubling for DRAM, we appear to be in no real risk of creating industry overcapacity between now and the end of 2011. Although, we will remain, of course, cautious as to the overall state of the economy and its potential impact on overall semiconductor unit growth, which is a second driver of our growth behind the technology node transitions.</p>
          <p>So, with this explanation, Peter and I will now be pleased to take your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Eric. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&amp;A session. But beforehand, I'd like to ask that you kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up if necessary. This will allow us to get in as many callers as possible.</p>
          <p>Operator, could we have the instructions and then the first question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, of course. Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will start a question-and-answer session now. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Today's first question is from Mr. Didier Scemama. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, gentlemen. It's RBS. Thanks for taking my question. I just have a simple question. First of all, you mentioned that the 55 or 60% increase in CapEx this year for the industry will increase capacity by about 15% for IC units. What do you think would happen if IC unit shipment were to grow by 20 or 25% this year? At which point do you think we would need to or we'd start to see the build-up of new factory from your customers among foundries and memories? And then I just have a quick follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is good question because indeed at this moment although nobody can read the GDP development in the year. You do have this question very often in the industry whether with only a 15% unit we are too conservative and the numbers should in fact really be between 15 and 20%. So, this is a very actual question. So of course, we are preparing capacity for this ourself and as I think I said last quarter, our capacity will be at the level of about &#x20AC;1.5 billion of lithography tool per quarter within, or by the end of the year. So we will be ready in case this upside would come more &#x2013; is confirmed.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the customers themselves are ready. Most of the customers have enough space in their current buildings. You &#x2013; as you know, we do not have the time anymore where people would build walls and than fill them completely. Most of our customers have already the walls and have filled them by phases and you have in the industry a lot of fabs, which are basically definitely not full and are expecting the next phase. But in addition, you are starting to see of course fabs in Singapore, in Korea, in Taiwan, which are getting to completion or are already completed and are shells. So this is again a good preparation of the possibility of an upside.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And a quick follow-up. I just wanted to clarify one point. On your second half outlook, do you expect your book-to-bill to remain above one for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, a very good question. If I translate it differently I would say, are we going to have a peak booking. The current profile of the cycle when you start and if the cycle is looking like an historical cycle and will be spread over two to three years, we do expect in fact that the book-to-bill will remain plus or minus 10% from one, if you know what I mean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With some quarter a bit higher, some quarter a bit lower, around I would say the current level. That plateau type activity could last again as I said, two to three years and allow us to reach, as I said also last quarter our potential target of sales of &#x20AC;5 billion, as we said that we would reach on the next up-cycle. So, that's within the possibilities, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is from Mr. Janardan Menon. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Liberum Capital. Thanks for taking the question. You said that you could see a Flash memory upgrade cycle in the second half, where Flash goes to 32-nanometer. Can you sort of quantify on a relative basis how big that can be versus the DRAM upgrade cycle that you are currently seeing to 40-nanometer? You think without a big SSD led boom, but you just get a significant Flash technology upgrade cycle. Can it come close to the levels of orders that the DRAM industry is placing?</p>
          <p>And a short follow-up, if I may, your capacity on the 1950 is &#x2013; seems to be moving quickly as your production is moving from nine to 11. What is your maximum capacity in that going to be in the second half of the year? And when will you be in a position or are you already in a position to satisfy customer requirements for any kind of rush orders on those tools at this point in time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Very good. Two good questions. So you could probably use a simple formula between DRAM and Flash. We think Flash is equal to one half of DRAM, roughly in numbers of immersion tools, immersion units. So there &#x2013; of course, you cannot have this every quarter. So some quarters may be higher and et cetera, but we would expect the Flash 32-nanometer wave to start as we said in Q3 to looks like half of the big wave of 40-nanometer DRAM. So that is happening as we say at this moment. Regarding the capacity of immersion tool, as I said we &#x2013; I expressed myself in euro, a &#x20AC;1.5 billion of capacity, that would be about 30-ish to 35-ish immersion tool per quarter plus the KrF and et cetera, et cetera, of course but your question was on immersion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Odon de Laporte. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have a question relating to gross margin. When I'm doing my math, I conclude that with sales of 1 billion, Q2 gross margin could have been a little bit higher, maybe 50 basis points higher. So I was wondering whether this will be a clean-clean gross margin or maybe you will be penalized by any items, maybe in relations with the ramp-up of NXT? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I can answer -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before, I think nice accent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer quickly. Yeah, I think indeed clearly we have a gross margin percentage of around 42% like we did around 40% for Q1. In Q1, we were 30 basis points higher, that is within the realm of I'd say the differences that can always happen during the quarter, 30 or 50 basis points difference, it could happen. I'm not saying that it will, but if you come 50 basis points up, that's pretty reasonable. But as you have seen also in the actuals, there is always somewhat of a difference between our guidance and what we actually come out with. But if so, it is within the margin of you could call error.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Timothy Arcuri. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A couple of things. First of all, Eric, you talked about revenue, the revenue capacity being roughly &#x20AC;1.5 billion by year end. Does that suggest that there is a reset in lead times, so i.e., lead time is now, what, nine to 12 months and maybe that comes down pretty significantly later on this year? And if so, where does it come down to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, very good question, because we hear this from the customers on a regular basis. The lead-time by then would be about three months. So, in other terms, I don't say this to our customers too much, but we can turn orders within three months when we have reached the maximum capacity and have prepared the lenses.</p>
          <p>So, in other terms, at the moment we reach back a sort of a plateau work. We can offer customer very short lead time, turnaround time, which then makes the business much more stable for them, where they put orders on the long-term when they can do this and they can plan it and they have X% of their business, which can be done a very short lead time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just a quick follow-up on that, so typically whenever you see sort of a reset in lead times from such a long lead time to such a relatively short lead time, doesn't that usually drive a correction in bookings because there's at least some portion of what's being booked today that's happening because of the fact that your lead times are so long and people want to get in the queue. So, I'm sort of curious as to why that kind of a reset in lead times would not drive a correction, it may be mild but a correction nonetheless in bookings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, I think you always have the same, well, you have always the same behavior. Things that can be booked early like a new fab as we discussed, or a new line is going to be booked early because people understand that the real lead time of those machines are within nine months, six to nine months because you have to build up the lens, the glass, et cetera, et cetera. So, when they can do it, they will do it, so a very large part of our bookings will always be on that basis. Then you have a part of the bookings, which are due to the fear factor, as you said we need to slot. And you have a big part of our bookings, which is based on complete surprise out of the blue. So depending on the year, the fear factor is higher than the blues, the stuff coming from the blue and sometimes the things coming out of the blue is higher than the fear factor. But this impact could be responsible for say 20 to 25% of the fluctuation quarter-to-quarter of the bookings but they are not I would say more significant than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just &#x2013; just to make sure that I get that. So you're saying that roughly a quarter of your bookings right now are because of the fact that lead times are so long.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are putting words in my mouth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just mentioned the fact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we were at this moment I would say because we have now accumulated two or three events where we need to accumulate three quarters of high bookings, the question is not even real. The bookings are based on the fact that the customers now have realized that they need more capacity. It's driven not for double booking. It's driven for definite output. In fact all of our machines are expected, weighted for, they're all running to a bit above 100% capacity. So, you can see in there, there is no paper tigers there. This is at this moment highly, highly required. In fact the first question was, is business going to be plus 15% or more? At this moment, everybody is thinking that it could be more than 15% therefore every order is for used. So, I would not say at this moment that there is any luxury for what you just mentioned the possibility of saying, shit, I have to double book because I'm not sure. That is not the case at this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also if you look at the presentation, 76% of the backlog is shippable over the next six months. And so it's pretty tight and it is actually more proof that customers are not adhering to our standard lead times, which currently is not a very short lead time but it is the long lead time more for the leading edge products, closer to nine months than to the six months. So, you have this management problem that we have, that we have a lead time, a total lead time in the supply chain which is, in fact, closer to nine months and the order lead time that customers are granting us and that is a game. That's a game between a customer and a supplier that is sometimes played very smartly by our customers, sometimes very smartly by ourselves.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Again, you may not have really taken with the full seriousness the two messages we gave. The first message is that most of the industry semiconductors and beyond really are under a product pressure. So there is clearly a volume pressure at this moment and you are driving a lot of demand for that. And the second reason &#x2013; second thing that I said which is very, very important, in fact, is the numbers of layers on each of the chips are doubled in the immersion for DRAM and probably 40 to 50% increased on Flash. And in 2011, these ratios again are increased, potentially not double but not far from it. So at this moment, the &#x2013; everybody, there is no rush to be overly smart about double booking. We are putting all the capacity necessary to, in fact, execute these ramp needs. The double booking opportunity, in fact, is impossible that &#x2013; at this moment because, again, we are running everything at full capacity and our customers are doing the same.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, JP Morgan. Can I ask you regarding the orders in the current quarter itself? I mean is it mainly still in the second quarter, the orders are still going to be very much DRAM and upgrades to immersion and then the latter half of the year, NAND? And secondly regarding the NAND orders in the latter half of the year, are we talking about that you are already in discussion about new capacity in NAND or are we just talking about the 32-nanometer shrink?</p>

          <p>Peter, can you address that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The orders in &#x2013; just to give you a breakdown of the bookings in Q1, just to refresh your memory. Of the bookings that we had in Q1 was about, I would say, 20% was Foundry/IDM, 55% was DRAM, about 10% was Flash, and about 15% was what we call so-called hybrids, so it could be used for either or, which we think is largely going to be DRAM. So, that's the booking split in the first quarter. We don't expect in the second quarter that will be a big difference in that split. And we will probably see the first few bookings coming in for the Flash ramp like you talked about the 30-nanometer ramp in the second half, but we don't expect a big change. So that's the first part of your question. And the second part of your question was &#x2013; I was looking at the data when you were asking the question. The second part was, Sandeep?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second part I'm asking is that, in terms of the Flash bookings, are they only shrink-related that you expect in the second half or are you also in discussion about new fab and new capacity launches in Flash?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's definitely, there are some shells as you know in the Flash industry and some of our customers will take the first tool shipments to start filling those first lines. So it's going to be a combination of the 30-nanometer shrink and the extension of capacity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Morgan Stanley. Thanks for taking my questions. Eric, in your prepared remarks you mentioned that we might not see an oversupply for quite a while. My question is on foundries, the foundries are spending, at least the tier one foundries have been spending quite aggressively since last year and the capital intensity is above 40% level and the last time we saw this high capital intensity was in 2004, which was followed by a correction. So as yields at foundries 40-nanometer are low like 40 to 50% and you get 30% more incremental capacity when 40-nanometer yields improve. I'm just curious, how sustainable are the foundry bookings level from here onwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all the foundry business that we have is only tier one and I will not mention what that means but only tier one, which means as the mechanics of this business is that the customers would always force a second source to the tier one. You are certain that you are going to have some duplicated capacity being put in the other memory &#x2013; in the other foundry businesses. These ones haven't started yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you know that this foundry build-up is going to happen anyway in parallel to the tier one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the top of that I'd like to add, Atif, that you have a comparison to 2004. 2004 was the 90-nanometer Logic ramp, which at 90-nanometer we had many IDMs doing the same ramp. It's quite different than we have in 2010, where 45-nanometer Logic ramp is basically foundry. So, we had many IDMs at that same time, at that time, that were doing the same thing and that's now all concentrated. It's what you call consolidation. So, I think it's difficult and also a bit dangerous to make that particular comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow-up on gross margins here. If you'd assume that revenues be at 1 billion level in the next few quarters and your margins are already 42% from software holistic contribution, how high can the margins go if you assume revenue stays flat at 1 billion? Or do we need to see a higher top line to get to the 45% target that you guys have talked about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say both. If you want to take the 45% would need &#x2013; we've always said at 5 billion. We're not at 5 billion today, we're at 5 billion in the future, which we hope is not going to be the very far future. That will be driven by the volume impact on the gross margin, but also by that time the impact of the new what we call the holistic rate of products. So, we are seeing shipments of the first of those products this year. They are going to add to the margin profile, but to get to the 45% we've said that before that's between 1.2 and 1.3 billion per quarter. That is a volume and a product mix issue. And we are well underway especially on the holistic litho product that Eric alluded to that in his speech. That we have &#x2013; we are being increasingly successful in selling those products. So that will add to the margin profile. Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. It's with Goldman Sachs. I had a question on just going back to this debate on lead-time, when I look at your backlog today of the 58 in immersion systems. Am I right in then saying that you can deliver all of those in 2010 and that's basically incorporated in your forecast? Just to understand the mix dynamics then from a pricing point of view going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think what you have on backlog is what 90% shippable in nine months. There is always a few strategic machines which have been designed by the customer, put a bit longer than normal as I tried to explain at the beginning. Lead-time is one thing, but when you know for sure that you need something at a given time because your walls are finished, you'll say you had that so you can say this about, say, 10% I think is shippable in later. But on the other hand there are tons of, sorry there are certain numbers of orders which "are virtual" at this moment. These customers have told us they absolutely need the units, but the paperwork is not finished. So that, in fact, has always represented a very large part of our business which is why we do this forecast of bookings as well as the forecast of billings with usually some accuracy because we have so many, you call it, virtual orders which are being discussed in terms of their spec, their timing, in fact some time the price, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So where we actually know that the likelihood of that happening is virtually 100%, but we don't have the paperwork. I think I'd like to correct &#x2013; there's a feeling out there, very often that there's a one-to-one correlation between our lead time, our production lead time and the lead time that our customers give us in terms of a sales order. That's not the case, yeah. I mean we can have an internal lead time that takes us nine months to build a tool and from day one, from that first day of that nine-month period, we can have a discussion with a customer for a particular shipment and it can take two, three months before they finally give us the PO, which is signed, sealed and delivered. Some customers are very good. They give us POs 12 months before. That's why we have POs for shipment in the first quarter 2011. But there are also customers, which are a bit tougher, which are a bit &#x2013; we need to put a bit more effort in getting the POs on time. So, don't assume that one-to-one correlation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I see. I mean I guess, I'm just trying to go back to this earlier phrase that you used I think about the fear factor order, is I think is what you called it. So, how much of that do you think genuinely is out there now or if any at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as I said, I answered theoretically your question in case you are in a situation of constraint, people will have fear factor order. But in this business at this moment, the need for machines and the placement of each of the machine, I don't know how to express this better, but the placement of each of the machine in each of the places of each of the fabs are negotiated one-by-one. Remember, these are &#x20AC;40 million each.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Especially that you have to take deliveries of them. As you know, our terms and conditions are pretty solid on that. So I apologize for having misled people. At this moment, there is no issues of us. The order backlog we have and the virtual backlog that we have are absolutely required machines, which will be immediately put in production to the maximum speed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, okay. And my second question would be, just if I look at your orders, your order book over the last nine months or so, as you said NAND has been very dormant but may be close to &#x20AC;2 billion worth of orders being placed from the DRAM manufacturers for their shrink. I appreciate that NAND of course has a slightly configuration &#x2013; a slightly different configuration of machine requirements in relation to wafer starts they're trying to get too. But I guess, my question is, going forward, is the NAND upgrade cycle to 3X worth a similar magnitude of this 2 billion figure to what you've just seen for DRAM over the last nine months or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just checking one quick thing, the numbers of layers, give me a second. No, DRAM is always going to be a much bigger business than Flash for two reasons. One, the numbers of layers of immersion required by the NXT technologies from 40 to 30 for instance or 30 later into smaller or Flash there is always a factor of about 50% more, more, 50% more immersion layers in DRAM, so that's one thing. And the second thing, if I'm not mistaken the numbers of units of Flash is about half of the numbers of DRAM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So DRAM is a bigger business and it has more technology requirement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To give you some color on the backlog, as you can see from our presentation about 25% is foundry and IDM. I'm going to give you the break down in the memory segment. It's 45% is DRAM, 15% is flash, and 15% is what we call hybrid but that is largely we think is going to go to the DRAM side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's a pretty low number for Flash that we have in the backlog. Like Eric said, if you say it's about roughly 50% of the DRAM demand will finally end up being Flash demand. There's still some way to go.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Nomura. And if I look at the unit immersion backlog, it's now this quarter almost 50-50 between XTs and NXTs. Now, I mean I was asking myself and looking 12 months out and who still will buy NXTs in 12 months because I mean if I look at NAND -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>XTs, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>XTs, yes. If I look at NAND we have a double patterning development in DRAM overlay requirements and if I understand correctly in Logic, the overlay requirements are even worse than DRAM. So, if I &#x2013; who is buying XTs in 12 months time? And if I look then at the implied ASP for NXTs, it's about 40 million. So, is it totally unreasonable to model 40 million immersion ASPs in 12 months time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a very good question. In fact we cannot answer fully that question. Not we are hiding, but we're not 100% sure. It is true that if the customers were to &#x2013; wanted to have the appropriate target overlay, for instance they would convert 100% to NXT. However, we also know that there are some layers within the numbers of immersion layers, which are less critical than others. So, it may be that some customers would say, I want to optimize CapEx for one or two years and they would have a mix, but it may be there is a customer who would say optimization for one or two years makes no sense and I prefer to buy the machines which have more extendibility.</p>
          <p>So to be clear, our history has been that the customers have always gone for extendibility, which is why we've been in some ways so successful. But this time, we clearly offer the customer a choice between an NXT or an XT. Both machines will have about the same margin for us, so it's not a big issue of what their choice is, but the customers may have then the choice between a cheaper version if they do not need to use a full performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And having said that, I think, answer your question, it's almost time, we do believe that our shipments will be predominantly NXT within 12 months. But like Eric said, the percentage of XT, there will be XT sales and how much that will be in the end, that's a bit difficult. So your assumption of a 40 million flat ASP for immersion is in that sense a bit too optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And maybe as a follow-up, coming back to your famous model. I think you said before that in order to entertain a 50% bit growth for DRAM in 2011, you'd need about a quarter of a million additional wafer. I think that was based on the assumption that 2010 is flat capacity and I think what we see now in DRAM that indeed we see some capacity increases. So I am just trying to understand, does it mean what you said before, you need a quarter of a million between end 2009 to 2011 to entertain basically two years 50% bit growth?</p>

Now, if you talk about 40-nanometer nodes, you have to multiply it by a factor, which is the numbers of passes, as I just said, the numbers of layers. So, what I can do is separately or Franki and Craig could give those numbers to you. There is no secret. We &#x2013; there is a need for much more immersion machine now on every new node and there is another ratio for the 30-nanometer DRAM node, which is already being worked on.</p>
          <p>So, all these nodes have a different response. So, whatever I told you then was probably correct, because it was based on an average mix of different nodes. And if I have to re-update those numbers for 2010 or 2011, we can do it. There is no secret, but they are probably higher than what I ever said.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Adrien Bommelaer. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Piper Jaffray. I had a question on EUV. I was wondering if you could give us some color on the progress done by the rest of the Semica ecosystem to launch EUV. And I am always a bit concerned that ASML is a little too far ahead of the others on this. And then I have a quick follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the first question about, are we too much ahead versus market needs. The answer is no, in fact, because EUV is considered a cheaper solution to a current problem. If you do double patterning immersion at the level of, say, 22-nanometer node or 18-nanometer node depending on which product you are talking about. EUV at the current prices is a cheap version. So if we succeeded, customers like it. And the proof is that we've got now six orders and by the &#x2013; say, by July, we probably will announce certain numbers of orders for the new version called the 3300. So we are time-wise with the current market need, okay.</p>
          <p>Are we ahead of the ecosystem? Good question. There are, I would say, four areas of concern. One is the light source, which is basically a supplier of ours. And at this moment, the issue with the light source is not so much if it works or not, if it's what is the power we're going to get out of that source. And at this moment we have a minimum power, which is already demonstrated which already gets us into a mode of nearly breakeven of total cost wise of EUV versus immersion. So every effort we do now in improvement and granted, we don't know how fast we can do that at this moment, but every effort is in green territory. So we think that is under control.</p>
          <p>The second part, potential limiter would be the resist and at this moment resist at 10 milljoule per square inch or 15 milljoule per square inch depending on usage, is being proven and you can seen this resist at IMEC, at Albany, New York and at customers. The issue here would be line roughness, whether we can clean it up so that it allows perfection and gradients. So again, I don't think people will tell you that there is any showstopper.</p>
          <p>The next one is mask, the blank mask in particular and the writing. So, here again, most of the customers who are interested by this, are big mask vendors themselves. And the fact that they buy our machines, we can think that it is a proof that they can find a way to build the mask and the blank. There are some issues, of course, of getting enough blanks at this moment or having the right defect density on the blanks. But again, as I said, if &#x2013; had it as a showstopper, anyway it's under their own control. And when you look at the amount of billions that we invest in R&amp;D versus the poor amount of money that is required on that business, it's &#x2013; we don't think that there's an issue. And the fourth issue is defect, is an investigation on the mask inspection.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Inspection?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that it is true. At this moment, the industry has not completely converged on an industrial solution. There are solutions, solutions like you test your defects not on the mask itself but on an exposure. That's possible, but that's not elegant. And there are also ways of inspection based on non-EUV source, but on 193 source and you can see a significant amount of defect, probably not everything you wanted to see, but et cetera. So, this again is &#x2013; could be considered, I would say today as the area of least excitement. But those guys as usual react more when you are nearer to production, because they are not a showstopper in the whole R&amp;D and recipe management. They will be a show &#x2013; could become a showstopper when you want to get into full production but full production is 2012 to 2013, so there is significant time to solve that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also on top of that, Adrien, this is a fundamental issue in the sense that all these four things that Eric just mentioned, you can only really manage when you have this exposure tool. So you first have to have the tool before it can really solve the other. So, it is logical that if you don't have an exposure that the exposure tool will be the first there and then the rest needs to follow because you cannot solve those problems if you don't have the tool.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, that's very clear. And just as a quick follow-up, Intel has actually made some fairly lukewarm comments regarding EUV in the last few months. And I was wondering in terms of acceptance by the industry, who would look at this tool first for mask production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Today, we are certain now that DRAM doesn't have easy work around and Logic, call it Logic aggressive does not have EV solution. So for instance when you're a foundry business and you try to do the maximum shrink on a given node. That is you give the maximum flexibility to your customers to shrink, there is no real solution. Flash could potentially get one generation more by crude system but that's it. Some other customers could decide to be less aggressive on some nodes and therefore go around a certain numbers of years. But I'll repeat my fundamental statement, what is important is with EUV is that we reach a cost factor. It's an economic decision. So every customer including the person, the one you mentioned will be moving into EUV, at the moment ASML and the peers develop the right economic solution.</p>
          <p>So, we're not dreaming here and people would tell you at this moment they plan to convert in 2010, sorry 2012, '13, '14, '15, '16, et cetera. At this moment this is irrelevant if they do not know what economic equations we are giving. And if we are able to give an economic equation, which at the end of the day is cheaper than anything else. As you and I know that there will be a jump into it. Now, again we do not feel highly concerned ourself because if EUV &#x2013; if we cannot reach exactly the level of performance that we want, we can still do one or more years with our immersion machine and we would not be business impacted in some ways. So, we are doing this because we think it is necessary for the industry. We think that in any event past 2015 there are going to be some nodes where there is absolutely no choice. But between 2010, 2015 it's for us to define the economic equation that makes the transfer happen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The numbers of lithography tools, I don't know if I want to give you the very precise number at this moment about what we expect during the year. So, yes, I think it's, it will be a bit &#x2013; how do &#x2013; a bit too much to -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's put it this way, our top line guidance which we said is very likely going to peak our 2007 revenue, that top line revenue guidance and I'm not going to give you the details on what we think the breakdown is for our litho tool, that is going to support Eric's statements.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize, we told you that guidance for the year, it's very rare we give a guidance for the year so early. If you seen our past, the fact that we give a guidance which is above 3.8 billion is already a measure of our bullishness.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One quick follow-up on your backlog. At what point will you add in the EUV tools into your backlog?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will do that once we understand that we have visibility of revenue recognition within the next 12 months. So because EUV will be shipped in the second half of the year, they will &#x2013; probably is not fully certain yet, will probably be governed by what they call SAB 101, which is a revenue recognition principle which actually says if you have a completely new technology then you can only have revenue recognition when you have fully and latest sign-off at the customer side and that could be 2011. So when we get sight on when we will book that revenue within the next 12 months, so it's not order wise, it's really revenue recognition, then we will put it in the backlog.</p>

          <p>It &#x2013; no, no, it could be earlier. I mean for instance, if we see that six months that we see good progress and then we expect over the next six months that we will get final sign-off then we'll put it in.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Arete Research. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions, Eric and Peter. First question is that I wanted to find out how should we think about what is the next levels of bookings acceleration? What, who, which customers should come back and start to buy? Is it the tier one guys coming back to make capacity purchases that you will see the bookings accelerate? And I have a quick follow-up, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, in fact, the reason of our bullishness again is because of the moment when they &#x2013; so, to simplify. At this moment, the first half, we've got the first tier DRAM, we've got not much Flash and we've got the first tier foundry. And therefore, in the second half, we expect the natural second tier DRAM, new Flash and second tier foundry.</p>
          <p>But in addition, in 2011 or in the progressive fashion from now until end of 2011, there is a conversion of nodes which require so much more passes of immersion, which the first year we will have been doing some things in the first half of this year will start moving back in and it probably will start back moving back in in Q4, Q1, Q2, 2011. So, it's going to be &#x2013; these are a lot of waves that will add up in the next at least four quarters if not six quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what Eric is basically saying is that the litho diffusion rate is going up. Now how &#x2013; where will that end? We don't know. But, clearly, because they need more of those immersion passes, the percentage of litho as total of CapEx spend will be going up over the next two to three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a follow-up, you said that you've going to beat the 3.8 billion from 2007. Is it fair to assume that your EBIT margins, also you will eclipse in this particular cycle? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Mehdi Hosseini, FBR Capital Markets and thanks for taking my question. Eric, I'm looking at slide number 19, where you're illustrating DRAM capacity or memory capacity is going to be 10% below the prior peak year, I mean for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mean that even with the significant backlog for the memory customers you have, there is still going to be shortage and if that's true then would we see the first year memory DRAM guys coming back and actually start placing orders for capacity buys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly what I said. So this is good understanding of what we try to say. We believe that we are going to have a sustained period of booking and billings because of this phenomenon. We start with a very low level of capacity because of the retirements of 200-millimeter. You add to this sort of a volume correction, which globally is what we call the 15% unit. You add to this the number of layers are multiplied by two now and they will be multiplied by another factor in 2011. So, everybody is going to come back. Is there going to be a shortage? I hope not. In fact, we're going, we're working extremely hard to build up that capacity to the famous level of as I say, 30 to 36 big immersion tool for quarter, which is big enough we think to cover customers' needs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if what you have in the backlog for the most part is for shrink among the memory customer, and assuming that the capacity buys will be higher in euro value then at some point this year, we should see an acceleration in booking, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In fact, it is already. Now, it's good we finish the call with the first statement I made is, we expect this plateau-ish of bookings billings to potentially creep up. And I use the term plus or minus 10% per quarter as a proxy of the fact that you never know in which quarter things really happen. So, the fact that you hint or we hinted that there is a probability, a potential &#x2013; a probability of growing the plateau is correct, but I would not see a profile where the bookings goes from 1 billion a quarter to 2 billion, and then go to zero. I would see more creeping up, and some time maybe one quarter a bit lower than anything at this moment, because all the waves are fairly independent, the wave of the first tier, the second tier, this node, the next node, the foundry, the IDM, putting the business et cetera, and the very large processor companies starting to put orders.</p>
