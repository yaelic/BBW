          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for taking part in this conference call. And today's again will be based on the PowerPoint presentation that you will find on our website, and let me start with the first slide.</p>
          <p>As regards the results of the first quarter of 2008, we were able to reach a record high net revenue of 48%. Also a significant increase in the adjusted EBITDA and net profit by 63% and 30%. Now, speaking about financial and investment performance, I have to mention that the level of the debt burden of the company in terms of total debt to EBITDA ratio, reduced to 1.4 versus the 1.7 indicated at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Quite an impressive amount of cash at the end of the first quarter of 2008 enables us to guarantee sufficiently high liquidity under current market conditions.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>I will now take you to the second slide. In the first quarter of 2008, we agreed that under conditions of the very favorable market conditions, regulated gas prices in Russia increased by 28%, and an increase in the former Soviet Union countries amounted to 25% in dollar terms. As you can see from the upper left-hand chart, during 2007 there was quite a sustainable increase in prices for hydrocarbon materials, which resulted in higher export prices for us.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>So the average gas price in the European market totaled $346, which is an increase of 28% versus the same period of the previous year. Now let us move to the next slide. This will be the analysis of the volumes of sales.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>In this slide, you can see that the total volume of sales of gas by Gazprom in the reported quarter increased to 183.5 billion cubic meters or 6% versus the same period of 2007. The increase in the total volume of sales was due to a 34% increase of volumes of gas sold to the European market, which is the most profitable for us. In the Russian market, the volumes of sales changed insignificantly due to the impact of consolidation of Mosenergo. Reduction in the volumes of sales in the countries of the former Soviet Union totaled 11%, and this was mainly explained by lower volumes of gas sold to Ukraine.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Let me take you to the next slide. In the first quarter of 2008, our revenue from sales of gas increased significantly under the favorable market conditions. The record high growth totaled 48%. As you can see from the left-hand chart in slide number six, we saw this increase in all the segments of our activities. The highest share of revenue, as before, came from gas sales to the countries of Europe, which can be explained by higher demand and relatively larger volumes of gas sold. Among other key factors that explain increased revenue, we also have an increase in other revenue, which can be explained by consolidation of Mosenergo.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Let me now take you to the next slide. As was said before, the first quarter of 2008 was quite a successful period for our sales. This can be seen from the movement of adjusted EBITDA and net profit. For instance, adjusted EBITDA increased by 63% versus the first quarter of 2007. And net profit, in compliance with our income and loss statements, also increased significantly by 30%.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2008, total debt reduced by 2%. Net debt reduced by 10%, which can be explained by a significant increase in cash balance in the account of the Group. I must also mention that the total debt to EBITDA ratio reduced from 1.7 to 1.4 at the end of the first quarter of 2008. I have already spoken about that. The structure of the debt, in terms of repayment dates, has not changed significantly.</p>
          <p>And the current non-stable situation in the world financial market, of special importance is the level of liquidity. In the lower right-hand chart, you can see that the total volume of cash and cash equivalents in the account of the company, without result of Gazprombank and Gazprom Neft, is 16% more than its short term liabilities.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And I now pass the floor to Elena Vasilieva, Chief Accountant of Gazprom and Deputy Chair of the Management Board.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Good afternoon, or good evening, dear ladies and gentlemen, depending on where you are.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Let me now take you to slide number 10. Remembering that Andrey, in the first part of our presentation, spoke about revenue and debt burden of the company, let me now briefly speak about the main factors that influenced our operating expenses. Changes in operating expenses can be of significant importance for the users of our statements.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2008 increased by 34% versus the same period of the previous year. At this, the ratio of operating expenses to net revenue reduced from 66% to 60.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>The most important impact on increase in operating expenses was exercised by cost of purchasing of gas and oil, labor costs, cost of goods for resale, including oil and gas and refined products and other operating costs.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Now let me take you to slide number 11. Cost of purchasing of gas and oil increased by 32%. At this, cost of purchasing gas increased by 17% and cost of purchasing oil by 112%. The main reason for this increase in cost of purchasing gas was higher volumes and higher average price for gas purchased by Gazprom Germany.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Higher cost of purchasing oil can be explained by higher oil prices and also by some increase in volumes of oil purchased. Transactions for purchasing oil primarily have been affected by Gazprom Neft Group.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Labor cost. In the reported period, labor cost increased by 30%. A significant impact on this item was exercised by labor cost capitalized in the gas remaining in the underground gas storage, as of the 31st of December 2007, which were written off in the reported period because of withdrawal of gas from the underground gas storage.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Besides higher labor costs were influenced by inclusion of Mosenergo into the consolidated statements of Gazprom Group, starting with the first six months of 2007. Without taking into account such factors, labor cost of Gazprom Group would have increase by 16%.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Goods for resale, including oil and gas refined products, increased by 125%. This change is due to increase in volumes of sale of oil and gas refined products by 205% coming from Gazprom Neft. Also, we've seen some increase in the cost of purchasing other goods by 86%, which is explained by the activities of Gazprom Germany related to sale and purchase of power.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Other operating expenses increased by 83% over three months of 2007. This indicator included the revenue of the investment activities of the non-state pension fund, Gazfond, to the amount of about RUB10 billion. This is the change in the procedures of consolidation of Gazfond, which took place in March of 2007. In the current reported period, this effect is not present.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Other operating expenses were also influenced by consolidation of Mosenergo. For instance, other costs include cost of transfer of heat to the amount of RUB7.7 billion.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Without taking into account the above one-off factors, the increase in other operating expenses totaled 12.5%.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Next slide, number 12.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Based on the experience of our previous conference calls, I know that the users of our statements are always very interested about Gazprombank indicators and their reflection in the statements of Gazprom Group.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>In order to ensure objective and accurate consolidated financial statements, Gazprom, on a regular basis, assesses quality of those factors that are used to prepare financial statements of Gazprom Group.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>During this work in particular, we performed an analysis of the optimal classification of Gazprombank for the purposes of consolidated financial statements according to IFRS. As a result of this analysis, we came to the conclusion that it will be more feasible to stop showing, in the consolidated financial statements of Gazprom Group, the results of Gazprombank as a subsidiary and start reflecting these results, from June of 2008, as an associated company. We believe that this will help us to ensure more objective information for proper evaluation of the financial situation and performance of the Group.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>During this analysis, we also took into account such factors as changes in the composition of the Board of Directors of the bank, possibilities to exercise control over the operating performance of the bank as well as the existing plans to continue reducing the number of shares of the bank and the ownership of Gazprom.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>This is the end of my presentation, and we will be happy to take your questions, if any. Next to me is Mr. Rasif. He is the Head of the IFRS and Russian Accounting Standards Division.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Hootan Yazhari. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Hootan Yazhari from Merrill Lynch. I just had one question related to CapEx in 2009. With the severe drop in the oil price, what sort of a cut in capital expenditure are you expecting in 2009? What sort of impact would you expect that to have on growth? And the third part is, what sort of oil price are you budgeting for in 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Let me take this question. As regards to budget for 2009, this hasn't been completed, this hasn't been approved yet. We are currently in the process of drafting this budget, and we are analyzing different opportunities to finance our investment program.</p>
          <p>Today, I spoke in the Investment Conference, and I said that Gazprom was not going to cut down its projects, like Nord Stream and other projects, to develop the Yamal and Bovanenkovo field, in particular. Clearly, the current situation calls for a thorough analysis, and of course, a lot will depend on the situation in the capital markets.</p>
          <p>In the worst case, we will have to size down our forecast and prolonged terms of implementation of our projects. However, with regards to lower prices for construction and installation, where lower prices for metal &#x2013; and you know that Gazprom is a metal intensive company. For instance, we consume pipes more than two million tons of metal needed by Gazprom per annum. So we believe that such lower prices will compensate for the current situation in the financial markets.</p>
          <p>As regards our borrowings, the plan for 2009. You know that the plan is RUB90 billion, and if you compare this with the investment program, which isRUB900 billion, you will see that this 90 billion is just a small part of the large scale investment program, and we hope that we can do this out of our own sources.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from Igor Kurinny. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. It's Igor Kurinny from ING. Actually, my question is related to the previous one. Given the fall in oil prices, could you please comment about prospects for the Yamal and Shtokman development projects. What is in particular interesting is what minimum oil price and domestic gas price is needed to make these projects economically feasible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Currently, we have no plans to change commissioning dates of our fields in Yamal and Shtokman projects. Even under the worst case scenario, which is $50 of oil price, we still think that these projects will remain feasible for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. If I may, just a quick follow-up. What domestic gas price would be required to make Yamal development feasible? And also, do you see any risk that the government plans to increase domestic gas prices could be reviewed because of the fall in oil prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Well, as regards the plan of the government, it seems quite acceptable to us, and it supports our plans to continue with implementation of the project and commission the project. This makes our plans quite realizable. And also, we don't see any problems with the plan of the government to continue gradually increase the domestic gas prices and to bring them to the market level by 2011.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Natalia Milchakova [Otkritie Brokerage &#x41D;ouse]. Please ask your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>I'm sorry. Before you ask this question, I have to leave you because I was called by the Chair of the Management Board, and all the questions addressed to the Financial and Economics Department will be taken by the First Deputy Head of this Department, Mr. Yatsenko.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>The question was, regarding costs of Mosenergo, consolidation of Mosenergo, we have seen that this consolidation had an impact on costs in the first quarter. Do you think that this will be a continuing and ongoing impact, or is it just a one-off increase in costs? Will you see it during the whole of 2008 and, or not?</p>
          <p>And the second question was regarding 2009. The energy assets consolidated by Gazprom, how this will have an effect on cost and profitability of the company, speaking about consolidation of some generating companies?</p>
          <p>So the answer is as follows. As regards Mosenergo's consolidation, this started in the first six months of 2007, and the impact will still be felt in the next quarter, too. And as regards the consolidation of generation and power assets, we don't expect any negative contribution to be made by this consolidation. Quite the opposite.</p>
          <p>Also, currently, the Board of Directors of Gazprom made the decision to consolidate TGK-1 in the Gazprom Group. And in 2008, this company showed positive performance results. We also know that the business plan of the company is fulfilled better than expected. And as regards consolidation of those energy assets, clearly, there will be one-off increase in costs, but then this will be compensated by good performance results of the assets. The decision about consolidation was made in August 2008. However, the final date of consolidation is not known yet. We know that we will start reflecting TGK-1 from 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening. I have a question as far as the cuts in expenditures for 2009, and it's not really for the CapEx side, but actually on the operating expenses. Can you give us any idea of what scope you think you have for, in terms of cutting staff expenses and other operating expenses, either in actually cutting per-head costs or in cutting the number of people that work for Gazprom?</p>

          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>I pass the floor to Igor Shatalov, Deputy Head of the Department to answer the question. So the answer is as follows. Two months ago, this decision was made and approved. We are talking about reducing the head count in the headquarters in the head office of the company. And this will be brought into effect till the end of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what about the broader Gazprom, beyond just the headquarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Well, we are still working on completing finalizing the restructuring process, and the company is spinning off special companies. This process is ongoing and will continue into the next year. However, no final decision has been made about reducing the head count for the company in general.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Olek Keenan from JPMorgan. I have two questions. One is, given the level of your outstanding debt, are you planning any debt buybacks? Maybe <mark type="inaudible" /> share buybacks <mark type="inaudible" />. And secondly, what will be the price for export of gas to Ukraine for 2009? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>As regard to your first question, we have no plans regarding buying back our debt from the market, and we also don't plan to buy back our equity from the market.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Mr. Kruglov has already mentioned that according to our plan, by the end of the year, the debt ratios of the company will come to a very comfortable level.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>With regards to the average price of gas, which is a little bit more than 6% at the moment, we see no reason for us to start buying back our debt from the market. The current structure of capital is quite comfortable for us.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>In future, everything will depend on the market situation. But again, no decisions about that have been made by the company, yet.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>As regards to gas prices for 2009, we are negotiating at the moment.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>During the meeting between Prime Minister Putin and Prime Minister of Ukraine, it was agreed that during three years there will be a step by step transition to the market-based prices, which will be pegged to the European level.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Let me repeat again that we are currently negotiating.</p>

          <p>The second question is about the domestic demand for gas in 2009. The answer is, I expect that it will remain at the same level.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Stefan Colak from UniCredit. My question is related to <mark type="inaudible" /> basically. Could you give some information on your available credit lines, and also if there's commercial paper program you are planning? Thank you.</p>

          <p>As regards credit lines, they are quite accessible to Gazprom. Clearly at higher prices, recently we borrowed $1 billion, and we have offers from other banks. So this means that we can fulfill our borrowings program to the end of this year. But of course, prices are high at the moment. On the other hand, we expect that they will start going down.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>As regard to your second question about commercial papers, we are considering such plans, but currently we are in negotiations with a bank.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good evening. I only have one question left. If there were a devaluation of the ruble, how would you expect the domestic gas re-pricing schedule to be affected? Which is to say, will the nominal amounts remain the same, or would the pricing shift up to cover the devaluation?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Well, we don't see any devaluation of the Russian ruble. If it happens, we will start negotiating with the government.</p>

          <p>The question comes from Deutsche Bank. We keep hearing that Gazprom currently is in a very good situation, and this is because gas prices in Europe have reached the record high level. However, what will happen when the gas prices will start to go down? In the second half of 2009, it can happen that gas prices will be on the level of less than $250 per 1,000 cubic meters. What measures do you plan to take? And the second part of the question is about oil prices in 2009. What measures will be taken in case of further reductions?</p>
          <p>The answer is as follows. We are considering different scenarios, and of course we understand that the marginal prices that can be feared. We are ready to start downsizing our investments program, and we know when to do that, on which level of prices. We have also identified the priorities within the framework of our investment program, so we know what projects we just stop or suspend as the previous speaker has explained to you.</p>
          <p>The board of directors meeting is scheduled for December. They will discuss the investment program and other budgeting parameters, and the decision about this will be made. So again, we are considering different scenarios. We also have other sources of funding for our projects in case of further reduction in oil prices.</p>

          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>Could I please specify regarding those projects that you can stop or suspend? I can't remember that Mr. Kruglov said anything about such projects.</p>
          <p>The answer is as follows. Well, actually, we don't mean any key projects for Gazprom. We are talking about such projects that can be suspended, like automation or reconstruction. And maybe I shouldn't call them projects. These are, rather, construction plans. And we have sufficient reserves to delay such plans.</p>

          <p>The question is about the statement made by Mr. Kruglov earlier today. He said that Gazprom is going to promote the tradition of increasing dividends to be paid on an annual basis. So the question is, are you going to link this to the net profit according to IFRS? And what shall be, in percent, the amount of planned increase in dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
          <p>So the answer is as follows. We are not talking about payment of dividends in the head office of the company. We are not speaking about the whole group of companies. And Mr. Kruglov indeed referred to increased dividends paid to shareholders in the last years, and from the net profit. We have a permanent percentage from the net profit which is 17.5% of net profit are paid in dividends.</p>
          <p>And we pay higher dividends because of increase in the net profits. This year, the situation is going to be the same. And the Board of Directors takes decisions on payment of dividends based on the dividend policy of the company. This decision must be approved by the general meeting of shareholders.</p>
