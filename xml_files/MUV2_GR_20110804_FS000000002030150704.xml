          <p>Good day and welcome to the Munich Re Half Year Results 2011 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to your host today, Christian Becker-Hussong. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call on the half year and second quarter 2011 results. It's a busy day for all of you, as quite a few other insurance companies have published results this morning. So, in the interest of time, only a short introduction from my side.</p>
          <p>Today's speakers are Nikolaus von Bomhard, J&#xF6;rg Schneider and Torsten Jeworrek. After the presentation, there will be the usual Q&amp;A session. And as always, please limit the number of questions you might have to a maximum of two per person.</p>
          <p>And I'll now hand it over to Nikolaus to kick off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Christian. Good morning and good afternoon, wherever you are. It was a busy day for us too by the way.</p>
          <p>And let me start on slide three, if I had to summarize the second quarter, I would call that back to normal in terms of results and overall development of our businesses. Of course and unfortunately, the half year result is still a loss, but I have to probably emphasis here that we did no major work on the reserve positions. We, of course, always look at actual versus expected. This is more of a quick check what we do there every quarter and there is no bad news at all, it's rather the opposite. And I can state here that we consider ourselves very solidly reserved.</p>
          <p>As regard shareholders' equity, I think I can be brief, no surprise. We almost made up what we paid out as a dividend. Of course, currency development was a little difficult to counter. That's why we had a slight &#x2013; deterioration was slight diminishing in comparison to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The Investment result is a little weaker than we expected by the end of the year and that of course also has to do with our write-down on our Greek severance bonds that we did write-down completely, both in terms of our expiry date of the bonds we hold, as well as to market value because we did not stop anywhere in between nominal and market value of the day, we roll it down all to market value.</p>
          <p>Reinsurance is all I would say, well, Torsten make a run. With regard to primary insurance, it will be J&#xF6;rg, who will present these numbers. I would like to make only one brief statement. Those who work out of Germany have probably seen ERGO making it to the headlines of several newspapers several times. The reason being for that that there were unfortunately unacceptable and deplorable wrong doings and mistakes made in the past, the past venture also effect sometimes 20 years. But ERGO management did rightly, first of all, were needed excuse itself. And secondly and more importantly, even investigate without any elements as regards investigation and act with resolve to whatever the finding. So, necessary steps are taken immediately when and wherever needed.</p>
          <p>And the underlying dispute behind these statements or these headlines that were made, there are disputes with the &#x2013; with former agents, independent agents of the ERGO's sales force about severance payments in the first place. They are still ongoing. That is why we cannot say we have seen it all, but I would dare to say we have seen probably most of it. Then as regard to Munich Health. I think, J&#xF6;rg will tell you what is needed here.</p>
          <p>Coming to the next slide, this is a slide that I would probably label, what has changed between the two quarters from first to second. And this is certainly not rocket science here, one point only. Now that is, in reinsurance one can clearly see how life reinsurance to some extent can compensate the difficult first quarter for non-life with a heavy burden on the natural catastrophe side. And the same on a higher level would then go for primary insurance vis-&#xE0;-vis reinsurance as a whole, where here that will nicely to some extent can compensate less pleasing result of reinsurance in the first half of the year overall.</p>
          <p>On slide five, you see a summary of the first half year, the key numbers and years since they are being broken down in the further set of slides. I think the only thing that you again can see, here reinsurance, primary insurance, it's a set of &#x2013; of course, this is not the consolidated set of numbers, therefore these numbers do not add up. And as I said, we still show an overall loss on IFRS accounting of around about &#x20AC;200 million in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Primary insurance, one quick statement, as regards the challenges of the international book, this refers mostly to the P&amp;C book to three countries that you all, I guess, at least are aware of. Korea, Portugal, where we do right now check all options at hand. And Turkey, where we're absolutely determined to fix what needs fixing. And this is in two of the three cases, utmost and foremost, the question of the development of the motor business that goes for Korea and Turkey.</p>
          <p>That being said, I would like to come to J&#xF6;rg, who will now give you a run through the business segments of the group. J&#xF6;rg?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nikolaus. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'll start with slide seven, development of our shareholders' equity. And here I point your attention to the right column, which shows the change in the second quarter with an IFRS, which declined by only &#x20AC;200 million despite the payment of &#x20AC;1.1 billion dividend in April. This was due to positive impact from our Q2 results and plus &#x20AC;400 million increase of net unrealized gains and losses.</p>
          <p>In local GAAP, for the parent company, this is relevant for our distribution capacity, the equalization reserve absorbed most of the extraordinary burden from the major losses. This is also obvious that our economic capital position suffered from the nat cat losses and the low interest rate environment. But there is still a comfortable buffer, which allows us to make use of opportunities in an attractive reinsurance market.</p>
          <p>Let's move onto slide eight to talk about the challenging field of investments. You see here the familiar overview on our well balanced investment portfolio, compared to the end of last year, the portfolio size remained stable at &#x20AC;196 billion. And this despite negative currency effect of &#x20AC;2.2 billion and higher interest rates, especially at the short end of the yield curve. This was compensated, this decline, by an increase in deposits from the major life and health reinsurance transactions.</p>
          <p>The overall investment strategy remains largely unchanged. We made some movements of more tactical nature from some of our weaker into the higher quality European government bonds. Some shifts into corporate bonds as well as into inflation linkers.</p>
          <p>Besides the execution of our rent strategy for renewable energy and new technology investments, gained momentum with about &#x20AC;500 million being invested to-date and signed to-date, and four major projects are new in 2011; electric supply, network and wind energy in Germany, as well as major photovoltaic portfolios in Italy and Spain. We like that kind of investment because it has a relatively low correlation to our other assets, and therefore, long-term stabilizing impact on our return on investment.</p>
          <p>Our duration mismatch remains very limited in volatile markets. The intentional short and long positions in primary and reinsurance segment are beneficial from the group's perspective.</p>
          <p>On slide nine. We show the fixed income portfolio of &#x20AC;167 billion, overall, and the emphasis is on highly rated securities. But let us first look at the problem zones. The market values as at the end of June were roughly &#x20AC;840 million for Greece, &#x20AC;430 million for Portugal, &#x20AC;1.5 billion for Ireland, &#x20AC;2 billion for Spain, and &#x20AC;5.3 billion for Italy. Movements in value of these and all other &#x2013; almost all other instruments have always been fully reflected in our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>For Greece, however, we took the impairment hit and wrote the bonds down by &#x20AC;703 million with a bottom line effect of &#x20AC;125 million. But to put this exposure to the weaker sovereigns into perspective, we have an overweight in bonds of top rated countries, 99% of our covered bonds and 87% of our government bonds are rated AA or better. And even 94% of the government bonds are rated A or better. And the markets flight to quality resulted in a good performance of the sovereign bonds of the top countries. And with these increases in values, we were able to compensate to a large extent for the market losses of the weaker government bonds and this holds also true for the last couple of weeks after the close of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our investment result is shown on slide 10, stable regular income of &#x20AC;4.1 billion, which is 4.2% return on investment, high net write-downs of about &#x20AC;800 million, not only the impairment on the Greek bonds, but also the revaluation of the derivative instruments held in our primary life insurance business to hedge against low interest rates with effect of &#x20AC;80 million and bottom line impact of &#x20AC;15 million.</p>
          <p>And the opposite direction comes from the write-up of insurance risk transferred to capital markets after the Japanese earthquake, &#x20AC;211 million, which is to be deducted from a gross burden of &#x20AC;1.7 billion and brings us to the net burden of &#x20AC;1.5 billion. Important also, some &#x20AC;250 million gains from real estate from the sale of real estate in Singapore out of overall net gains on disposal of &#x20AC;600 million. Overall, we are satisfied with the 3.6% return on investment in a very turbulent environment.</p>
          <p>Now, a few remarks on the segments and I directly jump to slide 15 to our primary life insurance, 15. IFRS premiums declined by 4.4% and this was due to decline of single premium business, which was similar to the market as a whole. Whereas the new regular premiums went up overall, the APE was flat for the first half this year and the new business came in into the second quarter better than in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Technical result, there was an improvement mainly due to a technical negative effect of the preceding year. The investment result suffered from the write-downs and lower disposal gains. And this was also responsible for the decline of the consolidated result.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, primary health, good development, plus 4.5% growth of premium, technical result up 28%, and in spite of the write-downs on the Greek bonds, we had an only small decline of the net profit to &#x20AC;46 million. And property casualty gross of IFRS premium plus 3.2% stronger in international business than in Germany, technical result improvement of 26%, especially coming from the German business. The investment result was pushed up by the sale of real estate in Singapore, which I mentioned before and so was the consolidated result. We have a very different situation in Germany and abroad.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, you see the key numbers. International with a combined ratio of 106.4, we have significant improvements in Poland, but still difficulties in Turkey and Korea. And, what gives us lot of confidence is that second quarter numbers were better than the first quarter numbers with a combined ratio of 104.5, which is still way too high, but measures are underway like the centralization of claims management, especially in Turkey, faster settlement, more selective approach with regard to distribution channels. It just takes time before this find its way into the bottom line numbers.</p>
          <p>I would like to refer you on the left hand side, Germany was in outstandingly good combined ratio of 89.7%.</p>
          <p>Finally, Munich Health, page 22, slide 10, 22. Munich Health, the combination of primary and strongly growing reinsurance health business. This strong growth in reinsurance comes from large volume deals similar to life reinsurance and we also had an acquisition of Windsor Health Group, which perfectly fits to our U.S. primary operation sterling because it brings managed care capabilities into our group, which is important under the circumstance of the U.S. health reforms.</p>
          <p>Consolidated results more than doubled, but its still on the relatively low but satisfying level.</p>
          <p>With that I hand over to Torsten for reinsurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am on slide 24 and I would lead you through reinsurance and start with premium development in the first six months 2011.</p>
          <p>For reinsurance, a very satisfactory development overall life and non-life together the group had 14%. And I would particularly explain, the growth 10.4% in the lower left part of the slide in property and casualty, because you might not have expected this sort of growth in this difficult market environment due to the cycle in P-C.</p>
          <p>What happened here? We general had a flat development of the rates and found hardly any growth opportunities, but then there were few exceptions. One of the exceptions was our P-C business in China that contributed about &#x20AC;500 million to this growth. And this China business was a new demand from the clients which was driven by the need to improve solvency ratios and in other words, business was not in the market yet. And then we could grow our agriculture business by about &#x20AC;90 million, that is a very solid development and no surprise for us here we are market leader in that business.</p>
          <p>And then, extra development in the UK Motor business where we benefit from participations and in proportionate business and we all know how nicely the motor market in UK developed recently. And the fourth, so to speak specific development came from the Offshore Energy business where the market and the rates happened after the Deepwater Horizon was in 2010. So, very explainable and nice developments which relates flat development in the general business due to cycle.</p>
          <p>I switch to page 25 and come to Life and Life's growth is 24.7% from &#x20AC;3.8 million to &#x20AC;4.8 million. And here the story is unchanged and the business we could generate here and it's a continuation of our large deals, or our large transaction basically from North America and Asia. And the trend continues also in 2011 which could write some additional business here which contributes to the top line. The volume in life is very similar to 2010, a very slight increase when you compare the quarterly results there, a bit distorted, the first quarter is probably a bit overstated and two optimistic second quarter, bit too pessimistic areas, additional losses to digest and altogether I think the average of the two quarters is quite right, hence meets our average expectation.</p>
          <p>Then, I switch too P-C on slide 26 and I explained already the volume growth from &#x20AC;7.6 million to &#x20AC;8.4 million. And the technical result which deteriorated from close to &#x20AC;200 million to minus &#x20AC;1.8 million is explainable and exclusively driven by the cat events particularly in the first quarter, but similar not to that extent but a similar trend continues in the second quarter particularly due to Tornado season in the United States.</p>
          <p>When you switch to the next slide, slide 27, you'll see the impact on the combined ratio 133% for the first six months in 2011. And remember after the first quarter we mentioned that about &#x20AC;2.7 billion losses occurred to the Munich Re balance sheet which led to this very bad combined ratio in Q1. And this figure increased in the mean time due to additional losses and loss development to &#x20AC;3.3 billion. The loss contribution from that nat cat events is about &#x20AC;3.3 billion, which is included in this combined ratio figure. And, the good thing is when you look a bit into the combined ratios underlying basic business is pretty stable and pretty solid. That means, we have to deal this year with the cat impact.</p>
          <p>And, here I would like to dig a bit deeper onto next slide 28. That maybe a sort of picture, which tries to describe what's happened and what occurred to us in the first six months. And, 2011 was already today terms of economic losses, the most expensive year ever, so that means the first six months are already higher in terms of economic losses than we have ever observed it before.</p>
          <p>Largest event first of all, of course an earthquake and tsunami in Japan, here we estimate insured loss in the order of US$30 billion then second biggest event, the New Zealand earthquake of February, 2011 in according to our estimation US$10 billion insured loss and then we calculated loss for the whole tornado season, consisting of different part, we were seeing the insurance loss is in the order of US$11 billion to US$12 billion.</p>
          <p>And, so that was bad luck, but was of course part of our business model, so losses are within our natural catastrophe budgets, or as far as risk management is concerned it was not a surprise even if I have to admit it was.</p>
          <p>On slide 29, I would like to describe the loss development and then on slide 30, the new losses. Loss development of losses which occurred prior from Q2 and here, the good news is loss which is in economic terms &#x20AC;1.5 billion from earthquake in Japan is pretty stable today.</p>
          <p>Where is still uncertainty in this loss? Where is better certainty? And we think, we get a good picture, I have got already a good picture for the residential office and here, significant part is already settled. So, this portion to overall loss is more reliable now and no surprise from that side and even a bit optimistic that we conservatively estimate this part of &#x20AC;1.5 billion loss.</p>
          <p>In terms of industrial and commercial losses, there is still further uncertainty. It's the biggest uncertainty comes from the business interruption and contingent business interruption part. And here, I think we have wait for maybe another two quarters to see a realistic figure. But the good news is that as far CBI contingent business interruption is concerned which is not covered in Japan, but could of course lead to losses outside Japan that we have so far not received any specific loss information. So, that means after few months after the loss, the good news is specific losses have not materialized yet, but we still think it's early to make a final estimation for this specific segment.</p>
          <p>Second part and that is sad story, earthquake Christchurch, here we had to increase our loss reserves by &#x20AC;260 million, now reaching level of &#x20AC;1 billion for the Munich Re. And what caused this increase first of all, it's based on the information we have received from the clients and it seems that losses, that the loss of this specific earthquake is pretty complex, meaning, a lot of structural, almost invisible structural losses, which occurred due to this interference of waves in this specific earthquake region, which lead to a difficulty to settle the losses and to judge them properly. And here if you ask me, where is higher uncertainty, earthquake, Japan or Christchurch? I still think is Christchurch. I'm more optimistic for Japan than for Christchurch, I don't know why, because no one of insurance industry has expected to the most damaged area in Christchurch which makes it very difficult to come to a final loss estimation.</p>
          <p>The other hand, there were weather related losses in Australia, remember the flood event and so, and here we see an improvement of our loss reserves and quick reduce by &#x20AC;110 million. On slide 30, I describe the new loss events which occurred in Q2 is the of course most prominent one, is the tornado season in the United States, I mentioned already &#x20AC;11 billion to 12 billion insurance loss and Munich Re loss estimation &#x20AC;210 million from all these losses together. And the tornado season tends to some extent to be explained as a result of the La Ni&#xF1;a phenomenon which occurred last year and leads usually to above average Tornado season in the following spring that means in 2011. And then, we had another earthquake in Christchurch last one of June not that severe as the former one maybe think as a lost for the Munich Re &#x20AC;60 million so that will not be the big one.</p>
          <p>I would now like to leave the figures and the development of the first six months and would like to come to on slide 31 to the renewal July 1. And July 1 wasn't interesting in renewal because there was a lot of speculation prior to the renewal of the market development as a consequence of the loss occurrence in the other part of the world. And July 1 is the second biggest renewal for the Munich Re about 11% of our P-C book was up for renewal.</p>
          <p>And what happens is the market can be described by significant increases in the cat and cat-related business, and then we saw a pretty stable development of original rate, which in most cases affect our facultative and proportional business. And the premium volume up for renewal &#x20AC;1.6 billion, and main markets which were up for renewal, Australia, New Zealand and Latin America and United States and global clients. And volumes split about &#x2013; before the renewal 25% property, nat cat business, 30% property, the non-nat cat, and about 30% casualty business.</p>
          <p>The outcome of the renewal is visible or can been seen on slide 32, and when you ask for a comment, I think it was more than satisfactory renewal for us. Why? Because, the forecast and expectations we had were fully met.</p>
          <p>And the premium volume could be increased by 10% and close to &#x20AC;1.8 billion. And when you look a bit deeper, then we could achieve price increase after exposure changes of 5.7%. And if you remember now, that the nat cat business contributed 25% to the business, which was up for renewal before the renewal, now in the meantime, more than 30%, and you see how big impact of the cat price increases was for the Munich Re portfolio, so a very satisfactory result.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide 33, maybe a summary; what we could observe in the market and how we see the coming renewals. First of all, we can &#x2013; we do not understand certain first predictions and then reports by a few brokers, who described rate deteriorations, particularly in the United States. That is absolutely not true. We could not observe that. The opposite was the case as the United States is quite not affected of losses. We saw follow-up for the market and/or the follow-up portfolio price increases in the order of 10% for the cat business. A bit higher price increases for hurricane-exposed business than for other perils of nationwide exposed business and what caused the price increases and to some extent or to a large extent that was the discussion about as modeled, the new version, which led to a completely new judgment of the hurricane exposure of the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>In Latin America and for Caribbean, similar price increases of 10% and that is particularly important because here we could increase already prices last year after the Chile earthquake and these prices could be continued or even be further increased.</p>
          <p>And now, the two parts or the two segments, where we &#x2013; which caused our losses in the first quarter; Australia/New Zealand and Japan. And Australia/New Zealand, general price increases in the order of 40% to 50% and because of our significant market share, remember our market share in that region is in the order &#x2013; in reinsurance in the order of 30%, and we were of course pleased with this &#x2013; with developments and they were important to us.</p>
          <p>In Japan, why Japan? Not all of the business was renewed and the remaining business, which was postponed, quickly renewed now. And here very similar picture like in the April renewal loss affected business for earthquake in order of 50% in combination with other perils in the order of 40%. So, that is the cat business. That is very pleasing development, but I always say a very necessary development.</p>
          <p>When you look at the right side of this slide, we try to describe the development in the non-cat perils in the underlying business. In here it's positive to mention then that prices could &#x2013; price erosions could be stopped. So, the price development was pretty flat in all underlying business. And in some cases, in loss-effective areas, proportional business benefited from commission reduction. And the small concern, we still have to see U.S. casualty business. Here we saw still slight price erosions in the order of minus 0.5% or so. So, it's still a difficult line of business, but all other underlying lines, flat development and first signs of improvements.</p>
          <p>Where could we observe the best developments in underlying business, some modern markets in the world. Industrial fire business saw a price increases in the order of 7% to 10%, but only in those areas, in those regions where large capacity is required to place these risks. And then I mentioned it already, offshore energy is nicely developing.</p>
          <p>What is over expectation for the January renewal? The January, of course, a bit ahead, and at this point in time, we think that similar development might happen. That means probably a flat to slightly increasing behavior of prices for underlying business, and more visible price increase for the cat business. And because model implications, and because in most cases we don't have reaches to where business is to be renewed, where losses occurred. For that reason, the U.S. is probably a good indicator for our expectation in the cat business in January. So, we are quite optimistic that the losses had at least one good implication and that was the surprise of our business.</p>
          <p>And with this comment, I would like to hand back to Nikolaus.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Torsten. And let me conclude by taking you to slide 35. And just as you thought on the outlook. First of all, the premiums might come in higher. Now as we &#x2013; than we thought in the beginning of the year, maybe up to &#x20AC;50 billion even. Return on investment, I already made my little remark here in saying that what we have seen through the first half of the year may be a little low. We might end up with a ROI closer to 4% &#x2013; somewhere below 4% probably.</p>
          <p>As regards the three business segments, of course, Torsten was finishing on a relatively positive note. Let me give you my view on reinsurance. First of all, I think that the basic loss ratio is relatively solid &#x2013; positively solid, that means low. And at the same time, we have the outlook on the upcoming renewal being positive and we have experienced three renewals throughout the year already that we consider positive. That all makes me think that including my remark on reserves when I started thereof with the presentation that we has a fair chance to not only see black numbers at the end of the year also in reinsurance, but we do successfully price business for a combined ratio below 97% even. Even though, the combined ratio in the current year for the losses we are seeing will be certainly above 100%.</p>
          <p>As regard to primary insurance, the combined ratio in the P&amp;C book should be below 95%, our target throughout the years in the cycles. The difficult thing with primary insurance this year is that we have many special effects that sort of distort number at first sight, so one have to look through that. If you do that, I think, then the basic business is doing fine. It's doing somewhat better than last year. The question is, what could be the result? We still think that we should come out towards the end of the year in the corridor that we put out in the beginning that is &#x20AC;452 million to &#x20AC;550 million.</p>
          <p>As of today, I would say, we're rather at the lower end and that may include another special effect, because we plan to maybe this year sort of replace some participations within the ERGO Group and hand them over to another entity in the Group that is still open, but it may influence numbers and that is included in my estimates.</p>
          <p>Munich Health, I think, probably no surprise. The combined ratio there is very steady, somewhere around 99% normally. But they are on a good path and consolidation is going on, and I think they have the maximum of further 12 months to go. And they have fully digested the new businesses they acquired. Of course, the big unknown there is what will the U.S. administration do when it comes to the budget deficits, or the dealing with the budget deficit. And stocks in the &#x2013; health stocks on the S&amp;P 500, of course, were characterized by an extreme volatility over the last weeks, so that is an open question there, but we are in good shape and that's why I am not worried there at all these days.</p>
          <p>If you take all that together, then the profit, of course, cannot be a 15% return on our risk capital in place, but it should be positive. And we have, of course, still the budget in place for the still open five months of the year, both as regards large single losses and natural catastrophes, but uncertainty is out there not only as regard to politics and sovereign debt crisis, but also as regards provisions.</p>
          <p>A last word may be on dividend and share buyback, not on the slide here. As regard to dividend, as you know, this is very close to our heart. And if I am not entirely wrong with what I said about possible profit for the entire year, the dividend is within reach. The share buyback is not only not as close to our heart, but it is also I think in view of the uncertainties is not the time to come up with any statements as regards share buyback.</p>
          <p>You remember, probably, that over the last six years, we returned to shareholders, in effect, on average, &#x20AC;1 billion each buyback and dividend each year to make it a &#x20AC;12 billion. So, this is the past. The future right now is focusing on dividend and buyback will be addressed when we feel it's about the time to do so.</p>
          <p>With that, I would hand it back to Christian. And thank you for your attention so far and we're going to the Q&amp;A, I guess.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. My first question relates to Poland and your International business. Can you please describe whether or not in Poland you've seen an improvement in technology profitability this quarter, and exactly what that's been? I guess, sort of subsidiary question there, as you mentioned the all options are on the table for the South Korea and Portuguese businesses. Would you mind just describing what exactly you mean by that? Do you mean that you might be thinking of selling those businesses? Yeah, those are the two questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>And they run at a combined ratio of 100.10 at the moment. That is a substantial improvement. They have been successful all over the years and had a bad run just in 2010 on the basis of an enormous burden from natural catastrophe losses. The recent floods did not have much of an impact. Therefore, we are very confident that Poland is back on track. And your second question refers to Portugal, did I get it right?</p>

          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. And my first question is on, I suppose, risk management really. I was quite shocked by the 35% increase in the New Zealand earthquake. Your peer did 10%. So, I find that quite hard to kind of put in context. It doesn't fit at all with the image I have of Munich Re.</p>
          <p>And in the same vein, I note that you had a reserve addition for Turkey for the second time. If I remember this history on Turkey, you said Q4 was bad. Then you had a reserve addition in Q1 and then you have another reserve addition in Q2. And I'm just wondering where's the risk control? And, I suppose ultimately would S&amp;P be tempted to come in and say look, we don't see the risk control and we'll take off your strong on that.</p>
          <p>And then, the other question I had is on the write-down on Greece, could you actually walk us through the actual accounting? I'm only aware of &#x20AC;63 million going to the RFP, so I'm just wondering where the west went. But maybe you could just actually walk us through the accounting, it would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, Torsten Jeworrek here. I'll start with New Zealand. And to your question, first of all, I share your view, so I do not want to talk small. I fully agree with you. I can only give you &#x2013; can try to give you, let's say, an explanation why is that difficult to come to a reliable figure here. First, that does has to do with the nature. We have this &#x2013; it was a 6.3 magnitude earthquake, which did not cause a loss size of the magnitude 3 earthquake. That is the problem here. And that has to do with liquefaction and with the interference of waves, which led to a loss picture that you, in some cases, did not see any structural losses of buildings but when you look at the basement or so, then because of liquefaction they are damaged and are total structural losses. And because no one has access to certain parts of the city, it makes it so difficult for us and also for our clients to come up with reliable figures.</p>
          <p>Why is Munich Re particularly affected? Of course, because of our market share in that region, New Zealand and Australia together, no doubt. On the other hand, the first loss estimate which we gave was still within our priority, that means in our net business. And even now the &#x20AC;1 billion does not deduct any recovery from retro. And, of course, for that reason, we are not protected here in the level where the loss changed now. Other companies who have maybe thought of hedging a retro strategy in place might easier digest an increase which does occur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Michael, with regard to Turkey, you're right. We are not satisfied at all about the speed of the turnover here. But when you enter into such a situation, where you have problems with the company, then you turn every stone and that explains part of the reserve development, which you correctly mentioned here. We also have a kind of loss trend in the market, because there are many bodily injuries, they are included. So, perhaps there's also a little bit of an over caution, but it's premature to talk about that. I am confident that with everything what has been put in place in the last couple of months that we will see an improvement very soon. So, far with Turkey.</p>
          <p>Then perhaps a quick word on Greece before Nikolaus will wrap it up with regard to risk management. We had &#x20AC;700 million '03 write-downs, of which some &#x20AC;560 million were in primary life, &#x20AC;430 million went to latent RFP and &#x20AC;40 million latent taxes, which is then an impact of net &#x20AC;90 million &#x2013; some &#x20AC;90 million. And together with the other segments, the impact on primary was &#x20AC;113 million. It's always very difficult to translate the German GAAP calculation, which is relevant for the policyholder participation into IFRS and even more on a quarterly basis. So, this is based on the expectations that the overall investment income from ERGO will be large enough to deal with the policyholder participation. With that, to Nikolaus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a short word to your introductory note. Michael, as regards the S&amp;P and the risk management, I think the two examples you gave are not risk management issues in the narrower sense. I would say it's management issues in the first place. And as regards Turkey, of course, that was poorly managed, as J&#xF6;rg already said. We were too slow to come close enough to the issues. And when we had turned around one stone, we turned around another one and found another issue that goes even back to IT performance and so forth. We feel now that we have seen it all. We may have been a little bit too conservative. I would also be very cautious to come up with that statement, but that is now &#x2013; will be addressed.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the loss estimates, of course, for New Zealand, Torsten gave you the explanation of why we had to increase. But again, for me, this is not risk management in the narrower essence. This is rather the question of how do you address losses once they come in. They were within the models. That is the risk management issue here. The question of how quickly you come up with the right estimate for the losses for me a different issue. And, of course, at the same time, we had to, I would not say, unfortunately lower our reserves for the Australian floods. So, that is the counter argument here.</p>
          <p>And we, as you know, always address reserve issues for up first and are little slower to address the issues when it comes to lightening the reserves. That's why I feel not uncomfortable here with the quality of risk management, because it's a matter rather of management. So, the Turkish issue, I cannot be happy with at all. With the loss estimates I don't feel too uneasy as long as I feel that the modeling and accordingly budgeting and pricing is right and here I have no doubt.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question from Vinit Malhotra from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much. This is Vinit from Goldman. So, one question on Torsten's slide number 33, there in the casualty section you mentioned first signs of improvement are apparent in the last bullet point on the right. Would really appreciate if we could just hear your thoughts on that because all we hear is negative commentary day-in, day-out on this segment and this is practically the first time we've seen that.</p>
          <p>And secondly, just really very simply number question here. On the reinsurance headline combined ratio 99.9%, I can &#x2013; I mean, when we add all the nat cat and larger losses, that's around 18%, budgeted 11%. So, you're getting to a 93% kind of underlying versus typically 97%, 98%. So, was something &#x2013; is something at work here, because you did mention, Nikolaus, that you're writing business much below 97%? Is there something to read here, any comment, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vinit, J&#xF6;rg here. There's, in the numbers, a little bit of a distortion coming from currency effects, group internal stuff, very difficult to understand, so very technical issues. That means that the underlying combined ratio on a normalized basis is somewhat understated here. So, it should be a little bit higher, let's say, some 2% higher than the calculation you did before.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe &#x2013; Torsten here, again, maybe a short remark to the casualty observation you made. We distinguish here between the U.S. market and the other market. In the U.S. market, we fully share your view. We have still a negative observation opinion of what have happened here. In other markets, I mentioned a very significant example like motor businesses in UK or in Latin America where we &#x2013; and which we book under casualty where we have very nice price increases, which we could generate. Therefore, it's a mix picture at this point in time.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question from Spencer Horgan from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you very much. Just a couple of number detail questions, please. The first one is you spoke about expected price increases being similar in January on the cats and the non-cat businesses you've seen in the recent renewals. Could you just remind me what the rough split of renewing premium is in January between catastrophe and non- catastrophe, just so we can sort of think about a weighted average number?</p>
          <p>Then the second thing is, if you look at the tornado costs, I think in relative terms, they are a little bit higher than some of the peer group have reported, and I know they're not an enormous loss in the overall context of things. But is there any particular reason why those tornado losses should be proportionately higher for you guys than some of the peers? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Spencer, I'll start with the second question and in the meantime, we look for the share of the cat business &#x2013; non-proportionate cat business in the January renewal, here ask for one minute. The tornado losses that is explainable. I think when you look at our business and ask who produced these losses then a major part of our tornado losses stem from our insurance operations in Midland.</p>
          <p>Yeah, they are a direct writer and they are exposed in the hinterland in this, in the Midwest. And here we see the losses, which hardly go through the cat programs in the traditional reinsurance into our books. So, that is explainable. I think.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just one quick question, actually, the tendency for all the factors now to be writing down the Greek bonds, as you've done. Clearly the direct impact is more than manageable, as you've shown. I guess one thing that's just been &#x2013; well, there are may be one or two others I think is just the potential impact, if you see significant other institutions that you've invested in having a more significant impact from that?</p>
          <p>Just wondering, A, what your thoughts are with your experience on that, and B, just is there anything you're doing within Munich Re to mitigate the risks of other institutions having perhaps a slightly bigger impact from those impairments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, J&#xF6;rg speaking. Yeah, we look at that very thoroughly and that is one reason why we have implemented a couple of months ago a financial sector limit for our exposures, yeah, because we see the secondary effect. For the time being, we do not have any specific worries in the names we are somewhat exposed to. Naturally, we have bank debt in our asset portfolio, but they are, as far as I know, not particularly weak candidates in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you able to give any sort of indication on that financial sector limit, what would &#x2013; roughly what that means or whether it's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that is internal. I'm sorry.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add one thing only. The logic of that segment is pretty much the same that we used for the nat cat business. So, we calibrate it to the available financial resources without telling you how &#x2013; what exactly the number is that gives you a feeling how we run it. Two, of course, we do not try to outsmart others by saying we know who is the one.</p>
          <p>So, of course, we react to market implied rating changes, whatever, and the limit we thus react to try not to just follow without thinking whatever could a cyclical or even more cyclical movement. But we don't think we are smarter than others. So, since we are long holders we have fair, I would say, distribution across the financial industry in terms of exposure. In other words, if something goes wrong, we most likely will be hit somewhere, this is the bad news. The good news is it will never be too much on one single address most likely.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question from Fabrizio Croce from Kepler. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two question actually. The first one is about your investments and particularly about the real estate quota, the real estate quota is very extremely weak at Munich Re, at least against your history. And then, of course, you have a structural advantage because you are, for the majority, being invested in German paper rather than U.S. or UK Paper. But are you not lending in a false safety assumption by reducing further already very weak real estate exposure and should you actually not go a little bit more deep in this asset category? This is first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is about renewable energies. Here if we chat with our companies, nobody is speaking or highlighting this as being one of the sector in which they are building up investments or premium. And I mean it's a rock-solid investment, so it's real and it's hard. So, basically, it's good. And on the other hand, from a business perspective, it seems that given that you are speaking about this alone, you should have a considerable market share in it. So, my question is are we speaking here about market share, I don't know 70%, 80% of this market and how big are the premiums currently in this market for you &#x2013; or really if you have a total figure for the entire market, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you talk about the investment.....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Both, actually. On the investment, how much you put in overall in terms of billions and the second one is in terms of insurance premiums?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I can quickly answer the investment question that our intention is to go as high as &#x20AC;2.5 billion. For the time being, we haven't done more than &#x20AC;500 million. We are careful, but we like this kind of investment because it's similar to infrastructure investments with rather stable cash flows. And Torsten will answer the question about our insurance exposure and market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Renewable energies, here we have to distinguish and I can only answer one part of your question. And when you look at renewable energies, you have usually premiums from renewable energy equipment in very traditional policies, so construction policies, property policies. This part of the business is bread and butter business for us, that is in treaties and in facultative acceptances; that is something we do not monitor.</p>
          <p>What we do monitor is which additional and new business we can generate through the development of new products. And here we have generated in the last two years an annual premium volume, which stands now at &#x20AC;50 million, and what are these products? These are sort of performance guarantee products, which are new in the market, and I think where we are the market leader or probably the only one who offers that currently.</p>
          <p>And, so when you asked me what is the projection for that, we see huge premium growth for the Munich Re. And we expect that 2015 premium volume in the order of &#x20AC;400 million, &#x20AC;500 million, so that is very significant and we are very pleased with this development where we I think have a unique selling proposition.</p>
          <p>So, I come back, once I have some micro here, I come back to Spencer Horgan's question, and answer the two open questions, what is our catastrophe excess of lost share in the January, in the coming January renewal, and about 11%. And the second quarter was how much of our Munich Re tornado losses come from our Midland, our insurance operation from the two, a bit more than &#x20AC;200 million losses &#x20AC;60 million from Midland.</p>

          <p>Wonderful, thank you, Torsten. And I come back Fabrizio to your real estate question. And real estate of course is an important asset line for us. And we have of course always said that we will not dramatically increase it. Now, the ratio came down because we sold a major real estate lot and slot in Singapore. That is what J&#xF6;rg already mentioned the specific extra increase of our return on investments here that was triggered by that sale.</p>
          <p>Overall, we look for interesting projects. It's not so easy, we are picky, I admit that too. We have some projects in the pipeline. We are not pushing it, and specifically, we will not go out with a target of either several billions to be invested anytime soon or a certain percentage. But if you take 3% where we stand more or less right now and say maybe it's 4%, but it will not be 6% or 7% anytime soon. So, we might increase it slightly, but it depends on opportunities, and we will not push it. And you have to see it in the context of other less liquid asset classes like the rent, which was just discussed and mentioned by J&#xF6;rg, infrastructure investments and so forth. So, this is for us a basket that we consider somehow like an inflation hedge, but it's not real estate alone.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question from Michael Haid from MainFirst Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and good afternoon. I have two questions. First of all, you talk surprisingly little about life reinsurance. The profitability in the second quarter was rather low with a high tax rate. Can you explain that? And also within Life Re, I noticed that deposits retained and reserves were up by roughly &#x20AC;3 billion. Can you explain what is behind that and how it is going to affect the return on investment &#x2013; the return of investment of this segment?</p>
          <p>Second question on ERGO, as you mentioned ERGO received some negative press recently. This comes at a wrong time as you just head a marketing campaign to establish the ERGO brand. Can we expect the further marketing campaign going forward and how much would it cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael. You first on Life Re, and especially the tax question, that is a tricky and difficult one. And what we do with taxes is that we do a constant refining and recalculating of our tax burden from the current quarter and all preceding quarters including preceding years. And that are many years where things develop over time. And then we have a kind of a new calculated tax. And the whole difference to the tax of the preceding quarter is then booked into the respective quarter.</p>
          <p>That means, in each quarter, we have enormous distortions up and down on our tax rate. And therefore, the tax rate at the moment in reinsurance life is relatively high. The last quarter, it was too low. So, it's fluctuating around. And I can promise you it will ever fluctuate in this way due to the same phenomenon which I described before. The increase in deposit is due to the large quota share treaties and it produces a little bit above average return on investment, I would say. Yeah, so, on average. ERGO, Nikolaus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you also for that question. The marketing campaign in fact was stopped for a while good six weeks, eight weeks, and we restarted or ERGO restarted the marketing campaign recently. So, this is all still the old campaign and the old budget. Then this marketing campaign will probably come to a close towards the end of the year. It's actually a five &#x2013; block of five-phase campaign, and one phase is still to come.</p>
          <p>So, that will run through. And then ERGO management will have to sit down and to see what and if next, but there is no plan right now to continue. So, what is being used or out of the budget is the old budget. Nothing had to be added. And since there was that six, eight week block, nothing was spent in that time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question from Jason Kalamboussis from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, there. Couple of things. The one is &#x2013; coming back to Michael's question on the RFP. I know that you don't disclose, you only disclose the RFP at year end, and it was around &#x20AC;850 million for 2010. Can you help us, if you cannot disclose where you stand now, can you help us to have an idea of the ins and outs because clearly, some big part of the Greek impairment will be going in there. There is probably a little bit of a benefit from the real estate sale in Singapore, but just so that we know where we stand.</p>
          <p>And is that correct to infer that if you do have any further problems, you probably will have to step in because the RFP buffer will not be there for that. And the second part is on RMS, I can appreciate that you have your own models, but could you tell us that how do you see the RMS changes filtering through the July renewals, and for how long do you think &#x2013; how long it will take for it to have the full impact in the market?</p>
          <p>If I may add to the RMS, I mean looking also at AIR who says that basically they had already the inland hazards and things like that. If you could put RMS in perspective, I mean were you closer to AIR on that respect, if you're saying that your models haven't changed, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're speaking on free RfB, it's true that we don't disclose it all the time, but it's roughly &#x20AC;1.3 billion, and therefore it was possible to book up the active latent RfB for the impairment of the Greek bonds. But a real calculation is really only done at the end of the year on the basis of German GAAP. And since we expect enough profit to come in, also gains from disposal, we do not have to compare temporary losses with the existence of the free RfB. The free RfB is just necessary to be able to book these losses as active latent RfB. Torsten?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Implications of RMS. As far as the translation into the business &#x2013; insurance business is concerned, it will probably at least take a year, maybe two years to see the full impact of these model changes. It depends of course to an extent who in the market uses RMS and who quickly can changes be implemented and applied. Insurance companies have &#x2013; need probably a bit longer time to make changes in their underlying portfolio. Reinsurance will respond faster here, but again, at least one year, maybe even a bit longer.</p>
          <p>When you ask me is this trend sustainable which we see that model changes lead to higher loss or risk perception leading to higher prices, it's always a equation of two sectors. One is of course the model, here we see the support now, and the other thing is, the demand-supply ratio which is driven by capacity and to some extent overcapacity in the market. At least, it's a good thing if in the companies in the risk management and underwriting processes, underwriters have to defend and justify decisions to deviate from the right model base. Therefore, we think that whatever happens with the capacity to some extent these model changes, these increases will be sustainable.</p>
          <p>What happens with Munich Re with our portfolio and we have all external models in our company to compare our own curve with external curves. So, we always want to see what is going in the market and as we mentioned in the past that we finally then make a decision which curve we use that happens here again and here too. So, at the end of the day, we use our own curve and that is by the way the reason why in the last years after Hurricane Katrina after we had and did adjust our curve immediately to a higher level, we were considered as very expensive in the market.</p>
          <p>So, it's a good thing now that the external available models and the last one is now RMS, move to a level which comes close to our curve in general. So, we feel confirmed to some extent and if you ask me is the model change right or not right, what RMS did? I think it was the right thing and it's the right thing. We had the similar expectation or judgment already before.</p>
          <p>And when you ask how does RMS model compares with our models, that is difficult to tell because it very much depend on the region. And although on the question what loss ratios or loss estimations are assumed for coastal business and inland business. The biggest change or biggest &#x2013; very big change has come from inland business from hurricanes and floods, which is beyond the first and second tier on the coast. And here the inland business we see two trends. The RMS model significantly sees upward changes in their model are in turn who increased their model already a few years ago have just reduced this inland figure a bit. So, we think we see a sort of convergence of the various models these days, so far to the models.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just two quick questions. You mentioned that German GAAP the equalization reserves had absorbed the &#x20AC;3 billion plus cat losses incurred in the first six months. My recollection, the fire equalization reserves were about &#x20AC;3.4 billion. So, does that mean essentially the fire equalization reserves are now exhausted so any future losses would fall straight through to German GAAP equity, I guess, because there isn't any equalization reserve offset, maybe just to clarify if that really is the case?</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you give us any indication what's happened to your kind of PMLs, probable maximum loss scenarios on U.S. hurricane, post the renewal? And I'm trying to get a sense of, I look at your scenarios which I think were last published at the full year would I increase those by 10%, 15% just taking into account any increase in business or any change in risk model. And have you purchased any additional retro protection in any form ahead of U.S. hurricane season? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Torsten here. I'll start with your model question. There are two actually two questions, one do we have or do we want to change the method how we calculate our PML which could lead or would lead to an increase or reductions, no, not at all. We think our method is stable and sustainable though we don't see any need to change our model calculation for our worse case event in the various regions. So, that is....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry the question is I'm trying to understand because of you've written a bit more business, has the PML gone up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I come to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question is, have you written more business so to speak which drives our PML upfront no, not in the United States. In the United State and by the way all the European windstorm scenario, we currently keep our PML exposure pretty unchanged. And by the way we could have thought to write a bit more there's room for increase, why we don't do it now, because allocation of capital to the various scenarios works in a way that higher peak scenarios gets an over proportionate allocation of risk capital, which makes us less competitive.</p>
          <p>And we think we have reached in these two scenarios a PML level compared with other scenarios in the world which is sufficient considering the current pricing levels in the market. If you look however to other scenarios, in Asia or even in Australia, here we expanded our and increased our PMLs by additional business somewhat, but not in the peak exposures, United States and Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question about equalization reserve. It is not so easy to answer for a couple of reasons. There are many countervailing effects going into it. For example, I'll start with our natural catastrophe expectation for the rest of the year, so we put that into our model calculation where this equalization reserve will end up. Then, there is also profit from various sources. Business is performing well, renewal was good, therefore, we expect the relevant losses to be lower than expected for example after the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Then last, but not least, not all losses from the natural catastrophes are booked under fire. Most are, but not all. There's a little bit of casualty there, especially engineering losses are also enclosed. Therefore, it's not a precise art in the course of the year, but there is more than &#x20AC;1 billion left in fire in our expectation for the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question from Jens Luckmann from Redburn. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you. I just wondered in terms of your pricing. I mean I know its risk adjust just wondered in terms of seismic risk like near-term aftershocks and so on, how do you figure that in? And also has the last experience in New Zealand or Japan changed your view on risk?</p>
          <p>And my second question if I may is on the RMS Europe model update, that has been released quite currently, do you have any visibility on that, if that changes as dramatic as in the U.S.? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, when you ask pricing of earthquake events, it's much more difficult to calculate the probability of a very specific loss event than the price which consists of possible probabilities of smaller and larger events. So, that means the average of a price is an easier thing and aftershocks of earthquake are measured and therefore included in the models.</p>
          <p>So, that is not issue for pricing purposes. Yeah, in terms of loss calculation and loss estimation, it's of course more difficult because when you estimate a loss you cannot know how many aftershocks will happen and what you have to include.</p>
          <p>Do we have to change models as a consequence of occurred earthquakes, no. We have monitored that and of course all losses gives a bit new picture in terms of frequency and severity and translation of losses and so on. So, every &#x2013; all loss helps so to speak. But we cannot see any significance which would lead us to change our models after these events. What we have done is that we have asked us, has earthquake which did occur change the geological situation in the specific areas, but it has nothing to do that our model was wrong. That has to do that we have a different picture, different behavior of stresses in the ground that because and as a result of the earthquake.</p>
          <p>And here, of course, we had to make changes and adjustments particularly in Japan, where the very large earthquake released stress in the neighborhood of the epicenter and it changed and to some extent did increase other stresses in the northern and southern part of this fault, where the earthquake did occur. And here of course we adjusted a bit of underwriting policy and implemented it into our models.</p>
          <p>RMS Europe, we have the similar picture like you. Our general perception is it moves upwards, difference by regions are to be expected to that, but not to that extend like in the United States, but we also in the middle of our own evaluations here. I cannot tell more now at this point in time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions. I've been disconnected during the part of the call, so apologies if this has been asked already. But first of all, what is your capital position according to the S&amp;P model? I think the last time you were asked I think you guys said low to mid single digit billions, but I frankly can't remember the date of that comment.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, when you think about your dividend and you think about all the different potential constraints on that, how do you prioritize those constraints? In other words, what is the closest to becoming a binding constraint in your ability to pay a flat or growing dividend? I can think of the S&amp;P model or maybe there is the creation of revenue reserves or maybe there's other issues but how do you &#x2013; what's the closest to becoming a binding constraint? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, our capital position with Standard &amp; Poor's no longer has a single digit billion buffer at the moment because we lost some &#x20AC;2 billion more than originally expected in the natural catastrophes and therefore it's just very small plus, very small excess if any. It's difficult to judge because there are too many analyst adjustments involved and also Standard &amp; Poor's in the process of giving us credit for the internal model. This is a process which is underway and which will most probably come into effect at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Therefore, I would not call our Standard &amp; Poor's capitalization a binding constraint at the moment for a model rate unchanged dividend. Same with local German GAAP revenue reserve. They should be sufficient to support such a dividend but we must have an eye on it because there are also interest rate change risks involved here. If we have a sharp increase in interest rate that would have a negative impact on local German GAAP and therefore we observe, it with a lot of caution, but I can say with a very relaxed attitude for the time being.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Could you comment please on claims experienced we see in the life reinsurance technical profitability was somehow down year-over-year, so some comments on what's going on here? And coming to your investments, could you maybe indicate the current reinvestment rate, you are seeing and maybe also your preferred spots, whether you're investing in that fixed income environment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The claims experienced in life re was somewhat worse than in the first quarter, but we see it as a natural fluctuation, not as a general trend. It comes from isolated spot. Then second, our reinvestment rate depends on our behavior and also, so volatile at the moment, so somewhat below 4% roughly 3.6%, 3.7%. If we go into corporate bonds it's rather it's 4.2% to 4.3% or so. So, it just depends on our tactical movements, but one can say safely say it's somewhere between 3.5% and 4% on average.</p>
