          <p>Thank you, Marie.</p>
          <p>This morning, John Deere reported results for the first quarter of 2010, and what a quarter it was. In spite of a decline in sales, earnings were up 19% from a year ago. The improvement was led by our Ag &amp; Turf and Credit businesses, both of which are experiencing improved conditions. Disciplined cost and asset management were again major stories, with SA&amp;G expense little changed, and trade receivables and inventories down by $1.4 billion. Finally, our full-year forecast for earnings has been increased significantly, to $1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>All in all, it was an impressive performance. Now let's look at the quarter in more detail starting with slide three.</p>
          <p>First quarter net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company was $243 million, or $0.57 per share, on net sales and revenues of $4.8 billion. It was the second highest earnings total for any first quarter in the company's history, trailing only the first quarter of 2008. As shown on slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 7% in the first quarter versus first quarter 2009. Currency translation on net sales was positive by about five points, with about two points of positive price realizations.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide five, worldwide production tonnage was down 20% in the quarter. However, demand has been better than expected for large ag and international forestry products, accounting for the improvement in our tonnage forecast. For the full year, projected production tonnage is now forecast to be up about 5%.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the company outlook on slide six. Second quarter sales are expected to be up 4 to 6% compared with the second quarter of 2009. Currency translation is expected to be positive by about five points, with about two points of positive price realization. For the full year, net equipment sales are forecast to be up 6 to 8% compared with fiscal year 2009. This includes about three points of positive currency translation and one to two points of positive price realization. Net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company is now forecast to be about $1.3 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture &amp; Turf on slide seven. In the quarter, net sales were down 6%, with production tonnage down 20%. Operating profit was $352 million in the quarter. Lower raw material costs, positive price realizations, and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and product mix offset lower sales volume and higher post-retirement benefit costs. A&amp;T is starting to see benefits from last year's organizational realignment, resulting in the creation of the Ag &amp; Turf division. Ongoing rationalization of processes, facilities, and resources is allowing the division to more efficiently meet customer needs and reduce overall costs.</p>
          <p>Before we review the sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business, starting on slide eight. Commodity prices for the '09-'10 crop have risen modestly since our last forecast. Corn acreage is expected to increase 1.5 million acres in 2010 to meet growing demand for feed, exports, and ethanol. What's more, corn is expected to be more profitable this year. According to Informa, profit from corn will be $77 an acre more than soybeans in 2010. This is an additional $15 an acre above the 2009 level.</p>
          <p>For soybeans, continued robust export demand will keep prices relatively high in the near term. Finally, cotton prices remain well above year-ago levels, driven by lower production in Asia and the rapidly recovering Asian economy.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide nine, forecast prices, as you can see, are below the very high levels of 2008, but remain strong on a historical basis. On slide 10, 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are now forecast to be up about 4% from 2009 levels. The biggest change is in the livestock sector, where milk prices have continued to climb and things are generally headed in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 highlights farm net income in Brazil and Argentina. Argentina is recovering from the 2009 drought, driving increased demand for tractors, combines, sprayers, and forage equipment.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, 2010 farm net income is expected to double from last year's level. Normally, when we talk about Brazil, we talk about soybeans. However, the primary driver of increased farm net income in 2010 is the large improvement in sugar. International sugar prices are extremely strong. Demand is higher than production due to a drastic drought-driven reduction in sugar output from India and China.</p>
          <p>Strong demand for sugar is only part of the story in Brazil. Other positive factors include demand for Brazilian commodities globally, as well as government-sponsored low-rate finance programs like Tsunami and Mas Alimentos. These are all contributing to positive producer attitudes which translate into higher spending on farm equipment.</p>
          <p>Putting all that together, as you can see on slide 12, our outlook for industry sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada is comparable to 2009. This is up significantly from our previous forecast of down about 10%. The strength we've seen in our order books is driving this increase. For example, the combine early order program ended in January with a significantly higher than expected response rate. Demand for large tractors has been higher than expected as well. On the 8R Series tractor, we have added schedule as orders have come in. Effective availability is December 2010. The story is same on the 9000 Series tractors, with effective availability in May 2010.</p>
          <p>Conditions in western Europe are weak, with Ag sales there expected to be down 10 to 15% in the year. Farmer sentiment is low, and used equipment inventories remain high due to the lack of product going to central Europe. We expect sales in central Europe and the CIS to remain under pressure as well. Things look better in South America, where things are expected to increase 10 to 15%. Turning to another product category, we expect retail sales of turf equipment and compact utility tractors in the U.S. and Canada to be flat for the year after a sharp drop in 2009.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, Deere sales for worldwide Ag &amp; Turf are projected to be up 4 to 6% in the year, versus our previous forecast of down about 4%. Currency translation is projected to be positive, about four points. As just discussed, demand for large ag equipment is much stronger than anticipated. Product mix has shifted in our favor as well. In November, we talked about product mix, referring to sales of different categories of equipment, being a factor in our lower 2010 outlook. At the time, we expected sales of large ag products to be down almost 10%, with the large absorption of these products negatively affecting operating margins. In our current forecast, the anticipated improvement in large ag will change the mix. We now expect mix to be neutral in 2010.</p>
          <p>The division will benefit from operating improvements made in 2009, as well as from positive price realization, lower material cost, and the positive effects of currency. Conversely, about 300 million of the increase in pension OPEB expense will be charged to Ag &amp; Turf. Also, the division will see higher R&amp;D expense, primarily for Interim Tier 4, the regulatory engine emission standards in the U.S., and Stage III B in Europe.</p>
          <p>In Turf, we are encouraged by strong retail demand in commercial mowing and golf and turf equipment in January. For the year, the A&amp;T division's operating margin is forecast to be around 10%.</p>
          <p>Let's focus now on Construction Forestry on slide 14. With continuing weak markets in the U.S. and abroad, net sales were down 15% in the quarter. Production tonnage was down 22%. The division reported an operating loss of $37 million. Again this quarter, C&amp;F demonstrated commitment to its trough management plans through tight expense control, but higher pension and OPEB expense, as well as higher R&amp;D expense, mainly associated with Interim Tier 4 spending, resulted in a decremental margin of about 50%. Without these two items, C&amp;F's decremental margins would have been in the mid-20s. Through the aggressive management of production levels, the division has continued to successfully manage inventories. At the end of January, based on inventory levels reported to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, Deere construction dealers in the U.S. and Canada were carrying about one-third less the inventory than the rest of the industry, based on percent of days on hand.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, Construction &amp; Forestry sales are now expected to be up about 21% in 2010, up from the very low levels of 2009, and from our previous forecast of up about 18%. On the Construction side, as you see from the chart, U.S. economic indicators for 2010 indicate the retail market will remain weak. Nonresidential spending is forecast to be down again in 2010, due to ripple effects from the depressed housing sector coupled with tight credit conditions. Overall, we believe the retail market for construction equipment will be down 5 to 10% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Things are looking a little better however for global forestry markets. Improving global economic conditions, better pulp prices, and low field inventories will benefit the Forestry segment in 2010. Again, this is in comparison with very low levels of 2009. Deere's C&amp;F division will benefit from higher production and sales. However, these will be offset by a higher charge of about 100 million for pension and OPEB expense. Other headwinds include higher R&amp;D expenses primarily for Interim Tier 4, as well as a possible material cost increase and roughly flat pricing. As a result, the C&amp;F division's operating margins are expected to be similar to 2009.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to our Credit Operations. Slide 16 shows the worldwide Credit Operation's provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average portfolio. In the first quarter, the provision, on an annualized basis, ran 52 basis points. Write-offs in the Construction Forestry portfolios were lower than expected, and lower than a year ago in absolute dollars. While this is encouraging, we aren't prepared to say we've turned the corner. The full-year provision is still forecast to run around 89 basis points, roughly the same as last year.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, past dues for the worldwide Credit Operation are about flat with last year. Annualized write-offs continue to reflect the excellent performance of our Ag portfolio. The Construction &amp; Forestry rate has increased, but as noted a few moments ago, write-offs in dollars are lower than a year ago. The percentage is higher because the portfolio &#x2013; the denominator &#x2013; is lower. This reflects the steep decline in U.S. construction equipment sales since 2006.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 18, worldwide Credit Operations' net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company was $81 million in the quarter, versus 45 million last year. The biggest factor was an improvement in financing spreads. This resulted from interest rates returning to more historical spreads following the interest rate volatility in late 2008 and early 2009. Looking ahead, we are projecting worldwide Credit Operations' net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company of about $260 million in 2010.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn our focus back to the equipment operations, and take a look at receivables and inventory on slide 19. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were down roughly $1.4 billion in the quarter. Since our last outlook, in light of the higher-than-anticipated production levels expected in the fourth quarter, we are forecasting receivables and inventories to be up about $450 million in 2010.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales. Slide 20 presents the product category detail for the month of January expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were down 7%. Deere was down less than the industry. Row-crop tractor industry sales were up 32%. Deere was up more than the industry. Four-wheel drive tractor industry sales were up 5%. Deere was up a single digit, but more than the industry. Combine industry sales were up 14%. Deere was up more than the industry.</p>
          <p>Looking at Deere dealer inventories in the bottom chart, for row-crop tractors, Deere ended January with inventories at 21% of trailing 12-month sales. Combine inventories were at 6% of sales. The January percentage to trailing 12-month retail sales has seen a slight uptick for row-crop tractors year over year. At the end of January, the absolute number of units in inventory for both row-crop tractors and combines as a percent of trailing 12-month sales was lower than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 21, in western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors were down double digits, and combines were up double digits in January. Deere's retail sales of selected turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were up a single digit in the month. Construction &amp; Forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada, on both a first-in-the-dirt and settlement basis, were down double digits for the month.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 shows raw material and logistics costs down about 160 million in the quarter. We now forecast material cost decreases of approximately $150 million for the year. This is slightly lower than our previous forecast, reflecting higher commodity price projections for inputs like steel. This estimate could deteriorate further if commodity prices rise more than anticipated and the dollar weakens from its present level. The Ag &amp; Turf division savings is forecasted at about $150 million. For Construction &amp; Forestry, due to the currency impact on partner products, we are now forecasting C&amp;F material costs to be flat to up $25 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at R&amp;D expense on slide 23, R&amp;D was up about 7% in the first quarter, with currency translation accounting for about two points. R&amp;D expense is expected to be up about 12% in fiscal 2010, with currency accounting for about one point. The bulk of the increase is accounted for by Interim Tier 4 emissions spending.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide 24, pension expense in the first quarter was about $110 million. As discussed last quarter, the 2010 forecast calls for an increase of about $400 million in pension OPEB expense, primarily due to a change in the discount rate. Of the $400 million change, about 325 million will hit cost of sales, leaving about 75 million in SA&amp;G. Ag &amp; Turf has responsibility for about 300 million of the additional expense, while the increase for C&amp;F is about 100 million.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, equipment operations SA&amp;G expense was up about 1% in the quarter. Currency translation accounted for about four points. Pension and OPEB added about three points. Excluding these two items, SA&amp;G expense would have been down about six points in the quarter. For fiscal 2010, we now project SA&amp;G to be up about eight points. Pension and OPEB accounts for about three points, variable incentive compensation contributes about three points of the change, and currency about two points.</p>
          <p>Moving to the tax rate on slide 26. The implied first quarter tax rate for the equipment operations was about 36%. For 2010, the full-year effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 34 to 35%.</p>
          <p>Before touching on cash flow, currency movements, both translation and transaction, or trade flows, increased operating profit by about $75 million in the first quarter. On slide 27, you see the strong cash flow from our equipment operations even in years of tough market conditions. This reflects, in large part, our success managing assets and controlling working capital levels. We anticipate strong cash flow from the equipment operations in 2010, $1.9 billion, up from last year's $1.4 billion. Such strong cash flow is further testament to the execution and success of the SDA model.</p>
          <p>On slide 28, capital expenditures are now expected to be about $900 million, primarily driven by Interim Tier 4. Depreciation and amortization is projected to be about $600 million. Our forecast currently includes about $600 million of pension and OPEB contributions in the year, and capital spending for financial services is forecasted around $200 million in 2010, primarily for wind projects.</p>
          <p>In closing, John Deere has started 2010 on a strongly positive note and is looking for further improvement in the year ahead. Our performance in the face of stubbornly weak global economic conditions reflects the solid execution of our operating and marketing plans and our success in taking costs and asset discipline to a new level. We've remained squarely focused on our customers as well, expanding our global customer base and extending our competitive position. As a result of these factors, we continue to believe that our company is well prepared to capitalize on an eventual upturn in the economy and well positioned to meet the world's growing need for food, fuel, shelter, and infrastructure in the years to come.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations on a nice quarter. Just two questions. One, Marie, can you give any more color in the first quarter, how much &#x2013; can you quantify what the material cost benefit was in the first quarter when we think about the Ag margins and just how that plays out throughout the year? Because I'm perplexed by your flat margin comment for Ag for the full year.</p>
          <p>And then the other &#x2013; the other question would just be on &#x2013; just a little more color on what you're seeing on western European trends within farm. You didn't change your top-line forecast, but sort of how you're thinking about your inventory levels and production relative to the industry and any color you can give by country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't we start with western Europe first. Farmer mood there continues to be pretty somber, and as a result, you'll note that we have not changed our guidance, which is the industry will be down 10 to 15%. We do see some differences in some countries. Because of the currency relationships, you do see some &#x2013; a little bit more strength in places like the UK and Poland because their currencies are &#x2013; their &#x2013; the farm subsidies are paid in euros and their currencies are relatively stronger. But generally speaking, livestock is maybe stabilizing some, but stabilizing at pretty low levels and you continue to see a backup of used equipment. We've cited this a couple of times in calls before. It's not yet at worrisome levels, but it does act as a precautionary note in the markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; generally speaking flat through the rest of the year. You'll note, too, that when we talk about things like R&amp;D and SA&amp;G, we're relatively light in the first quarter. Those costs will increase. At least that's what the forecast has them doing as you move through the year, and of course Ag is a bigger piece of both of those numbers.</p>

          <p>Can we talk about construction equipment, and I guess I'm sort of surprised it's going to lose money for the year, and it doesn't sound like you expect to make money in any of the quarters, given the scenario. What's going on? Is it all because of the Interim Tier 4 investment? Or what's going on that you're not seeing any sort of operational improvement in construction?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are really three factors. Even though their sales are up, basically that incremental margin is absorbed by about $100 million pension and OPEB increase, which we had &#x2013; talked about last quarter, so that's still in play. They too have higher R&amp;D, and it's actually, for the division, for the full year, it's about $40 million, so it's not insignificant. And they have &#x2013; there's one other factor. This is why we have notes.</p>

          <p>There are material costs. We have a headwind of flat to up about 25 million. So the mid-point of that would be, what, 10 to 15.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a follow-up question. You talk about Ag &#x2013; you have increased ag production significantly, and I think as you referenced it, the fourth quarter's going to be much higher. Can you give us some insight into how the Ag more &#x2013; the Ag sales will look for the rest of the year? Second quarter obviously probably still be the strongest of the year, but will &#x2013; a much stronger fourth quarter now than you anticipated before? Is that what you indicated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think that really was referencing not then what we anticipated but basically versus a year ago. Because a year ago, we were &#x2013; we had significant shutdowns, and so this year, we will be in production at a higher level, and that of course then goes on to affect our trade receivables.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So second quarter will be the strongest of the year, but much easier comparison, second half of the year, is that what you're saying?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to have two questions on production schedule. The first is just how you think about it. We've been hearing, and we believe, underlying demand is fairly strong.  Have you raised the combine production, and is that done? You're pretty much going to produce what you're going to produce?</p>
          <p>And a similar on the large tractor side. Would you potentially, if demand continues to be strong, pump that up again, or are you aiming to hit a certain schedule?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We certainly would do everything that we could to meet our customers' demand requirements. And to go back to one of your earlier points, yes, we have pretty significantly increased our projected production for combines and actually for large tractors, and that &#x2013; as we talked about, that is really the single biggest factor driving the change in top line and income guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the follow-up is, we've heard a couple farmers, not a lot, but a couple, talking about nervousness about the Tier 4 engine, not so much the price, but wanting somebody else to take the risk on the first year of the engine. And so, are you concerned about a pre-buy? Does that affect your production decision for this year? And what's your strategy for showing farmers that the engine's going to work? How are you going to roll that out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've already been at farm shows starting to introduce the product. We're starting to get news &#x2013; magazine articles talking about the production. I would like, and it's anytime you have a major change in a machine, there's always some customers who want the first in technology. There will be some interesting product benefits in some of the products that come along with it, and there's a tremendous need to continue to improve productivity. We, over the long term, we need to increase food for the world. And so I would say that this is something that we've managed through before. We will be doing a &#x2013; we have a very significant rollout plan for &#x2013; in terms of training and educations for dealers and technicians and of course for customers. We will have plenty of opportunities. Jim?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me just add to that a little bit. Marie hit on this training, and this is a huge undertaking. We've got 20 different courses we're rolling out, in 14 different languages. We've already touched more than 8,000 dealer personnel. And so all of that is really about educating the folks that are the front line interaction with the customers, to help the customers get the level of confidence that they need and to make sure that we can deliver the John Deere experience. So it's a huge undertaking.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, guys. I'm sitting here, because I'm laughing, because I think for the first time in the history of my covering John Deere, I have no objections to your outlook for Agriculture, either in North America or rest of world. I don't know what I'm going to ask my question about.</p>
          <p>So let's take it a different way. Marie, it's kind of a double-edged sword that &#x2013; or whomever wants to this address this. But currency is a positive and that it's positively impacting your outlook for equipment sales. However, the double-edge sword is, a stronger dollar could impact both your equipment exports as well as top commodity exports. Can you talk a little bit about what exactly is in your outlook for currency, particularly euro/dollar exchange rate, and what &#x2013; the upside versus the downside risk that you see with that forecast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well specifically, we have a practice of not forecasting the &#x2013; what the currency will do, and so we look at the rate that we have experienced in the quarter, and use that to forecast going forward, and that would have been a euro that was 1.40 or -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>1.46.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>1.46 for &#x2013; was the average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Was average rate for the quarter and that's what we use going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the company, in terms of Europe specifically, the primary tractor in Europe is a mid-sized tractor, and those are manufactured in Europe. That's the primary source for it. So we do a fairly good job of trying to match production to where the markets are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You did benefit last cycle though from significant exports of combines out of North America into places like eastern Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Eastern Europe and Russia, and that's a whole different set of circumstances. Go ahead, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, a lot of those transactions would be denominated in dollars as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But &#x2013; and Ann, you're aware that, though, the single biggest factor in our outlook there is the circumstances in Russia, and we will &#x2013; we're working to get a assembly facility up and running. We're on time for that. We said in the spring, and we're working with the Russian government to make sure we all understand the terms. So we're on track there, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my follow-up question is, a somewhat similar question, but on interest rates. Interest rates have helped support very aggressive pricing out there in the marketplace, not just from John Deere, but from competitors at large, and it has been a positive for your financial services business. Can you talk a little bit about your outlook for interest rates going forward and how that might impact your financial services business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We, I don't think, really have been out front with a explicit forecast.  But our financial services business is all about, we don't really take positions on rate so much. We try to lock in finance spread and be match funded, such that these swings, unless they happen very quickly and are very violently, that they don't impact the earnings stream too much.</p>
          <p>Having said that, in general, our view would be for a increasing rate environment over the course of the year, and we &#x2013; and that would be a very, very modest view, though, and we have factored that into some of our forecasts on the financial services side, but also on the equipment side. Because that generally results in a higher interest waiver charges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question for you on how much could you flex capacity, if we were to get a pre-buy for the large tractors and combines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't cite it so much as a pre-buy, because we know that the primary drivers of customer demand are good levels of cash receipts, because that's farm income, and we've certainly would agree, going back to Ann's comment, low interest rates certainly does also help support that. You are aware that we had put additional capacity on at both Harvester and at Waterloo last year, and actually at many, many of our factories globally. So we have the ability to respond to additional demand. That said, for our combine programs, in the U.S. and Canada, round numbers, 95% of our orders are already in place and we adjust production accordingly, based on our &#x2013; the results of our early order program. So we're &#x2013; we could have some additional flexing there, but we're pretty well in position there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's helpful. And for my follow-up, you mentioned benefits from the Ag &amp; Turf restructuring. Are there any more benefits that could be had from restructuring the old Commercial and Consumer segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that is included in the benefits that we are citing, because as we merged the two divisions together, there were people -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; redundancies and processes that were improved really out of both sides of the business. We really &#x2013; we don't exist as two separate silos anymore. They're really fully merged, and that's what's generating for this year a 50 to $60 million charge.</p>
          <p>I would just talk about our landscape, too, where we &#x2013; they have faced very difficult market conditions because they are very focused on housing and driven by housing. And that business has unfortunately also had employee reductions, to the tune of about 800 people, 800 to 1,000, and they've closed or merged store locations, so they also are looking for some improvements in their financial results, and that is maybe an additional $25 million this year.</p>
          <p>And then finally, you're aware that we closed our facility in Welland and we're really in the final phases of that, and so there's some operating savings this year to the tune, pre-tax, of about -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Couple quick follow-ups, I guess. I'm just curious, what happened since your last forecast that you gave us that led to such better margin? I guess it was all in the margin. But something must have really changed since the lens you were looking through in November was kind of so far off. What &#x2013; how did the quarter evolve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, we &#x2013; in terms of the sales outlook for the year, the single biggest driver was that our order books developed pretty dramatically over the course of the &#x2013; over the first quarter, and enabled us to improve our outlook for the industry, from down 10 to basically flat. Go ahead. The single biggest driver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And at a much different level than that, because that's the single thing that's &#x2013; business drivers, but we also then experienced a more favorable currency than we would have built into the original estimates.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And my follow-up, I guess maybe this is for Jim, but whoever wants to take it. We've talked a little bit about how you have a lot of liquidity on the balance sheet. You're obviously continuing to generate a lot of cash. At some point, some of that cash I guess becomes available for things like share purchases or dividends, or even acquisitions and &#x2013; but I think you've said that you wanted to kind of wait and see how things evolve in the financial markets. Has there been any evolution over the last few months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, first of all, you're right on. We've &#x2013; that's what we said, and the &#x2013; I would say, we have this well articulated use of cash policy, and one of the use of cashes that we've talked about also is making sure that our pension plans are fully funded, and then &#x2013; and so we did increase funding to the pension plans by about $250 million, in terms of the forecast.</p>
          <p>In terms of how we view the world, I think we still think we're on a relatively fragile foundation. In the fourth quarter of '09, we were all shocked by the whole Dubai situation and what the implications of that may have been for the capital markets, and then of course then we move into the first quarter and get to the Euro Zone issues.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we are targeting &#x2013; we had about a 12-month target of pre-funding at the end of '09, and we will be coming off that moving more into the six- to nine-month range by '010 &#x2013; by the end of this year.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Marie, in the last conference call, in November, you talked about the Construction Forestry, saying it would be up 18% in factory sales, with the retail sales down 5 to 10%, and you basically made the same forecast this time, except saying that the factory sales would be up 21%, which &#x2013; and the retail sales again down to 5 to 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that is primarily due to a lower inventory reduction year over year. Maybe a flat inventory, versus a huge inventory reduction last year at the dealer level. Now, can we then take that concept and talk about the Ag business? What's happening at the dealer level in ag inventory? And maybe you already mentioned this, but I didn't hear it. How much of the change in sales of ag equipment might be due to less inventory reduction at the dealer level than last year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We aren't expecting any reduction in inventories in the Ag business in &#x2013; at year over year, in &#x2013; at 31 October. In fact, at the dealer level, they'll probably have &#x2013; at least our forecast has receivables and inventories up about 450 million. That's our guidance at year-end. And most of that'll be in ag receivables, and it'll simply be because we'll have a little bit more in the pipeline than we did a year ago.</p>

          <p>My question relates to your Ag &amp; Turf outlook. What you report in the first quarter and what you're saying for the full year implies the next three quarters, the rest of the year, your Ag &amp; Turf sales are up nearly 8%, but your operating profit margins are down about 60 bips year over year.</p>
          <p>And it looks like, from what you're implying about costs, generally neutral the rest of the year, on a year-over-year basis, pricing up &#x2013; for the whole company &#x2013; up about 220 million rest of year. Have to assume a lot of that's Ag, not Construction.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What am I missing why your margins would be down the rest of the year, year over year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The increase in R&amp;D, which was up 7, it's &#x2013; in the first quarter, it's up 12. Higher SA&amp;G, which was &#x2013; basically I think it was up like 1% in the quarter, and our guidance has it up for the full year &#x2013; the number escapes me, hold on. SA&amp;G for the year, up 8%. So basically that's all back-end loaded.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be powerful enough to offset &#x2013; obviously the mix sounds like it's improving.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And price versus cost is obviously &#x2013; and price versus cost sounds like it's almost 100, 150 bips year-over-year improvement the rest of the year as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember the ag division will eat about $300 million more of pension. Now some of that is &#x2013; flows through SA&amp;G, so I don't want to -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But about 60% of that increase actually goes into cost of sales. So you wouldn't be picking up any SA&amp;G. And that is &#x2013; I mean, there's nothing else. It's very plain and straightforward. Those are the items that eat up that additional margin.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess related then, the pricing on the products in backlog in the order book, obviously there's been no change since price was set last fall, generally speaking, right? So if I'm getting better large equipment, which is where you got the pricing, or at least you tried to get the pricing &#x2013; it looks like it's coming through with the order book the way it is &#x2013; again, I'm still a little surprised that you would think that the offsets from SG&amp;A and so forth would actually give you down margins when Waterloo, Harvester Works -</p>

Our previous guidance had been similar to what we had done last year, and now we're saying about 10%. So it's a bit of an improvement.

          <p>True, true, but again, at the end of the day, the rest of the year, sales are implied up 7.8% for Ag &amp; Turf, while your margins are at 10.1, and you did 10.7 the last three quarters of last year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I actually do want to follow up on David Raso's question. If, as he forecasts, the 60 bip decline in operating margin against the 7.8% increase in sales, when I look at the SAG guidance for last year versus &#x2013; for fiscal '10 previously, the only real change is variable compensation is now seen up three, whereas it was completely absent from your old forecast. So wasn't variable compensation a major reason why Ag &amp; Turf didn't get any volume lift on the additional volume as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be a factor, but that's really in the SA&amp;G. And then admittedly, there's some of it in cost of sales as well.</p>
          <p>But the other thing is that it's somewhat of a timing. Our SA&amp;G came in last year a little more uniformly than what we are currently projecting this year. Again, we had a &#x2013; we were almost flat in the first quarter, and yet you're looking for a gain in &#x2013; over the course of the year. So you're going to have a bigger increase year over year in quarters two through four.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but even though you had a plus four prior forecast for FX, now it's plus two, so what you picked up there was 200 bips, but your variable comp went from zero to plus three, which more than offset -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And where does it lie in Ag &amp; Turf? I mean, what's their take, since they're obviously doing better than anybody else?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They get the bulk of it. And some of it goes into cost of sales, and some goes into SA&amp;G, and there's a little bit in R&amp;D, but basically it's cost of sales and SA&amp;G</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd be happy to. The &#x2013; actually, Forestry accounts for the improvement in the Construction &amp; Forestry outlook. We originally had said our sales would be up 18. Now we're saying up 21. And really it's because we are starting to see better ordering activity &#x2013; principally it's in &#x2013; it's coming out of Europe. But now we're talking about extremely low levels, really, in Forestry across the globe last year. So you're starting to see a little bit of improvement.</p>

          <p>Oh. Yeah, I mean anecdotally, customers, and as you &#x2013; I've actually looked through the comments even. They're talking about good farm incomes. They're talking about the need to maintain their normal trading cycles.</p>
          <p>We hypothesize, in fact, that maybe some of the very difficult conditions planting in the last two springs, and then of course what happened this fall with a very late harvest, may also be supporting that.

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Marie, can you step us through what part of your cost structure was lower than you expected in the first quarter?</p>
          <p>I understand the point about increasing production the balance of the year, but your production in the first quarter was mostly in line with what you were looking for, and looks like margins were about &#x2013; call it 3 to 500 basis points higher than you anticipated in your guidance last quarter. Was it higher plant efficiency levels? Greater gains from the Ag &amp; Turf combination? Can you give us some more color on the drivers, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; as you &#x2013; just to refresh your memory, actually we don't have guidance by quarter anymore. So you're probably looking at us compared to other modeling, but we would not have uttered any comments about what we thought our income would be in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>That said, if you look at us year over year, the mix I think which we were thinking would be a bit of a drag for us on the Ag operations actually was a positive in the quarter. We're telling you for the full year, it's neutral. It actually was about a point positive in the quarter in the margins year over year.</p>
          <p>So that would have been an improvement. Material costs came in maybe a little stronger than expected, and then the currency, which had not been in the forecast, and that's about a $75 million operating benefit.</p>

We do quarterly calls with our suppliers. We're working with them to make sure that, if they have bottlenecks, we are working through them, through those processes with them in the near term. We can maybe adjust some production to get things in early, late, depending, to help accommodate their productions.</p>
          <p>At this time, and we just checked with our supply management folks again, we don't see any bottlenecks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a quick &#x2013; a separate follow-up. The double-digit increase in western Europe combine sales, retail sales in January, is there any color behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's off of such a low base, there is no color. I think it's just a question of timing of some deliveries. You're talking a handful of units.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so no &#x2013; we shouldn't read anything into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Our guidance is still that that market is down in western Europe 10 to 15%, and nothing unfortunately we saw in the first quarter was &#x2013; has shaken that outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Koznarek. Please state your company name.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Hi. It's Cleveland Research. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question on the South American outlook. Just using Brazil as a proxy for overall South America, which probably is part of the answer to the question. But it looks like unit shipments for the first three months of your fiscal year are up 35% for tractors and 70% for combines, and the implication of even the top end of the guidance, 15% for the market for the year, actually means combines would have to be down for the final nine months of the year, and tractors would be up kind of a high single digit. So should we think about your South American outlook being conservative, or is there something in the latter part of the year that you're expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I guess, two things. One is I &#x2013; that South American look is influenced by conditions in other markets, and although we see Argentina coming back, it's coming back from pretty low levels. And then you have various sordid circumstances in other markets. So that's one factor.</p>
          <p>The other thing is, is that Tsunami, the current programs, end in &#x2013; at the end of June. Our forecast anticipates that they will be renewed, but probably not renewed at the same levels. You may recall Tsunami right now is 4.5% financing, and of course, time will tell, but since we don't know, we're I think a little more cautious on the fourth &#x2013; it's in particular, it's the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so even with an election coming up in October down there, you think they would have a less attractive Tsunami rate starting in July?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we are probably just being prudent, and I don't think &#x2013; we will wait and see what the government says.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, that's what our forecast contemplates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just &#x2013; with that, just to follow up, with that contemplated less attractive Tsunami rate, do you expect that that drives the market down to sort of a flattish outlook in the second half? I mean, <mark type="inaudible" /> do you guys have like real strong first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't be that prescriptive in terms of how it works out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just some &#x2013; so some of the steam goes out of the situation, is what you're contemplating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark. Next question.</p>
          <p>Operator. Thank you. And at this time, I'm showing one final question. Our last question comes from Daniel Dowd, and please state your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bernstein. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask first about the facility in Russia. You said it's continuing on plan, and I guess my question is, even if the credit issues in Russia and eastern Europe don't really start to ease in the next six months, do you &#x2013; are you &#x2013; when that facility starts to operate, are you still going to have to stock the dealers who are &#x2013; or are those dealers actually already stocked and there's not really demand for tractors out of those facilities until retail demand actually picks up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the &#x2013; it would probably depend by product. They're &#x2013; first of all, we're talking about getting- we're going full steam on this. This facility will be open in the spring. You're going to miss part of the season. So this gives us the time to ramp up. So we're not looking for high levels of sales, candidly, as we start to ramp up. We're going to do one product, make sure we get it right, do the next one.</p>
          <p>Financing is showing some signs of easing in Russia. It's much more difficult in other countries, but interest rates have come down, and so there are a few glimmers. Now, we're talking at the margins, so don't get too excited, but there are some signs here. Our dealers do have some product that was there before the liquidity crisis, so there is some product in country to help facilitate activity in this period of transition, if you will. Does that help?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the way &#x2013; it does. So let me just make sure I'm clear, and this would still be my first question. On the &#x2013; the way to think about this is, there's some dealer restocking in the back half of 2010, probably creating positive year-on-year comps, but the real game is recovery in 2011, assuming their credit crisis continues to ease. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a fair statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one last quick one. In Q1, your fiscal Q1, in the Construction &amp; Forestry business, did you produce the retail demand, or did you underproduce retail demand in that quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we under, but let's see. In the first quarter, we would have basically produced to retail demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
