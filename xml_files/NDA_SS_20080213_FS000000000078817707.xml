        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  I'm pleased today to deliver a strong and convincing result from Nordea in 2007.  I will go through the presentation with you, Arne and I. We'll start with page 3.</p>
          <p>This strong result is based on an income growth of 8%, the gap between income costs of 2% in accordance with our guidance, and our risk-adjusted profit is up 15% which is also well ahead of our long-term target of 10% on average per year.</p>
          <p>Profit before loan losses of 11%, and since we have positive net loan losses of 60, but lower than last year when they were 250.  The net profit is up 3% on a comparable basis.  Return on equity, 19.7, and earnings per share 1.20, and proposed is then $0.50.</p>
          <p>As a limited pay rate and interest exposure to the sub-prime market as well as insignificant exposure to the credit-linked structured investment vehicles so that effects on the data from the financial market turmoil is indeed been limited.  We have benefited from the high quality in our balance sheet, our well-diversified business profile, and our very good liquidity position and a solid funding name.  Actually I can say that I believe that Nordea is one of the strongest funding names now in Europe and have been so throughout this period.  So then we have indeed limited impact on our funding starts.</p>
          <p>If we move to our earning and income which is up 8%, is primarily driven by the net interest income of 11%, doubled its growth in lending, flat margin pressure, increased -- sharp increase in deposit volumes and somewhat improved margins.  Net commission is up 3% and high lending commissions, savings commissions up 7, asset management commissions only are below 3%, reflecting a lower -- asset fund of management their clients have moved from investment funds to savings deposits in view of the market prevalence.  Commission expenses are 17, reflecting mostly that we have expanded our credit card business significantly.</p>
          <p>Net gains losses are 15%.  It's mainly driven by a high cost of demand for the risk management products.  I will come back to that, but it is indeed a very good performance in this period, so, net gains losses of 15%.  Even quarter-on-quarter operating income is up quite significantly.</p>
          <p>Cost increase is in line with our guidance with 6.4, excluding investments in growth areas and Russia, its 3.7; and if we exclude increase in market severance, then it's actually seeing that the underlying cost increase is 3.1%.  Wage inflation is gradually increasing.</p>
          <p>Profit before loan losses are 11%, contribution from all business units, which means that the full year gap is met with the 2%; solid performance in Q4, on top of a very strong performance the year before in Q4, and it also gave  a positive gap in Q4.</p>
          <p>Credit preferred is strong, well-diversified 15 quarters in a row, with positive in net loan losses, the loan lending confirmed is still very diversified, 56%, corporate, 44%, household.</p>
          <p>Let me give a few comments to our strategy to going forward.  There's not a lot of new things that we have, reconfirming a number of our growth initiatives, and our view on how we should go forward from good to great. The profit orientation is of course, is our strong foundation. Strict cost management, prudent risk control and capital efficiency are the three words we use over and again, and they really characterize our culture in Nordea, which, of course, has been a very strong foundation in this period. Our risk management has been key in handling the situation.</p>
          <p>When we move to the next slide, our ambitious targets are there, and we have a follow-up in TSR, number three out of 20 in our peer group; that is clearly top quarter.  Risk-adjusted profit is 15% up, which is higher than our long-term target of seven years doubling.  Our year is in line, its 19.7 and we don't know yet whether it's in line with Nordic peers.  We have to see the rest of the peers report; 40% payout ratio, we propose 41 and 7% to 1 capital.  The TSR is clearly in the top quarter and actually as one of the few banks with positive performance last year.</p>
          <p>Risk-adjusted profit is up 15%.  It's a very good start on our long-term target which started in 2007 and it's driven by top line growth and which requires of course growth initiatives to double the risk-adjusted profit or &#x2013; in reality to double the value of Nordea.</p>
          <p>So the return on equity is 19.1 or 19.7, including non-recurring items.  Dividend of 2%; we are paying out 1.3 billion euros in dividends this year.</p>
          <p>A few comments to our organic growth strategy, we are executing it through with nine clearly defined growth initiatives and we keep focus on these.  They have indeed delivered through 2007.  We will continue with the same speed roughly in 2008 so everything is on track and we expect delivery in 2008 as well.</p>
          <p>On the household side it's mainly the migration of customer up to premium segments which is a key initiative.  We attract new customers to the premium segments and we have a special focus in Sweden where we have particularly large customer base compared to other advisors and network.</p>
          <p>Private banking; it's about adding capacity and accelerating the customer referrals from internal customer potentials.  The corporate strategy have rolled our new corporate merchant banking concept successfully since May last year when it was introduced.  We have established or are establishing in the coming years the cash equity offering to the professional investors.  And most importantly probably, we are indeed seeing a sharp growth in the sale our added capital market products to the next segment.  These risk management products and balance sheet management products has developed for the top segment and we are now selling them into the next segment of corporate customers which is huge in Nordea and which has large untapped potential.</p>
          <p>We are reinforcing our number one position in shipping and in new European markets we are expanding the distribution in Poland.  In Russia we are broadening the focus to include all segments, including household and the large corporates, and we have selected growth in the Baltic countries.</p>
          <p>These growth initiatives are purported by a number of other growth initiatives which are relative freeing up the resources needed to advise these customers and these more customers better.  We are filling our time for sales and unifying customer processes in the branch network.  We call it future branch program and we are unifying product development processes and we are moving to the next phase of improvements, cross-unit across our value chain.</p>
          <p>Let me give a few comments to each of these growth initiatives.  The first one of migrating is clear from the next slide that we have a huge potential, growing customer generates eight times the revenue of a branch customer and we see a significant potential with the number of customers, at least 1 million potential Gold customers in the customer base.  But also a significant potential for Gold from the outside and actually an increased number of Gold customers this year, one-fourth of them has come from external sources, which we see on the next slide where we also see that the actual number of Gold customers has gone up by 7%.</p>
          <p>Russia and Sweden is on track, we have 7% income growth, which is actually excluding the hedge activities somewhat higher and we think we are ahead of our peers in terms of generating growth.  We are increasing the number of advisors and the number of branches, specifically with the month ago announcement we are converting 36 offices of Svensk Kassaservice to Nordea branches and we are taking over employees from Svensk Kassaservice and we are adding further 100 advisors to increase the distribution capacity.  All these branches will become completely normal, Nordea branches and work on the same customer programs as any other branch, but it will increase our capacity, especially in Stockholm, where it's nearly doubling our network.</p>
          <p>Private banking is growing strongly, 4.3 billion euros in in-flow, 120 new advisors and 13,000 new customers.  It's a very attractive business and we have a good potential to grow, both from internal and external sources.  The capital market products are significant, both going forward, but also in the year we have just passed, as you can see on the P&amp;L.  It's particularly the customer-driven demand for the risk management product that we're solving by de-centralized units where we have advisors globally to handle the corporate needs.  It's a significant potential because there's a low penetration and the need is quite obvious and the profitability high.</p>
          <p>In new European markets we are growing.  We have opened 52 branches in Poland and Baltics.  We are going to continue that.  We also increased lending and number of Gold customers significantly because income has actually gone down while we had invested and we see very rapid cash flow generation out of this investment within sort of 20 months with the positive cash flow.</p>
          <p>So the outlook for 2008 we have a situation of course with increased uncertainty, and the global macroeconomic situation coming from the credit crisis in the U.S., we are assuming at this time, like most economists and IMF, that the economic growth in this area will be about 2% GDP, and we're also assuming that interest rates on average in the Nordic areas will be roughly unchanged, and with those assumptions we believe that we can guide the growth in the risk-adjusted profit is going to be in the range of 5 to 10%.</p>
          <p>We are continuing our investment in growth areas as I've gone through and they are on track, and we think they will continue to deliver and we think that investment will amount to maybe 100 to 120 million euros in 2008 which will mean that our costs will be slightly higher in 2008 compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>Of course with the uncertainty on the outlook we will carefully follow the macroeconomic situation in our area, and we are ready to review our level of investments and our cost expansion in light of this situation.  But we can't say that the very high activity we have seen throughout last year, also in Q4, on customer side and we think it's continue and we see that it's still happening and therefore we believe in beginning of 2008 we'll begin to see the growth continuing, more uncertainty of course of the latter part of 2008.</p>
          <p>The overall quality on the credit portfolio remains strong, however for 2008 we will expect some net-loan losses because regardless of previous made provisions are likely to decrease.  So my controlling the markets that we have a strong result based on our gross revenue including risk management, limited affects from the market turmoil.  We have met the three gap target of 2%, we have beaten the long-term risk-adjusted profit target 10% by 50%, which is a good start for the longer term growth, and we have continued strong organic growth in spite of the increasing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment.  Overall quality of the credit portfolio remains strong.  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, we will now begin the question and answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Matti Howcat from Hendels Bank is online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  A couple of questions, if I may, first on the guidance, if I understood you correctly, that you said the cost growth would be above 2007, which was 6%, partly because of these initiatives.  And I noticed on the screens there was some discussion proposed from the press conference that the revenue growth would be above the cost growth in 'the 08.  Is this correct by the way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's correct.  I think it's important to understand that the growth initiatives are medium to long-term growth initiatives.  The long-term growth targets of doubling our risk adjusted profit in seven years, of course requires that we invest in growth.  You can say it requires that we capitalize on our huge customer base and make it happen like we have been done in the last year.  And that's what has to continue.  Of course, with then stay steady on our investments and growth initiatives, but of course we will be flexible throughout the year if we see the economic environment changes compared to our assumptions.  But as we start the year, and with our assumptions made, we think we will come in with an income increase which is higher than the cost increases.  And we will follow that growth throughout the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the 6% is the cost growth, the corresponding cost growth for '07 that we should be looking?  So the cost growth in '07 also in '08 would be larger than 6%.  Is this correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, somewhat I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks.  Then another question, say your competitor, mainly from Iceland have said that they've been very successful in raising deposits mainly in the Finnish market, where you have quite a substantial market share.  Can you confirm that you would have lost market share, and do you plan to do something regarding pricing on your retaliating fees?  The deposit rates in Finland and maybe even Sweden where I hear the Icelandic Internet offerings are becoming more and more aggressive as well?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, generally the comment on saving deposits leaving the market share to others -- the general comment is that we hang in on the competition on savings deposits in all countries.  We typically do not have to pay the same amount as some other banks in terms of rates.  But we stay competitive.  We don't want to lose our deposit base, especially in the period of time where a number of clients are selling out their risk assets, and instead going with cash.  We, of course, would like to keep our market share of deposits.  So we try to stay competitive.  But it's sort of a battle week by week to make sure that we arrive there at the right rate, being competitive, attracting exactly the deposits we need, not overdoing it and losing margin, and not under doing and losing market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I ask another, this question has been somewhat focused on loss of market shares but at the same time we want to be careful because the focus has to be old news now, huge clues from have been pumped into deposits.  Nordea we have, as you might have seen, we have lost the net outflow in the weekly farm from 2.7 billion in '07 but at the same time we had inflow on our saving accounts of more than seven billion.  And of course it's our own costumers then that flows into savings deposits that change the market share.  We are focused on offering seeing good development in the total savings area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And commenting on Finland, very specifically the household deposits, our market share is 32.2% which is down a few percentage points than previous period.  And looking a more longer term view there our market share has been pretty stable there only 32-33%.  And in this specific quarter, the market share on corporate deposits in Finland is actually stronger, clearly stronger.  So I think we are holding up very well in Finland, also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Kim Bergoe from FPK [Fox-Pitt Kelton] is on the line with a quick question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  It's Kim Bergoe, Fox-Pitt Kelton.  First, if you could comment on what kind of underlying rate inflation you are seeing across your businesses.  And also in terms of the guidance you are now saying if you want to keep positive jaws we're talking at least 7% income, could you give us a little bit more steer as to where that is coming from in terms of volumes and margins that you see.  And then a question on your dividend, up 2%, obviously that follows pretty much your net result but as you are showing risk adjusted profit up 15.  It seems a little cautious that dividend, any comments to that?  And then one last thing, Danska Bank was saying they are going to invest a billion over the coming years in digitalization of their IT platform.  How much of your transactions are done in that sort of digital manner?  How much of your lending and these kinds do you have something that can help us sort of compare the two of you on that front?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me start off with the rate inflation it's, we are seeing steady now, in our report expect that to increase somewhat and on the average being up between 4 and 5% and maybe around 5% next year.  It's been somewhat lower '07 and the basis for our estimate assumptions on the outlook is that we of course we do see margins now, the personal margins setting out quite substantially and they are with the volume increase we have had we see also the last quarter and today we -- that in itself of course will help us to see increase in income next year.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the dividend, it's correct that compared to the profit, but we had a very strong dividend increase last year and we -- this is well in line with our target and with a growth rate we had in business during the fourth quarter, actually, that didn't justify higher dividend if you look at that isolated.  And going forward now we also indicate that we see possibility to release capital in base to the environment, but we don't see any need to be too aggressive at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe I can give a comment, I cannot comment on another bank's IT investments, but I can say that what we are doing, we are working both on our future branch and on their transformation program outside in by making customer processes and customer advice processes more efficient.  And that is very much building new processes and new IT processes and that could be anything from the customer management systems to automatic credit scoring and so on where we get a much higher degree of straight through processing from the customer straight through to the settlement part.  We have no exact numbers how much we intend to mention -- measure our efficiency on how much time we free up and we have a clear number that we think future branch is going to free up at least 400 people this year, which we of course are not are freeing up in the sense they are leaving because we are freeing up and using that more time to gain more Gold and Private banking customers in the network, which is good to generate the growth, that we're talking about.  So we are looking at this, making the daily life of the front office much more efficient by having more efficient processes and thereby freeing up time for cost savings.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Derek De Vries from Merrill Lynch is online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Thanks.  This is Derek from Merrill.  So I have a couple of balance sheet questions for you.  The first one, you've seen a number of European banks change their tier 1 targets as they are transitioning to Basel II.  In light of the current environment uncertainties, your 6.5 tier 1 guidance, is that changed as we fully transition to the Basel II world or are you still pretty comfortable 6.5% tier 1?</p>
          <p>The second question relates to some of the high yield lending you do or leverage finance lending or whatever terminology you use.  I'm assuming that's part of your 205 billion loan book and I'm wondering if you could quantify roughly how much of that would be leveraged financed or high yield lending and if you've taken any hair cuts on that in terms of valuation?</p>
          <p>And then the third question is a bit detailed for a conference call and I apologize, but there was a pretty big jump as I look at the interest bearing securities that you have held for trading.  It went from 6 billion to 17 billion and I know that it's a volatile number and it sort of bounces around but sort of a tripling of held for trading securities surprised me in a widening credit spread environment and I was wondering if you could give a comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With our thoughts with the tier rates speak to the target on 6.5 <mark type="inaudible" /> at least during this intermediate period up until 2010.  Then of course it remains to be seen exactly what the outcome of tier 2 will be going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the leverage finance, of course it's included in the overall figures of 245 billion and amount of what we would call leverage financing is roughly a little bit more than 2% of the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and all of that would be on your banking book,, none of that would be &#x2013; because the 245 breaks down, some of it's held for trading and some it's assets at fair value but just to confirm that 2%...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Everything is in the banking book because we are not actively trading in these instruments.  And we also indicate actually if you look at the presentation that we have had group wise reserve against that portfolio already actually since last year.  Indicating the higher risk than in the normal part and we actually increased that somewhat in the last quarter as well.  So you can call it a hair cut, we would call it a group loss provisions for part of the portfolio that this slightly under-performing compared to best case.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  Can I come back to &#x2013; first half to and the leverage finance?  I think in one of the slides it seems to say that there is increased uncertainty on pillar 2?  Could you kind of talk through why that is?  Is it just because the market's more uncertain or is it because you've had discussion with the regulators, or if you've got any kind of -- is there any factor and what does that mean?  Does that there's a risk that post-transition period they could disallow it or, could you just say what sensitivity is there?  And then also on the leverage finance; you mentioned the group wise provisions.  I think I read 30 million.  Is that the delta or is that the actual stock provisions against the book?  And you said there that some what underperforming versus base case; could you explain that a bit more?  Is it because of interest rates or is it because of economic environment?  And is this kind of a -- is this a big issue or is it just something at the margin?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can start on the leverage portfolio.  Yes, 30 million was the delta increase this quarter so it is obviously more than that.  We haven't discussed exactly the figure but it is the change this quarter.  And I mean as you know, on the rules of IFRS you cannot just make a provision unless you have some sort of facts based on what effect, plus event that has happened and they say the way to look at this is that the -- simply look at are they fully performing according to best case or are they keeping the <mark type="inaudible" /> doesn't mean that they would be close to default or anything like that.  But it's certainly an indication of some weakness in the portfolio.  And as this is a high-yield portfolio it's well paid.  It's also increased risk in that portfolio.  Net it is, anyway, a very profitable, good business.  It also indicates that in the fourth quarter this business as such slowed down quite substantially which we unfortunately could see in the level of provisions for lending which <mark type="inaudible" /> finance support income didn't come through because of the market has been rather down now in the last two quarters.</p>

          <p>Well, I come to your question about the uncertainty on the pillar 2; it's correct that we can notice an uncertainty amongst regulators when it comes to the discussion on pillar 2.  At the same time we now are implementing our inter-rating based model into the bank we can see that the benefits from that compared to base line is even greater than we disclosed earlier.  We still expect that the net effect of this will be roughly what we have talked to the market about earlier on that it cost us -- capital lease in the area around 20%.</p>

          <p>Could I also just come back to that. You haven't changed &#x2013; I mean one of these issues I think is involved to is whether you are looking at point-in-time or over a cycle? And could you just remind us what you've gone for and then cycle terms of your capital requirement can increase very quickly?</p>

          <p>Our rating is based on point-in-time.  Taking into consideration a certain extent in the subjective parts of the variation rating the fact that are we also looking to a stronger or a weaker in the four months going forward, but basically to the point-in-time and that is, of course, an agreement with authority as well.  That is I guess the way most banks rate.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much.  A couple of questions here from my side, as well.  First of all, I need to go back to a question that I believe Kim was asking.  And that relates to the implied guidance that you give on revenues for 2008.  I'm just looking at your slide here in the Investor Pack, Slide 36, where you showed the history where growth and revenues came from last year.  Coming from savings areas, markets, transaction accounts, etcetera.  One could argue that some of these areas, it would be increasingly difficult to grow revenues in these bases for the coming year and I heard you mention that growth will come from margin increase and volumes in some areas.</p>
          <p>Could you give us a bit more detail and if possible, how much of this growth that looks to be sort of in the range of 7 to 8%.  Will come from each area, especially, if I understand, the current side correctly, just below 1% is coming from lending volume, so, just a bit more clarity on that where the growth will come from.  Second question relates to the Baltics, actually.  And I read in your presentation that you're currently growing volume at around, what is it, just a touch below 60% on a year-on-year basis, and I was wondering, when I see your competitors, <mark type="inaudible" /> for example, they seem to be growing volumes at a much lower pace then this at the moment.  Aren't you worried that you are building up a loan book over there of relatively low quality?  I'm just doing the assumption that there's low-quality lending very late in the cycle, low quality deals to take.  So yes, I guess I'll start with those two questions, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can, maybe starting on the gross area <mark type="inaudible" /> I think we should take a bit broader view on this and look at the starting point, it's the strong volume growth that we have experienced so far and now with margins almost all areas have been under margin pressure, and we see clearly now, change gradually and meaning that also the earnings coming from our loan book will probably be increased going forward because there has been quite heavily margin pressure in that.  And remember also that the investments we have done so far in the U.S. also would be, give a benefit already in '08.  Having invested into new markets and already in '08 that's a percent drop to 20% of our income will fit in those areas, and that portion will probably increase going forward.  So there are many areas currently that we have now seen improvement in the latter part of '07 that we'll leverage in '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the new investments there, that captures Poland, Russia, Baltics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  On the Baltic situation, we had tried also in the presentations on the Slides 77, 78, 79 little bit, put light to that because it's not really very relevant to just look at percentage in growth, taking the fact that we start with a market share below 10% while some other competitors are paying maybe 30%.  So therefore in actual Europe numbers we are actually growing slower than say most of our competitors.  The fact that we have had a very cautious growth strategy all through these years was reflected by the fact that in 2006 we grew also percentage wise much slower than our competitors.  We are continuing that policy because we feel that sticking to the fact of doing business with good customers we have been opening fast new branches as well; that means that we have reached new customer groups which we like to do business with.  So we claim that the growth has not taken place at the cost of quality, but according to our long-term plan in growing in those markets, which maybe there's going to be a certain hiccup now for this year or so but in the long term this is an interesting to be in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  If I may, can I just shift in with another question, and it relates to, on a group level, loan loss provisions?  Now we have a quarter again with a net right back and I'm looking in your notes here where you have provisions and how much it's reversals, can you comment upon -- I mean the dynamics of the reversals, how correlated that is to property prices, or something like that?  There is a line that should theoretically be negative.  And this is -- I think your right but this is for the 15th quarter in a row where it's a net reversal, so just a bit of the dynamics of that line in your case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the big changes, when they occur, usually are related to changes in the group as provisions which, very much, today are reflecting , let's say the fact that we have on an individual basis, very, very few actual individually valued loan provisions because all of our customers are doing extremely well.  On the other hand, we have certain indications that some groups of assets has shown weaknesses and that is then very much the reason for lets say the gross numbers that we are seeing in the numbers also this quarter, slightly up from the previous quarter.  And what actually happened in the last quarter was that we continuously, as we have to do according to the company standards, evaluate if the provisions done, are they still valid?  Are they too big, are they too small?  And the reversed time provisions from our reserve which has been growing over the years.  On the other hand, we haven't had any losses for a long period.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the -- instead then increased the provisions for the Baltic countries which anyway have some sign of weakness.  And, as I also said before, also for the leverage finance portfolio.  I think this is a very typical sort of argumentation that we do every quarter.</p>

          <p>Geoff Dawes from Citigroup is on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Geoff Dawes here from Citi. Just a couple of, hopefully very brief questions.  First of all, in terms of the 100 million euro investments over 2008, would you be looking at bolt-on acquisitions to support that organic growth?  And if so which geographies and customer areas would you prioritize for such bolt-on acquisitions?  And second of all, if I could come back to your outlook again and perhaps just approach it in a slightly different way, you've already talked about group revenue growth exceeding group cost growth.  Now with the uncertain outlook, are there any individual business areas where you think there's a significant risk that that would be the reverse, so cost growth exceeding revenue growth in negative draws?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I could start with the program, I mean this outlook and this plan we have presented is not including bolt-on acquisitions, it's an organic growth strategy.  That's the reason why some of the investments we do that pop up in the cost line as opposed to acquisitions where we would have the cost in terms of goodwill and so on.  But we will not exclude, that's not part of the plan, will not exclude going forward, but we will do bolt-on acquisitions in the areas we are -- have as a prime strategic objectives, which is our growth initiatives you could say.  If the opportunity arises we have the capital and the liquidity to be ready to look at things if things come up in this period.  So we will not exclude it, but it's not part of the plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we don't see any particular business area with higher risks than others to meet development with a negative euro.  I mean I think there is good opportunities in most areas and since we invest ourselves gradually into new areas, it's possible to be flexible in that as well.  So the answer is no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great.  Thanks.  And just to go back to the bolt-on acquisitions, again, is there any size limit that you would have when looking at opportunities as they arise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sure there is a limit, but we have, as I said, it's not a strategy actually to find these, it's more a strategy of being very observant and scanning the market all the time within our core market and our core strategic areas.  So we all the time scanning the market and we have a precision where we can do a bolt-on acquisition of some size, but I wouldn't -- I would rather not put a limit, rather saying that it will be within our core strategy and our core initiatives if it comes up.  But as I said, it's our organic growth strategy is the core focus of us and that is the one which is part of the plan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there yes, sorry I'll be very brief, just one question on corporate lending margin.  I think we've got quite a lot commentary from the Nordic banks that they seem to actually start to expand and I noticed that yours continued down from fourth quarter.  Is any general trend you can point out where you actually think that they have bottomed out?  I think it's fair to say that the sort of systematic risk in the system has clearly increased but was wondering if you're taking initiatives to increase the price of risk or if you're just waiting to see what's going to happen with the competitors?  And my second question was actually a general comment.  I wasn't sure if Christian was correctly quoted but I read on the tape that he said that he had the door open for consultation or similar and I was just wondering considering that the Baltic exposed Swedish banks relative share price has been quite dramatic under-performing yours over the last six months if you at all would be interested in taking the initiative or if you are just waiting for them to approach you if they would be interested?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very quickly on the margin.  Yes we believe the margins will widen.  We already saw the signs last quarter that they leveled out, they didn't go down any more but it's fair to say that the Nordic market has not actually acted as the rest of the world.  One reason being that the affects of the turmoil has not been that visible here and competition is still fierce and the credit is in the market but we believe that it will be sort of coming through not quickly but slowly and thereby we believe it will change the trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But so just to clarify but would you be interested in sort of taking an initiative because I guess you are probably the largest player.  We've heard from Denmark just give for instance they've increased their margins across the board unilaterally.  I was just thinking is your view that you have the opportunity to increase your predominantly corporate margins or are you waiting to see what the others are doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We certainly are taking initiatives all the time and of course there's some times they are not successful but you're right, as a leading bank we need to show the way and we are doing that.  But you cannot be totally out of the market I mean you have to as well respect what is possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Okay, thank you.  That's clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And open door, the door has been open for quite a while.  It's still open which means we're open to discussions.  We are ready any time.  As you correctly point to the share prices have gone out so nobody has come through the door but I cannot comment in more detail on that.  We still believe in the longer run consolidation will happen.  We have also the view that we are the proof that consolidation can create value, also more larger banks, but we also are execute on our growth strategy and we're happy doing that, but the door is open.</p>
