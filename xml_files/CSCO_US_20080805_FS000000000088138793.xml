          <p>Blair, thank you very much. During the opening comments to the conference call, I will focus on what I view to be the key takeaways for Q4 and fiscal year 2008, an update on why we continue to be comfortable with our long-term growth projections of 12 to 17%, and our revenue guidance going forward with the appropriate caveats. Frank will follow these opening comments with additional detail on Q4 and on the fiscal year 2008. The third section of the call will focus on business momentum and strategy from a geographic, product, and customer segment basis.  Frank will then follow with additional financial parameters around our guidance. I will then wrap it up with some comments in terms of Cisco's momentum going into Q1, and finally our Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>In this conference call, we are going to move to a more abbreviated format. With new areas or areas that have evolved, we will provide additional details in this call and in future calls. We encourage your feedback on these changes. We will cover fiscal year 2008 at this time and then cover Q4.</p>
          <p>First, from a fiscal year point of view and a financial perspective, we are very pleased with the following very solid financial results in fiscal year 2008. Revenue was a record 39.5 billion, a 13% year over year increase. Cash generated from operations was 12.1 billion, a 20% year-over-year increase. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.56, a 16% year-over-year increase, and GAAP earnings per share were $1.31, a 12% year-over-year increase.</p>
          <p>Second, year-over-year order growth was also very solid for fiscal year 2008. Product order growth was approximately 12%. Service order growth was approximately 25%. Product booked-to-billed was about one.</p>
          <p>Third, in a year where there were a number of challenges, we were pleased with both of our geographic balance and year-over-year order growth for fiscal year 2008.</p>
          <p>Our emerging countries focus continued with solid momentum, China order growth was approximately 30%. India order growth was 32%. Mexico had order growth of 32%, and Russia grew 23%. Brazil grew 48%. Emerging countries in Asia in total grew approximately 28%. That is our Asia-Pacific operations not counting Korea and Australia and New Zealand. Our emerging market theater, which consists of Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa, and Russia and CIS, grew in total approximately 19%. Asia-Pacific in total grew approximately 20%. European markets grew approximately 13%, while the US and Canada order growth was at 9%. Japan grew 5.</p>
          <p>Fourth, from a fiscal year 2008 year-over-year product revenue growth perspective, routing revenues grew 14% year over year, again led by high-end routing with a CRS growth of approximately 119%. Switching grew 7% year over year. Our Advanced Technologies grew 21% year over year, led by Unified Communications, with growth of approximately 51%, and Application Networking Services with growth of approximately 36%.</p>
          <p>Fifth, from a customer segment perspective for fiscal year 2008, enterprise Public Sector order growth was approximately 10% year over year. Commercial continued strong at 20% growth year over year. Service providers grew approximately 10% year over year.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to Q4 fiscal year 2008, Q4 was a very solid quarter for Cisco, especially given some challenges that we are all seeing occur in the global marketplace. In terms of those areas that we can control or influence, we continue to feel very comfortable with both our progress in the quarter and our long term differentiated strategy as we move into new market adjacencies</p>
          <p>Again, let me review at first from a financial point of view, where we are pleased with the following results in Q4. Revenue was a record 10.4 billion, approximately a 10% year-over-year increase. It was our first $10 billion quarter from a revenue perspective. Cash generated from operations was 3.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.40, an 11% year-over-year increase, and GAAP earnings per share were $0.33, a 6% year-over-year increase. Non-GAAP gross margins were very solid at 65.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue for Q4 were 35.7%.</p>
          <p>Second, in terms of year-over-year order growth in Q4, balance was good.  Product order growth was approximately 10%. Service order growth was approximately 20%.  Product booked to billed was comfortably above one.</p>
          <p>Third, from a geographic year-over-year order growth perspective, there were a number of positives in Q4 and a couple of challenges. Our emerging countries focus, where orders tend to be variable &#x2013; that is lumpy in my terms, continued its solid momentum, and we achieved better balanced results across the majority of the emerging countries than we have seen in recent quarters.  China order growth again was over 30%. India growth was approximately 20%. Mexico and Russia both had order growth above 40%. Brazil grew approximately 30%. The emerging countries in the Asia-Pacific theater, again not counting Korea and Australia and New Zealand in the total number, in total grew approximately 23%.  Our emerging market theater, which does not include Asia, grew in total approximately 10%.  Asia-Pacific in total grew 19% in Q4. Japan after a very strong Q3 grew year over year at 10%. European markets grew approximately 11%, while the US and Canada orders grew approximately 7%.</p>
          <p>Fourth, from a Q4 year-over-year product revenue growth perspective, routing revenue grew 8% year over year, again led by high end routing with a CRS-1 growth of approximately 85%. Switching grew 5% year over year. Our Advanced Technologies grew 15% year over year, led by Unified Communications with growth of approximately 29%, and Application Networking Services with growth of approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>Just as an update of our early stage internal startups, what we call Emerging Technologies, our strategy is to develop a reasonable percentage of these emerging technologies into what we categorize as advanced technologies, with the realistic possibility of becoming 1 billion plus in sales and the number one market position in their respective product categories if we execute properly.</p>
          <p>Overall progress was extremely strong in Q4. While these numbers are not significant at this point in time, we believe that with proper execution, they can become very significant to our growth ranges in the long run.</p>
          <p>Q4 was a very strong quarter for Emerging Technologies group and in total grew approximately 300% year over year. We will focus on year-over-year growth rate for the following breakouts within the Emerging Technologies group. TelePresence grew approximately 500% year over year. Digital Media Systems grew approximately 200% year over year, and Physical Security grew approximately 250% year over year. Again, those were from an order perspective on Emerging Technologies.</p>
          <p>Sixth, from a global customer segment perspective, Enterprise and Public Sector orders growth in Q4 was approximately 10% year over year, with the Enterprise area growing approximately 13% on a global basis and the Public Sector growing 4% year over year. Commercial orders continued strong at 17% growth year over year, and Service Provider grew approximately 5%. Anticipating your questions about the US Enterprise order growth, Q4 grew year-over-year at 13% versus what Q3's Enterprise US growth rate was at 6%. We will provide additional details on each of the above areas later on in the conference call.</p>
          <p>On the very positive side, we are seeing network-enabled collaborative business process changes and productivity increases begin to gain traction on a global basis. Discussions with many of our customers are moving from a conceptual &#x2013; what is Collaboration on Web 2.0 and how it will conceptually enable competitive advantage and productivity increases, now to our leading edge customers having a discussion about how they could implement collaborative network-enabled Web 2.0 productivity tools, often with Cisco as their strategic and trusted business partner.</p>
          <p>In summary, in terms of areas that we can control or influence, we continue to be pleased with our progress. Again, our confidence in the 12 to 17% long-term growth range remains very strong.</p>
          <p>While at the risk of stating the obvious and as we said repeatedly in prior conference calls and will continue to say in our future conference calls, there may be times when our revenues grow above our expectations and there will definitely be times when they grow below. From a challenges perspective: first, we all see the same mixed signals in the market from both a US perspective and other parts in the world in terms of economic momentum, stock market behavior, energy costs, and confidence changes. Second, from a service provider perspective, which now represents approximately one-third of our total product business, CapEx expenditures signals are mixed both by companies and geographies. With the shift to IP networks firmly having taken hold, we believe we are strongly positioned with the global service providers more than we have ever been before both from a technology and a business partner perspective.</p>
          <p>In simple terms, our service provider customers are often in one of three phases. At first phase are those that over the last several years have built out very large IP networks and are in the process of loading those networks and adding services. Second are those at the start of either their first next generation IP build-out or even their second next generation IP build-out. And third are those that are slowing CapEx until they achieve more top line growth. Regardless in which stage these companies are in, we think we are in a very good position to capture a larger percentage of their total spend.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to a discussion of revenue guidance, as we said before, Cisco will always be affected by major economic changes, capital spending patterns, new and existing competitors, and our ability to execute or not on our strategy and other factors as discussed in our SEC reports. For purposes of our long-range guidance as well as our quarterly guidance, we are also seeing that our vision of how the industry and the market will evolve will be accurate and we will effectively execute on that vision.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, during each of the economic slowdowns from the last 15 years, Cisco has always navigated through them very effectively. We did this in 1993, 1997, 2001, 2003; and in each scenario we gained both wallet share and in my opinion, profit share. And as a result, we were better positioned coming out of the transitions versus our peers. We will continue to be aggressive in our investments during this slowdown.</p>
          <p>Despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment and the impact it is having on many of our customers, particularly in the US, we believe that our strategy and the critical role the network plays in enabling all forms of communication and IT is right on target.</p>
          <p>Secondly, with all the appropriate caveats, our best estimate is this is a relatively short challenge going forward.  Cisco will use this time as an opportunity to expand our share of customer spend and to be aggressive about moving into new market adjacencies.</p>
          <p>While it's very difficult to predict when we may see a stronger spending environment by our customers and return to our 12 to 17% long-term growth objectives, our best estimate with the appropriate caveats mentioned earlier is that the current economic challenges will remain with us for the next few quarters. It is for this reason that we will provide guidance for the first half of fiscal year 2009 rather than the entire fiscal year until we become more comfortable with the predictability of when we believe our revenue growth will accelerate back toward our long-term guidance.</p>
          <p>With this discussion in mind, our revenue guidance for Q1 fiscal year 2009, including our usual caveats as discussed earlier and in our financial reports, is for revenue growth in the range of 8% year over year.  As for guidance in Q2 fiscal year 2009, again with all the appropriate caveats, is for revenue growth in the 8.5% range year over year.</p>
          <p>In summary, we believe that we are very well positioned in the industry from a vision, differentiated strategy, and an execution perspective. We believe we are entering the next phase of the Internet as growth and productivity will center on collaboration enabled by network Web 2.0 technologies. We will do our best to provide the product architectures and the expertise to help our customers in the implementation of these collaborative capabilities, both from a technology and a business prospective. We will also share with our customers how we have done this internally.</p>
          <p>In short, we are going to attempt to execute our strategy over the next decade that is very similar to what we did in the early '90s. And as we said before, it powered Cisco's growth for an entire decade, except for the obvious differences this time of being a company that is now at a run rate of approximately $40 billion with over 66,000 employees focused on this opportunity.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn it over to Frank for some additional comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. We are pleased with Cisco's very solid results this quarter as we closed out our fiscal year. Starting with our Q4 results, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $10.4 billion, an increase of approximately 10% year over year, at the high end of our guidance of 9 to 10%, Cisco's first $10 billion revenue quarter. Routing revenue was $2 billion, up 8% year over year, due primarily to continued growth in our high end router portfolio at 12% year over year, with particular strength in CRS-1 growth of approximately 85% year over year. Switching revenue was 3.5 billion, an increase of 5% year over year, driven by growth in our fixed switching portfolio. Advanced Technologies revenue totaled $2.6 billion, representing an increase of 15% year over year, led by strong performance in Unified Communications of 29% year-over-year growth, and Application Networking Services growth of approximately 30% year over year. Other product revenue totaled $551 million, an increase of 9% year over year.</p>
          <p>Total Service revenue was $1.7 billion, up approximately 16% year over year, with solid growth across all geographies. We are particularly pleased with growth in Advanced Services of approximately 23%.</p>
          <p>Total revenue growth by geography was in the range of 5% year over year in the US and Canada to a high of 42% in emerging markets. Emerging markets revenue growth for the quarter was higher than the order growth rate that John reported due to the increased shipments and recognition of previously deferred revenues.</p>
          <p>Q4 total non-GAAP gross margin was 65.2%, down slightly quarter over quarter, and flat on a year-to-year basis. For product only, non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 65.3%, down 0.6 point quarter over quarter and up slightly year over year. Our non-GAAP service margin for the fourth quarter was 64.7%, up from 62.7% last quarter. Service margin will typically experience some variability over time due to various factors such as the changes in mix between Technical Support Services and Advanced Services as well as the timing of support contract initiations and renewals.</p>
          <p>Total gross margin by geography ranged from 62.6% for emerging markets to 70.9% in Japan. Across the geographies, the margins have remained relatively stable over the last few quarters.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were approximately 35.7% in Q4 fiscal year '08, up from 35.5% in Q4 fiscal year '07. Foreign exchange impact for the quarter was $82 million when compared to the same period last year, which added approximately 0.8 point to the ratio. Excluding foreign exchange, non-GAAP operating expenses for Q4 grew at 8% year over year. Going forward, we will continue to invest in areas that we believe will drive future growth and innovation while remaining focused on prudently managing our discretionary spending.</p>
          <p>Interest and other income was $157 million for Q4 versus $228 million for Q4 fiscal year '07.  The decline year over year was due to market conditions which resulted in lower gains from the sale of public equity investments and lower interest rates.  We remain pleased with the high quality and the conservative risk profile of our investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our Q4 fiscal year '08 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 25.6%, reflecting realignment of foreign subsidiaries. For the full year, our non-GAAP tax rate was 23.1%, reflecting the benefit we reported in Q1 related to a tax audit settlement. Excluding this settlement, our full year non-GAAP tax rate would be approximately 24%.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was $2.4 billion compared to $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, representing a 6% increase on a year-to-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter were $0.40, up from $0.36 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and an 11% increase year over year.</p>
          <p>GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $2 billion as compared to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter were $0.33, up from $0.31 in the same quarter of fiscal year 2007.</p>
          <p>Now switching to our full fiscal year performance, total revenue for fiscal year 2008 was $39.5 billion, an increase of approximately 13% over fiscal year 2007 revenue of $34.9 billion. Routing revenue ended the year at 7.9 billion, up 14% year over year, with strong growth in CRS-1 revenue, up approximately 119% year over year. Switching revenue was 13.3 billion, an increase of 7% over fiscal year 2007. And Advanced Technologies revenue grew 21% year over year to $9.7 billion. Total Services revenue was 6.4 billion, growth of approximately 18% in fiscal year 2008.</p>
          <p>Total non-GAAP gross margin for fiscal year 2008 was 65.4%, up 0.6 point year over year. For product only, non-GAAP gross margin was up 0.8 year over year due to higher cost savings and shipment volumes, partially offset by discounts and pricing.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were approximately 35.9% in fiscal year '08, up from 35.2% in fiscal year '07. Foreign exchange impact for the full fiscal year was approximately 332 million when compared to the same period last year, which added approximately 0.8 point to the ratio. Non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2008 was $9.6 billion, up approximately 14% from fiscal year 2007 non-GAAP net income of $8.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully-diluted basis for fiscal year '08 were $1.56, up from $1.34 in fiscal year 2007, representing a 16% increase year over year.</p>
          <p>GAAP net income for fiscal year 2008 was 8.1 billion or $1.31 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to 7.3 billion or $1.17 per share on a fully diluted basis in fiscal 2007. This represents 10% and 12% increases year over year respectively.</p>
          <p>Product backlog at the end of fiscal year 2008 was $4.8 billion compared with $3.9 billion at the end of fiscal year 2007.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the balance sheet, the total of cash, cash equivalents, and investment at the end of Q4 was $26.2 billion, up 1.8 billion from Q3. During Q4, we generated $3.5 billion in cash flow from operations as well as $616 million in proceeds from our stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. For the full fiscal year 2008, we generated $12.1 billion of cash from operations.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, we repurchased 1.35 billion of common stock or 54 million shares of our stock at an average price of $25.11 per share. For the full fiscal year, we repurchased $10.4 billion of common stock or 372 million shares of stock at an average price of $27.80. We ended the quarter with approximately $8.4 billion remaining in the current stock repurchase authorizations.</p>
          <p>Moving on to accounts receivable, we ended the quarter at $3.8 billion, down 9% from Q3. At the end of Q4, days sales outstanding or DSO were 34 days compared to 39 days in Q3. Total inventory at the end of Q4 was $1.2 billion, down 3% from Q3 of FY '08. Non-GAAP inventory turns improved from 10.7 last quarter to a record 11.5 turns this quarter. Our inventory purchase commitments at the end of Q4 were 2.7 billion, relatively flat from the end of Q3.</p>
          <p>Deferred revenue was 8.9 billion at the end of the Q4, an increase of 217 million from Q3 and 1.8 billion from Q4 FY '07, representing growth of 26% from Q4 FY '07. Deferred product revenue was 2.7 billion, down 165 million from last quarter. And deferred service revenue was 6.1 billion, up 435 million from last quarter.</p>
          <p>At the end of the Q4, our head count totaled 66,129, a net increase of approximately 900 from Q3 FY '08. Our head count increases were primarily the result of Cisco hires in engineering, sales, and services.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, I'm very pleased with our performance for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, enabled by our balanced portfolio management approach to innovation, a broad and growing global footprint, and a team dedicated to outstanding execution. I'm also pleased with our performance for the entire fiscal year, led by strong top line growth in the first half and excellent balance sheet management in the second half. Our ability to deliver solid financial results with excellent cash flow and a strong book-to-bill during a fiscal year that included somewhat uncertain macroeconomic conditions in our larger geographies illustrates the power of our business model.</p>
          <p>And finally, as John indicated, we do plan to continue investment in our diversified technology portfolio while maintaining our proven focus on profitability in order to take advantage of market transitions and drive toward our long-term growth target of 12 to 17% over the next three or five years.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to John.</p>

          <p>Frank, thank you very much. In this section of the call, we will cover our geographies, customer segments, and products for Q4 in more detail. The product review will be in revenue growth terms, while the geographic and customer segments will be discussed in terms of orders unless otherwise indicated.</p>
          <p>First from a geographic and a customer segment point of view in terms of Q4 year-over-year order growth, there were a number of positives from our five theaters and customer segments. Discussing Asia-Pacific first, order growth in Asia-Pacific in Q4 was very solid at approximately 19% year over year. As we said earlier, growth in China was above 30% and India was approximately 20%. Korea was flat. Australia and New Zealand grew approximately 15% year over year. The rest of Asia grew approximately 17%.</p>
          <p>From a customer segment perspective, balance was again good with Enterprise growing in the high-teens in Asia-Pacific, Public Sector growing 20%, Service Provider growing at 10%, and Commercial at approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>Japan continued their solid momentum in Q4 with growth of approximately 10%, following a strong Q3 where they experienced growth about 20%. Leading the way was Service Provider with growth about 25%, which represents approximately half of our total business in Japan. Enterprise, Public Sector, and Commercial were relatively flat. Overall, we feel good about our momentum in the Japanese market.</p>
          <p>Europe: Europe had a very solid Q4 with growth of approximately 11% despite a more challenging economic environment. Balance was relatively good by customer segments within some of the key countries. Commercial growth was 16%. Enterprise growth in Europe was 12%. Public Sector was 7, and Service Provider growth was 9% year over year. Germany led the way with growth in the upper-20s. The UK and The Netherlands had growth in the low-teens. Spain had growth of approximately 20%, and Italy was down slightly.</p>
          <p>For the US, order growth in Q4 was approximately 7% year over year. From a customer segment perspective, Enterprise growth not including Public Sector was approximately 13%. Commercial was approximately 14%. And Service Provider, which had very tough comparisons in Q4 a year ago, was flat. Public Sector year over year order growth in the US was down approximately 6%. As we said earlier, the Enterprise segment grew approximately 13%. Balance was good across the six US Enterprise areas, with five of the six growing from the high single digits to approximately 23% year over year.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets, we were very pleased with the balance across all of our emerging market countries. The emerging market theater grew approximately 10% year over year. As a reminder, the emerging market theater does not include emerging countries in Asia such as China, which grew approximately 30% year over year, and India, which grew approximately 20% year over year, as we said earlier. In the emerging market theaters, three of the four geographies had year-over-year growth in the high teens to mid-20s in Q4. These included Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Russia/CIS. As we have shared in prior conference calls, growth can be variable in terms of the countries or segments in the emerging markets. Middle East and Africa growth was down approximately 5% year over year in Q4.</p>
          <p>Products, as a reminder, products are discussed in terms of revenue growth year over year. Routers in total grew approximately 8% in Q4, led by high end router growth of 12% and midrange router growth of approximately 10%. Low end router growth was relatively flat. Switching grew approximately 5%, with modular switches flat and fixed switches growing at approximately 10% year over year.</p>
          <p>Advanced Technologies growth was solid. Security grew approximately 10%. Networked Home grew in the mid-20s. Unified Communications grew 29%. Wireless grew 13%, and Storage was down approximately 14%. Application Networking Services grew approximately 30%, and Video Systems grew approximately 7%. Again, the total for all Advanced Technologies is 15% year-over-year growth in Q4. As discussed in last quarter's conference call, we are very pleased with our product pipeline and innovation leadership across almost all of our product areas.</p>
          <p>In summary, our vision of how the industry is going to evolve appears to be playing out very much as we expected. We believe our differentiated strategy is also achieving the benefits to both Cisco and our customers that we thought were possible. And finally, our execution is on target in terms of results as measured by customer partnership perspective, market share, and share of our customers' total communications and IT expenditures as the network becomes the platform for delivering these capabilities.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it back over to you, Frank, for additional detail on financial guidance and other financial highlights.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP.</p>
          <p>As John indicated, at this time we will provide revenue guidance for the first half in fiscal year 2009 rather than for the entire fiscal year until we become more comfortable with the predictability of when we believe our revenue growth rate will accelerate back toward our long range of our guidance of 12 to 17%.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we anticipate total revenue growth for the first quarter to be 8% plus or minus 1% year over year. Revenue growth for the second quarter is expected to be 8.5% plus or minus 1% year over year. At this point, let me remind you that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you some additional details in Q1 financial guidance. As we have said in the past, forecasting gross margins has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, variable component costs, customer and channel mix, and competitive pricing pressures. That being said, we believe total gross margin in Q1 will be approximately 65%. We believe Q1 operating expenses will be approximately 37% of revenue. This includes the impact of foreign exchange, which continues to have a negative impact on our overall expense. We expect interest and other income to be approximately 175 million in the first quarter, and our tax provision rate for Q1 is expected to be approximately 24%.</p>
          <p>While we expect to continue our share repurchase program, it's difficult to predict the exact weighted average shares outstanding. We are modeling share count to be flat to down approximately 50 million in weighted average shares outstanding for EPS purposes. In this estimate of share count, we are not taking into consideration any further change in stock price that could occur in the first quarter of fiscal year '09. As a point of reference, a $1 increase in our average stock price would increase the calculated shares outstanding for the purpose of determining earnings per share by approximately 16 million.</p>
          <p>Regarding cash flow from operations, we would expect to generate 600 million to $800 million per month. For our Q1 FY '09 GAAP earnings, we anticipate that Q1 GAAP EPS will be $0.04 to $0.06 per share lower than non-GAAP EPS, primarily due to the acquisition related charges and stock compensation expense. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail.</p>
          <p>Other than those items noted above, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring, and tax or other events which may or may not be significant.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the call back to John. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, thank you once again. The following is a summary of my view of Cisco's momentum and opportunities entering Q1 of fiscal year 2009. In areas that we can control or influence, our momentum continues to be strong, especially in the areas of product leadership, innovation, and thought leadership. Balance, given the global challenges, continues to be good across our geographies, products, services, and customer segments.</p>
          <p>As we said before, even if the market slows, we don't see this changing our long-term growth targets if we execute the way we have in prior slowdowns. As we head into the next fiscal year, we plan to be aggressively investing in new and adjacent markets for the longer term, regardless of how long it takes for the macroeconomic environment to rebound. We would not be investing aggressively if we thought this current slowdown was going to be long in duration, and that we didn't have a high probability of achieving our 12 to 17% long-term growth objectives.</p>
          <p>In terms of major areas where momentum would appear to be solid and areas where we can possibly gain momentum would be the following areas: emerging markets including both our emerging market theater and emerging countries in Asia-Pacific such as China and India; Japan in Service Providers; next generation network build-outs; Collaboration and network enabled Web 2.0 acceptance and Cisco's leadership in our customers' minds and their beginning implementations views; product pipeline and innovation leadership; and Advanced Technologies and Emerging Technologies.</p>
          <p>While there are many more positive areas than there are areas of concern, the areas that we continue to monitor closely are the US market and the possibility of these challenges in the US spreading to other geographies, and Service Providers long-term growth rates for capital expenditures. On a global and US basis, we see the same challenges and uncertainties from an economic, political, and capital spending perspective that many of you continue to witness.</p>
          <p>While it is too early to indicate it is a trend, we are seeing progress in the US enterprise market. Total overall enterprise growth is possibly stabilizing. While growth still varies dramatically by industry, the large multinationals and financial institutions, which were the first one to decline almost a year ago in terms of their spending with us, now are doing dramatically better. Just to share the data with you, in five of the last six quarters, these accounts, which used to be called our statement one accounts, had negative growth, or best case, mid-single digit positive growth. In Q3 and now again in Q4, we saw the year-over-year growth rate comfortably in double digits. Time will tell us if this is a trend and if it continues and evolves through the other industries within our Enterprise segment.</p>
          <p>The second area that we are watching closely is Service Provider CapEx spending. One way to analyze CapEx growth is in capital expenditures as a percentage of total sales. The rate of growth in this area appears to be moderating, although it varies dramatically from company to company and by geography.</p>
          <p>For our technology and business partnership relationships and most of the Service Providers are continuing to get even stronger. There are clearly some very tough comparisons when you think about year-over-year growth in fiscal year 2007 Q4 and fiscal year 2008 Q1 and Q2, which had very strong year-over-year growth rates. As an additional data point regarding the challenging comparisons, worldwide Service Provider orders have been growing for three years in a row at a very rapid rate. Fiscal year 2007 as an example grew approximately 40% year over year.</p>
          <p>Again, if the market does continue to slow, we believe this will not dramatically change our long-term opportunities and our vision of how the industry will evolve with our differentiated strategy. In fact, it is our intent to expand our share of customer spend during these corrections, as we've done in the past. We also believe that our opportunities to expand in our current markets and market adjacencies are actually increasing. This is true from the data center to the home market, and from the service provider to the small business and consumer. Therefore, you will continue to see us aggressively invest where appropriate while maintaining our focus on our financial models.</p>
          <p>Once again with the usual caveats as discussed earlier and in our financial reports, our Q1 fiscal year 2009 guidance is for year-over-year revenue growth in the 8% range. And our Q2 fiscal year 2009 guidance is for year-over-year revenue growth in the 8.5% range. We believe our long-term growth opportunities remain in the 12 to 17% range, again assuming our usual caveats.</p>
          <p>We will focus on what we can control and influence and attempt to position Cisco to gain momentum in markets transactions whether they are industry consolidation, product transitions, market adjacency opportunities, or economic.</p>
          <p>In summary, for those areas that we can control or influence, we believe that our vision, strategy, and execution are in great shape and producing results.</p>
          <p>As always, I want to thank our shareholders, customers, employees, and partners for their support and continued confidence in our ability to execute during rapidly changing industry consolidation, market transitions, and challenging economic times.</p>
          <p>Now Blair, I'd like to turn it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, John. Now at this time, we're going to open up the call to Q&amp;A and I will request that sell-side analysts please ask only one question. So Kim, if you could go ahead and open up the lines, we'll start with the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our first question comes from Tal Liani from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I have so many questions. First, I want to thank you for the level of disclosure. It's just unbelievable and I hope that other companies will do the same. I want to ask a general question about one sentence you put in the press release. You said that you have intentions to expand into adjacent markets. In this kind of environment, you want to take the opportunity. Would you mind to elaborate on this?  First, do you have an appetite for a big acquisition or a series of small acquisitions? And second, what kind of areas are you interested in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so breaking the information into three pieces, first, thank you very much for your feedback. And Tal, you and others have been very candid with us about giving you more detail. So we are attempting to do that and we appreciate very much you appreciating the value of it.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of areas we're going to expand into, and Ned, I'm going to ask you to comment just a little bit in a moment on our concepts, we are going to expand into areas and market adjacencies in every major customer segment: in the home, in the small business, in the medium sized commercial business, in the enterprise, and in the service provider. And we will go as we said in the comments really from the data center to the home devices.</p>
          <p>In terms of our strategy, innovation will continue to be defined as done internally in terms of expanding our existing products and evolving into market adjacencies, internally in terms of startups, where the Emerging Technology groups are really knocking the cover off the ball. Those numbers were fantastic in the three new emerging technologies that are growing in total over 300%. And also in terms of partnerships, and you will see us partner, primarily big to big. You will see us acquire primarily big to small to medium.</p>
          <p>I would not rule out all four areas of growth in each of our customer segment groups. If you think about what we're going to do, we usually acquire as we move into new markets that we do not have the expertise or the product segments in, we tend to partner big to big. So think of us partnering with companies like an IBM, a Microsoft, an Intel, an EMC, an Accenture, Infosys, WIPRO, Tata, companies of that type. Think of us acquiring more in the &#x2013; Jim, Scientific Atlanta type of range, the WebEx or a deal on as Ned and I have always discussed is 100 engineers with a really hot product that's just about to come to the market that some of our best customers say go buy and we will buy a lot of. Ned, maybe you are take it to the next step?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John. Thanks very much. We expect to continue to be very aggressive in using acquisitions as a part of our build, buy, and partner strategy to expand our presence in the markets. You've seen it continuing through the slowdown, most recently with our acquisition of Pure Networks in the consumer market which positions us in the networked home both through retail and through the service provider delivered to provide the simplest, easiest to use, and best customer experience, a great example, John, of the small acquisition where we were able to bring in a strong, innovative engineering team to expand our additional markets. We will also, as you know, with Scientific Atlanta, WebEx, and others continue to use platform acquisitions to position ourselves in new markets going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Paul Mansky with Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you for the question. Obviously, John, and congratulations. I mean you did call the macro turn down.  I'd argue probably first, certainly out of the tech group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wish I would have been wrong on that, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would prefer you have been very, very wrong on that actually, but it looks as though you called it right. And yet, as we've got two quarters underneath our belt here, obviously you have fallen off your target rate of growth, although not as dramatically as some might have anticipated. While at the same time recognizing currency benefits impact different companies at different paces, very largely if I look at large cap tech, and then I also look at your smaller direct competitors, companies certainly haven't been lowering numbers. I was hoping to just to get your perspective relative to what it is that Cisco may or may not be seeing that is a unique, and then just any color you could potentially provide around that because, obviously I'm sure you pay pretty close attention to what your competitors both direct and indirect are doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so let me take the overall geography question and bring it down to the specific questions at hand. The overall geography is what we are hearing when we look at an economic perspective, we mainly look to what our customers are telling us. And what our customers are telling us outside the US is largely that their GDP growth and the growth of their own business is pretty solid. That doesn't mean that some of the things going on in the US won't affect them but if China goes from 13% growth to 11 or 11 to 9.5, we and others are still going to do very well there.</p>
          <p>As we said earlier, it's the best balance we've seen in our emerging markets, and that's emerging markets, it doesn't matter where it is in the world: in Asia, in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia, CIS, and I would be very surprised if we didn't see the Middle East and Africa bounce back very strongly this next year, so good balance there. It has actually been a pleasant surprise to us in areas like the UK, where clearly they have had some of the same challenges the US did. Their growth last quarter was very solid. Areas like Germany, you really see the country investing for the future and it looks very solid there, and we experienced growth in the high 20s in Germany.</p>
          <p>In the US, it's really mixed. We have a certain number of our customers who actually say if it weren't for what they were seeing in the press, their business is very solid and even their shareholders don't believe it when they say that but they say John, it really is. You have others that are a little bit more cautious, and I think all of us understand that by industry segments et cetera.</p>
          <p>We do have some tough comps which ought to be taken into consideration when you look at our Q1 and Q2 growth, especially true in Service Provider where you went through three years in a row where the average quarter year-over-year growth was above 30%, and clearly you have to absorb that capacity. What percentage of CapEx they spend as a percentage of sales will vary a little bit on investments, but you are seeing service provider network loads grow very, very rapidly.</p>
          <p>So actually our US Enterprise was stronger than we expected this quarter. Our US Service Provider was a little bit weaker. But if I look at the total global scenario, it's probably going to be a little bit longer than we would have said six months ago. But still most of my customers see it turning early next year, and that's what we're listening to our customers and we are budgeting that way. We don't want to project that in terms of our yearly growth numbers until we see it occurring and most likely even if we were we would miss what that number would be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. My question, John, is, several quarters ago when you mentioned that things were slowing a bit, it was more enterprise focused, and it seems like that part of your business now has stabilized and maybe bottomed, and it's the Service Provider part of the business that gives you some caution. Is it safe to say in your discussion with your customers globally that the worst is behind us in Enterprise and we just to need to now get through the telco -I'm sorry, the service provider capital spending uncertainties or is there still some risk you think on the Enterprise side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start in reverse order. From the Service Provider perspective, our relationship has never been better, and we are working with most all of the large service providers around the world, not just in providing a technology product, but beginning to evolve the technology architectures and considering going all the way from the home to their data centers, and combining data, voice, video. And the loads on their networks are starting to approach levels that many of them have said, John, you all probably called that one right four or five years ago when you said the loads on networks wouldn't be 50 or 100%, but multiples of 100% as video really begins to take off.</p>
          <p>The major challenge they face is how do they bring the economics to the loads on their networks. And so when you build out with the capacity that people have said before, it takes a while to absorb that. And then it also takes a while for the service providers to transition from charging purely for individual voice connections or for bandwidth speeds to the services they put on top, but you're seeing most service providers begin to do that. That's a nice way of saying we would not anticipate service providers spending over the long run, not returning into double digits. Time will tell if that's right or wrong.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Enterprise market, it really varies. Around the world, they have held up remarkably strong, and they may be lumpy by individual country at a given point in time, but pretty solid around the world. Again, our relationship with the CIOs around the world, we would get ranked usually number one of almost all ITN communication companies in any large surveys done in terms of everything from vision to customer staff. So we're positioned well.</p>
          <p>In the US, I think it's a little bit too early to call the trend. I think we want to share with you and when you see US Enterprise going from 6 to 13%, that's very positive. Listing, not forecasting those type of numbers yet for the future, and so we'd like to watch at least another quarter before I'd call it a trend. But if you do believe, and we try to follow everything that moves, the organizations that led us into this slowdown, which were financial and the large multinationals who went through, as I said earlier, over a year of very sluggish growth to negative growth would be kind words, we've seen them upturn as a group. And we saw good balance across our Enterprise markets in five of the six theaters growing from 8% to mid-20s. It's a nice way of saying we would like to say yes to your question, but I think it's going to take a little bit longer to play it out.</p>
          <p>In summary, from what we can truly influence are pretty good and what we're pretty good at is predicting the overall additions of all of our balance of markets, although we often miss by customer segments or individual products. I hope that, Nikos, it helps explain a little bit. I wish a quarter from now I can give you a more definitive answer on the Enterprise.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you so much. John, I just wanted to understand a little bit the assumptions behind your guidance. When I look at some of the metrics in your business last quarter, your orders by geography have actually improved in couple of the regions like the United States and Asia. Also, your deferred revenues improved. Advanced Services were up nicely. Your book-to-bill was above one. Clearly there are areas of deceleration as well. But I was just curious how putting all those things together, how that comes out to a further deceleration in the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, do you want to take a crack at that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Simona, thank you. As you pointed out, Simona, as we ended fiscal year 2008 for Q4, we do have &#x2013; we're going into the Q1 with a stronger position as we look at our backlog and also in the deferred revenue that we've been able to build. I mentioned this quarter that we had deferred revenue growing at 26%. We had a comparable amount last quarter. So that really bodes well as we look into the future in building that kind of a base. We've taken that into consideration although that's a good start point as we go into the quarter.</p>
          <p>But as John mentioned, we really have to call it as we see it and we take all that into consideration. We did have some great growth and strength in the quarter. We also are looking at these tough compares especially on the Service Provider that we're taking into consideration as we look at Q1 and Q2, and that is a factor that affects our growth rates. So in balance, we feel fairly confident with what we see right now that we've &#x2013; with the 8% plus or minus one and the 8.5% for the second quarter plus or minus one. It gives us the right balance of the good, the positive, as well as some of the areas where we have a little bit more challenge.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jeff Evenson with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Related to that, your DSOs were lower, implying maybe there was a little bit lower sales toward the end of the quarter. Yet you seem pretty confident in guiding that second quarter will have about 3.3% sequential growth using the midpoint of your numbers, plus a higher year over year growth rate. Given that you're unlikely to be seeing anything macroeconomic that makes you much more confident about the fourth quarter, are you doing something internally like new products or organizational issues that gives you confidence to guide for the acceleration toward the end of year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A series of questions. First, it does feed into Simona's question as well. The DSOs were very solid, but our order growth rate actually was very strong in July. It was probably up a point or two above the normal percentage of business that comes in the third month of the quarter, especially in Q4.</p>
          <p>In terms of what gives us comfortability in terms the direction, while there might be an occasional competitor that gains a little bit of market share in a category temporarily &#x2013; and by the way that's healthy for the business because if the market isn't growing well and we aren't getting good competitors, we've got a bigger issue. We actually feel very comfortable with where we're positioned in all of the markets. And we do see Collaboration on Web 2.0 starting to take hold. I personally believe that's going to be the biggest driver of our direction as a company over the next five to ten years. And you now for the first time that I can remember as a CEO, you talk to other CEOs and they can actually give an advertisement for me on Collaboration in TelePresence in terms of saying this is changing the way that I do business, this is the direction that we're going et cetera.</p>
          <p>Video is clearly the killer app here. And when you think about the loads currently going on networks, these are largely downloads that are occurring today or one person to one person. If you begin to take concepts like TelePresence where you have ten different locations into a single medium, which I do pretty regularly now as an example, and you begin to think about that occurring not only in the area of business, but also to the home where you watch sporting events together from your home, across multiple sites and do reruns et cetera, you begin to see our view at least what we believe will be loads on the networks. Still, we'll actually accelerate even though there are often in many of our accounts starting to hit the 200 &#x2013; 250% range.</p>
          <p>The third element is you're beginning to see balance in a lot of our strategies we're putting in place that are occurring. The fourth element is that you are seeing easier comps. We have some very tough comps coming off of Service Providers in Q1 and Q2. They are a little bit more adjustable in Q3 and Q4 although, Pankaj, make no mistake about it. I want to get Service Providers back sustainably into growth in the double digits and if we execute right, I expect us to.</p>
          <p>It's a nice way of saying, Jeff, a lot of moving parts. In my opinion, all of them that we can control or influence almost without exception are going the right way. That doesn't mean for Cisco people who are listening in on the phone we can't do better, but I think what we can control or influence, it looks good. And our customers are also saying this is the most likely scenario for them in terms of what they see occurring on the macro environment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I need to give a point of clarification here. Simona mentioned about the DSO. We were very pleased with the DSO of 34 days in this quarter. We did report 39 days last quarter, but we also noted that last quarter, we had some large service deals that impacted that. So we've had some comparable DSO in that 34-day range now for a couple of quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would agree. And just for people on the phone, as long as it's in the 30 to 40-day range, I don't even ask Frank about it. If it were to go on either side of that, I'd say are we doing something unusual and we'd want to really think it through. So Frank, congratulations to your team and the manufacturing team on that measurement.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Okay, next question please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Scott Coleman with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'm wondering if we can focus on the router market for a minute, growth of 8% year over year. When you look at your competitors in this market, they're growing at much faster rates. I'm wondering if you have a reason behind that. Is it that they are more focused on the edge part of the market?  Do you need to do something with the existing product portfolio over the next couple of quarters to drive that growth rate back higher? But I'm just curious why the numbers are so divergent from your competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Break it into probably three or four segments of it. First is if you watch our growth using high end routers as an example, Pankaj, the last five to six quarters, we've gained market share on everyone. And if you look at high end multichassis routers, our market share there is huge and going in the large-scale deployment almost as fast as we can build them within it.</p>
          <p>Secondly, even at our size, orders can be a little bit lumpy. So let's use an example that's very real. We have a medium sized service provider who is a great Cisco partner that we're not losing market share in, but they did in a comparable quarter 125 million. In this quarter, they will probably do less than 20 million. So that's 100 million on our numbers that if you look across the board, that's probably a 7 or 8% negative change in terms of the scenario on it.</p>
          <p>Third is that I would probably challenge you a little bit in terms of sustainable gain by the majority of our router peers in the industry. We actually have been very effective on our peers and I'm real comfortable with the product range from the core to the edge. I do think we have to do a little bit more, Pankaj, in certain segments of the edge though the ASR 1000 I think has been very solid. We probably have a little bit of work to do in some of the other product areas, and I wouldn't be mentioning that if I didn't expect us to close that gap as well.</p>
          <p>I do, however, want to congratulate Juniper to your indirect part of your question. I mean they had a very good quarter. They clearly would not with a new CEO coming in project growth to be actually accelerating at these levels and beyond and redo their guidance; they didn't feel comfortable with it. We do have to make it a little bit tougher for them in a couple of the Service Provider commercial accounts, and we understand where those are, and we will do a little bit better job competing in those. Pankaj, do you have anything you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I think you covered it very well. I think our innovations and our R&amp;D investment, especially in the high end like the CRS-1 for a number years now is paying off pretty handsomely. We have a pretty strong position in that and especially with the offering like Multichassis, we excel pretty well. So I think what you pointed out earlier, which is when it comes to the architectural part leadership of systems and end-to-end solutions that gaining both the mind share and the market share, I don't think we have been in a better position than ever than we have been in this market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add one more point on from a data point of view, not only the midsized service provider, which you referenced, but a very, very large service provider who gave us record business in the first quarter of last year. We will do very well this year. Still the comps are extraordinary in that situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you do the numbers and you add three years in a row, 30% year-over-year growth, you realize there's lot of capacity. Scott, let me very direct and bold here. I think we're going to lead in our architecture and routing across the board. I think there might be very short gaps where somebody might have a feature or temporary advantage. I think over time, you'll see us continue to be the clear leader in routing in all categories. And our customers who we disclosed our current and future plans to would probably agree with that.</p>
          <p>Having said that, there is always a little bit of room, Rick, for a couple of accounts that we know that one or two of our competitors did very well in. If $100 million can swing us by 7% on our growth numbers, imagine what an incremental 50 million can do for one of our smaller peers to put it in perspective. It's a nice way of saying congratulations to those peers that had a good quarter. We'll try to give them a little bit better run over this next year and we have traditionally given them a very good run over the last couple.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. John, there is a big difference between 8 and 12 and a bigger difference between 8 and 17.  Is 12 to 17 just glass is half-full optimism and why do you still feel that the current revenue contraction will be short-lived? And I ask since we're looking at four potential quarters of revenue growth below your long-term growth guidance and the short term is starting to feel pretty long.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, Mark, and I realize that in many markets and especially in some of the markets that our shareholders who make these decisions are measured in, you're often measured by the quarter and by the year. I make no decisions by the quarter and very few by the year. I make all my decisions three, five, seven years out. And if you watch what we've been able to do, our growth projections over 17 years have been remarkably accurate. There are periods of time more often than not where we actually exceed our growth projections versus those where we're operating a little bit underneath them.</p>
          <p>If you can grow in the 8 to 10% range, just for purposes of the discussion, when your market that represents a 30-year business is growing mid-single digits in the US, which represents 50% of your business, is growing at about 7%, I would challenge the reverse way. I'd say, Mark, and I know you're challenging me on this in a very positive way, the 12 to 15% it might be a little bit low in terms of what the opportunities are. So, I see nothing that has changed my view on the 12 to 17% range. In fact, if you review what's occurring on a geography basis, it's a little bit like that game that you used to play in the carnival with Whac-A-Mole where now it's automated. No sooner do we put one of those challenges or opportunities down, then another one pops up. But eventually, we'll get them in sequence.</p>
          <p>And so if you can grow in the 8 to 10% range without currency effect and if you have your expenses being hampered by &#x2013; Frank, I think it's about 2.5% a quarter, you hit negatively on the expenses because of currency. As currently begins to balance out, as the economy in the US comes around, and it will. We might have active discussion, is it one to two quarters or is it three quarters or four quarters out, then I would actually say, Mark, those numbers look pretty to very reasonable in terms of the expectation. I can tell you now, however, if you try to add up each one of the variables, it's very difficult to say exactly what the growth will be. We are pretty good at portfolio management, not as good at signaling each one of the individual variables.</p>
          <p>And so in summary, if you were to look at 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, the vast majority of the time, the numbers have actually run ahead of our guidance and at the upper end of the range.</p>

          <p>Hi, Hedy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, a couple of things. If you look at the cash flow guidance that Frank gave of 6 to 800 million a month, you used to be saying 7 to 900 a month. I'm assuming that's correlated with the guidance that Frank gave for next quarter on the gross margin and the OpEx that point to an operating margin of 28%, a little bit below the 29.5 range you had before. My guess is those are two sides of the same coin. Can you give us a sense as to where the extra expense is going and why &#x2013; you gave guidance like this two quarters ago and it turned out that you didn't do it. It turned out that you actually did get 29.5% operating margin and not the 28. Do you expect that your OpEx and if you can give us a little sense as to where it will be stepped up because it sounds like it's costing roughly 300 million a quarter, 100 million per month, and why you feel that the right thing to do is to spend more money and in what areas during these times of slow revenue growth, that'll be helpful. I appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, I am going to give you that easy question and have you do it. And each of the members sitting around the team from the engineering to sales are saying we'd like to have more as well. So take it within the parameters and I might sum it up after you do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, John, clearly over the last two quarters, are you just being conservative?  A little of both, but over the last two quarters, with the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, we tried to be extra cautious as far as looking at and focus on spending across the board. And so as we continue to make investments, we were more prudent as far as selecting those investments. We have those two quarters behind us, and as we've mentioned on the call today, both John and I talked about this.  And going into the new fiscal year, we are making investments for our innovation for the long term. There are so many different opportunities that we are looking at in our portfolio. We've spent a tremendous amount of time especially over the last six months while we were managing our expense, looking at the opportunity and what the payback was going to be over the longer term.</p>
          <p>It really goes back to the question that John just answered about the 12 to 17%. We feel very confident in that 12 to 17%, and in order for us to deliver on that 12 to 17%, we need to make investments and driving the innovations to go after that. We've got our portfolio in place, we are into a new fiscal year. We've got that all portioned out as far where we are going to be making those investments, many of which John talked about on the call, especially in Advanced Technologies, Emerging Technologies, solutions, opportunities, especially services is where we are growing on a global basis. So there are many opportunities, the right thing that we have to keep in control as we move forward is making the right trade-offs in that portfolio and we are ready to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you really think about it from a mathematical point of view, we've talked about it before in terms of our collaborative approach to market opportunities. Instead of doing one or two cross-functional a year, we are going to do almost two dozen. Out of those two dozen, I'd have to look at it mathematically, but I'd say at least half have no material effect on our top line for at least two years out. So if you look at the investments we are making, and we are making them on a larger front than ever before and we are actually accelerating the market adjacencies that we're moving into as well as the new market opportunities, and I would argue with a tremendous success rate.</p>
          <p>Just use TelePresence as an example. What Marthin and team have been spending in TelePresence for a two-year development cycle and then the best we've ever had a $1 billion product come to market is five years later in a new market area, they are very likely to beat that with all the appropriate caveats in terms of the run rate. So we are investing and we are investing in a portfolio play. We are investing very broad, and it goes back to &#x2013; I think it was Mark who was in a constructive way exercising me about my comfort level of 12 to 17%. If I were just doing routers and switches and a little bit of Advanced Technologies, I would say fair the challenge.</p>
          <p>But look at where we are moving and our success rate of not only moving there and becoming rapid growth with a great profitability, but also becoming the number one player in doing what we said. It has been really good. So if I were a shareholder, and I was really saying &#x2013; and you run it like it was a private company and look where the stock is two or three years out, I would actually probably be more aggressive on the expenses. And that's where I think both Frank and I and the rest of the team are a little bit conservative. But, you will see us spend the money. We are going to be aggressive. You will also see us if we execute versus our past with a pretty good hit rate. In fact at the current hit rate, the net is a little bit higher than I'd like, I'd like to take a little bit more risk because so far we've been remarkably accurate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should assume that when revenue growth goes above 10%, operating margin goes back to 29.5?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going tie it down. We'll give the ranges as we go through it. But we could bring operating profits down to again up to whatever level we wanted very quickly. We've always balanced our opportunities versus our long-term growth objectives et cetera. I have no problem with growth opportunities. My problem is the reverse, how do we spend across the whole company, not just in R&amp;D, as we move into a new area because Rick has to spend on go-to-market. Service has to spend on it, manufacturing has to spend. Each of our groups has to invest into it. So as you move in this many markets, it takes a little bit more time to be effective on it.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John, hey. I thought I just heard you say that TelePresence could be a billion-dollar market in less than five years, which hasn't happened before. The question is I'm hoping you can give us a little bit more insight in terms of the base of business today on these new growth drivers, TelePresence, Nexus, which I know you just started shipping, and I suspect the numbers are extremely small, and Application Network Services. And can you also give us some insight relative to your comment about TelePresence? What type of impact do you think these products could have over the next couple of years as well that longer five-year timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, again, it's very difficult to do by individual products, but our ability to add up the total gets pretty dramatic. So, I would say in many ways, Paul, it's like when first moved into Advanced Technologies several years ago and you saw how successful we were across the board. Each of us would have probably got the specific technology growth rate wrong. But in total, they were remarkably sustainable. And for five of the six, they actually exceeded our expectations and continue to grow extremely well.</p>
          <p>I will use one example and then maybe in future calls, we can expand further. If I were to look at the three emerging technology groups as an example, they grew 300% year over year in terms of orders. They're at a run rate of about $200 million now. And using TelePresence as an example, it's at a run rate of 500% year-over-year growth. The total of the three are actually at a 300% year-over-year growth. So it gets confusing if I were to throw more variables in, but that kind of a sampling, Paul, of how we approach it, and a pretty good track record on doing it.</p>
          <p>The IP phones as an example, I don't know if one of you have the data in front of you, but if you look at Unified Communications for us at the present time, its run rate I think is above 2 billion type of run rate and it was market that we didn't even really address aggressively five or six years ago. So we have shown an ability to go into that pretty quickly.  Frank in the meantime is paging through his books frantically to make sure I have got that number right. And if we didn't, we'll correct it a little bit later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but didn't you say that you thought TelePresence could be a $1 billion product in the next five years? If you did say that, is that direct revenues and the indirect impact on your Switching and Routing business or is that just direct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is just direct revenues and I think I have got to add all the caveats that we are all very much aware of. But if there is one product that really captures people's imagination, it's TelePresence. It speaks to the role of video and communications. 60% of the way you communicate is non-verbal. It's about video and that loads the heck out of networks, and you are just beginning to see what's capable with TelePresence. And so today while you see the typical ones that probably each of you have seen, you have not seen our movement into the home, which we clearly are going to do. Probably a couple of you have seen it on YouTube with nearly doing a virtual hologram of being able to virtually appear on stage together with people that are either in other parts of the world or actually time shifted into those roles.</p>
          <p>So while it's not a sure thing and obviously I expect very good execution and there is always the portfolio play here, the one product that I feel with the highest probability of hitting that billion-dollar run rate in a new area that we haven't been in before is probably TelePresence.</p>
          <p>The other products, Paul, it's early in the cycle. So when you think about data center, there is always a slow uptake when you bring in brand new products into the data center. Our feedback on the customers and you seen the awards we won, the Nexus 5000, Nexus 7000 look really good.</p>

          <p>Thank you, if I could just follow back on the Unified Communications comments, obviously it continues to be strong there. Just give us a little color, John, where you think we are in the cycle and how the economy is going to maybe the influence some of those upgrades. And also you get this question every quarter, if you could just talk to the pull-through of switching that you are seeing on the Unified Communications side, that would be great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>The run rate on Unified Communications, actually the number for the year was above 2.5 billion on the order rate. And so the run rate you all have seen over a period of time, it varies. Some of the areas like IP Telephony is a given and people will spend on that during good times and during bumps, maybe not quite as much during the bumps as the good times, but that is a role that I think is pretty much a given is that the phones of the future will be IP. They won't describe him as phones. They will probably describe them as a combination data with voice, video, wired and wireless flexibility within that. The second part of the question I missed.</p>

          <p>So for new technologies and let's use TelePresence as an example, during stronger economic times, it's a lot easier for people to put in a pilot group of 20 systems and then take them to 100. During a little bit tougher economic times until they experience it and begin to get their base, it's a little bit longer ramp-up in terms of what might occur. So that's a nice way of saying in areas that have a very quick ROI that the customer feels pretty comfortable with, they spend either way. During areas that are a little bit more based on productivity and collaboration. I think we've got a little bit more work to go.</p>
          <p>But that's a very appropriate one to end on, Tim, because what has changed most of all in the last six months is the conversations on Collaboration and Web 2.0 that move from theoretical or a pilot base more toward our leading edge customers saying help me implement it; what sequence do we go in, how do I get there, and that's true both in the enterprise and in the Service Provider environment.</p>

          <p>I want to thank everyone and Blair, maybe turn it over to you for final closing. Please give us feedback on what you thought of the new format. We tried to be a little bit more net and leave a little bit more time for a healthy give and take in the Q&amp;As. Don't hesitate to share with us what areas it is you see improve on. But in summary again what we can control or influence, I feel very good about. And our growth opportunities I think are more prioritization and execution than having opportunities to go at. I think that's a real unique in the industry as a whole. So Blair, back to you.</p>
