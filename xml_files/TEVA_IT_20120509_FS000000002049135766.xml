          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. First Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Following management's formal presentation, instructions will be given for the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded May 9, 2012.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over the call to Mr. Kevin Mannix, VP, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Mannix, would you like to begin?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rachel. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Teva's first quarter 2012 earnings results. I'm joined today by our President and CEO, Shlomo Yanai; Teva's incoming President and CEO, Dr. Jeremy Levin; our CFO, Eyal Desheh; Bill Marth, President and CEO of Teva Americas; Rob Koremans, President and CEO of Teva Europe; and Dr. Michael Hayden, President of Global R&amp;D and Chief Scientific Officer.</p>
          <p>Shlomo will begin by providing an overview of the quarter followed by Eyal, who will then provide additional details on our consolidated financial results. Finally, we will hear from our new CEO, Jeremy Levin, before opening the call to a question-and-answer period.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements, actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Teva's report on Form 20-F and Form 6-K.</p>
          <p>Also the discussions during this conference call will include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Teva's earnings release issued earlier this morning which can also be found on our website, www.tevapharm.com.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn the call over to Shlomo. Shlomo, if you would, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kevin. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to report that the year is off to a solid start for Teva. Compared to the first quarter of 2011 sales were up by 25% to reach $5.1 billion. Quarterly operating profit grew by 42% to $1.6 billion and net income increased by 39% to $1.3 billion. This brought us to EPS of $1.47 up 41% over the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we undertook an important initiative to streamline some of our commercial arrangements in the U.S. In the near and midterm these changes will yield important financial benefits for Teva. During Q1, however, these moves had a negative impact on revenues of approximately $180 million. Revenues were also impacted by currency exchange rates during the quarter of $81 million.</p>
          <p>I would like to discuss just a few highlights from our major businesses during the quarter and Eyal will elaborate later on all of our businesses in greater detail in his remarks. This was the second consecutive quarter of solid results in our U.S. generics business. Teva's world-class generics R&amp;D, broad product portfolio, continuing improvement in service levels and deep customer relationships have enabled us to bounce back to enjoy growth of 29% year-over-year. During the first quarter we launched seven new generic products representing over $10 billion in branded sales in the U.S. market, and a number of these launches were either exclusive, semi-exclusive or in limited competition markets.</p>
          <p>In Europe, in spite of rough macroeconomic conditions, sales grew by 3% during the quarter in local currencies to $1.3 billion. We saw a significant increase in sales of our branded products due primarily to the inclusion of products we acquired from Cephalon as well as the take back of Copaxone distribution and marketing rights from Sanofi. In fact, in the E.U. countries where we recently took back Copaxone sales and marketing rights, our average growth in units is about 7%. This offset lower generic sales due to the ongoing macroeconomic conditions and health care reforms in key European markets.</p>
          <p>Our strategy of diversifying our business in Europe geographically and from a product standpoint as well as our significant footprint in the continent has helped us to successfully mitigate some of the prevailing pressures.</p>
          <p>During Q1, we continue to enjoy strong growth in our rest of world markets, particularly in Eastern Europe and Latin America. As sales totaled $1 billion, up 23% in local currencies and in Japan, Teva has introduced a new face to the market with the integration of Teva's existing businesses into one new company, (5:58) Teva Saikou <mark type="ph" />. We are very pleased at the enthusiastic response the Teva brand is receiving in Japan.</p>
          <p>2012 was off to a great start for Teva's branded business with strong sales of our major branded products. As you've seen in our press release, sales of Teva's portfolio of branded products enjoyed 54% increase in sales year-over-year thanks to a combination of organic growth, the addition of Cephalon products and positive sales synergies of the major Cephalon products with Provigil, Nuvigil and Treanda growing organically on average 22% year-over-year. I am pleased to report that the integration of Cephalon into Teva is going even more quickly than we anticipated and synergies remain in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>Copaxone remains the market leader in the U.S. retaining over 40% market share and continues to grow outside the U.S. in terms of value and units sold. Outside the U.S., in-market sales grew by 15% in value and 26% in units sold over the first quarter of 2011. Copaxone remains the leading global therapy for the treatment of MS.</p>
          <p>Teva's global respiratory business grew by 4% over the first quarter of 2011. In the U.S., market share for both ProAir and Qvar continued to grow during Q1 with Qvar further strengthening its number two position in the growing inhaled corticosteroid market. We are very excited about our recent launch of QNASL and have received U.S. approval for our ProAir dose counter which we expect to launch this fall.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'm pleased to report that as part of our strategy to turn our Women's Health business into a global franchise we've launched our Women's Health product Zoely in select E.U. countries and have submitted Seasonique for approval in the E.U.</p>
          <p>As you all know, I will be stepping down today after five deeply rewarding years as President and CEO of Teva. When I joined Teva the company was already a generics powerhouse with annual revenues of over $8 billion. The growth strategy we have implemented over these last five years has turned Teva into a larger highly diversified global pharmaceutical company. As CEO, it's been extremely gratifying to lead Teva through this exciting period in its history. At a personal level it has been a true privilege to work with Teva's outstanding management team and employees to create a stronger and more balanced Teva. I am very grateful to the entire Teva family.</p>
          <p>Over the last few months I have had the genuine pleasure of working closely with my successor, Dr. Jeremy Levin, to ensure a smooth transition of leadership. I've gotten to know Jeremy well and I'm completely confident that he will lead Teva to even greater heights. Jeremy, I wish you and the whole Teva family every success in the future.</p>
          <p>As you can understand, it would not be appropriate at this time for me to provide any forward-looking statements but I'm sure that after undertaking his own processes and conducting his assessments, Jeremy will share his thoughts with you. It has been a pleasure to work with all of you. I would like to thank you very much and wish all of you the best going forward.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will now turn the call over to Eyal. Eyal?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Shlomo, and good day to everyone.</p>
          <p>The first quarter of 2012 marks a positive start of the year for Teva. We're' reporting today solid growth in our key quality parameters: net revenues, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS as well as the GAAP results. The main drivers of the solid growth were the performance of our U.S. generic business which is back on track with seven new product launches during the quarter, strong performance of our global branded business, notably in Europe, where we have successfully taken back all rights for Copaxone and consistent growth of our markets in the rest of the world. In addition, the growth also reflects the contribution of our M&amp;A activity last year, primarily the acquisition of Cephalon and Taiyo.</p>
          <p>There were three factors that provided headwinds to our result this quarter. First, the renegotiation of certain distribution service agreements in the U.S. in order to establish a new fee structure resulted in a reduction of approximately $180 million of branded sales. We believe this move will yield benefits to Teva in the short and mid-term. Second, the continued regulatory changes have created pricing pressure on the pharmaceutical industry in Europe stemming from the general macro-environment in the continent. And third, negative impacts of foreign currencies on our sales.</p>
          <p>I would like to touch on two issues before I review the first quarter numbers. First, I would like to remind everyone that we are presenting GAAP and non-GAAP results. In our non-GAAP presentation we've excluded the following items: amortization of purchased intangible assets totaling $414 million, of which $402 million are included in cost of sales and the remaining $12 million in selling and marketing expenses; amortization this quarter mainly represents the Provigil patent expiration and is expected to be lower for the rest of the year; inventory step-up of $56 million in connection with the Cephalon acquisition, this amount will be significantly lower next quarter; costs related to regulatory actions taken in facilities of $38 million, which relates primarily to our Irvine and Animal Health facilities; impairment of long-lived assets of $87 million; restructuring and other expenses of $43 million are related primarily to the Cephalon and Taiyo acquisitions; legal settlements and reserves of $19 million mainly related to U.S. product liability matters and related tax benefits of $216 million. Please review our press release and related tables for complete information including reconciliation to GAAP figures. As we've indicated in the past, we'll present non-GAAP figures to show how we, the management team and our Board, look at our financial results. And second, I would like to cover the impact of foreign currencies on our P&amp;L as well as our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, foreign currency differences had a negative impact of approximately $81 million on sales. This resulted primarily from the weakening of some European currencies, mainly the euro, relative to the U.S. dollar. Currencies had minor positive effects on our operating income this quarter, as it has impacted our expenses in a different manner.</p>
          <p>We expect foreign currencies to continue to have adverse impact on our sales during 2012. On the other hand, foreign currencies had a positive impact on our equity increasing it by $772 million. So with those background points looking at consolidated results for the first quarter, net revenue had reached $5.1 billion, an increase of 25% compared to the first quarter of last year. As we started doing last quarter, I will turn now to the description of a breakdown of our sales by business line and by geography.</p>
          <p>Generic product net sales for the first quarter of 2012 were approximately $2.6 billion including API sales of $199 million, an increase of 12% when compared to $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2011. Our generics business in the U.S. had a strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion, an increase of 29% compared to the first quarter of 2011. This was the result of the launch of seven new generic products, which are escitalopram, modafinil, progesterone, irbesartan and irbesartan/HCTZ, quetiapine and olanzapine ODT. We also continued to benefit from our agreement with Ranbaxy relating to its launch of generic Lipitor.</p>
          <p>In Europe, our generics business had a challenging quarter with sales of $775 million, a decrease of 15% or 12% in local currency terms compared to Q1 2011. The decline was primarily the result of various regulatory measures and reducing healthcare and drug expenditures in key European markets. The generics business and our rest of the world market had another good quarter with sales of $623 million, an increase of 30% driven primarily by sales in Eastern Europe, Latin America as well as the inclusion of Taiyo slightly offset by a decrease in generics sales in Canada.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to our branded business where we had a good quarter across most product lines. Total net sales in the first quarter were approximately $2.1 billion, an increase of 54% when compared to the $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2011. Branded products revenues this quarter comprised 41% of our total revenue. Branded product sales in the U.S. this quarter were $1.5 billion, an increase of 60% compared with the first quarter of 2011. This was mostly the result of the inclusion of Cephalon.</p>
          <p>In Europe our branded business had a good quarter with sales of $365 million, an increase of 43% compared to Q1 2011, driven by the successful completion of the take back of Copaxone sales in Europe from Sanofi, the inclusion of Cephalon and strong sales of each product. In the rest of the world markets, branded sales were $212 million, an increase of 32% driven primarily by strong sales of Copaxone in Russia and certain Latin America countries.</p>
          <p>Finally, turning to our OTC business, net sales for the first quarter of 2012 were $196 million, an increase of 7% when compared to $184 million in the first quarter of 2011. OTC sales are made primarily in non- U.S. dollar currencies and in local currencies they increased by 10%.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to our non-GAAP operating income which totaled $1.6 billion in the first quarter, up 42% compared to Q1 2011, reflecting mainly the inclusion of Cephalon, strong sales of our branded products and the seven generic launches in the U.S. as well as tight expense management.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income and fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.3 billion and $1.47 respectively, up 39% and 41% respectively compared to Q1 2011.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter of 2012, the weighted average share count for the fully diluted earnings per share calculation was 882 million shares on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis. As of March 31, 2012, the share count for calculating Teva's market capitalization was approximately 872 million shares.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss profit margin and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross profit margin for the quarter which excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets, costs related to regulatory actions taken in facilities and inventory step up were 60.9% in the first quarter compared to 58.8% in the comparable quarter of 2011. The higher margins this quarter primarily reflect the inclusion of Cephalon and the new generic launches in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Net R&amp;D expenses reached $292 million this quarter compared to $239 million in the first quarter of 2011, mostly reflecting the inclusion of Cephalon.</p>
          <p>Selling and marketing expenses for the quarter excluding amortization of intangible assets totaled $916 million compared to $825 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Cephalon and Taiyo as well as the take back of distribution and marketing responsibility for Copaxone in Europe partially offset by lower royalty payments on generic products in the U.S. and changes in currency exchange rates, which had an impact on expenses as well.</p>
          <p>Total G&amp;A expenses this quarter were $312 million compared to $221 million in Q1 last year, primarily due to the acquisition of Cephalon and Taiyo and a gain from the sale of our Peruvian pharmaceutical chain recorded in the comparable quarter. This was partially offset by lower legal costs.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter reached 31.1% significantly up from 27.3% in the comparable quarter last year, driven primarily by the inclusion of Cephalon and the new launches in the U.S. and tight expense management. We recorded $70 million of financial expenses on a non-GAAP basis in Q1 compared with $38 million in the comparable quarter of 2011. The increase is mainly due to higher interest expenses resulting from adding debt incurred to finance the acquisitions of Cephalon and Taiyo partially offset by income from hedging activities.</p>
          <p>The provision for non-GAAP tax for the first quarter of 2012 was 13.7% and amounted to $207 million on pre-tax non-GAAP income of $1.5 billion. The provision for tax in the first quarter of 2011 was $121 million on pre-tax income of $1.1 million or 11.2%. We experienced an increase in our annual tax rates for 2012 compared to annual tax rates in 2011 primarily as a result of change in geographical and product mix following the Cephalon and Taiyo acquisitions. The tax benefit for the first quarter GAAP results amounted to $9 million on pre-tax income of $885 million compared with $49 million on pre-tax income of $829 million in the comparable quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at our cash flow. Cash from operations in the quarter was $756 million, a decrease of 16% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Our free cash flow excluding net capital expenditures and cash dividends amounted to $414 million, a decrease of 19%. The decrease is mostly a result of one-off items such as legal settlements, tax advances and restructuring costs and an increase in inventory levels.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we bought back approximately 11.9 million shares at an average price of approximately $44.67 per share for a total of $533 million. On March 31, our cash and marketable securities and our total outstanding loans, bonds and convertible debentures remained unchanged compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 at $1.7 million and $14.5 billion respectively.</p>
          <p>Our financial leverage as of March 31, 2012, was 38% up from 23% as of March 31, 2011. The increase in financial leverage is attributed primarily to the financing incurred in relation to the Cephalon and Taiyo acquisitions. We expect to gradually reduce our financial leverage in the coming year.</p>
          <p>Net capital expenditures reached $168 million this quarter, a decrease compared to $280 million in the previous quarter and $184 million in Q1 2011.</p>
          <p>Yesterday, Teva's board approved a quarterly dividend for the first quarter of 1 shekel per share in line with the increase to our quarterly dividend announced in the previous quarter. Based on the rate of exchange on May 8, 2012, of the shekel to the U.S. dollar, this translates into approximately $0.263 per share or total amount of approximately $229 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Before I conclude, I would like to extend my warmest wishes to Shlomo who is completing today five very successful years as President and CEO of Teva and wish his successor and my new boss, Dr. Jeremy Levin, the best of luck taking our extraordinary company to new heights in the future.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for your time and attention today. Now let me turn the call to Dr. Jeremy Levin. Jeremy?</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eyal. I'm delighted to be here today to speak to you as Teva's President and CEO. It's an honor and privilege to lead this great company.</p>
          <p>Here with me today are some of the key members of Teva's global management team. Together, we'd like to thank Shlomo Yanai for his leadership over the last five years and, from me particularly, for all of his time and effort during the transition period that we worked together. As a result, specifically, of this effort and of the very smooth handover, I take over this flagship company having had an initial immersion in Teva's operations, activities and culture. Thank you, Shlomo.</p>
          <p>Teva is a remarkable company in a prestigious industry. It has a strong historic heritage, an impressive record of achievement and many competitive advantages. I joined Teva because of its potential to make a difference in patients' lives around the globe and I believe I can make a difference here. Together with the great people of Teva, I am confident that we can have an increasingly significant positive impact on patients around the world through innovative ideas, excellence in operations and performance, superior solutions, products, and commitment.</p>
          <p>In the past few months, I've had the opportunity to meet many of the leaders and some of the talent that have made Teva the company that it is today. As I've traveled around the company in Israel and abroad, I've been very impressed with the people that I've met and what I've seen. Teva has some of the best people in the industry, suffused with an entrepreneurial drive, commitment to patients and a desire to succeed at all levels that is unparalleled.</p>
          <p>As I take the reins of my new role, I'm examining where we'll take Teva in the next part of its journey, how we can build on our strengths and past achievements and to seize and capitalize on the unique opportunities that can drive our future. To that end, we've already put in place a set of initiatives designed to address key needs and articulate opportunities which will help formulate Teva's agenda and develop its long-term strategy. We expect to unveil our strategy later in the year.</p>
          <p>I understand that from time to time, Teva has commented on our guidance during these quarterly calls and in our other communications. As you know, I'm currently conducting a detailed business performance review for 2012, which is still underway. Once it is complete, I'll be able to talk about 2012. Until that time, we'll not be addressing our guidance.</p>
          <p>We have a covenant with our shareholders and investors to maximize value and I want to emphasize how important it is and will be for us as a company to unrelentingly drive value for our shareholders and investors. As part of that, I'm committed to having an ongoing and in-depth relationship with you, our investors, and to that end, I'll be embarking on a series of meetings, conferences and road shows in the coming months both to listen to your views and to develop an open dialogue.</p>
          <p>As you know, Teva is a widely admired and respected internationally and within the pharmaceutical industry. It has accomplished a great deal. I look forward to reporting to you about our progress and achievements as we embark on the next steps of our continued journey to drive the company to an even more successful and sustainable future. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks very much and good to be back on here. First of all, Shlomo, just best of luck with everything. It's been great working with you and I look forward to being in touch in the future.</p>
          <p>My question here was for Jeremy, based on your first few months of immersion in the Teva business could you just articulate at this point what you see as the key needs for the company based on your time so far?</p>
          <p>And then a second question for Jeremy as well, obviously your prior company was faced with a significant patent expiration cycle. Obviously a different situation here but do you think there are lessons that you can apply to Teva in the way a company is managing itself or thinking about future growth given the Copaxone uncertainty? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all, my apologies to everybody. I can't say that this has been an exciting moment, my first quarter call and guess what happens? We go silent so all I can say is that it's probably one for the record and we'll put it down to the fact that hopefully we'll get this &#x2013; it'll never occur again, hopefully.</p>
          <p>Anyway, look, a couple really good questions there. Thanks for them. Number one, I've not finished my assessment of the needs for the company. I will say that a couple things have played out and been quite remarkable in my assessment of it.</p>
          <p>Having seen a number of other companies, Teva's footprint is most unusual. I think global footprint, extraordinary footprint, array of products, these things are extremely, extremely important to the company. Geographic dispersion as well as the capabilities that underlie not only its manufacturing, commercial but its generic research, very, very unusual. So I'm going to continue that process of looking at some of the needs. I will be coming back to you and talking about those and how they fit into an overall strategy a little later on in the year. My sense is that it would be premature for me to give you a comprehensive look.</p>
          <p>I will say, though, there's some very impressive aspects to the company, particularly and perhaps the striking note that I would say to you is having been in different companies, each company has a &#x2013; for want of a better word let's call it <mark type="ph" /> a full (32:36) and that really reflects the culture and the intent behind the people and I'd say that this aspect of Teva is second to none.</p>
          <p>Let me just turn briefly to your question about patent expiries and Copaxone. Look, first of all this is something that happens across the industry. Every single company experiences it. Different companies react differently to it. I would say that reacting to a single product patent expiry is part of the norm for every company and it's put in the context of an overall strategy for that company and part of that has been initiated by the company in the years gone by in the sense that the dependence on Copaxone has been sequentially reduced over the years in terms of its revenue to the company by virtue of dispersion across different geographies and the acquisition of some of the specialty products that it has.</p>
          <p>So some of the steps are there, there's lots of lessons to be learned from other companies that have dealt with patent expiry and we're going to go through that process as well. And I'm bringing some of those lessons with me as well. That's for sure.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everybody and I'd like to add my congratulations as Shlomo and his path forward and Jeremy Levin on joining Teva.</p>
          <p>A couple of questions if I may. Jeremy I think you're going to get a lot of those today but I understand from talking to some of your partners that you began to do an extensive process of review in the R&amp;D pipeline and given this is an area of strength for you, can you give us an idea about assets you're particularly excited about? And moreover there's been quite a debate for a while about whether or not Teva should have a higher level of branded R&amp;D and I just wonder if you have a thought &#x2013; if you came to an initial conclusion around that?</p>
          <p>Second, and it's a bit more of a couple of product specific questions, any first impression on QNASL support in the marketplace and the status of the tamper-resistant hydrocodone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just touch on the reviews. As I've said to you we're conducting an extensive review. This is not just of pipeline. It's across the board. It's the business. It's the &#x2013; in the different geographies. It's also the manufacturing footprint. It's the pipeline capabilities in R&amp;D capable and the individuals &#x2013; the people that we have. This is part of a normal process that any CEO does. It's not something unusual to what is undergoing at Teva. We've identified a number of different processes that we'll undergo to look at that and amongst those is a process to look hard at the pipeline.</p>
          <p>Now as you know, that pipeline was looked at last year and I think at this stage we're &#x2013; it's premature to say that there's any changes whatsoever from that, but I anticipate as Michael comes on board and works with me and others around the table we'll have a much clearer view of that a little later in the year.</p>
          <p>And as regards the other two products, I'll hand over to you, Bill.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Ronny. Just a quick follow-up on that, your &#x2013; with respect to QNASL, we had a great launch meeting. We were very excited about it. And of course the product didn't launch until March 23. So very early on, but we're &#x2013; again, we're very, very excited about the formulation and we think this is the right product and it's a very large market. So we're pretty excited about that.</p>

          <p>With respect to your second question on TD hydrocodone, that study, unfortunately, was a negative study. We actually got very good hydrocodone scores on our pain side, but quite unusually our placebo scored very well too, so we did not get significance, so that is a failed study at this point in time. I would &#x2013; but I would also add, Ronny, that the Nuvigil first study came back on bipolar and that was a positive study.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just a question on the fentanyl brands, Actiq and Fentora, so I think arguably it's a little bit more of a crowded competitive landscape at this time. We saw fentanyl sublingual spray launch recently. So can you talk about what you are doing there to defend that franchise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David (sic) [Traver], this is Bill Marth. With respect to that franchise right now we do have Fentora and we do have Actiq. The TD hydrocodone was going to be our next product in this market. Fentora is still a great product, still exclusive at this point in time but we had hopes for TD hydrocodone. We are going to reevaluate that, but right now there's no other addition for that particular portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And just moving to the generics business, so is there any additional color you can give us on generic pricing in the E.U. maybe particularly what countries you saw the largest pricing headwinds and maybe some countries that you saw better pricing than expected? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David (sic) [Traver]. This is Rob. Well what you're seeing in Europe is actually a combination effect that's stemming from the overall difficult macroeconomic environment. And the crisis has caused healthcare reforms basically all over but especially in the larger European markets and they are not only affecting pricing but also the overall commercial environment in Europe with all the conditions in there. What we see is that this impacts &#x2013; there has been strong pricing impact in countries like Spain, France, but also in there in some of the big markets what we see is that there is a reform going on and it's very difficult at this moment in time to really predict how it's going to roll out further.</p>
          <p>Reforms happen, changes in government are happening, the good news, though, is what we also see is that there is an underlying strength of Teva. We are in all of the European markets. Our geographic spread and also the diversified business help us to come through this. We really are very well-positioned and in some of the smaller markets in Europe we've seen really very good growth of generics. And so the markets in countries like Germany, France, Spain have gone from growth to no more growth or even sometimes negative but we see some very good developments in smaller countries, offset also some of the volume and price growth by new launches where we are &#x2013; have been quite successful.</p>
          <p>The one thing that is going to be very difficult to predict and I cannot do it at this moment in time, is how the economic environment is going to roll out further in the year in Europe.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I have two. First, can you elaborate a little bit more on your recent announcement of hiring Dr. Michael Hayden as head of R&amp;D and what Dr. Hayden brings to the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Corey, this is Jeremy. I assume the question is posed to me, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Look, I think one of the elements that is important as we look to the future of the company is to understand how we can leverage some of the assets that are internal in the company. And so couple things were important in thinking through who would be &#x2013; what was required.</p>
          <p>So number one, we have a number of dispersed assets in R&amp;D across the company. So I needed to bring together an organization that is currently geographically dispersed &#x2013; multiple sites, multiple different programs &#x2013; so that we can really get a clear handle on what it is that we most want to spend our money on. And with that in mind, this includes across the generics, across the generics R&amp;D and also, for want of a better term, is core branded R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>So I've known a number of different individuals across the industry who are people who are capable of leading this kind of a process. One of them &#x2013; there are a number certainly, they're rare. And amongst them, Michael brought a couple of qualities that I think made him outstanding. The first is that we're a company that's committed to medicine. And those medicines are not just medicines that are all start with an NCE. There are things that effectively are medicines that are generics, often, different kinds of approaches to providing a good medicine in different formulation. Michael understands this deeply and has a firm belief in the use of medicines as it applies to patients. So he has an understanding of how medicines apply to patients that's unique as a physician.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Michael, over the years, has had a track record of either working with or finding or developing himself or through companies that he's developed, interesting and very potent and very important medicines. And this has been a very unusual track record. And as you look into his background &#x2013; and I'm sure he'll have the opportunity to meet you all, and I'll make sure that he does &#x2013; you'll get a sense of exactly what this character of experience actually is.</p>
          <p>Coupled with that of course is that there's some deeply experienced people within Teva who have had the experience of developing products in the generic area and also in some of the branded area. And when you couple that with Michael's vision of what's required for patients, what's required for different marketplaces and his international background, and I'll repeat that, his international background. It's not just America; we are a global company and he has a deep understanding of the requirements across multiple societies. You have a very unusual combination of positive attributes which provide for an individual who can lead an organization, of a kind that is suited to Teva and particularly suited to the structure and types of medicine we produce. And perhaps I'll let Michael say one or two words.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Jeremy. I'm delighted &#x2013; I've just been on the job here at Teva a few hours, so I'm not going to comment too much about vision but rather just to say that the reason I was attracted to Teva is this is a very patient-focused company and the opportunity to think about products that range from all aspects going from target identification all the way through, through a life cycle of the drug both through its patent protected lifecycle and then its off-patent lifecycle gave me an opportunity to really think deeply and give me this opportunity to focus on the patient. And I think Teva's global footprint gives us an opportunity to think specifically about patients and patients' needs in specific geographic areas and so I'm thrilled to be part of this very imaginative and creative team.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, perfect. Thanks to both of you. Second quick one probably for Bill. I was a little surprised to see you settle for generic entry on Nuvigil in 2016, especially with what you just said about the first positive bipolar study. If you did a second study, is that still worth filing and commercializing given the timeframe of generic entry now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think so. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. That's all I had. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from David Buck of Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions for Jeremy. First, from an investor standpoint I think the expectation for this year was largely a pause in big deals and a focus on return of cash to shareholders. Can you talk about conceptually whether we should still be thinking that that's the case?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, if you look at Teva &#x2013; I know you're not done with your full strategic review but if you look at the patent cliff for generics and the waning of the U.S. patent expiries over the next few years, can you talk about your views on Europe in particular as a way to offset some of the potential slowdown in the U.S.? Does the strategy make sense and are we seeing that as an offset to that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So perhaps I'm not quite understanding the question. Let me understand it, so I'm going to repeat your question and then just tell me if I've got this right. The second one was really given the patent cliff diminution and therefore the reduction on Paragraph IV type products, does this mean that we should be focusing elsewhere and in particular as what you've described in Europe? Is that the question &#x2013; the second half of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess more simply does the Europe &#x2013; diversification into Europe in particular make sense given the pricing environment and the outlook for the next couple years in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it does make sense. And so I think this is a global company. We look at opportunities in each of the different marketplaces and I think we would be wise to consider all of these marketplaces with our footprint in the future. So I certainly envision that. Let me perhaps give some of the color of that back to Shlomo because some of the thinking was taking place previously, or perhaps two or one of the two of you should handle that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeremy, and David, thank you for the question because I think it's a good opportunity to explain that what you see in Europe and maybe in some other countries where you are under price pressure, may create a kind of a short-term thinking on the future of generics.</p>
          <p>So first of all, let's look at Europe. So there's 400 million inhabitants, aging population, high need for life standards and very huge economic pressure. Definitely they are going to end by getting &#x2013; or having more generics. The level of the current generics penetration in Europe is still below the U.S., which is almost 80. In Europe the average is about 50 and in certain big countries even below that number. So it's a fiscally important market for the future of the generics business.</p>
          <p>I can make the same point for Japan where the government of Japan just last month, as part of their view on that, made a decision to increase their support in generics in order to increase the level of penetration in Japan to 35%. Previously they were aiming for 30%. And you can just tell that, that they are giving incentives for pharmacies to sell more generics. This is a world trend. Generics business is &#x2013; has a future out of United States not less than in United States. In United States of course the business is going into a kind of a transformation once the &#x2013; what you call the patent cliff is going to arrive, but that's mainly by 2015. And by this time our businesses around the world will be such that it would be compensate, or actually will get us another force for growth and stability in the business &#x2013; and so in the generics business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe &#x2013; this is Eyal, maybe I'll take the question about our shareholders return. As you remember, we have announced a pretty comprehensive program for shareholder return, increased our dividend last quarter by 25% and continued with this run rate this quarter. In the first quarter we have executed a little over $0.5 billion in share buybacks and we believe that we are going to be very disciplined with capital allocation and will examine the opportunities every quarter and come back to you when we report at the end of the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So for Jeremy, I have an industry question for you, just looking for your view on companies being diverse in terms of geographic mix and business mix as opposed to more of a focused model. And maybe you can attack that from both an operational standpoint as well as a stock price standpoint and how that influences your thoughts on to be diverse or not to be diverse. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that's kind of an important question. I think you're trying &#x2013; if the word diverse means different kinds of products or different from different kinds of geographies, let me address the geography aspect because that's really perhaps from an industry perspective the most important. Certain companies have a significant advantage in North America where they have a predominant one kind of product that really is the most important in that class and that marketplace and they don't tend to diversify out of those areas.</p>
          <p>However, Teva, amongst others, in fact has looked at the demography of the middle classes and those who are able to consume medicines around the world, and if you look at that demography, what you are see are trends that Shlomo alluded to, which are extremely favorable in many different parts of the world outside of America where often people are not able to consume the same kinds of medicines that are consumed in America for a number of different reasons, either they aren't launched there or in fact culturally they don't take them.</p>
          <p>I view the &#x2013; if you look at the growth over the next 10 years, the predominant growth in markets will be outside of the United States and Europe, but that doesn't mean one can't win and be successful in those markets, playing an exceptionally good game. And the goal for Teva is to play in all these markets so that we can actually leverage our size, our skill and definitely our cultural ability. This is not &#x2013; you can't &#x2013; this is a multinational company with a cultural diversity which is most unusual that allows us to understand whether you're in Chile or whether you're in Japan how to actually access the marketplace. And I think that in those &#x2013; thinking about the modern companies of the future you should be asking the question, in my mind, how do people, how do companies, how do organizations address growth outside and both bridge the gap of addressing growth outside of the major markets as they exist today and prepare and be ready to take advantage of the predicted and likely growth in the other marketplaces?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And one more on the people angle, as you meet with those talented and proud people around the company and once you get past them trying to impress the boss theme, are there certain themes that come up consistently that you sort of try to explore, be them good ones or bad ones, as the company's become quite large and it's changed quite a bit over the past decade or so? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You know it's &#x2013; this is one of the fun things that you do. Each time you go through this you try and understand where are the solid foundations of any company. I'd say to you that the &#x2013; given the growth trajectory of the company over the last 10 years, that trajectory is nearly unparalleled. And what that has occasioned is the development of an enormous amount of resilience and determination to either, when problems crop up, to fix them, or in fact to, in a very spirited fashion, to be aggressive in trying to succeed in their business goals. And you have to dig down below that because, as you rightly point out, as the boss walks around, they ask themselves how can they impress the boss.</p>
          <p>Well, the kind of questions that I'm asking are just talk to me about &#x2013; tell me what's really bothering you. What's your strategy, open ended question which allows me to drill down a little bit lower and get a sense of who these people actually are. And it's my sense of, overwhelmingly, that you have incredibly committed people and people that, when given the opportunity to solve problems, will absolutely solve those problems in a very concerted and across border fashion, which is a little different from many other organizations I've seen where you tend to find people who are much more siloed than we are here.</p>
          <p>So there are a number of strengths there that I think will play very well to an organized focus, highly efficient, highly strategic approach, which I hope we'll be able to roll out to you later on in the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question. And Shlomo, good luck to you in your future endeavors. First, I'd just like to ask, can you please just provide an update for us on the European consolidation landscape? We see the headlines for the larger acquisition. Is there anything going on still, more on the regional levels, for some of the secondary manufacturers with smaller shares and how there are pricing/staying in business? Or is there more consolidation going on there?</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't really see &#x2013; this is Rob. Thanks for the question, Frank. I don't see &#x2013; well, obviously, there's now Watson, Actavis, but for the rest, I don't see anything of the more consolidation going on at the moment. And frankly, it is also not something that we are particularly worried about in that sense. We are really well positioned. At some point, Europe is going to come back. There's a huge number of patients that could benefit from generics and we are in all 29 markets. And almost always leading, clearly leading in Europe. So for us, we're well positioned to use the momentum when it comes back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then just shifting, I appreciated very much the comments on R&amp;D earlier, but if I can just ask the question in a little different way. I typically think of generic companies spending approximately 6% on R&amp;D, branded or specialty pharma companies spending somewhere in the teens. When I look at Teva's spend in the quarter, given that you have greater than 40% of revenue coming from the branded side, what can we expect as far as an R&amp;D commitment? Or are there enough projects currently out there for Teva to spend enough to have sort of the historical sustainable branded pharmaceutical franchises? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is Eyal, maybe I'll put some light on the R&amp;D spend from the quarter, which was lighter than planned. And I can strive to say that you could expect to see increased R&amp;D spending later on in the year. But this quarter was a special quarter. Some of the R&amp;D spending reduction was due to the currency. I mentioned that earlier it was a very long time ago, but before we had that break, I'm sorry. But some of the reduction in cost was due to exchange rate as a lot of R&amp;D spending is done in Israel, some in Eastern Europe, part of the generic work that we do there. So that has an impact. And we made very good progress on the integration and the synergy with Cephalon. Still combining the two organizations together is taking a bit of time and we will definitely see an increase in the run rate of R&amp;D spending later on this year and probably in the following year.</p>
          <p>Jeremy, Michael, you want to add something on R&amp;D?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah just, I have a couple of views on that. Number one, who said that the level that you are citing is the right level for either the branded or the other? That's just historical. The question is not that. The question is what is the focus &#x2013; what are the right kinds of monies to be spending on the right kind of projects. And that's what we're going to do here. To fix the &#x2013; my sense of the industry and I'm sure that of yours is that there are a tremendous number of overlapping projects across the industry &#x2013; people spending a lot of money on those. And whether it be 16%, 20%, 19%, 21%, the issue is much more how are you spending your money? And what are you spending it on?</p>
          <p>So as Michael enters into the role and as we look at our company and ask the question, what are we going to invest and how are we going to invest? These questions will be dealt with in the context of an overall corporate strategy that allows a company like ours which is a very unique animal &#x2013; not the same as others &#x2013; not to be bucketed in any one. But much more focused around how do we take our R&amp;D &#x2013; that is the Teva R&amp;D and invest with a terrific return on investment which is our goal.</p>
          <p>And recognizing that some projects that are multi-tens of hundreds of millions of dollars in the large pharmaceutical companies fail often, we're not really looking to try and emulate that. At the same time we've had a lot of experience of investing small amounts of money in small projects in generics and have had a tremendous return on investment.</p>
          <p>So there's a balance and it's very appropriate. Each company must carve its own route but I can assure you I don't feel that we should be held to the standards that have been held for other companies to date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may add to that just to help you to read Teva's numbers. If you bear in mind that we have no discovery, so we have no any investment right now in discovery. And you split the company between the generic activities and the branded activities you may find that we are quite in the norm that you're used to compare companies.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Maybe just a couple of functional questions &#x2013; less strategic. First for Eyal, specifically on the DSAs and the impact that had on the quarter I'm assuming that basically you've entered new agreements and you pay a fee for better visibility into channel pipeline inventory and chose to reduce pipeline inventory to levels more consistent with where you want the business to be going forward. Am I reading that correctly?</p>
          <p>And then a follow-up question for Bill, if you could just maybe update us on the Irvine, California Injectable business, kind of where that is in terms of returning to market. I mean it looks like you've been able to take advantage of a couple product shortage situations and pricing definitely seems to have been &#x2013; have kind of gone in your favor. But maybe just give us an update there in terms of where you stand currently relative to prior goals? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Elliot, this is Bill Marth. I'll try to do a two-for. So let's start out with the DSAs. I think the first thing we want to do is level set that everybody knows that the DSAs are the Distribution Service Agreements and those are with the primary wholesalers in the U.S. that hold the majority of the branded business that moves through the channel. And most of that business, of course, passes through them, and they're all in the range of $100 billion companies with very, very thin margins, in the range of 2%.</p>
          <p>And so when you think about their business model, the ability for them or the desire for them to grab inventory sometimes, hold on to that inventory and wait for the price appreciation or price increases is part of their model in order to drive benefits for them. So we were seeking a solution this last year. It took most of the year for us to be able to get better benefits for Teva with respect to price increases. When we take a price increase we want to be able to get an impact from that price increase and we were finding it was taking long &#x2013; way too long to get impact on the price increase because obviously the wholesalers were holding on to inventory and they were taking that benefit.</p>
          <p>We were able to work out an agreement with all the major wholesalers where we were to pay them a different fee, so they got a more predictable fee, which is something they wanted, which is steady, predictable income. And what we got for Teva was the ability for the &#x2013; for a price increase. We now can bill them for all price appreciation or all price increases immediately when we do that price increase. So we'll get the immediate benefit from this.</p>
          <p>This will have dramatic &#x2013; it does impact the pipeline, but it has great value for us over the years. So it was a great deal for Teva and we think it was a good deal for the wholesalers as well. Now you think about the dynamics that draw down inventory here because now wholesalers gets paid on a fee basis, but doesn't get the price appreciation, they're going to carry what they need in the channel and it's very important for them to carry just what they need in the channel and this applies to all the branded business.</p>
          <p>So we're real happy with the way those agreements went off. That was the first one. The second one with respect to Irvine, is again we're consciously optimistic about Irvine. We hope to have all the lines up by the end of the summer and we have recently had an inspection there. We were very pleased with that inspection. It did &#x2013; we did &#x2013; were issued a two-item 483, but relatively minor, we think addressable and so we will be addressing those 483s probably later this week and then ask for the lifting of the warning letter.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first for Jeremy, perhaps a conceptual question along the lines of R&amp;D, you've obviously had experience across the drug industry. Do you think or when you think about Teva and into your new role broadly as a fully integrated company, obviously now, the company does not engage in drug discovery, is your expectation to sort of increase that capability, perhaps that drug discovery at the stage at which projects are brought in house or do you expect to be much more focused on business development and late stage product acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Douglas, I wasn't quite hearing the questions clear, so let me repeat it and see if I got it right. Do I envision Teva having much more of a discovery-based R&amp;D, versus a late-stage acquisition of product, late-stage pipeline acquisition? Is that, am I interpreting your question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, more broadly, sort of do you envision sort of eventually building a fully integrated model or do you anticipate to continue to be much more focused on sort of late-stage project acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I &#x2013; let's talk generally because this will require Michael's rolling it out and showing you what we're going to be doing, but in general, there's no reason to suppose that the models that have existed in the pharmaceutical industry and in the generics industry are not interchangeable in some degree, but that being said, there's also no reason to suppose that the so-called integrated approach that has been adopted by the pharmaceutical industry is one which has been tremendously successful, one way or another.</p>
          <p>It's clear, however, two elements are crucial. Number one, you do need to have in any organization, a knowledgeable and thoughtful capability within the company that understands the language required to either diligence or in fact to integrate projects, whether they be Phase III, Phase I or in discovery, no matter what. Or whether they be a new formulation being offered by an outside third party or developed by yourself.</p>
          <p>So whatever you decide to do, there is no such model that will be successful unless you have at least &#x2013; unless you have at least some capability internally to interpret what you're doing on the outside. That being said, the other aspect that any company today, a modern company must understand is that across the world, there are literally hundreds of thousands of people generating interesting research, whether they are in academic centers, biotech companies, other pharmaceutical companies or indeed, other organizations, and in that regard, you must have the ability to be strategic and decisive in your ability to pull in things that meet your strategy. Perhaps, Michael, you'd like to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's early to comment in detail, but just to say that certainly as part of this initiative going forward, we're very open and interested in fostering novel relationships, both with academia as well as small biotechs. We recognize that many targets, many targets &#x2013; validated targets are available in numerous places and we want to foster these relationships and just generally have an interchange that allows us to learn more about what's happening in these communities, both in Israel and around the world. So I think we're &#x2013; I'm coming to this with a very open mind and certainly want to increase the pace of the dialogue with many nontraditional groups, but these include academic groups and small biotechs in different parts of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just Bill, one clarification in terms of Irvine, you indicated that there were a couple of 483s, you expect to address them and then soon thereafter, have the warning letter lifted. Once the warning letter is lifted, what should we expect in terms of the sequence in terms of bringing all the lines back to production at that site?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, this is Bill Marth. I think actually it's my hope we'll have all lines up before the &#x2013; about the same time that the warning letter lifts. The warning letter's important for a couple reasons. I mean, for us this has been a very, very difficult role and so we'd be very pleased to have that removed for all the hard work people have done in Irvine and I think to some degree we'll begin to ease the shortage here in the U.S. So we'd be thrilled about that.</p>
          <p>And then the second piece of course is approvals, and that's helpful. And I would just add and none of this by the way &#x2013; none of this stops the fact that we are ongoing and working hard to move products to G&#xF6;d&#xF6;ll&#x151; as well. G&#xF6;d&#xF6;ll&#x151; we had an inspection earlier this quarter as well and received no 483s. So we are hopeful that we can move forward with that facility as well and getting the EIR on that facility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then do have a backlog of new products approvals waiting for Irvine?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A few things. First on these distribution agreements. I just want to make sure I understand that all the pain has been felt with respect to the numbers. Like in the second quarter we don't have any more of an issue. How much of a change did we take these down in the channel? Where was inventory levels in the channel? How many weeks out there?</p>
          <p>Second, Eyal, can you talk about the gross margin. Is this a new range for gross margin or is this just kind of an unusual thing in the first quarter that's going to get back below 60 for the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>And can you talk about Japan a little bit? Shlomo, you mentioned 35%. When is the government pointing to the 35% penetration? And then also just talk about your business in Japan and how it did this quarter.</p>
          <p>And good luck also from me too, Shlomo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marc, I'll take the question first. The weeks of inventory. It all depends on per product. I can't tell you specifically how many weeks of inventory they'll have. If you think about it now, they're incentivized to keep the most efficient number of weeks per product, right? So depending on the dynamics of that product, say something like a ProAir, it'll move up and down with the season so they would probably keep a few more days of that than they would something else. For Provigil and new Nuvigil we manage somewhere between 13 to 15 days. Copaxone generally in the 20 days, in the 20-ish range, it could go anywhere from say 22 to 27 days. So it all depends. It's the wholesalers' decision on how much inventory to keep. That's the key. It's not my decision how much inventory to keep. They will keep what's there, to be efficient, and that's what's important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The question on the gross margins, and I think we delivered very healthy gross margins this quarter. This quarter is always a question of product mix, on whether you do generic and where are the generics coming from. Base is different than new launches and Europe is different than the rest of the world, than Latin America and Eastern European countries. So the mix is changing with the moving parts of the business, but I think it's a healthy gross margin, but we're not ready to talk about guidance today. We have established this early on in the call, but there shouldn't be any major changes to the spreads going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the Japan part, and first of all I would like to say that we are in line with our plants in Japan. We are very satisfied with the pace of the integration. As I said before, we are integrating there four different kinds of activities that we have in Japan and definitely the last year acquisition of Taiyo and the acquisition of our partner shares in the previous joint venture with the Kowa company. All those aligned with the plans and basically to give more color on that, we are working on three different angles of that integration.</p>
          <p>The first one is the go-to-market and as I said, on April 1 we launched our new face to the Japanese market under the name <mark type="ph" /> Teva Saicou (1:15:24) has been well perceived and we believe that, that will enhance our sales in Japan and will promote our brand name, which is very good in Japan.</p>
          <p>The second one is of course the typical classical synergies exercise where we believe there is room to continue our efforts there. We have a plan and that will definitely improve our profitability in Japan.</p>
          <p>And the last one of course is to take advantage of our back integration with the Teva Pharmaceutical APIs where part of the product there are in the process of switching to Teva's API. That is by definition a time consuming process. It's long, from one year to two years. Following all this realigns our working in parallel and we are very optimistic about this move and the achievements in Japan.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my questions. Two big ones, first, which were the areas where you see a potential acceleration in the coming quarters? Could it be women's health, respiratory or even U.S. generics for any other segment?</p>
          <p>And the follow up this one, could we have some color on how you see the quarterly performance as you did during the last call and is an acceleration in Q4 still realistic? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>First of all regarding the area of economic development we have &#x2013; when we talk about Europe and I think that anybody can predict that it'll stabilize our eastern European and our emerging markets are doing fine. We have the second quarter in a row with our generic business is doing very well so you look at many of the parts of the world where we operate we have something to hope for.</p>
          <p>Regarding the quarterly progression, I think we have established early on in this call that we are not going to address guidance today. Once Jeremy Levin completes the business evaluation and assessment of course we'll go back and discuss what we believe and what we see.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>For Europe this is &#x2013; we have launched Zoely in three countries. We are about to launch in the fourth in the next couple of weeks and for instance in woman's health in Spain we started this activity a good 14 months ago and we're now number two in the Spanish market. So, so far we see very good dynamics with Zoely, which is really a fantastic new oral contraceptive, a fully natural product. Doctors and patients alike are very happy with this product and so are we with the result so far.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and I would add to that. Across our brands we see strength in all our brands and we're excited about that. Copaxone still &#x2013; even though we've had the entry of Gilenya, we did expect Copaxone to tail off this year a bit. We've been as planned, but we still have 40.2% share in the U.S. market so it's been an excellent product and we are the global leader. So Copaxone still continues to do well but we're also excited about new launches like QNASL we talked about earlier in the call in addition to our respiratory franchise. Qvar's grown very nicely. Prescriptions are up around 25% over last year; doing very, very well. Nuvigil's been an exciting product for us. Growth there 10% in TRxs, and we've got almost 50% of the wakefulness market with Nuvigil. So a strong showing there. But so if you go across our brands, just we're very excited about the growth.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could add on the OTCs, in this quarter we grow by local currency terms, OTC by 10%, and that should be considered as organic growth due to the fact that we're still don't launch or have a joint venture product that will come later and we are starting to plan. Our next move is in that area based on our partner, Procter &amp; Gamble, stronger branded products in certain parts of the world where we believe it <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:20:36). You are going to see that by the later times of the year. So this is an area for definitely a big future, but again, don't forget it from any kind of numbers or guidance point of view, I'm just pointing where the business is going to evolve in the coming future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me? Hello?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A few questions for Bill. Bill, just first on generic pulmicort, this has obviously been a nice steady contributor for you guys and as we look at the next filers advancing through, I think there's a trial in early 2013; can you talk to us about your base case assumptions for when you see the current exclusive market dynamic eroding over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jason, that's a great question. But we know that's a market that's going to be tough to get into. Right now, there's still a litigation pathway one has to go through as well as approval. We think &#x2013; we are cautiously optimistic. It's a bit off, but even if we get competition in this space, this is going to remain an important product for Teva for a couple of years to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up, just on the DSAs, maybe if we can just think about it in terms of Copaxone. If you can talk about maybe what that $180 million headwind meant to Copaxone this quarter? And how we should we think about the price increases moving forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. The impact on Copaxone was approximately $120 million of the $180 million and that was the biggest single piece and about $50 million on the respiratory franchise; about $25 million on ProAir and about $25 million on Qvar. So it's in those ranges.</p>
          <p>As far as price increases, obviously we never, Jason, talk about price increases before we do them, but the impact here or the value here for us is the fact that now when we take these price increases we'll be able to realize that benefit immediately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So more than the 50% historically?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question, and good luck Shlomo and congratulations, Jeremy. So the first question is for Eyal and Bill, I guess you &#x2013; I know you don't want to talk about guidance for 2012, but versus your expectations, clearly you missed consensus expectations on revenue versus your expectations apart from the currency impact, how would you characterize your revenue performance this quarter?</p>
          <p>And then second, Jeremy, a question for you, and we know you haven't had time to think through your complete strategy and you've talked a lot about the opportunities that may present to Teva, but I guess could you give us some understanding on your view on the challenges that you see for the company as well? How confident are you that the company can maintain growth with the genericization of Copaxone? And can it or should investors be re-basing expectations on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Shibani. It's Eyal. I'll only take the first one. Yes, you're right, we will not provide any guidance or address the guidance, but I will not avoid the question on the foreign exchange impact. Compared to the rates that prevailed when we laid our plans, we see a significant shift in exchange rate. I would estimate that this would reduce the total sales for the year by between $650 million to $700 million with a very, very limited impact on bottom line, if at all. Part of that, of course, we've already seen in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Eyal, sorry, just if I can push you, when you gave guidance last quarter you clearly said that consensus was probably not getting quarter one correct, and I guess my question is more versus your expectations for this quarter, are you &#x2013; did results come in in line with what you expected in terms of the DSAs, etcetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We never have an expectation on the exchange rate impact because we can't predict them. As you know, we're not hedging our top line. We're hedging only the balance sheet &#x2013; the balance sheet ramifications, but while we have a very balanced model, which as you've seen, the reduction in sales for the quarter were very similar to the reduction in expenses. So our profit has not been influenced by that, and that's what my expectation for the future. But as to trying to guess an exchange rate, I don't think we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shibani, this is Bill Marth. Just one more point on the DSA. I think you ask a good question, that if you know you're going to put DSAs into place, you know ahead of the time of the quarter what the impact of the DSAs will be. But you have to remember two things, which I try to repeat on this pulpit so people understand.</p>
          <p>Number one, we put the DSAs in place, but the wholesalers then decide product by product how much inventory they want to keep. So therefore the true total impact, I can have estimates, but &#x2013; and my estimates were not. The market reacts &#x2013; the change in inventory was more than I had anticipated and that was two reasons. The wholesalers, they're the ones who know how much inventory they want to carry and so they have to make that very specific choice.</p>
          <p>The second piece was part of the negotiation. These are very, very tough negotiations. You don't go back to a wholesaler, as you know, very important people to us and our partners, and say I want to take money back from you. So when you do that, it's a tough negotiation. In this negotiation in particular with Amerisource &#x2013; we pushed very hard and ended up into a position where we pulled their existing DSA and we had no visibility to the product they had in the pipeline. So they were buying in the blind from our perspective. So we weren't able to track with that inventory. Once we lifted that and we negotiated the new DSA with them, there was a little bit more inventory there than I had hoped for. But other than that, you just have to tie back to they decide how much inventory they keep.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you. And then Jeremy?</p>

          <p>Shibani, hi. A couple of things. Look, Teva is faced with challenges that are similar to many other organizations in the industry. These challenges are not hidden from anybody. You know them probably better than I do at times, because you've studied them for a lot longer in some senses. That being said, I would say to you that the advantages that Teva has in facing these difficulties, whether they be pricing in Europe, whether they be penetrating different geographies, whether they be increased competition, etcetera, have the potential to outweigh the decision fees and the headwinds that we and others face.</p>
          <p>So our manufacturing footprint, our geographic footprint, our diversity of product lines, all of these represent opportunities to mitigate and/or potentially to obviate the headwinds that us and others face &#x2013; I'm more focused on what we face.</p>
          <p>As regards Copaxone I'm &#x2013; the sum of these advantages are what we should look at and ask the question can they mitigate against what is the norm in this industry for loss of a particular product? So I am much more focused right now in asking that kind of a question than I am &#x2013; and I have very &#x2013; I have a high degree of confidence based on what I've seen that this is a terrific company that will be able to weather its way through what is the norm in the industry.</p>
