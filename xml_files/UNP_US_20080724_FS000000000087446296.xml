        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Rob Knight, our CFO; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales; and Dennis Duffy, Executive Vice President of Operations.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to announce today Union Pacific overcame the challenges of widespread flooding in the Midwest, record high diesel fuel prices and a soft economy, to post second quarter earnings of $1.02 per share, a 24% increase over 2007. Quarterly operating income was a record 931 million in the quarter, up 18%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the drivers of our quarterly performance, the discussion has to start with fuel. Fuel became UP's largest expense category in the second quarter as prices increased more than 60% compared to a year ago.</p>
          <p>Rob will talk to you more about the flooding impact on our financials. But it did reduce quarterly earnings by about a nickel. Our dedicated employees quickly restored service to customers as they overcame the challenges associated with operating a 32,000 mile factory without a roof.</p>
          <p>UP's franchise diversity is a great strength and we demonstrated that again in the second quarter. Americans are spending more to fill their gas tanks leaving fewer dollars available to purchase consumer goods. In fact, The Conference Board's June Consumer Confidence Index reached its lowest level since February 1992.</p>
          <p>The effect of less confidence in the economy and reduced discretionary income is reflected in our lower quarterly loadings in Automotive, Industrial Products and Intermodal. The offset to consumer weakness is strong demand for our bulk commodities. Driven by growth in coal, grain, and fertilizer, our Agriculture, Chemicals, and Energy groups each posted positive volumes in the quarter. And growth in those areas was pacing even stronger before flooding impacted our Midwest operations. In fact, in April and May total car loadings were running about flat to a year ago before finishing the quarter down 3%. So we clearly lost some of our upside in the month of June.</p>
          <p>Despite lower volume, our second quarter operating revenue was a best ever 4.6 billion. Strong pricing and increased fuel cost recoveries both contributed to the gain. Operationally we had a strong quarter. Dennis will talk to you through a few of the key metrics, but we had 'best evers' in a number of areas despite the flooding challenge. That operational fluidity not only contributed to good cost efficiency in the quarter, but also drove record customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Overall, we turned in a solid second quarter performance despite a number of obstacles and we are looking forward to further profitability gains in the quarters ahead.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn it over to Jack to discuss our second quarter revenue. Jack?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Our second quarter freight revenue increased 13% to a record 4.3 billion even though continued economic softness and severe flooding held our volumes 3% below a year ago. The revenue growth was driven by improved average revenue per car for each of our six commodity groups. Four of the six businesses posted their best ever revenues. Intermodal came close to having a second quarter record and only the Automotive business failed to set a new record, as our revenues in that business were down 9%.</p>
          <p>At the same time, customer satisfaction again showed year-over-year improvement. Last month's Midwest flooding along with the flooding in the Powder River Basin in late May clearly affected our second quarter volume with the greatest impact in our coal business. Overall, our volume was tracking flat to last year through April and May, would likely have come a lot closer to finishing there had it not been for the floods. We estimate that the flood cost us around 40,000 loads but the good news is we think that we can probably recover some of that as we go through the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Three groups, our auto business, Intermodal and Industrial Products saw volumes decline for the quarter. Our Automotive volume fell 20% with the American Axle strike driving about two-thirds of that decline and the balance resulting from decreased production by the big four auto manufacturers.</p>
          <p>The economic softness also showed up in our Industrial Products results where volumes were down 1%. A drop in West Coast port volumes was keeping our Intermodal business kind of sluggish, but most of that volume decline was driven by some competitive losses and the impact of the flood-related embargo.</p>
          <p>The biggest volume offset was an 11% improvement in Ag products helped by a continued strong grain market. There is also plenty of demand out there for coal where volume was up 2% despite the floods. Our Chemical car loadings grew 1% as the strength in our fertilizer business offset the impact of economic softness in other segments such as liquid and dry, and our domestic plastics business.</p>
          <p>So this morning what I would like to do, is take you just a little more intently on Ag products, Energy and our Industrial Products business, talk a little bit about the highlights we had there in our second quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Ag products once again, Ag products posted the largest revenue gain with an 11% growth in volume combining with a 16% improvement in average revenue per car to drive a 29% increase in revenue. As in the first quarter, worldwide demand for grain and a weak US dollar created a strong export market for feed grains and wheat. Both saw volumes grow significantly in all three export markets, the Pacific Northwest, the Gulf, and Mexico. Overall, feed grain exports grew 71% in the quarter and wheat exports were up 47%.</p>
          <p>While narrowed margins and tight credit are stressed in the ethanol market, our ethanol markets continued to grow quite well. Our ethanol shipments were up 25% in the second quarter and we saw a 14% increase in DDGs [Dried Distillers Grains].</p>
          <p>For the second half of the year, the majority of the flood-related damage occurred in Eastern Iowa and Southern Illinois, which are not significant UP grain origins. So we are really not expecting to see a big impact on our grain volumes for the rest of the year. And in fact with worldwide demand for grain, for meat, and poultry, and the growth in our produce rail express trains, we expect our Ag business is going to show continued strength throughout the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Energy became our first business to top $900 million in revenue for a quarter, as our revenue grew 21% driven by a 19% improvement in average revenue per car and a 2% volume growth. Although both major segments of this market, the Southern Powder River Basin in our Colorado-Utah zones set productivity records for tons per train. Weather-related disruptions resulted in the somewhat modest growth against last year's volumes, which incidentally were also impacted by some severe weather.</p>
          <p>Southern Powder River Basin volume grew 4%. May loadings were hindered by mine flooding late in the month and June volumes of course were impacted by the Midwest flooding that curtailed shipments to the east as well as in Iowa and around St Louis.</p>
          <p>Chart shows you however that in July we pretty much put that disruption behind us and we are running strong. Production issues, utility outages and the St Louis floods led to a 3% decline in Colorado-Utah tonnage.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the rest of the year, Colorado-Utah looks like it's going to be up about 3% for the year and we're still shooting for 5% growth out of the SPRB [Southern Powder River Basin]. With continued strong demand the real wild card for us is going to be the ability of the tight supply chain to have some opportunity to make up some of the loads that were missed as a result of the flooding here in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>A 10% improvement in average revenue per car enabled Industrial Products to grow revenue 9% to almost $900 million even as volume declined 1%. With weak demand resulting from the ongoing slump in the housing market leading to mill closures our lumber shipments declined even further in the second quarter falling 25% below last year.</p>
          <p>The impact of a weak construction market also showed up in our cement business, combining with the rain in the Midwest to drive volumes down about 11%. But Industrial Products is our most diverse business group and there was some good news that helped to offset some of the overall volume declines. For instance, our steel shipments increased 20% as the weak dollar limited steel imports, creating a stronger domestic market and inventory replenishment across the United States. The worldwide demand for scrap and finished steel caused scrap prices to double since the end of last year and drove a 17% increase in our ferrous scrap volumes.</p>
          <p>Favorable weather in Texas combined with pent-up demand from the first quarter weather issues drove a 6% increase in rock shipments.</p>
          <p>And, as we discussed in Chicago, where wind Energy business is expanding by leaps and bounds we are continuing the conversion to unit trains. We had two unit train movements of wind power components starting up late in the quarter, one moving from Mexico to the Pacific Northwest and another set from California to Texas.</p>
          <p>Over the second half of 2008 we are looking to wind along with opportunities in other Energy- related markets like frac sand and pipe and continued strong demand in steel to help us offset the soft housing-related markets which are showing at this point in time virtually no recovery.</p>
          <p>So as we look to the rest of 2008, we are expecting that our strongest businesses will be those that led the way through the first half mainly Ag products and Energy. Chemicals, which have run slightly ahead of last year so far, should stay solid for us. As I highlighted earlier Industrial Products is kind of a mixed bag but we think there is potentially enough upside opportunity to offset the continued weakness in lumber and other markets. Domestic Intermodal and our Automotive parts won't be big growth drivers over the last year. But they should hold their own with volumes pretty much unchanged from 2007.</p>
          <p>So that leaves us with Automotive vehicles and international Intermodal and at this point in time we really don't see anything that's going to jump start vehicle volumes. GM's announcement last week was only the most recent reminder of the troubles in the Automotive sector as they deal with both the soft economy and changing consumer preferences. In international Intermodal West Coast imports have been down, the soft economy looks like we are going to have a fairly mild peak season.</p>
          <p>If you put it all together we expect overall volume in the third quarter is probably going to be down in that 1 to 2% range versus last year. For the full year it looks like we'll still be down around 1% reflecting a relatively soft first half and our expectation that the economic doldrums are probably going to continue through the second half. But as we did in the first half we will offset the volume softness with price. We'll wrap up the year with a core price improvement in that 5 to 6% range and that should continue to drive top line growth through the end of the year.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it over to Dennis for the operations update.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Jack, and good morning. For the operating team the second quarter was a study in contrasts. We made significant progress in April and May to improve the efficiency and reliability of the network, only to have Mother Nature set us back with the Midwest flooding in June. Despite these challenges, we continued to operate a safer network in the quarter, in particular with train crossing incidents and derailments.</p>
          <p>Productivity was the real story line for us in the quarter as we made strong gains in virtually every category. Employee productivity as measured by gross ton miles per employee improved 3% in the quarter. Through freight train starts were down 4% and yard and local starts declined 5% year-over-year with only a 1% decline in gross ton miles.</p>
          <p>Another important driver of our operating performance in the second quarter was our network resiliency. We faced a number of weather-related disruptions on our northern region beginning in late May. But unlike the mudslide in Oregon, these outages hit us right in the heart of the railroad:</p>
          <p>the Red-X, which is the densest part of the network, and in fact at its worst our Central corridor was closed for 10 days. Fortunately we came into this flooding situation with a very fluid network.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter we experienced a total of 54 network interruption days, nine more than last year. Now, some of you might have expected a bigger difference but you will recall that we had flooding last year around the Kansas City area and in Texas.</p>
          <p>Our recovery from the flooding was much fast this year than last, in part from the continuous improvement principles we applied and from lessons learned. We took an innovative approach establishing a coordinated redesign of the transportation plan that allowed us to maximize the efficiency of alternate routes. We utilized the permitting process to control the flow of business onto our network: this allowed us to isolate the impact of the flooding to the Northern region.</p>
          <p>Our engineering team did a great job of pre-positioning resources so we could immediately start work to reopen the lines after the water receded. This involved rescheduling some of our work gangs, giving us extra resources in affected areas, while reducing the maintenance impact on other parts of our network. In addition, investments that we made over the last couple of years to harden our rail infrastructure and add capacity and surge resources greatly improved the resiliency of our network.</p>
          <p>The end result of these efforts can be seen in the chart at the bottom left where we improved our quarterly velocity by over 1 mile per hour versus last year. And if you look at our velocity on a weekly basis, you can see more clearly the improvements we've made. We had a nice pick-up in velocity through the quarter averaging 23.5 miles per hour in the month of May, our best monthly velocity in five years. Importantly, since we have moved beyond the major flooding issues, velocity has rebounded quickly and we are running at nearly 24 miles per hour today.</p>
          <p>Our other key operating metrics, inventory and terminal dwell, both improved in a challenging environment. We are translating greater network fluidity into better operating efficiency and service reliability as shown by the charts on the right. Freight car utilization, which measures the days between originated carloads, was a second quarter best at 9.5 days.</p>
          <p>As we've improved our system velocity recrew rates also improved, declining more than two points year-over-year. To put this in perspective, one point of improvement saves us over a 100 train and engine employees.</p>
          <p>Jack shared with you the high marks that our customers are giving us on their satisfaction surveys. Internally we are also setting new records as our service delivery index, which we use to measure customer service commitments, improved nearly 10% versus last year and set a monthly record in May. So, across the board we are improving operationally. We are consistently executing our transportation plan which is driving greater overall efficiency and reliability.</p>
          <p>Looking to the back half of '08 the operating team will continue to execute on the principles that have driven the improvements year-to-date. Safety remains our priority and we'll continue with implementing total safety culture across the railroad. Summer is the peak maintenance season for our railroad. Our challenge is to accomplish these major programs and continue to achieve the necessary throughput to improve service. We expect continued productivity from our structured approach to asset utilization and cost control, and customers will see greater service reliability across all of our business segments.</p>
          <p>With that I will turn it over to Rob for the numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. We'll start off with a quick look at our income statement. Second quarter operating revenue was $4.6 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year. Operating expenses increased 12% in the quarter, driven entirely by higher fuel costs. In fact second quarter operating expenses excluding fuel actually declined 1% or $28 million. Although we did benefit in the quarter from a $12 million casualty expense reduction, that was more than offset by roughly $23 million of higher costs associated with the final clean-up of the Oregon mudslide.</p>
          <p>The Midwest flooding also added costs to the quarter of a little more than $10 million but we were able to offset the majority of these through fewer train starts and less fuel consumption. This cost performance highlights our improved operating efficiency. And it's even more remarkable when you consider the operating challenges that we faced during the quarter. The net result of our operations was 18% growth in operating income to a second quarter best $931 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at the drivers of our freight revenue growth, we reported a 13% increase or $496 million to $4.3 billion. Freight revenue would likely have been about $45 million higher in the quarter but was impacted by the Midwest flooding primarily from fewer coal loadings.</p>
          <p>Increased fuel cost recovery driven by higher fuel prices was the largest contributor to our 13% freight revenue increase. Pricing also continued strong for us as we achieved roughly six points core price improvement in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our mix of business was also a positive. In particular the business group with the highest average revenue per car, Agriculture, grew volumes 11% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to expenses, compensation and benefit expense declined 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. We offset general salary and benefit inflation through greater overall workforce productivity as we moved 1% less gross ton miles with 4% fewer employees.</p>
          <p>Training costs were also lower versus last year as the continuing trend of lower volumes requires us to back bill less attrition. For the remainder of the year our workforce levels will be aligned with anticipated volume and productivity. Cost per employee will likely increase, however, as the nationally negotiated wage increase of 4% went into effect on July 1st.</p>
          <p>As Jim mentioned, increased fuel expense was a key driver in the quarter totaling a record $1.2 billion, driven by a 64% increase in average diesel fuel prices for the quarter. This expense category increased more than $400 million versus last year. Although our various fuel cost recovery mechanisms helped offset these rising fuel prices, the effect to our profitability cannot be overstated.</p>
          <p>In fact, in the second quarter alone, we estimate that higher locomotive fuel cost, over $0.75 per gallon threshold, net of our various fuel cost recovery mechanisms, reduced operating income by almost $200 million. By consuming 19 million fewer gallons of diesel fuel in the quarter we somewhat mitigated the impact of higher prices. Consumption was lower as a result of moving 1% fewer gross ton miles year-over-year as well as our ongoing efforts to conserve fuel.</p>
          <p>The operating department's conservation initiatives as well as the increased use of newer, more fuel-efficient locomotives have enabled us to consistently improve our quarterly consumption rate. In particular, our June consumption was very favorable year-over-year and better than anticipated. A portion of this variance can be attributed to our business mix, with the Midwest flooding and the associated reduction in train starts was also a factor.</p>
          <p>Another fuel headwind for us is the increased cost of gasoline and diesel use in our work and fleet equipment. This added $12 million to our second quarter expense. We are committed to improving our fuel cost recovery and reducing the negative impact of fuel on our profitability. But until we re-price all of our legacy contracts we are exposed to rising fuel prices.</p>
          <p>Moving to purchased services and materials expense, this expense line increased $16 million or 3% in the quarter. Cleanup and restoration costs associated with the Oregon mudslide and the June flooding was well as higher contract costs were the primary drivers in this increase. Crew transportation costs were also higher in the quarter as a result of increased fuel cost.</p>
          <p>On slide 24, we show both depreciation and equipment expenses. Depreciation expense increased 6% in the quarter to $346 million. This increase is driven entirely by higher capital spending. Second quarter equipment and other rents declined 5% to $338 million, a $16 million savings year-over-year. Better asset utilization and fewer shipments of finished vehicles and Industrial Products both contributed to a reduction in car hire expense. In addition lower lease expenses for freight cars, containers, and equipment were partially offset by other rental increases.</p>
          <p>Our last expense group is 'other', which declined $3 million in the quarter to $199 million. The primary driver of the decrease was a semi-annual actuarial study we completed in the third quarter &#x2013; excuse me, in the quarter, which reduced casualty expenses by $12 million year-over-year. Our continued safety improvements and lower estimated settlement costs are reflected in the lower expense.</p>
          <p>Offsetting a portion of this decline were increased utility costs and higher state and local taxes. You'll recall that in 2007, we conducted actuarial studies in the first and third quarters, which in 2008 will be completed in the second and fourth quarters.</p>
          <p>And in the third quarter of last year we recorded a $47 million casualty expense reduction. Although we will see ongoing benefits from our improve safety performance, last year's quarterly reduction will clearly impact the year-over-year comparisons.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows our second quarter operating ratio. We improved our operating ratio by nearly a point in the quarter to 79.6%, our lowest second quarter mark since 2002. Of course, back then we were only paying $0.72 per gallon for diesel versus this year's average price of $3.60 per gallon. You can see the impact of higher fuel prices adding about 4.6 points to the operating ratio. This further illustrates the substantial headwind we faced from the more than $400 million run-up in quarterly fuel expense.</p>
          <p>The ongoing strength of our base business, driven by strong pricing gains, improved operating efficiency and the casualty expense reduction more than offset those added costs to drive 5.5 points of operating ratio improvement in the quarter.</p>
          <p>This operating ratio improvement is actually understated a little when you take into consideration the weather events we experienced in the quarter, both this year and last year. You might remember than in 2007 we experienced flooding on our network that reduced our earnings by about $0.05 per share post split. This year we had the impact from both the Oregon mudslide and the Midwest flooding which altogether cost us closer to $0.08 in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We are pleased by this quarterly performance as we continue to set the bar higher with regard to our profitability. In particular, we know we have a tough comparison going into the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the full income statement. Second quarter other income was $17 million less in the quarter, at only $19 million. Less interest income and a year-over-year decline in gains from real estate sales contributed to this decrease. For the full year we still expect other income to be in the range of 75 to $100 million.</p>
          <p>Interest expense increased 7% in the quarter to $128 million as a result of higher average debt level. Income tax expense increased 13% versus last year or $34 million. Higher pre-tax income was the driver of the increase with some offset from a lower tax rate: the effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2008 was 35.4%. This reduction is a result of federal tax audits and state law changes which increased earnings by $18 million after tax.</p>
          <p>Through the first half of 2008 our effective tax rate is 35.5%. For the second half of the year we would expect a more normalized rate of around 38%.</p>
          <p>Net income was a second quarter best of $531 million, a 19% increase. Earnings per share grew 24% to $1.02 per share. Of course, the per share amounts reflect the two-for-one stock split that we completed at the end of May.</p>
          <p>Similar to the first quarter our earnings per share growth is outpacing the rate of our net income as a result of our share repurchase program. On a fully diluted basis our weighted average shares outstanding declined 4% in the quarter. During the second quarter we repurchased 6.3 million shares of UP common stock at a total cost of a little more than $480 million. Since starting our repurchase program in January of 2007, we've bought back just over 38 million shares returning more than $2.3 billion to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 29, and our balance sheet. Our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio is up year-over-year to the mid 40s with about 12.5 billion of total debt obligations at the end of June. This puts us solidly in the middle of the investment grade credit range which provides us with good access to the capital markets at a reasonable cost.</p>
          <p>Let me close today with a look at the third quarter and the second half of 2008. Similar to the drivers of the first half of the year, the key factors in the second half will be volume and fuel. Jack, talked to you about our expectations that third quarter volumes could be in the 1 to 2% lower year-over-year range.</p>
          <p>From a fuel standpoint our outlook assumes $4 per gallon for diesel fuel in the quarter. That equates to roughly $135 per barrel for crude oil. At that price third quarter fuel expense would increase roughly $550 million year-over-year assuming a flat fuel consumption rate.</p>
          <p>The good news is that in the face of lower volumes and a huge cost hurdle we still expect solid earnings growth. We would look for third quarter earnings to be in the range between $1.10 and $1.20 per share, or 10 to 20% growth. Put some perspective around this, if third quarter carloads are down 1% and crude is near $135 per barrel with reasonable refining spreads, our quarterly earnings could be toward the high end of the range. But if carload volume is weaker and we see fuel prices increase that could bring earnings closer to the lower end of the range.</p>
          <p>We are also updating our full year outlook: we now expect volume to be down around 1% for the full year. This reflects the tougher than expected start for the year with volumes already off 1% through the first half.</p>
          <p>We are also increasing our earnings range to $4.00 to $4.20 per share for the full year, or growth of 16 to 21%. This is above our previous range and is consistent with our stronger year-to-date earnings as well as our expectation for continued earnings growth. Our focus on improvement will allow us to drive more of our strong top line growth into greater profitability for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Rob. As we look ahead to the second half of the year we'll continue to face challenges from higher fuel prices and a softer economy. We remain committed however to driving productivity improvements throughout the organization for providing a safe, reliable service product to our customers. The end result of these efforts will be a record financial performance for Union Pacific and greater financial returns for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>So with that we have got time to take a few of your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question regarding the tremendous unit revenue performance in both the Ag and the Energy business segments, both up in the high teens, and was wondering if you could comment a little bit on how much of that was price, how much was fuel surcharge, how much might have been the use of larger cars on average and how much might have been a change in the length of haul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack, you want to try a shot at that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the Energy business, John, we did have some repricing of a couple of our legacy deals. And so the price component of that number was stronger than what we saw overall from the average for the quarter. And in the Ag business, quite honestly it's just the strength of the market that's allowed us to go in and whereas typically we might take one or two price increases over the course of a year we've been able to do three or four. So our core pricing in both of those segments has been at the higher end of our business groups.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, the other thing I would remind you, you have a real spread there on the Ag and Energy. Energy is obviously we have got a big book of our legacy contracts. So while we had a nice increase in the average revenue per unit, it really doesn't reflect what the market is right now. It's much higher than what we had in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also had a question regarding the clean-up expenses with natural disasters such as the Oregon mudslide and the flooding in the Midwest. Seem to recall that a couple of your other US railroads in the face of other disasters have had insurance recoveries on clean-up and rebuilding expenses. Is that something that applies in these cases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Iowa floods, we don't see that being something that we would cover in insurance. The Oregon mudslide is one that we do have some coverage on. You know, at the end of the day though you still -- you may recover insurance but you pay it back over the long term.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see -- I think the thing that really stands out the most in the quarter to me seems to be the cost improvement, the operating performance despite the headwinds in June. Where -- how much of the benefit of that improvement really came in on the cost side, I guess if you look at head count reduction and rents. Or was a lot of that held back by the flood impact and I guess is it, if you look forward do we say okay you are going to continue to improve and maybe that the cost improvement stays at a similar pace. Or is there some further acceleration? Clearly you have a lot of momentum on the operating side so just wanted to get some thoughts on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Tom, I think the best slide Dennis used and there was velocity before and after if you look at it. We had a dramatic fall-off, we were running strong right before the flood that's out here. And then we have recovered and that's not by accident, that's by plan, in terms how we are running our network today. We still have I think substantial opportunity for productivity improvement going forward here. So the rate that you've seen, while it was dampened somewhat by the floods and weather, we're going to continue. We've said long-term our productivity opportunities we said at a minimum we want to offset inflation. And, Dennis, you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I'd to add to it, Tom, is that we tried to show you at our previous analyst sessions that we have a very structured approach to cost reduction and asset utilization. And I think you are starting to see some significant payouts from our efforts on unified plan, simplifying our network, and running a much more disciplined operation and we expect that to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I look at, I think equipment rents here improved about 130 basis points year-over-year if you look at it as a percent of revenue, and then the head count was down 4%. That type of pace probably can continue for a few more quarters and might even accelerate a touch, you know, if you don't have more weather events. Is that a fair way to look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd be careful about just extending it out. Equipment rent's a great one in there as we are reducing our leased locomotives, short term leased locomotives, which is directly related to our velocity improvements. We'll end the year with fewer locomotives when you look at it. And as we've said you before part of the additions and those assets, looking backward was our challenges we had with velocity but we've got good opportunity going forward. Rob, you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One comment, Tom, you should remember last year's third quarter was a very good performance period. So while we are continuing to make improvements we got the headwind of a difficult comp in the third quarter. The other point I would make to your earlier comment is on the fuel consumption: as we pointed out the fuel consumption in June as a result of some mix issues and the weather was extraordinarily good and I wouldn't anticipate that that run- rate will continue. We'll continue to make improvements. But that particular run-rate clearly helped us on the fuel consumption side in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what -- it seems like the improvement in velocity is a good indicator at the present time of some improvement in your cost side performance. Where do you think velocity may ultimately go to? Is it realistic to look back to '02 and say you get to those levels or you think there is a sense maybe going into next year you could even exceed those type of levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are going to continue to improve our velocity. Now part of this will -- part of this in my mind is what's the market willing to pay for the service piece? There are two equations with velocity, as you know, which are reducing assets, improving the returns. The other piece, in fact my Head of Marketing actually missed the flight so I'll have to bail him out here. On the customer satisfaction side, if you look at it we had a customer satisfaction for the quarter of 83, the best since merger, and there is great value there from the customer basis. We turn their assets and provide great service.</p>
          <p>I don't have a number, I mean we don't have a number I've heard what says what's the ultimate velocity. What we are focused on is every year improving our asset utilization and our speed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess last one, I'll pass it along to someone else. On the legacy contracts I think you commented that coal got a little bit of a boost from some legacy repricing in second quarter. Is there more? I guess your contracts are kind of second half loaded? So can we see a little further acceleration even in effective pricing in some of the lines in second half as more of those legacy deals reprices here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you will see the carryover effect of things we've done so far, Tom, and really from this point forward the bulk of them are going to be year-end expirations. We don't really have many coming up here in the third and fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Well, congratulations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've got in the Energy business was also in some of our export coal opportunities. We have a new move in export coal that's moving down to Mexico, we have also started moving some coal off the West Coast to Asia and both of those helped us as well from a pricing perspective for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of William Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jim, maybe I could just follow up with one comment you just made here at the end. The service improvements: should we think about that as being able to extend the period what you can kind of sustain this 5 to 6% core pricing. Or could it actually mean that contracts you have already re-priced have even more upside? So we can think of maybe even growing that core pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think there, it's both there, really as where you -- and we said it consistently, there is a market price for obviously the service you are providing today. But we clearly are seeing some very good opportunities where we are really entering new markets, providing new service products. So I think the value of railroads really are really showing through right now with our customer base. I see it upside on both sides.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you mentioned that you expect coal to be strong. Do you have a sense for where your stockpiles are? I mean is this something where you are just going to make up the flooding or are we actually have even more pent-up demand there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stockpiles at the moment are declining and -- but that's really not unusual for this time of the year, I mean this is the heavy season burn. So you would expect it. I don't know that we would say they are declining at an alarming rate, they are kind of seasonally acting the way we think. So we think we will have stockpile replenishment as well as some upside opportunities selectively for some export business, and then we've got some of the recovery stuff that's out there. So I think there's three things that are going to contribute to a strong second half in coal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just last question in -- at the Analyst Day you mentioned that you had seen lumber shipments sort of seem no longer to deteriorate sequentially. Are you seeing any signs that things are getting better in that world? Or was that just sort of a fluke?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer that one. I don't think we're down, what, about 25% in the quarter, that's on top of -- we're down almost 50%, I think, from where we're in the peak. I don't see anything out there on the housing side that says there is a recovery in the near term. We're -- our planning cycle next year says it's still going to be pretty tough. Now we are fortunate to we have a good mix of business. If you look at steel, was up, what, 15% or so, 17% stone, some of that is related to highway construction, was up. But I don't see anything in the near term that's going to drive our, drive our lumber business back up.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good morning. Just on the oil side, now that we have seen a bit of a pullback, you were talking about, "But what if it goes up?" and the impact to earnings. But since we've seen a $20 pullback, I am just wondering do you see any of that domestic Intermodal that, Jack, you were talking about might be good in the second half.  Do you see any of that, maybe potentially going back to the truck or do you think you keep winning even at these high lofty levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, I really think that the domestic Intermodal will stay fairly strong for us over &#x2013; even if it pulls back $20. I think we're going to see a sustained demand or some good initiatives that we have in the marketplace. We've got some great service products, and our service is getting better and better all the time. So one of the cool things we are seeing happen right now is that the service gap between truck and rail, as our service improves and as highway congestion gets worse, we are closing that gap. And so we have got a lot of very strong products particularly on the Southeast, on the Sunset Corridor, and places like that. I think we will continue to make inroads even if fuel prices back down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, I think the wildcard in the domestic &#x2013; well two things. One, obviously the economy, but there is a second one here is what is happening with excess truck capacity today. And we know it's been shrinking in terms of you look at equipment being sold overseas. We've actually have seen some areas that have -- we saw some shortages in terms of equipment. So I think there are -- obviously fuel, energy costs are a big deal to the truckers, but there are other factors that have to play out here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just two quick technical questions if I can. In the annual targets, are you using the $1.02 or you are excluding the tax gain in that full year target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We are using the $1.02.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then same for, was it last quarter you also had the tax gain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and we are including that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then on the fuel, Rob, do you use WTI or diesel in your surcharge rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have several different surcharges, but with very little of it is WTI. DOE [Department of Energy] is the predominant driver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I think, Rob, I forgot who mentioned it earlier but Intermodal was driven by competitive losses, I think maybe Jack mentioned that. Can you talk about the scale of what on the international side is being lost? Is it going all-water East or is it being lost to other carriers out West?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, we lost some business to rail in terms of the contract. So that's a &#x2013; it wasn't really shifting to the East.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the pricing mix, in that high teens performance this quarter great 16% yield, can you simplify that? What percent was pure price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Core price was up about 6%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So at the top end of that 5% range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question I have is, just as you look on the 4% increase in costs, the employee cost, the new contract, that Rob, talked about, just wondering what -- are there anything specific you needed to do in order to offset this immediate increase in this quarter? Or is that going to be something you just trying to keep the ongoing productivity to gradually offset that? So could we see -- is that why you are being cautious on the third quarter, because of the scale of that and employee cost increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are going to have the pressure, as Rob mentioned. But we need to continue to focus on our productivity, reducing recrews, we've talked about that before. We -- our recrew rates, while we had a good improvement year-over-year, we are still running about 8 or 8.5, 8 or 9%, so we have got to keep focused on the productivity piece.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're speaking to UNP, but it really starts with where you think consumer spending is going to go. I mean, of course part of peak is getting ready for Christmas. Our auto producers, which also are part of peak, as they are producing new models, we don't expect that to be as strong this year. So and it is unique to UP but it also reflects what's happening in the overall economy. We will have a peak. It's just simply &#x2013; it may be only a hill this time instead of a mountain.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ed Wolfe with Wolfe Research. Go ahead with your question, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What happened in the last two and half weeks that allows you to print such a strong number at the end of the quarter? I mean you still talked about a nickel of impact from the West Coast. So what really happened at the end of the quarter that was so positive and can you talk about that relative to how July has begun?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ed, we ended up with just a much stronger finish to the quarter. It was -- when we gave our guidance, the fuel impact, or the weather impact, came in pretty close to what we thought, but we saw a pretty strong bump in the quarter, at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>And right now it's -- if you take autos out of the equation, we are, Dennis, we had shown you what's happening with coal, running over 37 trains a day out of PRB in coal. So it's staying a little bit stronger. But it doesn't take much when you look at -- our productivity came in a little bit better. And then fuel consumption came in better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jack talked before about Ag going through PRB and Gulf. Can you give a sense for on the export grain side, the mix of volume or revenue in terms of how that splits up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now the markets are favoring some of the Pacific Northwest shipments and so we are seeing product move from the Midwest up to the PNW, but we're seeing uniform strength whether it is moving Gulf, PNW, or Mexico right at the moment. It's, typically for us the PNW would be one of the weaker markets, but it's pretty strong right now; so all three, all three outlets for our international grain feeds are doing quite well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in the terms of the size of each one, where are they right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the specifics on that, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Relative, are they fairly even at this point? <mark type="inaudible" /> but just relative to where more volume is flowing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are going to have more volume would be flowing Gulf to Mexico than you would to the PNW; so that would be the smallest of the three for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Gulf and Mexico, where is that mostly moving to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of it -- in terms of the final destination?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Asian markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You have concerns at all, at the end of the year, based on what we are hearing from Australia in terms of after two years of drought it feels like they are going to have some very strong planting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think where that's going to impact us is going to be in the wheat markets. If you look at last year's wheat crop around the world the US had the bumper crop. Everything else was relatively soft. So the Australian wheat crop and others are going to bounce back. That said, we are going to basically probably diminish some of the strength in wheat sometime around the fourth quarter. But I think we'll still have plenty of market demand for our product and that shouldn't be an issue.</p>
          <p>Another place where we've seen some pretty strong exports is also to Europe or in Italy in particular for our wheat products. And so we think some of that's going to roll back a little bit here in the fourth quarter. But it's not going to be draconian by any stretch of the imagination. We'll still have solid market demand for our grain products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in your forecast you have a little bit less wheat, but made up in other areas basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, corn is going to be okay. Despite kind of the concerns right now, in our serve territory our corn crop should be good. I mean you always have the normal crop risk that you have to worry about, early frost and those kinds of things.</p>
          <p>And some of the lost acreage got transplanted into soybeans; and again the soybean market should be strong, the acreage is looking good. The corn crop itself, the quality of the crop, we were concerned that the quality of the crop was going to be weak, but it's actually -- the latest projections it's back up to 150 bushels an acre. So it should be good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just shifting gears, Jack, to coal and export coal. You talked about Mexico and West Coast. Can you talk a little bit about what the size of that export coal product is currently and what the capacity is to extend that over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this year in total, Ed, we'll probably do about 4 million tons of export and probably 1 million to 1.25 million of that is going to be to off the West Coast, going to steel producers in the Asian Rim countries. Probably 0.5 million tons down to Mexico and then the balance is going to move to the River and head off to Europe, Spain and other places. That's kind of the run that there is right now.</p>
          <p>There's actually more capacity out there I think then from the port perspective and the rail perspective than there is right now at least on the mine side of things. So if in fact we could get greater production out of Colorado-Utah I think we would have some greater upside potential.</p>
          <p>I think in the first quarter I mentioned that our export potential was somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 million tons alone just off the West Coast. I think my team now would say new interest, new contacts, would say that export market is probably somewhere in the 15 million ton range in terms of what the potential is.</p>
          <p>We don't know how many of those will come to fruition but we are feeling actually pretty good. We spend a lot of time working with ports. We think there is some port potential capacity out there that's unused that we'd have the opportunity and I think our biggest concern right now or our biggest opportunity is if we can get more production out of the mines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's your best guess to when the mines can get you more production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are working hard at it, it's pretty hard to determine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>They're quarters or years away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it's quarters to I would say next year. I think over the time period, I think you're 12 to 18 months away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, I think the question though, is long term, when does Australia come back in the market? I think again they are talking about a couple of years. PRB could be of interest moving export. So I think again, export coal has seen cycles and this is one of the positive ones here. I think if it's sustainable you will see the supply chain respond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing we are seeing on, is just the fill back phenomena of the Eastern Appalachian coal going international. Because we've got a lot more interest now from Eastern utilities wanting to bring in PRB coal. Typically what they are trying to do is blend it so they don't have to make major modifications to their boilers. But there is far more interest in trying to make those movements happen now as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that magnifying itself or manifesting itself in terms of test burns or requests for tests? Where are you in that process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's a combination of test burns but it's not only -- I mean any railroad that has a test burn whether it's us or whether it's our competition, the contracts when they come up for opportunistic bidding will be a free flow for all of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What is timing of that and I just have quick one and I'll let someone else have it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You could actually see some of that come to fruition in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just the last one. You talked about the split between 6% pricing, what's the other 9% or so. How does that split between fuel and mix, give or take?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We feel about two points may be mix, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
