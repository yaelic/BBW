        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call to discuss first quarter and 2011 results. We have a simultaneous webcast on the Internet that can be accessed at the site www.petrobras.com.br/ri/english.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, I'd like to draw your attention to the Slide 2. We may make forward-looking statements, which are identified by use of the words "will," expect," and similar that are based on the beliefs and assumptions of the Petrobras management and on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petrobras' results prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards and Brazilian legislation. At this moment, we are unable to discuss any issues relating to U.S. GAAP results.</p>
          <p>The conference call will be conducted by our CFO, Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa. He will comment on the company's operating and financial highlights and the main events during this quarter, and he will be available to answer any questions you may have.</p>
          <p>Mr. Barbassa, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss first quarter results.</p>
          <p>The first quarter is noteworthy for the consistent progress we made throughout the company. Net income for the quarter was a record. Our activity in the Santos pre-salt is ramping up very rapidly. So far this year, we have already drilled 40% of all the wells we drilled in the prior four years. We made significant discoveries in the pre-salt in Santos and Campos basins. We started new extended wells test in the pre-salt of Santos. We connect the final link from our offshore gas facilities into our now-completed gas infrastructure. Our refining system operated at <mark type="ph" /> 9% (3:01) of capacity, refining record amounts of domestic oil into diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel. We completed a US$6 billion bond offering. We are <mark type="ph" /> trimming (3:16) our access to the debt capital markets to supplement our internally generated funds.</p>
          <p>Next, please. Sequential and year-over-year results for the first quarter were influenced by higher production, rising international oil price, stable product prices in Brazil, and a strengthening real. Year-over-year quarterly operating income was up 8%, while net income up by 42%. Sequentially, quarterly operating income was up 16%, and net income up 4%.</p>
          <p>Next, please. Year-over-year production was up 3% globally and 4% in Brazil. Oil production in Brazil was 2.044 million barrels per day, up 3% from a year ago. As expected, first quarter production was below our 2011 oil target of 2.1 million barrels per day, due to the higher scheduled maintenance. We concentrated scheduled maintenance into first period due to lower demand for production of our associated gas, natural gas, in the first quarter. We remain on schedule to reach our target of 2.1 million barrels per day of volume in Brazil for 2011.</p>
          <p>Natural gas production was up 8% versus &#x2013; from last year production. Capacity will expand by approximately 20 million cubic meters per day this year with the startup of the Mexilh&#xE3;o fields and the Lula Pilot. Actual production growth will ultimately depend on demand for natural gas in Brazil, particularly from the <mark type="ph" /> Permolet (5:52) generation. Our international production increased 3%, primarily from Nigeria. This year we expect the Cascade and Chinook in the Gulf of Mexico to begin producing &#x2013; contributing to production growth.</p>
          <p>Next. In the pre-salt, we continue to accelerate our activities. During the quarter, we finalized two contracts to charter FPSO for Guar&#xE1;&#x2010;Norte and Cernambi; announced additional discovery in Carioca and Parati; drilled eight new wells, bringing to 28 the number of wells in the pre-salt of some stage; began an extended well test in Lula Nordeste; and re-initiated extended well tests in Guar&#xE1;; and finally, revised our &#x2013; the master plan for the Santos pre-salt.</p>
          <p>Next, please. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:01) Petrobras <mark type="ph" /> is instruct (7:07) we have a long-term master plan for the pre-salt. Based on our appraisal and testing work as well as <mark type="ph" /> refinement (7:14) logistics planning, the plan for the pre-salt was recently updated. That portion of the pre-salt CapEx plan that corresponds to Petrobras is incorporated into our consolidated business plan and will be more fully disclosed when we present our updated business plan. But I can highlight some of the conclusions from the latest revision of the pre-salt plan. Since our initial cost projection in 2008, which were based on a limited number of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:55) estimates of the capital required to develop the fields, have been reduced by 45%. Corresponding to the net present value of this oil when compared to the original projection has increased by 52%.</p>
          <p>Next, please. A large reason for the reduction in capital costs is a reduction of assuming greater productivity &#x2013; is the result of assuming greater productivity for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:39) based on our experience with extended well tests and also to reduce time to drill and complete a well. The results of the extended wells test that we have <mark type="ph" /> conducted (9:00) so far has essentially broadened our knowledge and reaffirmed our optimism. Steady, consistent production with no indication of decline during the test, good reservoir behavior, excellent lateral communication of the reservoir, no flow assurance issues, excellent well productivity limited only by the restriction on gas flaring. We have increased our projection of well productivity by some 20% since the first pre-salt master plan.</p>
          <p>Next, please. Wells, well costs, responsible for more than 50% of the development costs. The number of wells and the time to drill down them is critical to project returns. As you can see, the time to drill from the initial wells to those drilled in 2010 has been reduced on an average by one-third.</p>
          <p>Next. The run-up in the international price of oil during the last six months is obviously an important factor in our results. In the last two quarters, the price of Brent has increased by near 30% &#x2013; US$30 per barrel, sorry &#x2013; and almost US$20 just in the first quarter alone. The increase in the <mark type="ph" /> light head (11:00) differential means that our own crude increased by less than that or up $22 during the last six months. Due to our pricing policy of minimizing the volatility of international markets &#x2013; or the Brazilian markets &#x2013; the increased international price was <mark type="ph" /> partially (11:27) reflected in the domestic markets, the domestic price. During the first quarter of 2011, the average realization price of all our products sold was US$98.30 per barrel versus our Gulf Coast average of US$108.35 for the same basket of products. This is the first quarter since the third quarter of 2008 when Gulf Coast refinery gate price were higher than those in Brazil. We continue to monitor price closely, and remain committed to international parity in the region long run.</p>
          <p>Lifting costs. Expressed in reais, lifting costs before government take increased by R$1.70 per well during the first quarter as compared with the fourth quarter 2010 or approximately US$1 per barrel. The increase in lifting costs was due to a combination of unusual factors: higher costs associated with the additional system installed in the fourth quarter of 2010, Lula Pilot <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:59) Urugu&#xE1;-Tamba&#xFA; <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:00) that are still ramping up, storage and maintenance during the period due to the unusual high number of programmed stoppage, as well as greater well interventions. Our systems in the Campos Basin are maturing, which will require additional maintenance that are reflected in lifting costs. Due to additional maintenance requirements, we expect that for 2011 lifting costs will average around R$1 more than the average of R$17.50 for 2010. Production taxes also rose by nearly $5 per barrel as a result of higher value of our oil, which is based on international benchmark.</p>
          <p>Next, please. Brazilian GDP growth, which has contributed to higher real income, is reflected in higher product sales. For the last two years, demand for petroleum derivatives in Brazil has equaled or exceeded the GDP growth. Of note is growth in jet fuel, up 18% year over year as growing income and the stronger real stimulated air travel. Gasoline consumption was up substantially during the quarter, as higher ethanol price caused switch to gasoline <mark type="ph" /> pride of flex fuel fleet. (14:52) Natural gas consumption for non-thermoelectric use has continue to grow, up by 8% year over year. Total natural gas demand declined from the prior quarter, as the rainy season typically reduces demand for thermoelectric power.</p>
          <p>Next, please. In the first quarter of 2011, the results from our expansion of <mark type="ph" /> Replan (15:27) and the REVAP coker and modernization are a part. Due to these investments, and the absence of programmed maintenance in the quarter, crude oil processed at our Brazilian refineries increased by 114,000 barrels per day from one year ago with throughput of domestic crude oil growing by even more and now representing 82% of the oil <mark type="ph" /> present. (16:03) Literally all of incremental throughput was produced as diesel, jet fuel, and gasoline, <mark type="ph" /> a fact (16:12) that Brazil currently imports to meet demand.</p>
          <p>Turning to financial results, revenue for the first quarter were up slightly from the prior quarter <mark type="ph" /> as a seasonal reduction in demand volume sold (16:29) was more than offset by higher price. Cost of goods sold was added by the impact of inventory average. Expense declined during the quarter due to lower general and administrative costs of 5%, what means R$200 million, and lower exploration expense of R$425 million. As a result of these factors, operating income increased 16% when compared with the fourth quarter, while EBITDA of R$16.1 billion was 10% higher.</p>
          <p>Next. If you look at net income, there were no significant changes to the net financial results from the fourth quarter of 2010, with exception of income tax expense, which increased as a result of higher operating income and lower deduction for interest on capital. As a consequence of higher operating income, while partially offset by higher income taxes, net income increased by 4% from the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Next. Exploration and production. Operating income for E&amp;P in Brazil increased by 19% as the result of higher prices. Partially offsetting the benefit of higher price were the lower sales volume from a <mark type="ph" /> smaller underlift (18:20) and higher leasing costs, particularly those associated with production taxes. A higher reserve base from crude reserves booked at the end of 2010 lowered the unit depreciation cost by approximately <mark type="ph" /> R$1.30. (18:41) The reduction in other expenses were largely as a result of lower exploration and dry-hole expense.</p>
          <p>Downstream. The downstream segment experienced an operating loss of R$494 million during the first quarter versus operating income of <mark type="ph" /> R$4.5 billion in the prior (19:08) quarter. Downstream revenues increased due to higher export price and a higher price for domestic product that track international prices on a bi-weekly basis. Revenues from higher prices were partially offset by lower volume. Cost of goods sold increased as a result of higher price for the crude oil feedstock and imported products, which increased faster than the price sold in Brazil. The impact of these higher costs on the operating result was reduced by the effect on inventory average.</p>
          <p>Next. Gas and energy, International, and Distribution. They have each experienced improving operating performance during the quarter. Together, these three segments contributed with R$2.207 billion of operating income or 18% of the total operating income as compared with R$1.478 billion in the fourth quarter or 14% of operating income. The Gas &amp; Power segment continued to benefit from the completion of its infrastructure, and the flexibility of &#x2013; it has created to generate income under a range of market conditions. International operation benefit largely from higher oil prices. Our Distribution subsidiary benefited from higher margins, partially offset by lower volumes.</p>
          <p>Next. Capital spending totaled R$16 billion during the first quarter 2011, a decline of 10% when compared with the first quarter of last year. Capital expenditures <mark type="ph" /> were deferred (21:41) by Brazilian exploration and production were down because of reduced exploration spending for the quarter. Downstream spend improved by 11% as investment for upgrades, regulatory spending, and logistics is peaking, while spending on the Abreu e Lima refinery and Comperj are ramping up. In the first quarter, quality upgrades accounted for 37% of investments, while expansion 33% and logistic and infrastructure another 30%. Gas &amp; Power investment declined as the gas infrastructure reached completion. Our International segment also was reduced, as capital spending remains focused on integrated operations in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Next, please. Capital structure. We continue to have a very comfortable position with respect to both liquidity and leverage. We ended the quarter with a net debt to net capital of 70% and a net debt to EBITDA of one time. Cash and equivalents, including government securities maturing above 90 days, were R$63 billion as of March 31st. Cash flow during the quarter was supernetted by a US$6 billion bond offering.</p>
          <p>With that overview, we will now be happy to answer any questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The floor is now open for questions from investors and analysts. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Our first question is from Frank McGann, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Just a question on the refining side, two questions. One, in terms of the incremental production of diesel and gasoline that you did see in the first quarter, based on continuing investments in upgrading projects, I was just wondering what your expectations are for increased production &#x2013; further production for the rest of this year and in 2012 that might enable better overall earnings in the segment? And then secondly, import needs in the first quarter were clearly very strong and not a positive factor. I was just wondering how you were seeing overall demand right now relative to your own production and how you see imports as you go through the rest of this year, particularly in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Frank, I'll have <mark type="ph" /> Indu (25:25) to help us in these two answers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. In fact we had this good results with, especially with cokers and the project program that is essentially adding hydro-fitting capacity to improve the quality of diesel and gasoline in Brazil. A better diesel yield we will have in 2012 with another coker that will be implemented in Repar refinery. And mostly up to then we will face the challenge of providing the Brazilian markets with better quality of diesel and gasoline in this period.</p>
          <p>So what we will &#x2013; we will have, then, is that what we see &#x2013; the way we see the Brazilian market today is the demand will keep increasing, and we will have to still import a lot of diesel and gas to supply in the market until we expand refinery capacity, and we will have the first new refinery being implemented by '13. So up to then, we will have a hard time, importing a significant amount of volumes to supply the market besides our own production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Emerson Leite from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning. Thank you. I have a question on the PLANSAL slide &#x2013; I think it's number 7. I'm trying to understand what was the improvement in net present value ex the effect of the transfer of rights? The slide shows the PLANSAL areas under concession with a net present value 152% of the initial PLANSAL, and some 20% above of last year's PLANSAL. Does that NPV assessments include or not the transfer of rights?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:56)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, what we see is that on the investment side, what the charts try to tell is that we can see a reduction of 45% on the CapEx program especially for the licensed areas, and if we add up the transfer of rights, then we would come back to the initial level of investment of 100%. And on the net present value side, we are saying that only for the licensed areas, the NPV grew roughly 60% especially because of a reduction in the well program and <mark type="ph" /> some optimizations (28:38) in the FPSOs and topsides as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so only for the areas under concession, that's what is -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah the NPV is only for the areas under concession.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so now, since this NPV is probably 20% or so higher than last year's NPV and comparing 152% versus 118%, have you already estimated how much more you will have to pay back to the government for the 5 billion barrels that you acquired last year under assumptions that were not as positive as the ones that you would now have in your hands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Boy, Emerson, lots of &#x2013; sorry. We have done the <mark type="ph" /> transaction of right transferring (29:37) last year, so all the data we have is still valid. Now, when you compare with the ones you have here, the last position you have here is 2010. So 2010 was the <mark type="ph" /> Momanpopam (29:58) acquisition, so we don't have this calculation. This is going to happen at the end of the appraisal periods of each area individually. They are not going to happen all together, but we'll <mark type="ph" /> have &#x2013; buy (30:17) each one according to the appraisal is concluded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Almir, so let me see if I understand. What you're saying is that the evaluation of the rights transfer areas already takes into account all these improvements that you recently announced that were able to drive lower CapEx, so there is no incremental improvement from the assumptions that were made in the exercise of the rights transfer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did not do an exercise. On comparing what were the results of 2010 that is presented here, that represents a reduction <mark type="ph" /> of written (31:13) of CapEx of 45%. We did figures, we had when we did their appraisal of rights transferring. So we don't have the answer for you, Emerson, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So my second question is on the &#x2013; on last week's announcement that the board of Petrobras did not approve the plan, the strategic plan, review and asked for incremental studies. The local press reported that the board instructed the management to lower the total amount of investments. I would like to confirm if that reading is correct or if it's not what was asked for you to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Emerson, this is not the case. We had many demands from the board to re-examine, to do a sensitive analysis. One or a few of them includes a CapEx reduction, but it is not one question addressed in this event that was reported. There were many. As we said, we had to do many sensitive analysis to present them, so they will take their decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Paul Cheng, Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Almir, in the first quarter spending <mark type="ph" /> runway (33:09) that's much lower than your budget for 2011, and if you're going to meet the budget you need to spend about R$25 billion, R$26 billion. I mean, realistically that is it possible for the company to spend in such a high run rate? Should we assume that &#x2013; I mean, in the past you always underspend your budget. Should we assume that this year you're going to underspend maybe more now in the 15%, instead of in the past maybe 5% to 10% underspend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I tend to agree with you that we are not going to increase so much in the next quarters, our CapEx in the next three quarters. But cannot get the conclusion that it's going to be a 15% under-invested at the end of the year. I can agree we are not probable &#x2013; there is a big probability not to do 100%. How less than that, we have to wait for a little bit more time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question is that in the CapEx for the pre-salt project, you dropped by 45%, pretty impressive number, from the 2008 level. Do you have a breakdown by function that where's the savings come from? is it &#x2013; such as the reduced drilling time that contribute 5%, 10%? I mean, any kind of a &#x2013; maybe a further elaboration of where the saving or that by function lie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Paul. Roughly 50% of that savings comes from well activity, both by reduction of the number of wells and also by the fact that we're drilling wells faster than we did before. And the other 50% has to be assumed as being directed to the top-side facilities, and especially because now that we have more information on what we'll have to do for each platform for each field, perhaps &#x2013; I won't need the amount of flexibility that I was building up into the projects, because now I know much more precisely what I'll need. So when I'm optimizing my top side <mark type="ph" /> through NOM, (35:36) reducing the amount of wells, and reducing the time I take to drill those wells, I would say that this is where this reduction comes from. I would say 50% from the wells and 50% from other parts of the projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The gross saving must be even higher than that because the cost has go up, so &#x2013; I mean that without an inflation that you're probably is reducing or saving more like in this 60% to 70%. Is that a fair estimate? Because I think inflation probably over the last two or three years has been in the 15%-plus a year for you guys.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks very much for the call, ladies and gentlemen. I'm wondering about your financing plans for the rest of the year after having executed the jumbo US$6 billion, what markets you intend to tap next, and will you come back to the dollar market this year or not? If you can give us any kind of color on your financing plans for the rest of the year, appreciate it very much. Thank you.</p>

          <p>We are always working with different alternatives for financing the company. As I showed you, we have a very high liquidity at the moment, but this does not mean that we will be out of the market. We will looking not to go back to the dollar market. In years we did, we did well, and that's enough for the year. We may go for euro or other currency, as well as in the bilateral of the international banks, where we have a very good source, important source for the company. We may raise more <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:06) from a &#x2013; the development bank, like BNDES, that is a very important supply of funds in Brazil. So yes, we are always looking for opportunity, and as it arises, we may approach the market.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wonder if you could address the potential need or lack thereof for the future rigs given the lower CapEx demands and how that may translate into the needed or the built 21 rigs you're planning on building in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, so far we don't see a reduction on the rigs' necessity for us, you see. We have the entire transfer of rights area to appraise and to develop, you see. E&amp;P believes that we'll still need all that &#x2013; the portfolio of rigs. And of course this can change in the future, but it's mainly related to my exploratory success. And the last years we have been very, very fortunate to find lots of oil. And in summary from now on, I don't see us lowering our demand for rigs on a 10-year period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To that I would like to add that <mark type="ph" /> in the 21 (43:15) rigs were anticipated as necessary into 2008, and last year we added to the pre-salt over 5 billion barrels to be produced. This will bring a lot of new needs. So even if we were to use the rig in each well a smaller, shorter time, we had much more to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you still have confidence that the 21 rigs you're planning to build in Brazil can still be built there and delivered on time?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is the assumption we are working. We give timing for the shipyards to get prepared and deliver the first one. And then they have not one to be built, they have a number of them, <mark type="ph" /> in case of the first bidding whilst (44:19) giving us seven rigs. <mark type="ph" /> Only (44:22) seven rigs allow them to invest what they need to do, or to do what they need to do to increase their productivity and delivering on time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I had two quick questions. The first one, on the business plan, Barbassa, is there any internal estimate from you guys, for how long it might take to run the sensitivities and effectively get back to the board? And ultimately in the event that you have to go with something that is smaller than what the management initially proposed last week, is there enough flexibility in the investments that you guys have on &#x2013; outside of E&amp;P, which I assume is pretty much locked up for a long period &#x2013; to cut back on something? Or is that going to be something impossible? That would be the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is a very quick one on the natural gas price discussion from the ANP that we had on the other call. I just wanted to understand, as you reduce your E&amp;P price, is that something that the ANP also does for the calculation of royalties, or are the royalties calculated on a separate pricing mechanism? And that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gustavo, we are working hard on these demands of the board. We hope to have <mark type="ph" /> our benefit (46:17) in the shortest period of time. But I cannot tell you how long it's going to take. For sure, all the company is working to get their share as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>And CapEx on E&amp;P?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're pretty right when you say that E&amp;P CapEx is pretty much locked up for the period, and the general management of the planning area of E&amp;P is conducting all those sensitivity analyses. But when you say that we are locked up for quite some time, let's say two or three years, you're quite right.</p>
          <p>And on the royalties side that you have asked, not necessarily our internal prices are the same that ANP uses for taxation purposes, you see. But the good news is that I think that they've disclosed on their website what price they are using, but not necessarily the same that we use internally.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. Just had a quick question on the revenues from the fourth quarter from exports that were still in transit, and they were supposed to be recognized on the first quarter. I just wanted to understand how much of that actually made it into this quarter's revenues? And if I could ask a second question, on the Urugu&#xE1;-Tamba&#xFA; project, when should you start producing oil from that project? Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we had a limitation on that project because of &#x2013; well, we had a delay on the environmental license for the gas pipeline, you see. But we expect that still this semester we'll be able to normalize production there on the Urugu&#xE1; field. And then the Tamba&#xFA; field will also be starting yet this year. I'm quite sure that in this semester, we'll be able to normalize the situation of the Urugu&#xE1; field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first part of &#x2013; could you repeat the question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Last quarter, you said there was some revenues, I believe, due to exports that were still in transit that weren't recognized. You sold, but they were still in transit, so you didn't recognize that revenue on the fourth quarter. And part of those sales were going to be recognized on this quarter, so I just wanted to know how much of the revenues from this quarter were actually sales from last quarter that were recognized now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the effect is not big, because you have to consider the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:16) now and applying that in our books in the second quarter. I think the impact <mark type="ph" /> was R$20 million or R$30 million (49:25) in our revenue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to follow up on something. The rigs that you mentioned that will be in place by year-end was 11. I was under the impression that it would be 13, and I was just wondering, are the other two just pushed into 2012? And then secondly, in terms of gas prices &#x2013; and I unfortunately got cut off for a second from the call, but I don't think this was asked &#x2013; what drove the decline really in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have seen is that we'll have a &#x2013; those two have split. One for 2012, and one for 2013, you see. On the decline side, that's a tough question. I would have to get back to you on that. What we have seen in 2010 was 9.5%. I would have to get back to you on that. I don't have the precise figure now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I meant the decline in the gas price in the quarter, the realized gas price. What was the &#x2013; part of it was international prices were a little bit weaker, but if you could just provide a little bit more commentary on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay. The internal transfer of rights between E&amp;P and Gas &amp; Power, <mark type="ph" /> consider a component related to international price, and it held price down neutral and hence know they are selling down so the internal transfer of rights follow it. (51:10) Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And there were no other factors that drove that? That was the only thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's basically that. You consider also another factor in the calculation of the price, that is partly related to the infrastructure that E&amp;P gives <mark type="ph" /> gives us count to get the fire related to the interest (51:33) &#x2013; the gas pipeline that we had built, so. But it's not the most important part.</p>
