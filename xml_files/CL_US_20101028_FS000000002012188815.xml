          <p>Good day everyone, and welcome to the Colgate-Palmolive Company's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate.com.  Just as a reminder, there maybe a slight delay before the question-and-answer session begins due to the web simulcast.</p>
          <p>At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Bina Thompson. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dana, good morning, everybody, and welcome to our third quarter earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Steve Patrick, CFO; Dennis Hickey, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.</p>
          <p>This conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events and results may differ materially from these statements. For information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent annual report on Form 10K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the caption Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements on Forward-Looking statements.</p>
          <p>We'll discuss our results and outlook excluding the one-time charge of 271 million related to the transition to hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela as of the 1st of January 2010. We'll also discuss organic sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted on the investors relations page of our website at www.colgate.com. So we'll be glad to answer any questions you may have, including or excluding these items, as you wish.</p>
          <p>We're pleased that our third quarter again exhibited solid performance, reflecting the successful implementation of our financial strategy, well known to you all. Our gross margin increased and we reduced our overhead expenses. This provided funds to increase our advertising, both absolutely and as a percent of sales, to grow the top line, while at the same time increasing our profitability. And this was particularly pleasing given the macroeconomic challenges we face in the more developed regions of the world, coupled with ongoing competitive activity in all our markets.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our market shares in many key countries around the world are strong and growing, up in the majority of our categories, including toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash. You'll hear more about specific share performance as we review the regions in more detail.</p>
          <p>Now as you know, relevant innovation is key. And we've continued to launch new products across categories across a range of price points to appeal to all consumers. Our global launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief continues to do well. As of the end of this quarter, it is now being sold in markets that represent 75% of the sensitivity market worldwide.</p>
          <p>As well as a strong P&amp;L, our balance sheet is solid. Our strong cash position has allowed us to increase our dividend this year as well as to continue with our share repurchase program, both of which provide a good return to our shareholders. So let's turn to the divisions for more specifics.</p>
          <p>Starting with North America. Business in this region remains solid. We continue to launch new products across categories, and have an exciting pipeline slated for the first quarter of next year. As you know, this quarter we are in the midst of a re-launch of our Colgate Total toothpaste line. This is being accompanied by strong media and trade support. The re-launch with innovative packaging incorporates very impactful integrated marketing campaigns and in-store activity across all retailers. Our Max Fresh line, which is particularly relevant with the Hispanic consumer, will see increased focus on key Hispanic accounts in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our manual toothbrush shares continue to do well, up 150 points basis points on a year to date basis to over 30%. The Colgate 360 Degree franchise is doing well, buoyed by the ActiFlex line launched earlier this year. And we continue to build trial and repeat for our on-the-go toothbrush, Colgate Wisp. Another encouraging sign in the U.S. business is that private label growth appears to be flattening, and we see consumers reverting to branded products. As you know, private label in toothpaste is virtually non-existent, and we see the trends in other categories improving.</p>
          <p>We've just launched Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief in Canada. While it's early days, results are particularly encouraging. In three weeks, we've achieved 80% distribution, a process which would normally take closer to three months. Acceptance on the part of the trade and the profession has been excellent, and we've started to see replenishment orders.</p>
          <p>So looking ahead in North America, volume growth is expected to be solid in the fourth quarter, up mid single digit, and should be up mid single digit for the full year as well. Organic sales are expected to be up low single digit for the fourth quarter and full year. Operating profit is expected to decline modestly for the fourth quarter, but should be up mid single digit for the full year, up both absolutely and as a percent of sales.</p>
          <p>Turning then to Europe. The macroeconomic situation in Europe continues to be challenging. As you know, suites in the UK are implementing austerity measures and the general climate in the PIGS countries is very depressed. As we told you last quarter, private label continues to make inroads in the home care categories, and growth in all our categories is sluggish. But despite this, our market shares are up in the important categories of toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash. And this has been due to the consistent introduction of innovative new products, many of which are premium-priced.</p>
          <p>Our launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief in this region continues to drive incremental share. And in fact, our overall toothpaste market share is up 70 basis points on a year-to-date basis, with our sensitivity product at a 1.2% share. In Greece, our overall share is at a record 47% on a year-to-date basis, up almost 4 full points, with the most recent share at 48.9, and Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief leads the sensitivity segment with almost 8 points of share.  In the UK, Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief is at 2.6% year-to-date, with the most recent share at 3.4%, and we've narrowed the gap with our leading competitor almost 13 points, to about 10.5.</p>
          <p>In the countries where GABA is strong, we've launched a sensitivity product under the Elmex name, which uses the same breakthrough Pro-Argin technology. While only in market since August, we've gained distribution very quickly, and trade and professional reception is strong.</p>
          <p>Our manual toothbrush share was up 70 basis points on a year-to-date basis, to 19.9%, with the most recent read at 20%. In the UK, our share increased 3 full percentage points behind launches such as the premium-priced 360&#xB0; ActiFlex. And in Italy, both the Colgate and GABA brands drove our share almost half a point. And in Germany, we gained share behind both the premium and mid tier segments.</p>
          <p>In mouthwash, our share was up a full point, with increases from both the Colgate and GABA brands. Germany launched a new mouthwash under our very successful meridol name, targeted particularly for those suffering from bad breath. Our market share there is up 60 basis points on a year-to-date basis, to 21.7, with the most recent read at 23.6 as a result of the successful recent launch.</p>
          <p>So looking ahead. Volume in Europe is expected to be up modestly for the fourth quarter and full year, with organic sales down modestly for the same period. Operating profit is expected to decline double-digit for the fourth quarter and should be essentially flat for the full year on a dollar basis, but increasing as a percent of sales.</p>
          <p>Latin America. Business across Latin America remains solid, with good market share performance. Our regional market shares are up in toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, bar soaps and deodorants, and we are maintaining our leadership position in the fabric conditioners and dishwashing liquids.</p>
          <p>In the toothpaste category, our shares are up in virtually every country. Our excellent toothpaste share performance in Brazil was referenced in the press release. Both Colgate Total and our Colgate sensitive business are performing well in that market where Colgate Total is up over 2 points on a year-to-date basis. The launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief has met with success and helped drive our professional recommendations for sensitivity toothpaste to a leadership position.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, despite heightened competitive activity, our toothpaste share is still well over 80% and has increased sequentially for the last three periods, while our main competitor has lost share. Colgate Total in Mexico is at a record of 17.6%. With the launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief, we've established the number one position in sensitivity in drugstores.</p>
          <p>Our regional toothbrush share is up almost a full point year over year in Mexico, despite aggressive competitive promotions, our share is up over 2 points to over 41%, a new record. And in Brazil, as well, heightened competitive activity has not affected our share, which is at a leading 30% of the market in the most recent period, and up almost half a point on a year to date basis.</p>
          <p>Our mouthwash business is very strong as well. Up almost a full point on a year to date basis, with firmly established number one positions in Brazil and Argentina. While we are the number two player in the region overall, our excellent performance has narrowed the gap with the number one competitor from almost 30 points in 2007 to 15 points year to date in 2010.</p>
          <p>Both the Palmolive and Protex brands have helped lift our number one regional bar soap position almost a full point year to date. In addition to new products, implementation of a hand washing campaign modeled after our Bright Smiles, Bright Futures oral care program has contributed to our success in this category.</p>
          <p>Continued innovation in the underarm category is critical and a number of new products have driven our regional share, up by a half a point: men's Speed Stick Extreme, Waterproof and Stainguard, and Lady Speed Stick Waterproof Professional Protection and <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So looking ahead, volume in Latin America is expected to be up slightly in the fourth quarter, with full-year growth in the low to mid single digits. Organic sales are projected to be up mid-single digit for the fourth quarter and high single digit for the full year. Operating profit is expected to decline in the fourth quarter, after a very strong increase in the year-ago quarter, but should be up as a percent to sales. And for the full year, operating profit is expected to decline modestly on a dollar basis and as a percent to sales.</p>
          <p>Turning then to greater Asia-Africa. The strong momentum continues across the region, testament to the growth offered by many of these markets. Most of the countries' economies are quite buoyant and categories are showing continued good growth. Our regional toothpaste share was up 70 basis points to almost 40%. In China, our share is now at 32.5%, up 80 basis points year over year. We've launched Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief in key cities where it is now has a full point of share.</p>
          <p>We referenced our strong share performance in India in the press release, now solidly over 50% at 51.1% of the market. In Russia, we are maintaining our leadership position of almost 33%, and in Singapore, one of our lead markets for the launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief a little over a year ago, we continue to see benefits from that new product, with overall shares at almost 69%.</p>
          <p>Across the region, we enjoy the number one position in toothbrushes. Our year to date share is up 40 basis points to 36.2%. India increased toothbrush shares 180 basis points to almost 40% as we've re-launched a popular Zigzag toothbrush in the value segment. And in Russia, super premium new products drove our market share up 230 basis points to 51.7%, In Turkey, Colgate 360 contributed to a 510 basis point increase to almost 24% of that market.</p>
          <p>In the mouthwash category, we increased our share in every subsidiary. In China, we have a 30-share with the most recent period at 33.4%. Ongoing new product launches supported by media and effective in store activity have driven our success across the region.</p>
          <p>So looking ahead, volume in greater Asia, Africa is expected to grow double digit for the fourth quarter and full year, with organic sales increasing double digit for both periods as well. Operating profit is expected to grow high single digit for the fourth quarter and double digit for the full year, up absolutely and as a percent to sales.</p>
          <p>So turning then to Hill's. Our business at Hill's is slowly improving. Although volume was modestly down for the full quarter worldwide, volume in Europe was positive and we saw volume increasing in the U.S. at the end of the quarter, Indications that our right pricing and right sizing initiatives are working.</p>
          <p>Another encouraging data point is that unit consumption at the large format retailers here in the U.S. was up for the most recent 1, 4, 13 and 26-week periods, and volume was up on a one and four-week basis, boding well for the business going forward. We told you last quarter about the launch of Science Diet Healthy Mobility here in the U.S. This product is doing very well, and drawing new consumers to the Hill's brand. Shipments are above forecast, and customer feedback has been very positive. Media support and in-store activity has helped to drive these results.</p>
          <p>We also told you about the launch in Europe of Science Plan Vet Essentials, a product sold only through the veterinarian. This has been very well received, and has driven our overall market share. As a result of this launch, our vet recommendations have increased as well. Our launch of Toy Breed Science Diet in Japan has done well and our 3.6% share is ahead of all other brands in the segment.</p>
          <p>A recently announced innovation here in the U.S. is the Hill's Prescription Diet Therapeutic Weight Reduction program, available only through veterinary clinics, for obese or obese prone dogs. Think of it as the Jenny Craig for dogs, with pre-measured food and biscuit packs. Pet owners are also provided with ongoing support in the form of a therapeutic weight reduction guide providing instructions and tips. Support is also available online.</p>
          <p>So looking ahead, volume at Hill's is expected to be even with last year for the fourth quarter, and modestly down for the full year. Organic sales are expected to decline modestly in the fourth quarter, down low single digit for the full year. Operating profit is expected to be flat for the fourth quarter, but up as a percent to sales, and full year operating profit should be up modestly, both absolutely and as a percent to sales.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we're pleased with our results. We have a proven strategy that has worked over the years to deliver profitable volume growth and increasing market shares. As noted in the press release, while we're still in our global budgeting process for 2011, we are planning to continue to strengthen our volume and market share next year, driven by many new and existing Colgate products, supported by increased advertising.</p>
          <p>Colgate people around the world are working hard to help them deliver these solid results, and we look forward to sharing our further progress with you as we go forward.</p>
          <p>So, now, Dana, I would like to turn it over to the Q&amp;A session.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ali.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted your perspective. It's kind of a good four or five months ago that we talked about extra investment by competitors. And at that time, you were hopeful that those commercials wouldn't actually happen, and in fact, you believed that you could defend if they did and maintain double digit EPS growth forever, for at least well, for next year.</p>
          <p>Now that's no longer the case, would love to just get underneath that a little bit if you would, kind of what specifically has changed? Do you have confidence now that you can really grow your EPS even mid single digits, given what you see out there from a competitive perspective and defend, or even a consumer perspective and defend? How long have you budgeted for, and/or how long do you think this investment by some of your competitors will last? What products or countries specifically? Just really trying to get underneath that dynamic, if you could, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, Ali, a broad question indeed. If you look at it sequentially for us, I think in the second quarter of this year, we started talking about the heightened promotional activity, and the fact that we had responded to it, and that we were going to continue assuming that would be the new normal for the back half of this year. And that despite that, we reaffirmed the notion of double digit earnings per share growth for 2010.</p>
          <p>Yes, in terms of the longer term, our objective is a sustainable double digit earnings per share growth, but fairly constantly across the third quarter &#x2013; and you and I had this discussion as well &#x2013; the position we took was that as we began our 2011 budgeting process for the year 2011, we would weigh what we were seeing around the world and what we were planning to do with our own businesses, and make the right determination by the business.</p>
          <p>And as we had guided for 2011, in the third quarter &#x2013; 2010, I'm sorry, in the third quarter of last year, we thought it was appropriate to give our preliminary thinking, while our budget process is not finished. And that is that with the competitive environment we see, with the initiatives that we have, to build on what we still view as a strong business, we have the opportunity to strengthen and accelerate the top line growth in 2011, with our innovation stream supported by increased trial-generating advertising, and that's the way we're thinking about 2011. And so that's the way we're approaching it, Ali.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just give us more of a sense of where exactly it's happening? In terms of competitive increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we haven't finished our budgeting process, but we will be focusing on continuing to build our market shares in brands and geographies important to us, but I wouldn't be more specific than that at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How about temporally, how long do you think something like this lasts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are talking about the 2011 budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. My question has to do kind of just with the longer-term outlook. I know you guys have been just historically one of the most consistent double digit, low teens earnings growth companies out there. But as you think about kind of the competitive environment and how you look at something like Latin America, where the volume growth even ex-Venezuela, just doesn't seem to be quite as good as it used to be. Is there a chance that there needs to be a change in your long-term sort of growth algorithm? So that maybe we're looking at, I don't know &#x2013; permanently high single digit earnings growth, as opposed to reverting back to double digits in sort of 2012 and beyond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess, Wendy, we don't take that view. I think as we have revisited our strategic planning process, which leads into our budget process for 2011, and without any conceit, I think we feel that the strategic initiatives we have are sound, and can continue to guide the company going forward. We feel the category choices we have made are sound in terms of the inherent growth rates over time and profitability over time in those categories, and we think our geographic diversity positions us well over the medium term.</p>
          <p>What we are seeing, I think, in 2010 is heightened activity from some competitors who are perhaps recovering from a slower than traditional performance, and we are meeting that in 2010 and we have initiatives of our own in 2011 that we want to drive hard. And I'm sure in response to question, we will some back and talk about market shares, around the world, the market shares are good. So we think we're making an investment of choice in order to accelerate the top line, in order to continue to build our brands and market share, and we're viewing this as we go into it, as a 2011 focus. And we will revisit in the context of our strategic plan and 2012 budget those out years, but we do not believe that there is a structural change going on here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a follow up to that, as you think about the &#x2013; I know it's early in the budgeting process, but as you think about 2011 with all the new products you're launching, does it sound like the pressure on margins is going to come primarily from stepped up advertising or do you anticipate more promotions and price off, which would then pressure your gross margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are focusing always on trying to build our brands. We have said before that when we think about marketing and building trial and awareness, we prefer to use what you might call traditional advertising. That said, we have been building in-store shopper marketing activity, which comes in the gross to net calculation, particularly in those parts of the world that are responsive to that from a consumer point of view, and that would be more the developed world. So as we plan going forward, it will be a mixture between commercial activity at retail, as part of an intentional strategy, and it will be what you might call the more traditional advertising and promotion, the media, and the sampling below the line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All righty. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First, hi, first question about the "new normal" you referenced earlier, Ian. It sounds like you're talking about 2011 specifically, but you guys have not really starved your brands. I mean, your advertising spending I guess year-to-date is close to 11%, and that's sort of the average over the last five years, and yet you've put up pretty good volume growth during most of that period. I mean, as we look beyond 2011, is there a chance that now companies in the space have to spend beyond 10%, 11% on advertising to really drive that mid single digit volume growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the way I would answer, Joe, first of all, my comment on the new normal, to a certain extent, was related to 2010. And we were simply saying on the last call that we weren't changing our view on the back half of the year, based on remarks made by some that maybe their pricing activity would be would be easing.</p>
          <p>My sense is, and our strong view is, we want to take the choiceful opportunity in 2011 to accelerate our top line and further strengthen our brands. And in order to do that, we are prepared to, and want to, increase our advertising. And with the backdrop of the competitive activity we're seeing.</p>
          <p>If you're projecting forward, what one could foresee happening is that maybe the pricing intensity will lessen over time, and advertising in that 11-plus area is a quite healthy level of advertising.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just as I look to next year's guidance, I want to kind of understand if any impact comes from higher commodity cost? And specifically thinking of the Hill's business, as corn and soy are spiking while you're looking to kind of lower or right-size prices. If you could give us some color on the commodity outlook as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again, that's early in our process, Bill. But let me take this opportunity to do what we traditionally do, and give you the roll-forward on our gross profit for the third quarter of this year, because it allows me to step into the point for next year.</p>
          <p>If you looked at third quarter last year, at gross profit, it was 59.2. We have a headwind of material prices of 1.8, and we have Funding the Growth savings, our Funding the Growth program, of around 2, which gets you the 20 basis points and the increased gross margin.</p>
          <p>Now, if you move forward to 2011, and I stress, early days in our process, but as we're looking at it across all of our businesses, including Hill's, we're seeing a range of headwind that could be in the 3.5% to 6% zone. And we are very, very focused on our Funding the Growth savings for 2011 as an ability to handle those commodity prices, and that we think at this stage we can do.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just talk broadly about the M&amp;A environment, and any interest, heightened or lessened these days, in looking at acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think I'll go as broad as the environment. Let me just talk about our philosophy and thinking on that topic. The &#x2013; we view M&amp;A obviously as a strategic activity. When we talk about the growth of our company, we don't say for any planning period that the growth is going to be driven by a bolt-on acquisition. We'd rather talk about our philosophy, and our philosophy is, we want to buy, to strategically strengthen, priority categories for us.</p>
          <p>So categories of interest would be oral care, pet nutrition, and personal care. You're unlikely to see us as a buyer in the home care space. And I guess the bookend to that thinking is, we are very disciplined in our financial calculations for an acquisition, and we strive, as they say, not to pay too much. And that has seen us in the past, you may recall, when Pfizer sold their OTC business, not seek to buy all of that business just to get Listerine, because we thought that would have been imprudent. And if I pointed to GABA and Tom's of Maine, our two most recent acquisitions, they are both outpacing the acquisition plan that we justified to our board to make the acquisition.</p>
          <p>So the headline would be, we remain interested in the right strategic acquisition at the right price, but we are not reliant on it in our planning for the sustainable growth of the company.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, can you just talk about the category growth rates?</p>
          <p>And do you think it's macro, or do you think it's self-fulfilling? So do you think it's driven by some of this pricing and promotional activity, or do you think it's more macro-driven?</p>
          <p>And then the other question, sort of part and parcel with that, is has there been a time in history when both Glaxo and you and P&amp;G have been so aggressive with both innovation and spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's talk about the categories. As we said on the last call, we continue to see now what we saw then. And that is that the emerging markets around the world are growing high single digits on a value basis, and the categories in the developed world are growing low single digits, with the U.S. ahead of Europe.</p>
          <p>As to whether or not that's macros or self-fulfilling, it's a bit chicken-and-egg. There is no question, in low growth environments, some deflationary pressure, partly consumer, partly retail, and partly competitive. But that's the spread around the world, and that's what we are looking at going forward, we believe.</p>
          <p>When you come to the competitive pace of activity, Glaxo has always been a healthy competitor in the oral care space. Maybe more headline attention now, given our activity on Sensitive Pro-Relief, but there has always been intensity from them. And in the case of Procter &amp; Gamble, it is limited to the markets that we talk about every time we're on the call, and in fact, why don't I use that maybe as sort of a jumping off point to talk about some of those markets, and give you the headline market shares around the world.</p>
          <p>If I start with the BRICs, you know our share in Brazil, approaching 71, and that up against the second and third multinational competitors, one at about 3% share and the other at about 14. Russia has been, as said, we continue to hold a leadership, a strong leadership position, twice the level of our nearest competitor, who is declining on a year to date basis. India, our share is up, as Bina said. China, our market share is up, and the nearest multinational competitor is down a point.</p>
          <p>And Mexico, the market share is running around 83, with the nearest multinational competitor around 11, 11.5, and the more near in trends favorable to us.</p>
          <p>And I could show you that on toothbrushes around all of those markets where we continue to make favorable progress.</p>
          <p>So I would say GlaxoSmithKline situation, as before, and Procter &amp; Gamble, the new markets that we have talked about before, and the kind of results I've just taken you through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is Mexico getting better share-wise? I think that was one of the few places I think, at least my data showed that you've been losing share. It sounds like more recently, it's gotten better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Nielsen scan data shows that it's getting better. And remember, Bill, we have seen these things before, and I've often said our 85, 86 can drift down to 81, 82, and their 8 to 9 can drift up to 13, 14, and then there is a cycle to these events. Pleasingly, the near in market shares show the share on their side weakening as our share strengthens. Obviously, we will continue to be attentive to what we're doing in the market. I was actually just down there in the past several weeks, as I was in Russia and India, and feel quite comfortable with the programs they have in place.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, good morning.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I wanted to talk a little bit about the gross margins. I know at the height of the restructuring, 75 to 125 basis points. If I just heard your commentary correct, you're saying some of the commodity pressures will be offset by the funding the growth. So I guess the question is twofold. One, can you just talk maybe about the role of pricing next year, which has also been obviously an important driver of organic sales in the past couple years.</p>
          <p>And then two, can you put it into the context of maybe some bigger cost-saving initiatives? Is there anything underway? I'm not talking about a la 2004, but is there something, more acceleration on the cost-saving front, that will help you still drive the gross margins and get towards that 65 long-term goal? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jason. Yeah, when we were working our way through the restructuring process, you will remember we took up our more historical gross margin annual expansion range from 50 to 100 basis points, to 75 to 125 basis points. And if you go back to history, when commodity prices are against you, have tended to say that we will be at the low end of that 50 to 100 basis points range. And when commodity prices are with you, we would tend to be at the higher end of that range, in a world without a restructuring. So as we think gross margin going forward, that's how I think we should think about it for 2011.</p>
          <p>Pricing. Again, if you take out the extraordinary years of 2008 and 2009, the contribution of price on a global basis has tended to be in the 0.5% to 1.5% range. And again, while early days, I think as we think about 2011, we should think about it in those terms.</p>
          <p>And to your final point, always we are considering opportunities we have, linked as we are by SAP around world now, to regionalize or globalize process, organization, structure, and sourcing. We talked on the last call about the opening of the European business service center in Warsaw and how we're running the back office of 27 operations through that hub, bringing savings, benefit and better quality, more efficient reporting, and to the extent we can identify more of those, and we are aggressively pursuing them in that overhead area, we will be most certainly executing them, working them through the P&amp;L as we can for 2011. No question.</p>
          <p>And some of the initiatives that we have underway obviously contributed to the 20 basis points gain that we got in reduced overhead in this quarter. So, you're right Jason, a strong area of focus on top of our more traditional gross margin oriented initiatives.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>One follow-up and then one other question. Just on the gross margin, can you give a sense of what you're anticipating for oil prices for next year compared to I think the $85 number that you used for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're in the $80 to $85 range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just in terms of consumer spending levels in the U.S. and Europe in particular, could you give us a sense of what you're seeing there in terms of what the spending is looking like? And then relatedly, are you seeing any benefit from this push towards more trade spending in terms of volumes or just other sort of things that you can give us to say, hey, this is actually starting to really work for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's talk about the consumer. I think true around the world, but particularly true in the developed world, the consumer is looking for value. And as we have said before, value is not price, necessarily. And therefore, I think our and other people's job as marketers, is to continue to create an innovation stream that while offering innovation at all price points has the ability to have consumers pay a higher price, and want to pay a higher price and believe they get the right value from a superior product. And that, for example, is exactly the strategy that is playing out with Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief, a clinically proven benefit of instant and long lasting relief, a super premium price, and the consumer thinks that price is worth paying for the benefit that they are getting.</p>
          <p>As we see the consumer behavior translated into purchasing, we tend to see them staying with the same brand. So if they were buying our Colgate Total, which is the premium price product, they continue to buy Colgate Total, and Bina talked about some of the shares in Mexico, for example, strengthening, even though it is a premium business.</p>
          <p>What we are seeing more of is the consumer changing the way she is shopping. And we are seeing the discounter club and mass merchandise retailers are getting more of the consumers' business. And then also interestingly, in the U.S., the drug or the small mom and pop stores getting the business, usually the larger stores at the beginning of the payday cycle, and the smaller stores at the end of the payday cycle. So that's kind of the consumers' behavior. Stays with brands, private label going down, as Bina said, in the U.S., particularly on personal care, and oral care categories, but buys in different places and is seeking value. So that's the shape of the consumer.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You called out raw materials and funding the growth. What were the numbers for pricing, promotion mix, et cetera, the other components?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing was no contribution to margin this quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then same follow up is, you mentioned that you expected for next year for there to be a raw material cost headwind of 3.5% to 6%. Is that 350 to 600 basis points to gross margins or is that that your -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the year on year percentage increase in our raw material purchases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So does, and that is purely on -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On raw and packing materials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; on raw materials. Because when you talked about gross margins and the moving pieces in the past, my understanding is that currency plays into that raw material piece. So this is excluding any offset from benefits of currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Our current thinking, Lauren, is it's not going to be such an effect next year. We're thinking that impact is going to be similar to what it was this year. So you can take the 3 to 6, 3.5 to 6 as basically the percentage increase on this year, dollar costs for buying all of our raw and packing materials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then the other thing was, when you talk through market growth, and saying that emerging markets are growing high single digits, developed low singles, with that, you said that was value, right? It wasn't, okay. So if I just put those two together, that would suggest aggregate category growth for where you compete should be maybe in the 4% to 5% range, but your organic this quarter was 3. So can you maybe talk about where shares aren't so positive?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>

          <p>And that's all categories everywhere around the world. Right? So that's all categories.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is that consistent with what you, where you felt categories were in the second quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, one more thing, actually. With Latin America, last quarter, you helped us out by giving a sense about how much Venezuela contributed to pricing and detracted from volume in the quarter. Could you do the same this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just say, Lauren, I read your note. You are right, If you look at the third quarter volume without Venezuela, it is sequentially modestly down for Latin America compared to the second quarter, which is what you were deducing, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The comment I would make, though, is that sequentially, Mexico and Brazil, second to third, are up. And the impact in Latin America specific to this quarter was the impact of the timing of promotional activity, specifically in Colombia.</p>

And then as a follow up on that, because I'm not sure I'm clear on this, if you've addressed it, but particularly in the context of your -the positive commentary you made around private label competition, do you view today's heightened level and the heightened level from the last couple quarters as a structural shift in the amount of trade spend it takes to support your products?

But as I said earlier, if we talk trade spending in two parts now, one is strict price promotion, the other may be shopper marketing activity at retail, which includes merchandising and display activity. My bet is that over time, we will see the price promotion ease. Now when to call that is a difficult thing to do, and as we said on the second quarter call, we haven't assumed that for the balance of this year.</p>
          <p>But the other part of trade spending, which is related to shopper marketing initiatives based on a marketing strategy and an insight to drive brand engagement at the retail level, is actually in our view a good strategic investment, with a good ROI, not just in terms of the impact on category and brand volume and share at retail level, but also in terms of building the equity, particularly in those more challenged North American and European environments. So it's completing the job of brand engagement at retail level and not all of it is price related.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then just one last follow up. So, the price promotion piece of the, you know, what you broadly view as trade expenditures, you said you weren't assuming any abatement for the rest of 2010. What about in 2011? Do you think it'll be negative at the margin, positive at the margin, or just sort of more of the same?</p>

          <p>Frankly, John, I haven't completed the process. That really is one where rather than listening to the general chatter at 60,000 feet, we prefer to go through it country by country and understand the data of what exactly is going on in Thailand versus Ecuador versus Denmark. So I'll take a pass on that, and we will most surely answer it once we have been through our budget process on the next call.</p>

I know it may be too early, but should we be looking at these to be at a similar level to the 1.8, 1.9 billion that you've guided for full year '10 or will we see it step back a little bit more in line with sort of the historic $1 billion rate that you were buying shares?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. First of all, I was hoping that you or Bina could just quickly, the toothpaste market shares in the third quarter in the U.S., could you speak to what they were year over year? And then I was just wanting to get a better handle on your productivity initiatives, both overhead management and the funding the growth for next year. You talked about funding the growth, for example, offsetting the commodity cost outlook, which if I took your numbers and plugged them into your gross margin, you're implying roughly about 200 or 300 basis points of commodity cost pressure next year. So you're expecting roughly that same amount on funding the growth as an offset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you were to look at this on that point, Alex, if we look at this quarter, we got 210 basis points of gross margin on our funding the growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the answer is yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, yes. Okay. Great, and then the market share question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the &#x2013; I actually have it by months, not broken down by quarter, because well, just because I don't. The, if you look at all outlet shares in the U.S., we're about neck and neck with our leading competitor, in the mid 30, in the mid 30 area.</p>
          <p>If you track the months, the latest period is consistent with that at about exactly the same level as the year to date. The prior month was slightly lower by a point or two based on the introductory activity behind their whitening product, the 3D whitening product, which indeed got off to a very good start. And of course, as Bina mentioned on the call, we are now at work in terms of that re-launch with Colgate Total, with our innovation activity coming back in the fourth quarter. So year to date, about even, and if I take the months of the third quarter, because I don't have the entire month, July and September at about the same level, August slightly lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, are you saying the market shares are flat year over year in the past few months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, our market share is modestly down year on year, largely related to the incursion of Glaxo. So our market share in total is about a point down.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Bina, can you give me one quick clarification on the raw materials thing. I know you said 3.5% to 6% increase in dollar cost of what you're buying. So how do I think about that relative to, your sales are going to increase, too. So in other words, If your sales are up 3.5 to 6, and your raw materials bought, they're up 3.5 to 6, does that mean that on a percentage of sales basis, that those aren't going up? Or is that 3.5 to 6 an inflation number on top of just the notable volume increase you'll see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do it in constant volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, that helps. And just one other clarification, I guess, if your pricing is going to be plus, in that range of plus a half to one and a half in 2011 you've seen historically, I guess, despite the fact that you're probably going to grow next year's earnings at about half the rate that you normally grow, and part of that's going to be increased levels of promotion. I guess, where else might pricing be coming through, and does it get back to that commodities inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I &#x2013; in terms of our focus, the focus for us would be on A&amp;P. So to the extent that we can hold our pricing, and remember, we haven't been through the process yet, in that half to a point and a half range, terrific. If we don't believe we can, in terms of the plan, then that won't be the contribution from price. But our orientation is to try to put as much of our investment spending on A&amp;P to drive the trial of the new product flow that we have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Andrew.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I was wondering if you could give a little color on like oral care versus personal and home care, because at least in the U.S. data that we've seen, oral care hold up reasonably well, but things like Palmolive and some of the deodorant businesses have been more pressured. Is that something that we've seen globally? And I was wondering if you can give us some context around, of your 3% organic sales growth, what was oral care, substantially more than that, and how have those relative trends behaved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me try to give you some global data on that. Sorry, I couldn't see for looking. The &#x2013; we can talk anything we want, Andrew. Let me get third quarter and maybe let's talk organic growth for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That works. You can just mail the sheet to me if you want, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, no. We'll be &#x2013; I can read okay every now and then. The, you know, what you see in terms of the organic growth is oral care strong mid single digits, personal care mid single digits, and home care low single digits. So that's the profile. Frankly, that's the profile it's been for quite a while, because obviously we put more of our effort behind the personal care categories, as you know from our strategy.</p>
          <p>So our oral care business, as you say, and these are global number, by the way, this is not &#x2013; I'm not talking U.S. now. And so that has been pretty consistent, pretty consistent around the world market by market.</p>
          <p>If you focus in on the U.S., the one competitive spot beyond oral care in the U.S. business has been the stepped up activity in dish liquid, and you know what that has been, the introduction of a new brand to compete in that space. Our market share is down about a point, and we have responded with sizing and pricing actions that are under way, and we have three new strong pieces of innovation coming early in 2011, only one of which I will talk about, which is a dish liquid that provides a germ killing benefit actually on the plates themselves for superior hygiene, which we think is a strong idea. Retail reaction has been good, and we will be driving that business aggressively as we get into the new year. Otherwise, the U.S. profile is pretty much like the rest of the world.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a quick one on the dish side. When you say sizing, I know you guys had done a concentration this year. Are you reversing that back out because it didn't work?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Nik.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just a couple questions. In categories where you've seen some of your bigger competitors kind of come in with increased intensity, what have you seen to the actual category growth rate? And maybe you can just give Brazil as an example, if you have the numbers in front of you. And then the second question is, most of your penetration in oral care is primarily in brush and in toothpaste. So I guess there's also a lot of white space for Colgate to attack. Any thoughts about kind of getting into the other areas of oral care?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you, frankly, Nik, the growth numbers in the category are still in those high single digits. I mean, you're either shifting people between brands, but the pace of bringing new people into a category or increasing their per capita consumption tends to have an evenness to it. So you may get period-to-period shift, but on an annual basis, the growth rates are still in the zone that I mentioned to you.</p>
          <p>In terms of segments that we are not in, where we can drive performance and growth, you know, of course, that if you go around the world, and look at the segments in oral care, toothpaste is by far and away the single biggest segment, followed by toothbrushes, and then third would be mouth rinse. And of course, you know from some of Bina's remarks and comments that we have made before, that we have for the last several years had a very strong focus and still do have a very strong focus on driving both that category, which is in many countries growing double digit consistently, and of course, building our market share at the same time, and mouth rinse shares both the growth and the gross margin characteristics that we so like in oral care. So I guess the third territory that we would stake out is the international mouthwash market.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. So taking a look at the Latin American business, and you talked about sort of the volumes being sort of flattish. And I guess the question is, you've talked over the past couple years, as we've had this raw material and FX volatility, about the playbook related to pricing, and here's what you do when you get this volatility. And I guess, looking at the results over the past couple of quarters, is there any change to the playbook? Is there something that played out differently than you would have anticipated, as we've seen the volumes go sort of closer to flattish?</p>
          <p>And then I guess the other question that goes along with that would be, maybe one of the reasons why you've had this strategy you've had is because you guys give earnings guidance on a dollar basis, as opposed to sort of an FX-neutral business. And have you given any thought, given some of the volatility, to maybe changing how you end up guiding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the second question, we debate options often. We have elected thus far not to change the way we guide. We are a diverse global company, and therefore, we guide the way we guide in terms of the dollar performance as it actually is.</p>
          <p>In terms of Latin America relative to the playbook, no. I would say our thinking relative to the playbook has not changed. The principal weight on Latin America this year has been Venezuela playing out.</p>

          <p>Could you just provide a quick update on the resizing and repricing of the Hill's business, Ian? Have the new sizes kind of made it to the retail shelf? And it sounds like we should expect volume to be flat in the fourth quarter, but should we get back to more of a historical trend in the mid single digits as we move into 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the short answer is yes. The sizing and pricing is in place. As Bina said, we have seen volume, reported volume, dollar weighted volume, increase in Europe, and in the U.S., and we have for the past six months seen units increase, and for the last couple of reporting periods seen that convert into volume growth. So we believe the mechanical fix that needed to be made is both made and is effective at retail.</p>
          <p>As we said on last call, and to your point, modest nearly flat volume this quarter, expectation for flat next, and a return to volume growth in 2011. And as we have said on previous calls, that has a lot to do with the innovation stream that we are now bringing to bear on Hill's. Bina mentioned some of them, and there are several others that have not yet been announced publicly, and therefore I will refrain, but the move now is having fixed the base, we're now moving to a stepped up innovation flow supported by trial building, marketing activity, and we are hopeful of turning back to good sustainable volume growth in 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our final question today from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Alice</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I slipped in. I'm trying to get at the price/mix question, or the price question that other people have asked. You're saying you're determined to get your volume accelerating in 2011. Do you also feel determined to have your organic sales growth accelerate into 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Alice, absolutely. Part of our intention here is setting ourselves the target of returning to the pace of organic growth that we have seen in the not-too-distant past, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which was what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which was strong mid single digits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're determined to get back to 4 to 7, something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good spread, Alice. Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, do you think you can do that in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's what our preliminary budget planning is taking us to. We will work through the budget process and put the plans together necessary to do that. So that's our intention, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my other question is on mix, which I know that you put into volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dollar-weighted volume, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>is mix &#x2013; can you talk about what's happening with mix? And is it continuing to be positive in oral care through these difficult times? And then the second part of that question is, if it is positive in oral care, is it positive, neutral or negative for you overall, considering what might be happening in home care?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; that's a very broad question. I guess my only way of answering it would be to say that we continue to see in oral care the premium priced and margin accretive variance lead the growth of that business, which would be a way of saying yes, that certainly product portfolio mix would be favorable. Beyond that, I really don't have the data at the top of my head to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, within home care, are you seeing a downward shift in mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mix is less of an issue in home care because the portfolio tends to be more homogenous from a margin point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All righty. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks very much, guys. Thanks to all the Colgate people around the world who make it happen, and talk to you in the New Year.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>That does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.</p>
