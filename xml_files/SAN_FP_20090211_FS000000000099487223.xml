          <p>Good morning to those in the room. And good morning to those of you who are following us via webcast in the U.S. My name is S&#xE9;bastien Martel. I am in charge of Investor Relations. I have the pleasure to welcome you to the full year 2008 results and outlook presentation. Sorry. Can we go back to the forward-looking statements? Yes.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I'd like to advise people following us via webcast or by phone today that our press release and our slides are available on our website. As always, I have to advise you that the presentation today will contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially and these factors are actually detailed in our Form 20-F and also in the document de r&#xE9;f&#xE9;rence.</p>
          <p>Our presentation today will be divided in two parts. First, our CEO, Mr. Chris Viehbacher will actually lay out what his vision for sanofi-aventis is. In the second part, we will have Mr. Hanspeter Spek, who is Executive VP for Pharmaceutical Operations, who will comment on the 2008 sales performance. Laurence Debroux, our CFO, will then comment on the financial performance in 2008. After Mr. Viehbacher will have provided concluding remarks, Marc Cluzel, Senior VP of Research will actually join us on the floor together with Wayne Pisano, who is President and CEO of sanofi pasteur.</p>
          <p>With that I will pass the floor over to Mr. Viehbacher.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, S&#xE9;bastien and good afternoon everybody. It's a pleasure to see a lot of friends, I haven't seen for a little while and certainly since I've moved from orange to light blue. I am obviously &#x2013; been in this job for all of 10 weeks. It's been a pretty busy 10 weeks. We had a couple of weeks of pretty harried activity getting the budget done and approved by the Board. We've launched 12 transformation programs in the company and trying to get around to see as many of our teams as we can, doing town halls and webcasts, and France, Germany, the United States going around to see some key external stakeholders, trying to bring in some new physicians. But I tell you it feels great to be at this new company and I'd like to share with you today just a few things about some of the things that I have discovered coming into the organization, and then obviously a little bit about where I think we as an organization have the potential to go.</p>
          <p>Now, I've got a first slide up here, which talks about 2008 results. If you show up on first of December, you can't claim much credit for these results and that obviously goes to Hanspeter Spek and to Wayne Pisano. But I would like to just make a few comments because it goes a little bit to some of the things that I'd like to talk to the company about. I mean at first &#x2013; if you look at that box to the right, I mean there is some fabulous growth platforms that this company has built over time.</p>
          <p>You look at Plavix growing at 10.5% and what strikes me just as a newcomer to the business is, not only are these products that are growing in strong double-digits, but a lot of these products I have competed against first of all and I can tell you these are the gold standard in their categories. I mean Lovenox is a very difficult product to compete against. We had a very successful launch last year of Pentacel, and I'm very glad I switched companies when I did, because Wayne and his team have already grabbed 50% of that market share.</p>
          <p>We have a very, very strong U.S. based vaccines business. We've got two products that we've actually filed with the FDA this year. So we've got Multaq and Ciltyri. I mean Multaq, for me, is a very interesting product, because, I think, this is really the type of approach that the FDA is looking for. We've gone and done the long-term outcome studies, we've shown a 24% reduction in hospitalizations and cardiovascular death. So you've got a situation where there is clearly an older product around. We have had some issues with tolerability on that older product. But rather than just say, well, we'll rely on tolerability, what difference does it actually mean to a patient, and the company's made that investment, made that commitment, and we'll have seen the great results of ATHENA, and Hanspeter is going to come back and talk about that, but I think it does show that the company has adapted to what the regulatory environment requires. Now we've got to get it through the FDA, and we all know what challenges that can bring.</p>
          <p>Ciltyri is also another interesting product. You know, I looked at it first, and said 'okay, this is a sleep agent that doesn't help you fall asleep'. And we've discovered this new indication called chronic insomnia with nocturnal awakenings, and I looked at it and said 'this sounds a little bit like Restless Legs Syndrome to me. And I remember when we were launching that &#x2013; you know is there an indication? Less than 5% of physicians actually knew about that indication at the time, and I think the ATHENA, the chronic insomnia with nocturnal awakenings, has the potential to deal with that. But I will tell you, if anybody can do it, if anybody knows the sleep market, it's our company.</p>
          <p>I mean you just look at not only the progress of Ambien, but Ambien CR versus Lunesta, so I have got a lot of confidence in that. And we've got some very strong growth, not just the U.S. market, I mean, that was nice to see that return to growth, growing five times the rate of the U.S. market. Very strong double-digit growth in our emerging markets, and the all-important Japanese market. And we've been able to progress on our SG&amp;A to sales ratio. And, of course, all of that led to double-digit growth at constant dollar exchange rates, which means that we are above expectations, and above the last guidance we gave back in the third quarter, which is 9%.</p>
          <p>And I'll take an opportunity here to say that we are going to change the way we give guidance. We are giving guidance &#x2013; going forward, and everything I'm about to say today is at constant exchange rates. So, we're going to keep it simple. I don't manage the exchange rates any more than I can manage the weather. I think constant exchange rates gives the best view of the underlying business performance. Clearly, when you see the geographic spread of our business, it makes sense to take into account all exchange rates not just the dollar. So, we'll either talk to you in actual exchange rates or constant exchange rates, for all of our announcements going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, I don't need it to go through the list of challenges that this industry faces. You know this better than I do. But one of the things I would like to do is, say, okay, yes we have these challenges, but there are some real opportunities out there. When you start thinking about, what's the strategy going forward, what you really want to do is say, where do I find new reservoirs of growth? Where am I not really strong today? And where can I sell more? And when you think about the fact that two-thirds of the world's population doesn't really have much access to healthcare, and the fact that we've really focused on just the rich markets, then I think, you see that there is a clear underlying need for more healthcare. The whole world's population is getting older, and the whole world's population is starting to take on nutritional styles that are going to drive more demand for healthcare. We've also got some new sources of funding. People like the Gates Foundation coming into the picture and PEPFAR.</p>
          <p>And so, in emerging markets, it's not a model any more that you are going to give away your products for free. There are people who will actually buy those products, and tiered pricing is now a fact, a fact of life. And obviously, we can use some of this transformation to drive productivity enhancement and I'll show that.</p>
          <p>So, as I look at this business, first thing I say is actually, if I were to read a number of analyst reports and you talk to some people, a lot of people would have said, I think about sanofi-aventis &#x2013; I think about Plavix, I think about Acomplia. Plavix is going to go away and Acomplia didn't come. So, that's it.</p>
          <p>Well, let me tell you, I mean what I've certainly found is a lot more to sanofi-aventis than either Plavix or Acomplia. And I think the solid fundamentals are something that are not well understood outside the business. And so, I'd like to just take a little bit of time to go into that because for me these create the platforms of growth that we're looking for going forward. So, the other thing that is a little bit complicated with our company, is that of course, we don't consolidate all of the sales of those things which drive our business. We're a company that actually has been built on partnerships. So, all of Plavix sales, as you well know, are not in our books. So, Plavix in the United States is not in our books and obviously we have sales in our books for Europe that we then share with BMS later.</p>
          <p>But this actually extends beyond that. So, if I take our vaccines business, really the sales you see in our books are just the sales we have in the United States and some smaller emerging markets. Well, we've clearly got a very robust vaccines business in Europe, look at that growing 21.8% and the fact that we've done this joint venture with Merck allows us to really participate in the portfolios of two companies, ours and Merck. And, of course, when you do that, you see that we've actually got about a business that's closer to &#x20AC;4 billion that's going very strongly and will go forward at a similar rate.</p>
          <p>I didn't know &#x2013; I mean I've got a Labrador at home and been using Frontline for years, didn't know that was a sanofi company. We also share this 50-50 with Merck through Merial. This is an extremely important business. This is a business that has been growing nicely at 7.9%, 2.6 billion. You won't find that in our sales either but we have 50% of that company.</p>
          <p>Generics, we've kind of got a foothold there. We're pretty modest &#x20AC;350 million and ranked 23rd. It looks like we're going to be able to carry through the Zentiva acquisition. We've got European approval for that. The minority shareholders that had launched litigation have pretty much withdrawn that. So, I think we're pretty confident that we're going to be able to close that transaction this quarter. If we do that, that would put us actually in the 10th position in terms of generics.</p>
          <p>But even at that small basis, I am pretty proud of that team. When I went and saw the team in Germany, I discovered that the Sick Fund had done two tender offers and we had won one of them. So, we went up against the likes of oratsio Pharm and won. So, that gives me a lot of confidence to say we can bolt on to this business and build it.</p>
          <p>Now, OTC, we're 1.4 billion and growing, and I'll tell you a little bit more about that. It's a good base. I will say it's not really run as an OTC business but, as I say, we can build onto it. And obviously, the core drugs business is very strong.</p>
          <p>So, here is another thing. I remember looking at Novartis' third quarter presentation and they were all proud of the fact that they were saying, they were the second best company in the industry in terms of geographic spread of sales. So it begged the question, who's first?</p>
          <p>Well, guess what, that's us. And we haven't necessarily told that story in a big way, but what you can see is that actually we've got about a third of our business in the U.S., third of our business a little more in Europe and a third of our business then outside of U.S. and Europe. Why is that important?</p>
          <p>Well, because I think most people are moving to a model to say, you really don't want to be more exposed than you have to be to the small molecule business particularly in the United States and top five EU markets, where you are subject to all of the vagaries of patent life and patent extension. What you want to do is have a more geographic spread of that, particularly because those markets are growing strongly and we know that economic growth and healthcare expenditure correlate perfectly and we're only scratching the surface in terms of the numbers of patients.</p>
          <p>Now, the other thing I'd point out to you is this company is often referred to as a company that's very franco-fran&#xE7;aise. Look at this; this is a company that was the first one into China. This is a company that has adapted to the market conditions locally and is being very successful in Mexico. You know if you take our Africa business, &#x20AC;750 million growing at 13%, if I had a product that was &#x20AC;750 million growing at 13%, you know most of us would be all over that. But how many of you really know that we have an African business that's that size and growing at that rate? And so to me in some ways we have to look at these products and regions a little bit in the same way as we look at products of that size. And of course, number 10 in Japan, and I will talk about that a little bit later.</p>
          <p>So vaccines, vaccines, a wonderful business. Why is it a wonderful business? Well, from a public health point of view, it's obviously good. There is no better cost effectiveness argument you're ever going to make than a vaccine. But the second thing of course is that it's very hard to compete with anybody in this business. We are in the process of building a factory for our brand new vaccines; it's going to cost us &#x20AC;350 million to build that. The capital intensity of this business and the competencies that are required are almost natural barriers to entry. I couldn't even tell you the patent expiry dates of some of our key vaccines. But you are not going to go and spend all this money and develop all those competencies really just to have the generics markets.</p>
          <p>And we also know there is a huge unmet need. I mean, the opportunity of vaccines in Asia, there is plenty of work that has to be done to achieve that potential. But it's worth a huge amount to the company. Now, we also end up having a very well balanced portfolio, not only for North America, not only for Europe, but we do have products that are going to be able to deal with some of the world's major health issues, like dengue and that's the vaccine for which we're building this factory. 230 million people get affected by dengue fever every year; two million are going to develop a more severe form in terms of the hemorrhagic fever that comes with that. So, there's a huge opportunity there in that vaccine and given this is where some of the new money has come in in the tiered pricing, this actually ends up being a huge opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>So, we've got a very strong portfolio here, we've got very clearly strong industrial operations. One of the things that's so important to this market as an example is the flu market, and I have been in that flu market in the United States. The number one success factor is being first out the door, because those who get out the door, there are four or five people now in that flu market in the United States. Those people who get out of the door first get the best price and sell their vaccine first. If you're out of the door late, you're going to end up with having to eat that stuff in terms of returns.</p>
          <p>sanofi-aventis is consistently the first company out of the door. And this year I think, Wayne, it was 5th of September, I mean, beat everybody by several weeks. So, it shows that this is not only a great baseness, but we manage this business, I think very well. Now I put this one up for a couple of reasons. There is kind of this perception that that sanofi-aventis has missed the train on biotech. Did you know that 30% of our sales come from biological products? I mean, if you take Lantus, Lovenox and vaccines &#x2013; 30% of our business.</p>
          <p>Now you may say, well that's not what I think about when I think about a biotech business, but hey, these things walk and talk like biotech products in terms of the difficulties of getting generics, the capital intensity, the competencies to do that. So &#x2013; and Lovenox is that way. Now you're going to see that our guidance has been qualified to allow for a major adverse event such as generic substitution for Lovenox, nothing new you've seen it before. We have to put it in because it's probably the biggest uncertainty that we have to deal with.</p>
          <p>Now coming in from outside, I would say, and I obviously don't have the granularity of knowledge that my colleagues do. But as I look at it, I said last year we had a major heparin scandal. We couldn't even buy enough heparin, this year we are still very tight on supply. So, you have to ask yourself; is the FDA really going to take an aggressive approach to substitutability given the heparin scandal, given the fact that if you don't get the bioequivalence thing right, you could kill someone? And even if you do get a generic, it's not clear to us where they're actually going to get the supply of heparin, so that's why we have decided to qualify it in the guidance and not put it as part of our internal plans and budgets, but it does remain a risk.</p>
          <p>CHMP is chewing over exactly what the guidelines are for determining bioequivalence, then of course the U.S. regulatory pathway is also under evaluation and that may change with a new administration as well. But obviously Lovenox is a very strong driver of growth for us, a strong franchise and as I say &#x2013; I, we tried a lot of effort and we've been chipping away through &#x2013; we chipped away an awful lot through Arixtra [GlaxoSmithKline's (fondaparinux sodium)] but it's still peanuts compared to where Lovenox is in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Lantus to me is also a wonderful product. Clearly, this has differentiation in terms of it being a 24-hour product. But you look at something like the SoloSTAR pen, this is again where I've certainly seen in my background, if you come up with the device that's differentiated, really means something to a patient, you'll beat the competition. And given the competition is suing us, that says to me that they've been pretty successful at developing this. So, this has likely become our number one brand.</p>
          <p>We think there is plenty of opportunity for growth; you take China as an example. China is the second biggest population of diabetes patients in the world, 47 million. And clearly there is an opportunity &#x2013; now we may have to operate on a different price strategy, we may go more for volume than for price. But it shows the opportunity that there is. Diabetes and the thing that's really interested me over the last couple of years, we've tended to think of diabetes as being an industrialized country type illness. We're starting to see this in a lot of companies around the world &#x2013; countries around the world.</p>
          <p>Now OTC, I remember my webcast the day I joined the company said did you even know that we are the number six company in OTC and most people didn't know. And if you actually do the rankings and you add up the sales, yes we are sort of the sixth company. But we have to be honest that clearly we are not a serious OTC player in that sense. The business is concentrated in a few countries in particular five or six of them. But what it does say to me is, it's not zero. It says to me, I got some people in this business that understand that.</p>
          <p>So I can take some of those brands and actually invest elsewhere. And Hanspeter will go into this a little bit more. Because we used to have this thing called base business, &#x20AC;8 billion of business. Objective, don't make it go backwards, just kind of maintain it. But Hanspeter will show you that actually we could start to look at some of the products in that and there are growth brands and there are things that we can invest in. And if you're thinking about growth platform, why do you need it? Well, you're not going to go buy a &#x20AC;20 million OTC company, if you've got nothing. If you already have a business then you can afford to do that. Then the smaller bolt-on acquisitions start to make sense. And I've been saying for a couple of weeks now, I mean, you think about Pfizer spending $68 billion to buy Wyeth really to try to get to where we already are. I mean, we already have a major vaccines presence, we have some OTC and we have biologicals business. So, it says that you've got the competence and some credibility to actually go forward and build upon it.</p>
          <p>Japan is huge for us, 150 million people, so you're talking about a market that's about half the size of the U.S. and the nice thing about it is &#x2013; look, I mean, the drugs that have really driven the growth of this company over a decade are very early in their lifecycle. Plavix recently launched Lovenox, Taxotere, Lantus, Myslee, which is Ambien in Japan; those are all very early in their lifecycle, this is a market that's scoring at 18%. So again, if you start thinking about a country as a product, that's $1.4 billion of business growing at 18.5%.</p>
          <p>Now the emerging market is interesting, if you look at the two bars, so you got the one on the left is actually the pharma market, and the dark blue shaded piece are the classical BRICM markets, so, Brazil, Russia, India, China and Mexico. The light blue are all the other emerging market countries.</p>
          <p>Now what you see is we're clearly outperforming the BRICM slightly which represent 26% roughly of the market and we have 31.5% in terms of the growth. The bar height is the percentage of world pharma market growth that's coming from those countries. So 26% of the global healthcare market growth is coming from those BRICM countries. 31% of our growth is coming from those markets. But what's interesting is you can see the importance of all these other markets. And so we have a very significant presence in a lot of markets such as for instance Morocco and Algeria, number one in those markets; Turkey, South Korea. And that's, I think, extremely important again because those are growth markets and yes, there is going to be probably some impact here of the economic crisis. There is no question that we're already seeing some slowing down of growth in the Chinese and the Indian markets. But you also have to remember there's a huge reserve of patients that we're not even reaching. And this is where the broad product portfolio comes in.</p>
          <p>I bet you here nobody in the room has ever heard of the product Combiflam. Anybody, you know what Combiflam is? This is a product we sell in India, it reaches one-third of households in India. Now that's a lot of people and a lot of volume. And it comes back to saying well, we've got a product portfolio that's adapted to those markets. We're not really using this anymore as a metric, the top 15 sales. If you take top 15 for an average European country, we're about two-thirds, 70% of sales. You go off to China, you go off to India, top 15 is like less than a third of our business.</p>
          <p>So we've got a product portfolio that's actually pretty interesting in terms of developing in those markets. And we've figured out how to manufacture there. So roughly 47% of the volume that we sell, we sell in the southern hemisphere. 37% of the volume we make, we also make in the southern hemisphere. The manufacturing facility that we have that produces the most in volume and is bursting to capacity is actually our factory in Brazil.</p>
          <p>So we've &#x2013; again it comes back to saying to me, this is a company that has figured out how it can actually profitably sell in these markets. Because the other things you're going to be saying is well, you're going to get into OTC, you're going to get into emerging markets, isn't all that low margin stuff? None of the businesses I'm talking to you today about have less than 40 to 50% operating margin. So we can do that.</p>
          <p>Now, the only thing that worries me as I look at that graph to the right is, other companies have figured this out, and Novartis is hard on our heels and there is no way in heck that we're going to let Novartis overtake us in these markets or anywhere else for that matter.</p>
          <p>So what's another thing that you often hear about sanofi-aventis? Well, we don't do any cost cutting. And in fact I can tell you &#x2013; actually just even talking about cost reduction has been kind of a new experience for our presentations here. But actually when you look and see, this is a company that has been very quietly, very modestly doing a heck of a job at managing resources effectively.</p>
          <p>We are that dark blue line with the little circles on it. The X-axis is your SG&amp;A cost to sales line. And so a lot of other companies get a lot of credit for cost-cutting. sanofi-aventis has actually gone on and done it.</p>
          <p>Now, your next question maybe well, if you're already so good, there's probably no more room to cut, nonsense. There is plenty of resource in this pharmaceutical industry. I don't think we have actually begun to scratch the surface on what we can do in terms of efficiency.</p>
          <p>One of the things if you're looking at a lot of external growth opportunities is how you're able to finance them, especially in this kind of a marketplace. Well, that's another strength of this business in my view. Very little debt and in fact even with the acquisition of Zentiva, we should be actually in a virtual zero-debt situation by the end of this year. We're throwing off close to 4 billion euros every year in cash flow prior to dividends. You can do an awful lot with that.</p>
          <p>Now, I will also say, just because you got it doesn't mean you go waste it, and I think one of the things that has been a hallmark of this organization, and especially Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Dehecq over the years has shown actually how you do this and create shareholder value, and just because we have the cash flow doesn't mean that we're going to go and ignore those principles of making sure that this is driving growth and this is driving shareholder value. We will have disciplined M&amp;A activities.</p>
          <p>Another thing we wanted to try to do is try to put the patent expiries into context. Now, what we try to do is the Camembert there is representing our sales picture and the various slices of that really correspond to the 2008 sales of those products, which will face some genericization between now and 2012. Now, the reason it's complicated is obviously because of the numbers that you have on the lower right hand side of that slide. Plavix and Aprovel or Avapro as it's known in the U.S. are not in our numbers and they are clearly going to face this. But I can tell you if you got to have a patent cliff, it's great to share it with someone. And that's what we have done; we don't have all of Plavix. So actually, what we did is, we try to do a simulation, if we kind of proportionately consolidated Plavix for the U.S., but then also deconsolidated the piece that we share with CMS in Europe, you still actually end up coming back to about 20% of the pipeline.</p>
          <p>Now, in this of course, I don't have Lovenox. Lovenox, we believe to be a biological product and doesn't face the same risk. So we're trying to be consistent with it. But obviously you don't have Lovenox on that, which would add probably another 10% if you were differently minded.</p>
          <p>Now, pipeline. You might look at this and say, this looks like a great pipeline. Let's be right up front with everybody here. We know that we don't have enough product &#x2013; new products today to replace all of the products that we are going to lose when patents go off in 2012. However, there are some very interesting things in this pipeline and I think I'll talk about a pipeline review that we're doing. It's not quite as easy because I know on some of your reports, you've written things like well, yes, but there is products in here that are in search of an indication.</p>
          <p>And so I came in there and we've had a great late stage business review with our commercial colleagues and R&amp;D. And it's not quite so black and white as to whether something is a value or not a value, and just to give you a feel for what we are going through. If you take AVE 5026, which is kind of the son of Lovenox, you'd first say, well, what the heck are doing here? You've got orals coming in here. Rivaroxaban looks like a great product, why are you continuing to develop this thing? Good question, so we went back and had a look at it, we had our commercial colleagues talk to our R&amp;D colleagues and say there are actually &#x2013; we have an opportunity on oncology and we have an opportunity in prophylaxis at least in abdominal surgery where the orals are not going to compete. But we're prepared to say, let's not go spend all this money on developing the general medical indication. And certainly if you looked at what we would have to spend in marketing and sales, the NPV of this product was initially negative.</p>
          <p>After we got through with it and we looked at it and changed the indications and obviously we are not going to have near the investment in marketing and sales, we've got a nice little earner here. We've got a positive NPV and it'll be a mid-sized product, not a blockbuster probably but certainly that's going to help pay the rent. So that's the kind of process that we're going through and there are some things on here that I think are not going to survive very long, but I can tell you everybody in this industry has got stuff that is not going to survive either.</p>
          <p>The vaccine portfolio, I think is very interesting. I look at something like Hexaxim, that's a hexavalent vaccine that's going to be ideal again for the emerging markets. So as I look at it, I'd say wow, there is stuff that I can sell here. But again we're being realistic with this. This is an issue, I'll come back to saying we need to drive more innovation and we need to change our decision-making process about how we advance products. But there are some very interesting nuggets in here.</p>
          <p>So this is kind of just not trying to position sanofi-aventis versus some of our competitors. And again in the idea, what is there besides Plavix and Acomplia? We actually stack up pretty well in terms of being in biologics, being in vaccines, being in consumer health, being in animal health, obviously one star in generics and I think even at that we have to really count Zentiva to get to that one star if we're honest. But there is always room to grow from that. So I think if you believe that a more diversified model geographically in business is the route to success, as certainly I do, then I think this company is well poised at least in terms of having platforms upon which we can build.</p>
          <p>So that's kind of &#x2013; if you think about it where we start, you've got a big world out there in terms of where we can find growth. So what do we actually have to do going forward. And there are sort of four elements to this. There is no question that you cannot survive in this market. 20 years ago when I started in this business pretty much any new product coming along was going to have some value. That's not the case today. We all know that we have to provide value to payers and to physicians.</p>
          <p>We also know though that there is no global pharmaceutical market. This is regionally based. I've lived in a number of countries myself; healthcare and culture are intrinsically related. And given how much money gets spent in different markets you can't have the same healthcare offering in each and every market. We also know that there's no point in just continuing to be based in the United States and in Europe. We need to be looking for new sources of growth and that's where the innovation, and the global expansion and diversification comes in.</p>
          <p>And when you look all that and start saying, well, are you going to be in OTCs, you're going to be all over the world, we're clearly going to have to adapt our company, because as much as we are diversified, in some ways we're like a lot of other companies. We do still spend a lot of our time, management time, thinking about the U.S. and Europe and we're structured in that way. And so if we really want to capitalize on these platforms for growth we'll have to transform it and I'll come on to that.</p>
          <p>I'll just talk about &#x2013; we did three acquisitions last year, Symbion, a nutrition company in Australia, Acambis, which is a vaccines research company and Zentiva, a branded generic company based in Czech. I think you can see that this is very much in line with the strategy for where we want to go and the type of things that we want to do.</p>
          <p>I just like to spend a minute on Regeneron. I spent a day with Marc Cluzel in Upstate New York, going to see these folks. Again, it comes back to well are we or have we missed the boat on biotech? Well, this is something- a brainchild of Marc. Marc said, well, I've got a couple of options. I can go spend a gazillion dollars to go buy someone. I can go spend a gazillion dollars, take a lot of risk and build this thing myself or I can be a lot more economical and find someone who is good at this and actually partner with them and create that. And that's I think what he's done, and to me it's a very good model for how we want to do research, going forward.</p>
          <p>The left box talks about our VEGF Trap. This is &#x2013; looking in indications where Avastin isn't yet or in indications where Avastin has failed, we've got four Phase III studies in rolling. That's really the first product that's come out of that platform. But the one that interested me is the platform they have for creating antibodies and similar type molecules like Traps. And we're providing them with a budget every year. 12 targets we get to pick four, they get to pick eight. We can sit down and talk about which targets we go after.</p>
          <p>But they have the capacity to provide us with two to three antibodies every year and we obviously have a few of those already in our earlier stage pipeline with one antibody in Phase I &#x2013; or two of them in Phase I, we've got an IND filed on another and &#x2013; sorry, on two others. So I think it's a start and I think actually as I look at, that's not just a capacity for creating the molecules, they actually have some manufacturing capability, they've got medical capabilities, they already have themselves a small product for an orphan indication on the market. So they've got some regulatory and medical. And these are the type of people, you sit down with these folks, and they know what they are doing.</p>
          <p>So all of this comes into a three-pronged strategy, what we need to do to deliver our goals, increase innovation in R&amp;D, adapt the company and pursue external growth opportunities with what foreign objective. What we really need is more sustainable growth. The problem what the blockbuster model is, you spend a lot of money and you pray that a blockbuster is going to come your way. And when the blockbuster didn't come, you merged and you bought some time with cost synergies. But it's not really a terribly sustainable model. So what we're looking for is more of a sustainable model, we're looking for profitable growth and we also need to think about the risk profile, because just betting on the next blockbuster is highly risky and it doesn't work. So we launched 12 transformation projects, I'm going to really only spend a little time with a few.</p>
          <p>Obviously you can't keep spending 4.5 billion euros per year on research and development if you don't think you're getting enough out of it. So my intention is not to go on a cost-cutting exercise here, but it is my intention to pose five questions to our R&amp;D organization to which I expect an answer. And they're really designed around a few things that I think do need changing. I think two things in particular surprised me on this when I came in. First is that clearly the voice of the patient, the voice of the marketplace has not been integrated in R&amp;D decision-making.</p>
          <p>Our commercial teams &#x2013; we're not heavily involved in earlier stages; that started to change last year. I think we really are saying this got to be on a regular basis. We need to have some outside input, we need some sunshine on this, we need some good healthy scientific debate as to whether or not a project has value.</p>
          <p>So with that in mind, and one of the things I want to do then is, we've got teams of people who are looking at all 65 of our R&amp;D projects rigorously. I've got our commercial teams involved, I've got some outside consultants involved, on specific cases we may bring some outside KOLs involved. But I wanted to get to a position where I feel comfortable that every project in R&amp;D meets the requirements of our shareholders and our patients to say that these medicines will actually benefit someone and that there is a pathway forward.</p>
          <p>Now, just talking about the 5026, you want to make sure you don't throw any value out the window here, so it's not snap decision making. So we're going to take the time to the end of March to really go through all those projects and we will give you an update spend some time with the Q1 results as to where we really think we've got to. But you've seen some pruning of the pipeline already last year and we're going to do that. Now, where we do prune a project? Then my intention is we take the money and decide where's the best opportunity to spend the next euro? And it may not be inside the company. We may say the best opportunity to invest is outside the company.</p>
          <p>Second thing then is you don't want to get back into that process, so we're going to be clearly defining who needs to be at the table when we make decisions about when to advance a product from one stage to another. Another question though is &#x2013; and another thing I think that we haven't done as well is that we have not looked outside the walls of our own laboratories enough. We've been pretty much internally focused. There is a lot of fabulous science and innovation going on out there. I'm sure many of you have seen those companies, 6,000 biotechs worldwide and we've got NIH, we've got universities, we have got specialty pharma companies, there is an awful lot out there, and we need to be able to capture the best science that we can.</p>
          <p>Now, that is a lot easier said than done. And I can tell you that nobody has really done that exceptionally well yet, although there are certainly companies out there who do that better than we do. Because you really have to get good at partnering and you really have to get good at having your folks say, I like someone else's science as much as ours. And the reality is, hey, I've got brothers and sisters-in-law, I love my children always better than my nieces and nephews. It's just a fact to life. And guess what, when it talks to science, this is a very human process. So whatever we're going to fix, you can never get far from human emotion and that's what makes R&amp;D a very tricky exercise.</p>
          <p>So the questions are really make sure we &#x2013; have we got the right portfolio? Have we got the right decision making? How do we create a culture that really is going to foster that ability to look outside? What new technologies do we really need to be in? Where are we with nanotechnology? Where are we with biomarkers? And the final thing is really this, I think the whole megamergers that we've been through over the years, we looked at everything rigorously when we did those mergers except research and development. We said, hey, I got two companies, 5,000 people in each one, &#x20AC;2 billion budget we'll slam them together and they are going to be twice as effective. And of course the opposite is true.</p>
          <p>So I think we need to go back and really say what kind of an organization do we really need that's really going to foster innovation and creativity. You ask me, well did Glaxo solve that model with the sed? I think the jury is still out on that. But they did show that as you start to play around with that, you could have an impact on productivity. I don't think anybody has really cracked that nut yet, and so we really want to make sure we are.</p>
          <p>Now to that end, I also made a couple announcements today. I'm extremely excited about being able to work with someone like Elias Zerhouni, who will be a personal, scientific and technology adviser both to me and to Marc. Elias ran the NIH, a $30 billion a year research institute and took the size of that organization and brought about some transformation, which is extremely hard to do in that environment; led the Hopkins Medical School. But he has also got a very interesting feature and that is, born in Algeria, did his studies in France, has actually received the L&#xE9;gion d'Honneur from France as well; he brings a multilingual, multicultural background. And so as we start to look at some of the big global public health issues, he can be very helpful. He is right there at the leading edge of what's going on in science, can be an objective voice, because you know in all of this none of this is ever black and white. You can never go to the data and find the answer. You've got to make some judgments. And so I look forward to working with Elias just to have that second opinion, just someone who may push us a little bit further to think in a way that we might not because of our backgrounds.</p>
          <p>The other position that we created is the Chief Medical Officer. This kind of takes all of the people who have been working on safety, on patient safety and brings them more into one organizational structure. It reinforces the strong commitment we've already had to patient safety and gives clear accountability for that. And that position will not only report directly up into Marc and outside of the development chain, but will also be the Chair of the benefit/risk committee that looks at all of our projects in development and all of our products in the marketplace, just to make sure that we are meeting all of the rigors of the modern pharmaceutical environment.</p>
          <p>External growth opportunities &#x2013; I think I need to go back one. Adapting the company to challenges &#x2013; now you can understand an awful lot of things here. But it is true that if you're going to be more geographically diverse, you're going to be in different businesses, you going to have to adapt the company. I don't have someone today that runs the OTC business. OTC is run as kind of a product portfolio within a country. I really want to grow that business, we need to have someone &#x2013; and Hanspeter is looking at this and saying, let's create a division that's around OTC. Let's bring in some expertise, people who can help us to decide intelligently which products we can take into other markets, which opportunities we can buy.</p>
          <p>If you think about volume, the impact of losing sales in the United States has actually got this much impact on volumes that we produce. When you look at France, our biggest selling product is not Plavix, it's not Lantus, it's Doliprane. I've got an entire factory in France just dedicated to producing Doliprane. So if we're going to get into those businesses a little bit more, we got to think about whether our network of manufacturing is adapted to that.</p>
          <p>I asked a lot of our employees in a worldwide video clip, tell me the three things that you'd like to see me change, the three things you don't want me to change. Well, I can tell you on the things they wanted me to see change: simplify this company. We are very bureaucratic in a lot of ways, we can simplify our processes. And we have to if we're going to be able to be nimble and we're going to be able to have decisions taken where &#x2013; so there are some cost reductions that are possible. And I think you know Hanspeter is going to talk to you about what an excellent job his organization has been doing on the sales force and how we can go forward.</p>
          <p>Now, external growth. No question that we need to go do that, we don't have enough new products really to compensate for that. We know we're three years out from the cliff, let's take the cash and intelligently do that. And that's why today's announcement about Laurence's new position on Chief Strategy Officer is so important. It underpins the fact that business development seeking external growth is not something we're going to do on an ad hoc basis when we don't think we have enough in the pipeline. This is part of doing business.</p>
          <p>There are, I think, 250 or 300 companies that rolled up into sanofi-aventis. We're going to be looking around the globe and if you're going to really find why it is that a particular company can do better than we do, it takes some thought, takes some time, so Laurence is going to have a whole platform of competent scientific medical finance that will enable us to do this efficiently, quickly and with the ability to bring in some new deals.</p>
          <p>So it will also help us with Alliance management. If you're going to do these deals, you really have to be good at getting along with smaller structures. It's very hard for smaller structures to deal with big ones and I've been looking at this for years myself and those companies that really get the partnering capability right are the ones that are going to win going forward.</p>
          <p>So I'm not going to go into all of the transformation in this <mark type="inaudible" />, because not all of them are of interest to you, but I would say that I've come across a company that is actually very eager for change. When you get 7,500 employees from all around the world writing back to you talking about what things they want to see change, you know you're pushing against an open door and that makes me feel very confident that actually we can move things along. So this approach is also meant to say you don't want to just decide everything from the top, we've tried to engage some of our top talent to think about some of these topics and really drive change from within and write the way through the organization. So the objective of this is to take three, four months really look at everything, come up with a plan and then execute on that, and that's the time line that we're in. So we're on these projects until about the April, May timeframe. We need to sort out the recommendations and then probably by the second quarter results I can give you a little bit more of an update about where we stand with that and what the financial implications of that might be.</p>
          <p>Guidance 2009, again remember that we've changed now, we're talking about constant exchange rate, we're predicting guidance of at least 7%, barring any major adverse events such as the launch of a generic Lovenox in the U.S.</p>
          <p>I'm going to conclude slowly here now to say that the objectives then &#x2013; what we're actually trying to do, why did we launched these &#x2013; all these 12 initiatives? One is we clearly want to bring innovation back to our R&amp;D organization. We want to be one of the top companies in the healthcare sector in terms of what we're bringing in terms of new solutions to patients.</p>
          <p>I don't think the consensus forecast have the bar very high for us as we look out to 2012. I think as we look at this business, our business has a lot more potential and the objective of looking at all this is to try to outperform those consensuses forecast for you. And the third then is obviously we do need to strengthen these growth platforms. We're very happy and proud of what we've got. But it only have any value is if we can use bolt-on acquisitions and organic growth to grow them.</p>
          <p>So with that, those are our three objectives. You probably are going to have some questions. We'll come back to them. I'm going to turn it over to Hanspeter. I will say as a former competitor of his that I have always had a great admiration for sanofi-aventis. I'm glad to be on the same team. I think a company that delivers double-digit earnings growth in this kind of environment is very good. So I'd certainly like to congratulate personally Hanspeter, on a great 2008.</p>
          <p>And I'll turn that over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the flowers. Good afternoon. Yes, let's go back to the results of 2008. It's a classical &#x2013; it's a standard chart, which information I would like you to focus on.</p>
          <p>First of all you see we have been selling approximately &#x20AC;27.6 billion, which gave a growth of 3.7%. Second, you see that there is a rather significant change in trend in our U.S. performance between the total year of 4.4% growth and 9.5% growth in terms of sales for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>What is the reason? The reason is that during the second half we went away from the hole, which left the departure of Ambien IR, which took place in the April-May period 2007. So yes, we went back to a very strong growth in the U.S. during the second half and especially during the fourth quarter since if you keep in mind that today the U.S. market is at zero growth.</p>
          <p>Also of course worth mentioning the good performance of vaccines, with de facto 10% growth rate over the total year equalizing 2.9 billion sales.</p>
          <p>This is more from a geographical angle. On the left side of the chart you see the trends of the world global pharmaceutical market and you see then yet there is still a growth of 6.6% coming from Europe. You see that what I just indicated U.S. markets went to more or less zero growth and the Rest of the World markets are growing in 2008 by 10%.</p>
          <p>So for the markets on the right side of the chart you see our own performance. You see then that in Europe we have de facto zero growth. Why? Mainly due to generification, most importantly the loss of patent protection of Eloxatin during the past year more or less in all European markets.</p>
          <p>You see then the 5.4% growth in U.S. as indicated before, entirely coming out of the second half. Before the business was negative in U.S. And then once again Rest of the World with 10.1% of growth, which means we have successfully defended our market leading position in the Rest of the World countries. This is not only true for the so-called BRIC and M countries, it's true for the majority of all those approximately 60, 70 countries in Asia Pacific and in the south of the Americas.</p>
          <p>Now there's a lot of debate if there will be blockbusters in the future. Whilst we continue this debate in any case, it is very nice to have those blockbusters. We're proud to report that we don't have only blockbusters, we have mega blockbusters &#x2013; those products selling more than two billion. And we are even more proud to report that all those five mega blockbusters in 2008 have performed at double digits.</p>
          <p>So PLAVIX you see a growth of 15%, there's a part still of a technical effect coming out of 2007. There we were suffering from the Apotex generic, which later then disappeared of course. You see later in the charts that PLAVIX in the U.S.-in Japan is going the same successful way as it went in other parts of the world.</p>
          <p>We have achieved since the second full year of launch nearly &#x20AC;200 million of sales in Japan alone, which means sooner or later the product will be the market leading product also in Japan. You will see &#x2013; we also indicated the patent protection of the product in the U.S., which is November. We are quite optimistic that we will obtain prolongation of six months through pediatric indication, which then lead us of course to May 2012.</p>
          <p>LOVENOX, nearly 11% growth despite an extremely difficult year of supply. Chris has alluded to it. This is a situation, which to a certain extent continues. We estimate that we have lost approximately 70, 80 million of sales in 2008. So evidently if you would add those let's say 80 million to the 2.7 billion, you'll see that the product would have even reached a growth of about 14 or even 15%.</p>
          <p>LANTUS, doing extremely well, close to 28% growth. The product is driven by very strong medical clinical evidence. There is more positive evidence to come in 2009. But it is also extremely doing well supported by our own device, by SoloSTAR. We see a direct function. Wherever we launched SoloSTAR, LANTUS sales are being even accelerated.</p>
          <p>Taxotere, 13% of growth. Some of you will remember when we took over Taxotere, the product was flat. We more and more accelerated through five, six, seven, 8% growth, now last year 13%. The product is a widely used chemotherapy agent. We have eight indications all over the world. And the results speak for themselves.</p>
          <p>Then at the end of the five leading products, you find AVAPRO, totally different product. We are in an optimization strategy. It's a highly competitive environment. And you see that we optimize sales very nicely with close to 11%.</p>
          <p>From the existing portfolio to the two products we have deposited in 2008, we have deposited both products with the FDA and the EMEA. First of it, also in terms of expectations when to launch, is Multaq. We go into a totally new field. We aim &#x2013; in a totally new data situation because we've the first product with really clear-cut outcome data, we aim for overall seven million patients, which suffer a very dangerous and partially deadly disease. It is a costly disease as well as the FDA has fixed a date for an Advisory Committee by March 18. And evidently we're actively preparing for that.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the good news that this product will become available, mainly, but not only, through the very positive results of ATHENA continue to increase. You see that approximately 90% of the relevant physician population is today already aware of the ATHENA results and perhaps even more importantly, more than 50% of all physicians are ready to prescribe the product immediately as it will become available.</p>
          <p>A little bit later, we estimate a launch in the first quarter of 2010. We go into a new segment of the sleep market. Chris has also alluded to this. We have of course a vast experience in this field. We believe that we have a different approach this time. We are not a sleep inducing agent. Now we will be a product, which is treating those people who suffer from nocturnal awakenings.</p>
          <p>This is a new indication, which we call CINA. We have to cultivate, we have to shape this market. But there is a huge patient potential as you see, approximately 11 million patients in Europe and nearly seven million patients in the U.S. are suffering from this disease. We have a product, which is extremely safe compared to the existing base of treating those events. And we believe that we will also benefit from this in later labeling and promotion.</p>
          <p>Base business a word again, also from my side, we have a so-called base business which was in the center of our financial communication for the last four, five years which is approximately worth eight billion of sales. We are proud that we have succeeded to stabilize this eight billion business over the last years and we did it once again in 2008 with just minus 1.1%. If you go into this portfolio, you see that it is in fact construed of four segments, four clusters, which are very different.</p>
          <p>OTC/OTX, those as we've already cited 1.4 billion of sales we have with those major products in this field. We have local stars which are products, which play a very important role also in terms of growth in the various parts of the world, especially in Asia Pacific and in the Latin American theatre. We have generics, today less than 400 million but through the acquisition of Zentiva, more than one billion. And we have something which we call the tail business, which means a business which is a mixed business where we reduce investment close to zero.</p>
          <p>Those four parts underlie totally different approaches. They have different investment strategies. They have different results. And accordingly to this, we will start to report on those four segments as from the first quarter 2009, which will give you much more transparency to understand what do we do with the eight billion overall base business. And of course it obliges us to be much more transparent in terms of what we achieve. Evidently we will have growing results and less growing results but overall you will gain a lot of transparency for this and we will target more and better allocate our investments.</p>
          <p>Vaccines, once again, also those figures we have seen, growth 9.6%, nearly 2.9 billion, market leading position in the world. You see that this is not a single portfolio consisting of one major brand. This is a very well balanced portfolio. And you see also from the chart that all segments are in high-single digit or in double digit growth.</p>
          <p>We have indicated that we do extremely well with the vaccine portfolio in Asia-Pacific with a growth of 17%. We believe that there is a huge opportunity in Asia-Pacific and this is the reason why we have very recently decided to combine the pharmaceutical business and the vaccine business in Asia-Pacific because we have a market leading position already in those countries of Asia Pacific. So we will use the pharma business as a kind of locomotive to pull and to further accelerate the vaccines also in those parts of the world.</p>
          <p>Final comments then on our joint venture, important joint venture with Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme in vaccine; sales of nearly 1.3 billion in Europe, growing by 22%.</p>
          <p>So far on sales, and this is to a certain extent already abridged into Laurence Debroux's later presentation. We have not only worked on sales, we also have worked intensively on resource allocation. You see two aspects of it or one aspect and the result of it. Over the last three years we have reduced our sales representative number by 2,700 which already we feel is quite an achievement. We have done this our way without major announcements in a socially acceptable way. And we have achieved what we wanted and what we had to achieve.</p>
          <p>Intrinsically you see that we have not only reduced, we've also increased. We have reduced in those markets where the markets really already have performed a transformation into a different decision model, more concentrated decisions through treatment guidelines, through sick funds and so on. We have reduced 1,800 positions in U.S. and 2,900 positions in Europe and at the same time we have increased by 2,000 positions the number of sales reps in the Rest of the World.</p>
          <p>Consequently we have continuously driven down our cost, our operating cost. We have started with more than 30% in 2005. And we have once again decreased by 0.9 points in 2008, which gives us today's leading position in terms of overall operating expenses as ratio of sales in our industry.</p>
          <p>Other change and also this has been mentioned before by Chris, we believe that the old global marketing approach is no more true. We're more and more facing regionalization on the side of our customers, of our clients. We have very different situations from one continent to the other and we have taken care of that and also reorganizing our own structures and also delegating much more decision power on the regional level and then really combining our various activities on a regional level, activities which means industry, pharma, vaccines and R&amp;D to be really commonly present in front of our customers. We believe that this will also help in the ongoing initiative for accelerated external business growth through local acquisitions.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, the key takeaways, 2008, good solid growth more or less in line with the worldwide pharmaceutical market, a reversal of our U.S. performance and the strengthening of our market leading position in the Rest of the World.</p>
          <p>Continued improvement in productivity, best-in-class SG&amp;A ratio amongst our industry peers, we expect further improvement in 2009 and onwards. Last but not least, new operating and business models through regionalization, which brings us closer to our customers and will guarantee further growth in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Thank you so much. Laurence?</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. Good afternoon to those <mark type="inaudible" /> who have joined us from the webcast. I'm going to briefly present 2008 financial results and I'm going to do it in English to add a little touch of French accent to the very international tone of this meeting today.</p>
          <p>So Hanspeter commented on sales growth on a comparable basis. And the annual growth of 4% that he commented on is a pretty solid growth comparing that we had to face in the first quarter comparison, the full impact of generification of Ambien IR in the United States and of Eloxatin in Europe.</p>
          <p>So if I come back to reconciliation with the P&amp;L, in the Q4 2008 you have an exchange rate effect, which is favorable by 1.1%. And actually it's only 1/1% (sic) [1.1%] because the improvement in U.S. dollars was partly offset by the strong decrease in other currencies, especially British pound. Changes in group structure had a negative effect of 2.1%, mainly linked to the change in contract with Teva on COPAXONE at the end of the first quarter 2008. And so we come to a reported net sale of plus 2.6%.</p>
          <p>Coming to full year now. Of course exchange rate is this time very negative. And it more than wipes out the comparable growth, it's 75% due to the dollar. Changes in group structure is still negative, 1.5%, same explanation then for the quarter, which comes to the growth in reported net sales of minus 1.7%. This is what you see at the top of the P&amp;L. But let's not forget the underlying growth of 4%.</p>
          <p>We had a very strong performance in the fourth quarter with the plus 2.6 growth in sales translating into plus 12.1% increase in current operating income. And this leverage was reached in spite of the fact that we had to book about &#x20AC;60 million of costs linked to the discontinuation of Acomplia in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D went up by 1.3% on a comparable basis, current exchange rate, which is a slowdown in increased rate compared to the previous quarters. And SG&amp;A was down by 4.6%. What you might find surprising is to see that there is so little difference in the percentage of change in current operating income on a published basis and at constant exchange rate. Well this shows you that in the fourth quarter the positive effect of the U.S. dollar was partly offset by negative downturn in other currencies.</p>
          <p>Below the current operating income, two lines are worth mentioning. One of them is financial, net of financial income and expenses, which is an increased charge over last year. And the second one is the tax rate, which is probably lower than what you would have expected. I will come back to explanation on those two lines when I comment the full-year. But what I can already tell you is that the effects in Q4 on those two items offset each other at the level of the bottom line. So no impact on the increase of plus 16.8% that you see in the adjusted EPS excluding selected items.</p>
          <p>This strong quarter leads us to a very solid year. Increase in current operating income is plus 8.5% at constant exchange rate, which can be compared to the plus 3.7% of comparable sales increase that Hanspeter presented you earlier. Of course, we're helped in this performance by the recovery of PLAVIX, as you know in the U.S., as you know that we're booking royalties on U.S. sales of PLAVIX in other revenues. So that counts in the current operating income.</p>
          <p>But I would still like to draw your attention again on the improvement of the SG&amp;A to sales ratio, which went down from 26.9% to 26%. As Hanspeter was saying, it's an improvement of 4% in three years and this is clearly a consequence of our efforts to continuously adapt our selling and marketing structure to the evolution of our market and portfolio. And just to confirm that there is no trick to this ratio, if we were consolidating PLAVIX in the United States, the ratio would be even better as PLAVIX requires less efforts as a percentage of sales than some of our other products. For 2009 the decrease that you see in the SG&amp;A over sales will be continued at about the same pace.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales for 2009, I can also guide you to a rate that will stay around 27% of net sales and R&amp;D which is up 3.2% at constant exchange rate in 2008, but in this 3.2% we have 1% impact from the cost of discontinuation of Acomplia. So R&amp;D should be flat to slightly decreasing in 2009.</p>
          <p>Below current operating income, two main comments. The first one on financial income and expense, which is a charge of &#x20AC;270 million compared to a charge of 139 last year. Well interest charge on net debt is decreasing by about &#x20AC;30 million, but on the other hand, you have a negative of &#x20AC;74 million on the result of financial swaps and hedging on financial exposure compared to a positive of about &#x20AC;84 million last year.</p>
          <p>Well two-thirds of that difference comes from the fact that we swapped the deposits, the U.S. dollar deposits of our American subsidiaries to reimburse &#x2013; into euro to reimburse our euro debt. And these deposits have an average of $9 billion for 2008. So we actually do better on the charge &#x2013; on the financial debt because we have reimbursed the debt in euro and we have no currency risk here. But when the dollar pays less than the euro, we book a difference on that line. With the disappearance of the witholding tax on dividends from the United States next year we will be able to repatriate more of those deposits and thus the effect on our P&amp;L will be diminishing for the further years.</p>
          <p>Second comment on the effective tax rate. We booked for Q1, Q2 and Q3, tax rate at 29.6%. And for the full-year finally, the effective tax rate is actually 29%. So what you saw in the first quarter is the full effect for the full quarter of the difference of 0.6%. So the tax rate went down for the year from 30.6 to 29%. 1% decrease is directly linked with the decrease in tax rate in Germany. And the other 0.6% is due to a variety of factor including some tax credit like the U.S. R&amp;D tax credit that was decided in the last part of the year. What I can tell you is that I can guide you to a 29% effective tax rate for your 2009 models as well.</p>
          <p>So all in all, earnings per share excluding selected item of 5.49 for 2008, which is an increase at constant euro-dollar rate, which is our guidance rate of 11.2%, so comfortably above our guidance.</p>
          <p>I have made my comments on the P&amp;L excluding selected items, so just a few words on the selected items. You will find full reconciliation between adjusted excluding selected items, to adjusted, to consolidated in the press release. So I will just say that the adjusted &#x2013; the selected items are negative of $0.09 on the 2008 EPS after a boost of $0.11 on 2007 EPS. And I will just comment on the main item which is a &#x20AC;585 million of restructuring costs made of &#x20AC;140 million in industrial affairs, mainly the plant of Vitry and the rest being the cost of continuous adaptation and restructuring measures in our sales and commercial organization mainly in Europe.</p>
          <p>So this strong year naturally leads us to strong operating cash flow, &#x20AC;8.5 billion in 2008 compared to &#x20AC;7.1 billion in 2007. Part of this improvement is due to the fact that we managed to stabilize the need for working capital in 2008 when it increased &#x2013; well, it increased by &#x20AC;800 million last year mainly due to non-operating item. So after CapEx, acquisition, disposal, dividend and share repurchase, we get to a free cash flow of &#x20AC;2.5 billion this year, which is what we can apply to reimburse our net debt.</p>
          <p>And that leads me to the conclusion of the next slide, which is that with &#x20AC;1.8 billion net debt at the end of 2008, I can say that even including the Zentiva acquisition, we should be virtually debt-free at the end of 2009, excluding of course the impact of other acquisitions that we might make and we have here one of the best financial flexibility in our industry.</p>
          <p>We will propose a dividend of &#x20AC;2.20 per share, which is an increase exactly in line with the increase of the adjusted EPS growth &#x2013; the adjusted EPS excluding selected items. And as regards the share buyback program, we completed in the first half of 2008 the share buyback program that was initiated after 2007 AGM. And you know that we were authorized another program for mid-2008 of about the same size of &#x20AC;3 billion. But we have chosen not to implement it because we found it will be more reasonable in the current financial environment and also we decided to give priority to cash acquisitions.</p>
          <p>So as a conclusion, 2008 was another year of strong delivery with a solid topline performance, continued improvement of our operating ratio, and EPS growth comfortably ahead of guidance. And I will finish by repeating the guidance for 2009, which is that we expect an increase of at least 7% in adjusted EPS excluding selected items at constant exchange rates and barring major adverse event, for instance a generic of LOVENOX in the United States.</p>
          <p>I thank you very much for your attention. And I give the floor back to Chris.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Laurence. All right, I think we tried to demonstrate we're looking at a turning point for our company. We wanted to maximize the performance of our existing business. We are a company that manages our cost base effectively, showed you the SG&amp;A ratio to sales. One of the things you may not also know, three years ago we had 79 manufacturing facilities. Now we have 64.</p>
          <p>We are now also looking at truly trying to launch a transformation program. Some of you I know may have been expecting restructuring programs. I've been there done that. I really don't want to get into running a restructuring program every year. Managing your cost base is part of good management. And we're going to continue to do that. I think one of the things that we ultimately have to do as an industry and certainly what we as a company are focused on, is get back to growth.</p>
          <p>We have to show that we can build on these growth platforms and we can do the acquisitions. Yes, there's going to be a piece that comes from the growth of cost structure. But you got to have more in your toolbox than I think just restructuring. And that's how &#x2013; the objective of why we have launched transformation projects. If you're going to do some restructuring then you really also want to make sure that you're allocating your resources to those things that are going to help you to grow going forward.</p>
          <p>Now I think one of the things that we're going to try to do this year is have a different approach to communications and to investor relations. We started this at 2 o'clock this afternoon, so that anybody watching in New York isn't having to do that in their pajamas and I think these are the things that we can do. We will begin to &#x2013; continue to participate at broker conferences. We will be available as management to talk with you. We have a new Head of Investor Relations with S&#xE9;bastien Martel and obviously investor relations can't be any better than the degree to which they're integrated within the management of a company and I think we want to try to do as good a job as we can on that.</p>
          <p>So what can you expect for the year as we look forward? Clearly the biggest step for me is really making sure that we've got our pipeline in a robust situation. So that's the work that's ongoing. I expect to have that completed by the end of March and be able to tell you more with our first quarter results.</p>
          <p>We are going to be looking to do more R&amp;D partnerships. We want to look outside the business. There is a lot of opportunity out there. We want to be able to capitalize on that. We clearly have two NCEs that have been submitted to the FDA. We are looking for an approval, certainly for Multaq and hopefully for Ciltyri as well. I think just given the fact that Ciltyri was submitted at the very end of last year and given the real timeframes that we have, this might be early 2010.</p>
          <p>We'll try to give you some sense of what this transformation program really means for the company when we come back and talk about Q2 results later this year. You're going to be looking for and you should be able to find continued productivity improvements. We are going to be looking outside at growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>But again I really want to insist on this word, discipline. This has been the hallmark of this company. It's something I personally believe. And it's something that we are going to continue to do. Whatever deal we do, I want it to help our shareholders and not the shareholders of some target company.</p>
          <p>And obviously the last thing in addition to the communication, I think one of the things that strikes me in even just conversations that I've had with investors and analysts is that, obviously we're moving beyond the classical blockbuster model. And therefore, I think we can help in understanding a little bit more about what we do.</p>
          <p>So we're going to try to have some thematic investor seminars this year where we'll have some of our top management talk about for instance emerging market dynamics or we might do something, a little deeper dive on vaccines. But we'll do that through the course of the year and as and when we've got those lined up S&#xE9;bastien will be announcing that to you.</p>
          <p>So those are the things you can look for, for 2009. What I'd like to do now is ask Dr. Marc Cluzel, who heads our R&amp;D organization and Wayne Pisano, who heads our Global Vaccines organization to come up on stage with us and we'll move to Q&amp;A session. So Wayne and Marc, come and join us.</p>
          <p>I think we got microphones circulating around. So just let them know. We've got a few questions. We got a few here.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean Jacques Le Fur, Oddo Securities. Four question, if I may. The first one is with the new strategy you are &#x2013; you have described to us, how do you see, how do you think you will pass the 2012 around period of time and how do you expect the EPS evolution will be at this turnaround rate could we see growth decrease, flat?</p>
          <p>My second question is regarding OTC strategy, I'm a little bit confused there. What is your strategy, is it to grow the business through acquisitions or is it to extend geographically the existing portfolio you have?</p>
          <p>My third question is on cost savings, not restructuring, cost savings, cost reduction. What is preventing you to give us some guidance I would say, roughly for a plan for the next three years or in three years from now?</p>
          <p>And my last question is probably for Wayne. Vaccine sales growth is declining a little bit since two years. How could we see this growth this year and perhaps in 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You packed a lot in the question. Obviously, we're not in the business of giving forecasts. I think what we've tried to do is say, one is we recognize that at some point we're going to lose some products to generics. Therefore, do we have enough products in the pipeline? We want to be honest, we're not sure we do. That means we actually have to go look for new growth opportunities and my message to you is; one is that we have a number of growth platforms upon which we can build; two is we have a very strong financial situation that gives us the means to go after that; three is that we've been reinforcing some of our resources around that, particularly with the appointment of Laurence Debroux as Chief Strategy Officer, to say that we'll have a systematic and a disciplined approach to this. So if you couple that with the fact that we've been pretty darn good at managing our cost base, I think it gives us the confidence that we obviously want to continue to present a growing approach to this business through 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>I'll let Hanspeter deal &#x2013; talk about OTC and I'll let Wayne answer the question and &#x2013; so maybe I'll just jump to the cost savings. Why can't I give you a target today? Hey, look guys, I've been on this job for 10 weeks, I want a little bit of breathing room here, it is a 100,000 person organization, 28 billion. And again, it is easy as heck to cut costs, any idiot can do that quite frankly. I think what really is hard is to try to figure out how can you build a business that's going to grow and where are you going to put your resources? And that takes a little bit more of a thoughtful approach. And that's the approach that our management wants to take. We don't want to destroy what's good. We do recognize we're in a situation of reality. But I would like to come back and give you a little bit more detail about how we think we can outperform. But I'd like to be it a mix of things in terms of where we're going to find new source of growth and not just the brutality of cost-cutting.</p>
          <p>So Hanspeter, maybe I can ask you about the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The OTC question. It's much easier. So two answers. First the existing growth of what I showed you as a class, it's the same as 1.4 billion in 2008 is approximately 8%, which is just internal growth, which is not so bad. I mean it's twice the growth of the total business, so that's already a base. Second, yes we have to grow externally. We have made a first step with the acquisition of Symbion, Symbion is a business approximately 100 million. We don't believe that there are huge jumps possible because there is very little offer. But we believe that there will be repetitively opportunity to acquire businesses, let's say, in the ballpark of 100 million. So, I don't know, as an objective, you could perhaps say to try to double this business over the next five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wayne, do you want to deal with the growth question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think if you look at the vaccine marketplace today, our projections are that overall global market will grow somewhere around 8% a year. We believe that our portfolio will grow at a faster rate than that. And I think that when you look at the portfolio that we have, we have a number of products that will be coming over the course of the next three to five years. We have a new influenza vaccine that basically we filed in the second &#x2013; actually second quarter, which is targeted at the elderly. Chris referenced the dengue vaccine that basically is in development for us. The acquisition of Acambis has strengthened our upstream pipeline, particularly with a product called Clostridium difficile.</p>
          <p>And as Hanspeter referenced, the approach we're taking now from a regional perspective is going to allow us basically to leverage the strength from medical and policy for vaccines, but couple that with the strength that sanofi-aventis has at a regional basis. So we can take the marketing and sales strength and we see a lot of growth coming in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
          <p>In parallel, we're making a lot of large investments in our CapEx. Chris referenced the dengue facility, but right now we have 12 manufacturing facilities under either construction or major renovation. These facilities will start coming online in 2009. A new flu facility in the U.S. will be the start, but we have the dengue facility, and the <mark type="inaudible" /> facility. We're building a flu facility in China. And as this capacity comes online, we're going to basically be able to take advantage of the opportunities and you will see over the course of the next 10 years that we will have periods where we will have a much larger growth, more of what you saw say, three, four years ago, when were growing in the high teens and low 20%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. S&#xE9;bastien Berthon from Exane BNP Paribas. Three quick questions, please. One on generics, obviously you want to expand there. I perfectly understand the logic of bringing trustees in Teva which is primarily a branded generics company. What would you &#x2013; could you share with us the pros and cons of going into non-branded generics from your point of view?</p>
          <p>And then two, questions on your targets and guidance. We appreciate that you gave a guidance in constant exchange rates and we have I think a clear view of what is your exposure to the dollar, but it's difficult for us to assess what is your exposure to the non-U.S. dollar currency. So if exchange rates were to remain stable for the rest of the year, could you share with us what would be approximately an impact on the reported items for EPS?</p>
          <p>And lastly, you aim to beat consensus expectations today over the next few years. What do you see as being the consensus expectations today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think on consensus, yeah, you go find those and all of your reports. I mean, we come &#x2013; we get those from you. So I think you look at those and you can see where you are. We'll give you a little bit more detail as we move along. I will ask Hanspeter to talk a little bit about generics and then I will ask Laurence give you some of the color on the exchange rate. So Hanspeter, you want to talk about the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's seems the &#x2013; one of the major issues with generics is really definition, what is a generic? And I have said so before, if you define generic as I define it, a generic is a non-patent protected pharmaceutical, which is sensitive to price. If this is true, we're a major generic company already today, because eight billion at least. Second, generic is a different animal from one region to the other. We have a very typical Anglo-Saxon generic, which leads to certain functions, for example rapid penetration of generics over time. You have the issue of branded generics, which is something very typical for Eastern Europe and very typical for Asia-Pacific. So we believe that we have to have a very pragmatic approach to generics and we believe that we have to have a very regional approach.</p>
          <p>Coming from this, we believe today that there is no opportunity in the U.S. for us, because the U.S. market is strongly concentrated, three, four major players, very specific distribution system, very rapid penetration and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>In contrary, we believe that there is opportunity in Europe, preferably in Eastern Europe, but perhaps not only, because in France the fastest growing generic company is non-branded generics, is Winthrop, which is a subsidiary of us. And we believe there is opportunity in Asia, which has again a little bit of a different notation because it has to do this access to medication as well. Referring to what Chris has said, we make our business today with only 20% of the population. And then we have Latin America which is again a very different market, where you have other issues like similars and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>So overall, regional approach starting in Europe, later on in Asia Pacific eventually, and eventually into south of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Laurence, do you want to comment on the exchange rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably interesting to say first what you said is that, our first big exposure is on the U.S. dollar and we remain on the U.S. dollar. And there I can tell you that the sensitivity to the U.S. dollar that we have recalculated for 2009 is really in the same range as what we've seen in 2008 and in 2007 actually, so 0.5% change in EPS growth for each $0.01 variation.</p>
          <p>As regards the other currency, so no other individual currency is coming even close to the impact of the U.S. dollar. We have of course exposure to GBP, to Japanese yen, which might be now number two or number three if you look at those currencies. And we don't do the exercise of actually re-measuring where we would be at today's exchange rate. So it's probably easier for you and for me if we say on the &#x2013; if all exchange rates are constants compared to the average of what they were in 2008, which is easily verifiable, then we are at this &#x2013; at least 7%.</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Michael Leacock from RBS. Chris, I just wondered of the comments you got back from your employees, you mentioned there were three things they wanted to change, three things they wanted to keep. You mentioned simplifying the organization. What were the other two things that wanted to be changed? And what were the three things that people wanted to keep?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They want us to find more new products and really have that perspective of growth. And it's really the simplification, find more products and some of the other things that we're doing, grow our businesses in other parts of the world. Then your third item becomes kind of an amalgam of a number of things.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, the thing they didn't want to see us change were the values of the company. There are six values that have been a strong part of the culture and I took that to be a very positive sign. It says that people are very emotionally attached and engaged in the organization. And they're willing to change as long as we keep some guiding principles in there. And I think that's a very healthy situation in any company, and given that it's a company that's only four or five years after a merger, that you've got that kind of strong backbone to it, is a very good sign.</p>

          <p>Yes. Philippe Lanone, Natixis Securities. First question to Marc Cluzel about Multaq. How do you see the impact of the DIONYSIUS trial on the European approval, does it jeopardize it?</p>
          <p>And Chris, one question about one of the worries that the markets have from time to time is the possibility of selling shares by the big shareholders. So what are your views on that and could you be more proactive here, given the cash you have?</p>
          <p>And about the structure of the company, as you said a lot of joint ventures, could there be some simplification here? Especially I'm thinking about the Animal Health business, could it be integrated more in the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Marc, do you want to deal with the Multaq?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that the DIONYSIUS confirmed what we thought of the respective characteristic of dronedarone and amiodarone. That amiodarone is a good anti-arrhythmic, very good, so it's acting quite well on the EKG with a very bad safety profile. And that dronedarone has a good safety profile and at the same time it's not acting per se on the EKG, but it is much more active in fact on the complication of atrial fibrillation <mark type="inaudible" /> which are the result of that in our studies.</p>
          <p>And in fact in terms of impact on EU registration, there is clearly no impact. But clearly you cannot compare a study. You have to consider that Multaq is the first compound which has proven a benefit in terms of morbid-mortality in the field of atrial fibrillation. So really you are changing the paradigm, all the other products that has been at the best neutral and most of them are in fact going in adverse way, so increasing the mortality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your other question was, there was a question on the major shareholders. They're shareholders like everybody else, they'll buy and sell depending on how attractive we look as an investment and obviously our first job is to make sure that we are attractive. And that goes along the same lines that we have been talking about in terms of strategy. If you think about the size company we are and the fact that we do have 20% of the capital in the hands of two shareholders, it does suggest that there could be some underownership of this business compared to a Novartis or a GlaxoSmithKline, who don't have shareholders anywhere near this.</p>
          <p>We obviously don't have any control over what they do. Obviously your question goes to a line of well, can we use our liquidity to do something? You can't do anything directly. But would we do share buybacks to offset whatever they do? I think this comes back to what's the best use of your capital. And our principal objective is we're going to use that capital to the extent we can to grow the business. If there is an opportunity and it makes sense to do that in terms of buybacks, we could consider that. But to me, I think buybacks are something you do when you have exhausted all the other options for your capital and so wouldn't be our first priority to do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have been asked to stand up, so I'm standing up. So three questions, Chris. Firstly, you outlined the not-invented-here syndrome as being something that the company has struggled with historically. The other issue I think that we get a sense of is putting the cash on the table in order to be competitive versus other bidders. Practically, what are you doing in terms of the organizations in terms of getting rid of the NIH habit and making sure that you've got sufficient conviction to put an adequate sum forwards in order to win these products?</p>
          <p>Second question is on Regeneron. Obviously GSK, your former employer, took Aventis in-house. Do you feel that the current relationship with Regeneron is sustainable as it currently is and what would be the advantages of taking it in?</p>
          <p>And the third thing is &#x2013; and the final thing is on the emerging markets. Some of your peers have commentated they would expect to see the macro slowdown effect most visible in those markets. To what extent have you seen anything out of your exposure to those markets as you highlighted earlier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Marc comment too on the not invented here. I will just say before he does a couple of things. First is not invented here is not a sanofi-aventis invention, by the way. I mean, in my 20 years, I can tell you having been a personal champion of a lot of business development deals that if someone senior doesn't put their body on the tracks in front of the train, it doesn't get done. I mean, it's just &#x2013; it's a human aspect, it's not a company one. And it's something that we do need to change. I think personally the way you do it is you have to say, you're not just doing this because you &#x2013; we're not proud of what you as a team are doing. The ultimate mission of this company is to find better healthcare solutions for patients. And I think it's incumbent upon us to do absolutely everything that we can to do that and if we have to go outside then we should be doing it because the objective is noble. But it is certainly &#x2013; I'll lay it on the line of saying, hey, we may want to go and do a lot more of this, but we're going to have to change the company.</p>
          <p>Now just to deal with the question, before I let Marc come in on that, your question was on Regeneron. No, I don't want to take this company inside. I think there is a clear &#x2013; when you spend time with smaller structures, it's a different atmosphere there. These people had an idea, they had to go fight to find capital and financing, they've had to fight to keep progress going so that they can find new capital and you're always kind of on the risk of "Am I going to make it or aren't I?" And if my project dies, my company dies.</p>
          <p>We can't create that same thing in a big pharma organization and I think to bring this into the mother ship, kind of risks losing some of that strength actually. So &#x2013; and then if you think about the fact that you have to use capital to do that, it means the capital of bringing this in, I don't have capital to go do a number of other things, and personally I'd rather spread the company's capital on a broader way. But I'll let Hanspeter deal with the question on &#x2013; sorry, Marc answer the question on the &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first way I think is education. And I think it's quite simple. If you are looking in the 90s, most of the product which were going up to the market were produced in the pharma company, perhaps not the big pharma company, but at least coming from Japanese company and so. Now if you are looking at a number of products reaching the market, most of them in fact are originating from small company, from biotech, and in fact if you're ever looking at the spending of the government, it's quite interesting to see that now most of the big country are in fact giving grants to find new molecules or new drugs. So the first way is to acknowledge that in fact, I don't know what is exactly the percentage, but more than 90% of the innovation on drugs now is coming outside from the big pharma and it would be totally foolish to pass it away.</p>
          <p>I think in those point, which is quite interesting is that, the model is also changing that before there was in fact a little bit of chronological events, in that way that the innovation was done outside the big pharma and after that was internalized within the big pharma. If you're starting to think about potential new model and if you are doing by example for Targeted Therapy. You observe that a lot of the added value is not existing in the big pharma. You need blood bank and most of the time blood bank is not part of the big pharma. You need big tools to analyze a genomic or the proteomic, which are not &#x2013; which might be part of big pharma or not. You need big computers, most of the time not part of big pharma. After that you need quick production of antibodies, so you can have the platform, or at least have the platform I think it is one of the interest of Regeneron by example.</p>
          <p>And after that you need the clinical trial. So I think what we're looking into the future is not too much not invented here, because it's not something that you're taking from outside and going for internalize. It's much more the network of integrated added value coming from different directions. So I don't think that the model will be, I'm picking a drug outside and I'll try to do it inside. I don't think it will be the model. So the not invented here syndrome, I think will be less preeminent in the big pharmas than before.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Marc. Did you have another piece, there is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question on the developing markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, developing markets, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think the answer is clearly, yes. There is a clear relationship between gross national product and pharmaceutical consumption and pharmaceutical market. Now, because of this, yes if there will be a slowdown. I take the example of China. We had a gross national product growth of about eight to 9% in China. If this goes down to four to five, it will be still a very interesting place to be and to stay because if you compare to U.S., if it goes from zero to minus two, it is evident that every pharmaceutical company is in difficulties. Yes, we expect slowdown in the big markets, but from a higher level than the others.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. We'll go to this side of the room, we got number four there.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> three questions, please. The first on your scientific advisor, I was just wondering if you could give us some color as to how much time he's going to dedicate to sanofi-aventis and how you see his role. I mean is he basically a check to make sure you don't invest in any very bad opportunities or is he more of a sounding board or will he in fact help you proactively to generate ideas based on his scientific understanding?</p>
          <p>Second question also on R&amp;D, I just wanted to clarify, do you think that the perception is correct that in the last few years in particular, sanofi has lagged behind some of its peers on platform technologies like let's say RNA interference or possibly even on things like translational science capabilities? And what capabilities do you think you need to build internally to either be an attractive externalization partner for biotech companies or to make sure in your end that you don't invest in drugs that look good on paper, but aren't going to work in reality?</p>
          <p>And my final question is just, coming back to your strategy, I mean you obviously made it very clear you are looking for sustainable low-risk profitable growth, which is very similar to what is your peers are doing right now. So I was just wondering, should we just expect you to go after very similar opportunities like for example GlaxoSmithKline? Or have you actually already identified any particular areas of expertise where you really see low hanging fruit and do you think with a few small bolt-on acquisitions you can really leverage an existing platform very fast? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So scientific advisor, I have actually known Elias Zerhouni for a couple of years, we serve on the Board of Research!America together. You know what I really wanted was someone who helps us take through some of these things. You know there is whole kinds of stuff out there and this is a person who has clearly been through the whole competitive process of research grants for example, has reallocated resources, has thought about some of these new technologies and it's just useful to have someone with that kind of experience and background, as you say to use as a sounding board.</p>
          <p>But as we think about for instance some of the new technologies we may want to be in, and some of the platform technologies, you know one of the things is that you can start to convince yourself that you've got things right. And personally, I think it's always healthy for any organization and I'm not just talking about R&amp;D, I mean on the commercial side, we want to always be looking around and see what other people are doing. How good are we doing? Are we really as smart as we think we are? And so, I think there is an approach that helps us to push the limits a little bit.</p>
          <p>This is someone with a huge network himself, can help us to really identify some of the opportunities where we may want to acquire technologies, partner with people. And he's also given an awful lot of thought in his career about, how do you really build a scientific organization of excellence? What are the aspects within an organization that you need? So, he's going to spend a significant amount of time. This will be one of the major things that he does in his career, and probably will spent more time actually on this than anything else he does. So this is a major engagement, it's &#x2013; I don't want to say without having checked whether he's comfortable in saying how much time he's going to spend. But it's going to be very significant, very regular and on an ongoing day-to-day type basis. So that will be significant.</p>
          <p>In terms of the R&amp;D platform technologies, are we behind or not? I mean, this is kind of one of the questions that someone like Elias Zerhouni can look at and advise us on. But I'd turn to Marc and say, what do you think about that Marc?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No &#x2013; I think so far we are touching ourselves most of the technology or in fact are partnering with people for technology. I think looking at the platform and thinking in terms of Targeted Therapy. The only platform where we are not at the present time is diagnostic, because it is likely that the Targeted Therapy will be linked with the diagnostic tools. So some way we have to partner or to find some way to be part of this world, but except that we're using every other technology we have access to.</p>
          <p>In fact, we're also in <mark type="inaudible" /> we're not communicating too much about that. So I think that in the, I would say in the current or in the third trimester of this year, I think we'll comment a little bit on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked about the strategy. You know &#x2013; because there is sort of a theoretical side of strategy and there's a pragmatic side of strategy. I think we've laid out where we think we want to go. The pragmatic side is in how you execute and where you go. And I think you're going to see some companies, you could argue that GSK and sanofi-aventis and Novartis, for instance are thinking about the world in a similar way. But then you suddenly got a Novartis that takes that and goes and buys an Alcon. So, you suddenly see in the execution suddenly some differentiation. And I'm not by any means suggesting we're going to go do something like buy an Alcon. I'm only using it to suggest that, you're going to see something. I think there is very few companies that really have our &#x2013; I think our technology platforms in things like insulin and in vaccines. So we can build upon those in a way that other companies like even a Pfizer may not be able to.</p>
          <p>So you're going to see I think some clusters of companies I think in terms of how they execute strategy in terms of where they go after acquisitions, where they put their focus, but it's a little bit about where they are right now. So I just think most of us have come to the conclusion, look the blockbuster model and I don't think by the way blockbusters are dead. It just says that to kind of bet your company and pray that R&amp;D comes up with the next blockbuster as your core strategy doesn't work. And for those of us who have been in this business for 20 years and have seen it not work, we've all said well, we got to diversify the growth and have different businesses that aren't subject to the same forces and that allow us to really respond to healthcare needs around the world. So I think we're all coming to some of these conclusions and we may bump elbows on a few of these targets, but there's plenty out there for everybody. And number one there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Graham Parry from Merrill Lynch. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your revenue loss and you talked about 20% being lost to patent protection, but I was wondering if you can talk to us about how much of your net income you think that might actually relate to? And as you think about offsetting this going forward, proportionally how much of that are you looking to offset through new sources of revenue versus cost rationalization?</p>
          <p>And secondly a question for Laurence. I know you can't really talk to us about the FX sensitivities for 2009. But if you can give us a better feel for just the impact on your emerging markets business; that 27% of the business, what was the impact of FX on that in the fourth quarter of the year?</p>
          <p>And then for Wayne, on vaccines, if you can give us the volume price mix for flu in 2008 and update on doses sold for Menactra and how you're going on capacity into 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The profit impact we never give &#x2013; it's kind of a little hard to do because you can obviously figure out the effect of lost sales. But it kind of assumes that you sit on your hands and do anything while you let those products go off patent and clearly good management isn't going to do that.</p>
          <p>So I think it is safe to say that the profit impact is probably a little more than the 20% even if you do things just because obviously you've got greater leverage over some of those brands. Now, what proportion are we going to use on external growth and everything else? Graham, whatever it takes. Our objective is to offset those losses and present a growing picture of the company. Laurence, do you want to take that next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In the fourth quarter, when you saw the positive 1.1. If it had been only for the U.S. dollar, it would have been 1.6 positive. So the rest is other currencies. But really what played in the fourth quarter, if I look, the Japanese yen played favorably and then you had the British pound that played very negatively. So all-in-all, it's not really emerging market currencies that were the main negative.</p>
          <p>And if I look on a yearly basis for 2008 and it's really three quarter of the negative impact was dollar and one quarter was the rest. It's very difficult to guide you because we are exposed for not that big amounts to so many different currency because of the spectrum of our presence, that depending on how and how big they move like for instance the Russian ruble, the Russian currency in the last weeks of the year have hurt us a little bit on the P&amp;L of the fourth quarter, when I wouldn't even mention this currency in other circumstances because it's not such a big theoretical exposure. But you've seen very violent and very big movement in those currencies. So, sorry not to be more specific for a model, but it's an...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is that exotic island on the other side of the channel, too. I think the next question was for Wayne.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the flu marketplace in 2008, 2008 was sort of an interesting year, because it's the first year that as an industry we've seen supply exceed demand. We've been talking about an entire decade of basically a shortage of vaccine. What's occurred is that the industry has responded to the governments' requests, particularly the U.S. government to increase capacity. So that now is starting to come online and what has to occur now is that immunization policy has to be expanded.</p>
          <p>So for example the U.S. ACIP this past year expanded recommendations for children that was from six months to five years of age is now recommended all the way to 18 years of age. We expect to see the same sort of phenomena occurring virtually all around the world. In Europe coming down in age, many countries recommended from 65 and older, they will start moving those recommendations down to 55 and 50. Asia-Pacific began immunization.</p>
          <p>Our personal experience within sanofi pasteur versus past year is we delivered over 170 million doses. What Chris pointed out earlier about the key when you have a situation where supply exceeds demand really comes down to time to market. Who gets the doses to the customers before basically the market is saturated. We had an excellent year in 2008 in the U.S., we produced about a little over 50 million doses and delivered over 49 million of those doses by the first week of October.</p>
          <p>There is a fair amount of oversupply in the U.S. right now from this past season. Fortunately that was not our experience, I think when you look at sanofi pasteur, as it relates to influence of manufacturing, we probably have &#x2013; we clearly have -the two most experienced manufacturing teams in the world. The one in Val de Reuil which is our largest facility today, and the one in the U.S. And these teams have been producing vaccines for over 40 years.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the Menactra capacity; in 2008, we produced eight million doses of Menactra which met the U.S. market demand. The plan for 2009 is nine million doses. We will be filing for the new facility with the FDA in 2009; that should be coming online in 2010 and that facility will be able to deliver a minimum of 20 million doses. That's going to allow us to basically then take Menactra beyond North America and into Europe eventually and then also into the international zones.</p>
          <p>In terms of flu capacity, we have a new facility that we've actually filed with the FDA that's in the U.S. This facility will come on in two stages. The first stage will deliver about 50 million doses a year. That's incremental 50 million on top of our current capacity. And then when we go to the full capacity of that facility in 2010, will be 100 million doses incremental capacity for us.</p>

Firstly, you've highlighted the potential threat of generic Lovenox during the course of this year and the impact that could have on your earnings. Is there any update on in timing in the U.S. when you next expect to hear something, and would you be willing to give any sensitivity on the EPS, if we were to see a generic Lovenox?</p>
          <p>And then, the second question is really on the oncology market and the oncology pipeline changes that you've made this year.

          <p>No, we really can say there is no news at all. There is still no approval, there is no clear communication from the FDA. What the FDA takes as a standpoint in terms of additional clinical trials for applications, there is no statement referring to substitutability or not, there is nothing new on the U.S. side at all. There is a little bit more of news on the European side, where as the guidelines clearly go into the direction first to show detailed clinical data for each indication, and certain sensitivity to substitutability, which we take as a more positive sign for the future FDA attitudes, but this is nothing as a speculation. On the EPS?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was going to, on the EPS, I mean I think what we've tried to do is say, if you don't have one, you see what the guidance is. Beyond that your models are probably as good as ours. If there is a substitutable generic, you certainly know how to model that one. And if it's a non-substitutable, there aren't an awful lot of analogs around, so you're going to be somewhere in between and we figure every analyst will come up with what they figure is best. So where we could give you as a grounding is what happens if we don't do one. So Marc, do you want to talk about S1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First one, I think it's a good illustration of uncertainty of R&amp;D. You have to remember that S1 is marketed in Japan and in fact it has shown to be positive in survival in adjuvant therapy. Unfortunately when the study was done in the U.S., the study failed in gastric cancer. And so the product was given back to Diao. In terms of RITUXAN, I think we made some kind of analysis in terms of market potential for the product, and we decided in fact to focus where there are the most opportunities. And for one is definitely the prostate cancer, which is going very well in terms of recruitment, in fact which is in advance. And we should have the result of an interim analysis for this product in the middle of this year. And for the other product we are &#x2013; where there is some unmet medical need, which is pancreas cancer, which is a risky cancer, but which is very interesting if positive. And the other one, which is vesicle cancer, where there is also highly unmet medical need.</p>
          <p>At the same time we are very active pursuing some kind of opportunities in the cancer field, because we have product in the early portfolio, but we have already lack of product in the middle range portfolio and we are looking for opportunities in this range. At the same time, we are conscious that the oncological market is moving more and more for niche market. So &#x2013; and I think it is one of the risks with a cytostatic. So we continue in fact to explore cytotoxic and cytostatic at the same time.</p>

          <p>Laura Balan, Capital Research. I have three questions. The first one, can you comment on the dividend policy? Second, are you willing to rule out large-scale acquisitions as part of your growth strategy? And my third question is for Mr. Dehecq. What is the Board expecting from Chris, in terms of tangible deliverables over the next three years or so? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Maybe I'll take the second one, turn to Laurence and I'll turn to my friend, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois for the third. On the second one, which was again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The large acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A large acquisition, of course, how many times I have mentioned that one today. It's too early for me in my tenure to actually rule out anything, but I would say if you think about what we've talked about, where we want to build on growth platforms and having the ability to target acquisitions, so you get what you want in a geography or in a business that you want, it's going to put you more in the mid &#x2013; small-to-mid size. And basically, we're defining small-to-mid size, I mean, I think if you talk to most investment bankers they're sort of, in our industry saying up to five billion in market capitalization is small, five billion to 15 billion counts as medium and anything above 15 billion is large. And if you also think about the fact that my view is that becoming too big has hurt our R&amp;D capability, it's not going to be obvious that you're going to go after it. Now if you can create a large structure, where you think you can achieve growth, and there is something there, then you know you wouldn't want to eliminate that, and also if you're looking for a bigger impact. So I think again there is kind of a theoretical side to the strategy and there is the pragmatic side. But right now, I can certainly tell you that the large type is not a personal priority to look at. Maybe Laurence on the dividend policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In the past few years after we had managed to actually reimburse the bulk of the debt that we incurred for the acquisition of Aventis, we had to catch up with the quatre-quarantes and our main European competitors in terms of payout ratio, which is where we came to 40% last year, 40% of EPS excluding selected item. And last year that was really a big catch up because that was an increase of 18% in our dividends. So this year as a step, we decided that we would actually mirror the progression of the earning per share for the year, which doesn't mean that it's a policy that we will follow exactly year after year, but we are now quite comparable to the rest of the industry.</p>

          <p>Chairman?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that this question. I think that if you remember what we put in the press release in July, it was clear that there are three main points in this press release, and that's exactly what Chris is addressing today. So what I can tell you is that we are very confident in the fact that, yes, we will succeed and we will continue to succeed with this company. And one point that Chris said before is the fact that no reason not to continue to increase the profit of this company, even in 2012 because if you remember the story of this company, just to put in line, if I remember in '98, our earning per share was around 0.8, a little less than 0.8, it's now 5.4 or six. So I think that yes, we will continue like during the last 35 years to increase the EPS of the company. I think that all the transformations that Chris is doing are totally in line with what we wanted at the level of the Board when we decided to change the management of the company. So no reason to say anything more or different than what Chris was saying. I think that we are totally connected and without any problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. One up here in the front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Niall, Gore Imaging. Two questions, first on operating profitability. You're coming in when the company for the first time reaches the 35% operating margin line. Given the going forward with the patent expiries and at the same time you're projecting in terms of acquiring probably less profitable businesses in OTC or generics. How much committed are you to and how much sustainable do you think this 35% operating margin level is in five years' time? For instance, are you committed to grow top line but also to sustain this level of profitability?</p>
          <p>Second in terms of cost reductions, you pretty much emphasis this SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales, but I mean costs are made also of cost of goods and R&amp;D. We understand that we need another three months perhaps to hear you again on R&amp;D, but on the cost of good line, if we compare sanofi-aventis to Glaxo, because in terms of profit &#x2013; in terms of profile, it's pretty much the same activities in vaccines in consumer and in pharma. You have 40 to 50% more manufacturing sites. Do you think you need as many sites and what's your policy in terms of just filling the sites you have or also restructuring it and how big a challenge do you think it is for cost reduction as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on operating margin, again, I would talk to you about &#x2013; I think the businesses that we've talked about internally are at 40 to 50% operating margins, and you're not spending a lot on R&amp;D behind those. So it's not obvious to me that we actually have to change that margin. I think what we're certainly looking for is profitable growth. So we don't want to become a low margin company. Equally, I think most of our investors are looking for growth on the bottom line, not necessarily the margin line. So I'm not going to say what's the margin going to be in 5%, but clearly you can't have that much margin erosion and still grow your bottom line.</p>
          <p>In terms of the manufacturing costs, I've certainly seen in a few analysts' reports that we look like we're about two points adrift. At the same time, we have a far less exposure, and even compared to Glaxo that has over 50% of its sales in the U.S. We're around 40% and we have a proportionate more share in some of the developing world where we don't have the same gross profit.</p>
          <p>Now, the interesting thing is that we recover that on the operating expenses. So, although we've got, because of the geographic spread of sales and to a small degree, the way we don't have all of the, for instance, Plavix sales consolidated. But it's largely the geographic spread of sales. We also therefore have a lower operating cost because we are employing sales people in lower income countries. So, if you think about the sales force reductions that Hanspeter showed you before in the 2000 that went up. Well, the 2000 that went up don't cost anywhere near what the ones cost in Europe and U.S. So, that's why we still end up with the third best operating margin is that we do -this cost us a little bit on cost of sales <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Now, I can say &#x2013; one of the things I'm delighted about is when we have FDA inspections in this Company, there is not an awful lot in terms of 483s and I think this is a Company that has avoided some disasters in places around the world with quality issues, whether it's on the pharma side or the vaccine side. And then you look at where Merck is today on the fact that they are having difficulty producing a lot of the vaccines because of difficulties in the Westpoint site. Most of our industry had problems in Puerto Rico. I think you want to be careful about trying to save money on your manufacturing line because it can come back and cost you a whole lot more. It doesn't mean that we don't have to think about that and we have one of our transformation projects, Philippe Luscan, who runs our manufacturing, is working with McKenzie on that project to think about what we need to do to adapt and I think, as I said, we've already gone from 79 manufacturing facilities to 64. So, it shows that the Company has a track record of continuing to seek productivity improvements and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>I think the only nuance again I'd put in this is that when you think about driving your business, you do have to think about volumes and not just value and there are an awful lot of big volumes behind OTC business and behind emerging markets. But I think the fact that given the 47% of the volume is sold in the southern hemisphere and 37% is already manufactured there, shows that also this is a Company that has been able to make those adaptations and if we can do more on that front, we will do more on that.</p>
          <p>One over there, number two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Richard Wassup from JPMorgan. Two quick questions. One, there's been a lot of talk from especially from the vaccines business on new manufacturing sites. I just wondered if we could get an outlook for capital expenditure going forward possibly for the vaccines business and the business as a whole? And then one product-related question for Marc is will we see the eplivanserin data presented at a major conference soon and what medical conference that might be? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Laurence, perhaps you could take the capital expenditure question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's 1.6 billion investment this year which is pretty stable compared to last year. In this amount, you have about 200 million of acquisition of products. So, it's 1.4 billion when you talk about actual cap investment in the way you were mentioning it. And out of this, it's about 400 million for vaccines. And in the next few years that should be a comparable figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as eplivanserin, we are still thinking about which meeting will be the most appropriate in fact to produce the results. In terms of eplivanserin, what is quite interesting in fact is that when you are going in terms of side effect of the GABAergic compound, you have a clear difference versus eplivanserin and the GABAergic compound. And one of the good directions for eplivanserin, in fact on top of the chronic insomnia with nocturnal awakening, in fact is all the patients with chronic bronchitis and with some impairment of the respiratory function, which in fact are touched by GABAergic compound, but are untouched by eplivanserin. And in fact there is on the previous table results of eplivanserin, based on the previous results with eplivanserin, we may have some kind of benefit on this population. So, we're still looking which might be the best Congress in order to publish this kind of data in order to make the best of eplivanserin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. <mark type="inaudible" /> Two quick questions. First on vaccine, could you be more specific about the gross for the vaccine business, your vaccine businesses including the joint venture you have with Merck, especially regarding the performance of Gardasil which has been over the last quarter a little bit disappointing with 20% drop. Can we have to expect a decline in 2009 for this vaccine?</p>
          <p>And second question on Lantus, we have noticed two years of delay for the outcome of the origin study, so what the reason why? And second question, what are the regulatory risks if the outcome is finally negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we are expecting results in big trial in cardiovascular setting is that the treatment are changing and so the number of events is decreasing. And so if the number of events is decreasing, you need to increase the population in order to show difference. If what we're facing with Lantus in terms of the indication of Lantus versus origin, so far it is a little bit different because the purpose of Lantus is to look if an early initialization in patient is beneficial or not, which is not in fact the actual indication of Lantus. So, I will say that if origin is positive, it will increase especially in the setting of the present and you know where there is some controversy about the benefit of perfect control of HbA1C. So, if origin is positive it will be a big boost for Lantus. If origin is negative I think we'll stay as Lantus after in fact one oral antidiabetic therapy or most of the time in fact after pure antidiabetic therapy. So, I think benefit impact is positive, no impact is negative, and in terms of &#x2013; unfortunately if you look most of the cardiovascular study at the present time, we have to increase the sample size because there is a decrease of events, which is good for the population, but which is bad for pharmaceutical companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And growth of the vaccines and particularly the JV and Gardasil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We believe that the vaccine market next year is going to grow at about 8% and we expect to, as we've done it historically, basically outpace the vaccine marketplace. I think the big variable for us next year will be, will the flu marketplace expand in 2009 as we would envision, or is it going to take several years to get the immunization recommendations broadened. So and to speculate how high, but we'll be above 8% above the market growth.</p>
          <p>The joint venture is sort of an interesting phenomena on Gardasil in particular because when you look at a vaccine product particularly a product let's say like Menactra or Gardasil, peak sales occurred normally in the first one to three years after launch and then you see a slight decline and why is that? Because you get recommendations for a specific birth cohort. In the case of Gardasil often times, the recommendation is for 11 years of age.</p>
          <p>And the question is what do you do about the 12-year-old or the 13-year-old or 14-year-old who is not at that recommendation and many countries will recommend a catch-up. And so they will say okay, every child at 11 should be immunized but you should try to catch up with the 12, 13, 14-year-old. As the 14-year-old becomes 15, they move out of the target market and so with that you have a larger target population at launch because you have the cohort, plus the catch-up. And then as you immunize the catch-up, they are no longer eligible or if they don't get immunized and they move past the target.</p>
          <p>So, that's the phenomena you see with many new vaccines and Gardasil is no different and you see that Gardasil phenomena occurring as well in the U.S., basically &#x2013; sales basically went up very rapidly and then the fourth quarter or the second year launch, it started to slow down. We believe that the product will &#x2013; in Europe will continue to grow but at more modest rates. It's going to be driven by &#x2013; there are still countries where reimbursement needs to be secured, there are still countries that need to basically address the catch-up marketplace. But countries like Germany and France had very rapid uptake and so you saw very good growth.</p>
          <p>And the other phenomena for Gardasil is that for the first 18 months, Gardasil was a sole source product. There are now two products available in Europe. So, we are not going to maintain 100% market share in the face of another competitor. We are going to maintain a large market share and in fact still maintain 90% market share with the second product available.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we need to wrap up on the Q&amp;A. It looks like we're pretty much exhausted. Thanks. I believe if you're willing to stay we'll be available. I think we've got a little drinks set up outside. So, if you're able to spend some time we can continue any Q&amp;A you have there. Obviously, we'll see you at various other meetings in the quarterlies. I'll certainly be on the earnings calls every quarter as well. So, you should have all kinds of opportunities to ask Management questions. So, I appreciate everybody coming today. Thanks again for your interest in sanofi-aventis.</p>
