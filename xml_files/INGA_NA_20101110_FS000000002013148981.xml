        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Stefan welcoming you to ING's Q3 2010 Conference Call.</p>
          <p>Before handing this conference over to Jan Hommen, Chief Executive Officer of ING Group; Patrick Flynn, Chief Financial Officer; and Koos Timmermans, Chief Risk Officer, let me first say that any forward-looking statement in today's comments are subject to a number of current views, assumptions and variables, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates, movements in security markets, including equity markets and underlying economic conditions and changes. These are set out in greater detail in our public filings, which we would urge you to read.</p>
          <p>The realization of forward-looking statements could be materially altered and unexpected movements in any or all of these and other variables. Good morning, Jan, Patrick, and Koos. Jan, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and welcome, everyone, to the ING third quarter conference call. I am happy to report that ING continues to make good progress towards our strategic priorities and we have reached some important decisions with respect to the IPO process of our U.S. Insurance businesses.</p>
          <p>Koos, Patrick and Matt Rider, our CAO of Insurance, are with me here today. And we will later be available to answer questions after my presentation.</p>
          <p>Slide two, you look at the numbers here, the bank posted another strong quarter, a profit of 1.5 billion before tax. Operating result of insurance company increased for the third consecutive quarter, rising to 473 million compared with 393 in the third quarter last year. However, underlying results before tax were impacted by assumption changes on the variable annuities in both the U.S. and Japan. And the net profit also included a write-down of goodwill related to U.S. insurance.</p>
          <p>As we work towards the separation and divestments of our insurance company, we are not ruling out the option of one IPO, but we have decided that we prepare for a base case of two IPOs, one European-led IPO and a separate IPO focused on the U.S. As a result, we will implement a number of changes in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of 2011 that will improve the reserve adequacy of our U.S. legacy block as well as reduce the earnings volatility going forward and it will bring our U.S. reporting more in line to what our U.S. peers are doing. We will elaborate on these measures in the Insurance section of the presentation.</p>
          <p>Slide three, you see that the bank delivered another strong quarter, slightly down compared with the second quarter, but that included an 86 million capital gain on the sale of an equity stake. The performance of the Insurance company improved further in Q3. That's the third consecutive improvement in operating performance, driven this time by investment margin as we invested more cash balances. Pre-tax results were negatively impacted by the VA assumptions and the changes in those assumptions to the tune 356 million.</p>
          <p>Underlying net result for the group was 1,043 million, up from Q3 but down from Q2 entirely due to the VA assumptions, changes that we did in the insurance business. Our net profit was impacted by a goodwill impairment of 513 million that related to our U.S. insurance business.</p>
          <p>You see on slide four that the bank has good progress on the Ambition towards 2013 targets. The business generated strong income growth in the first nine months, helped by healthy margins, lower market impact and excluding the impacts of markets, income rose by 6.2%.</p>
          <p>Cost to income ratio excluding market impact improved to 52.9 in the first six months of this year and risk costs are trending down towards more normalized levels and the return on equity is 17.1%, if we use the original 7.5% core Tier 1 ratio assumption we put in our plan for Ambition 2013. If we use the equity as we reported in our accounts, the return on equity for the bank is 13%.</p>
          <p>On slide five, you see the plan for Insurance. Encouraged to see the initial progress that we are making on the Ambition towards 2013. We had healthy growth in the general accounts. The investment margin for Q3 standalone picked up to 92 basis points, although the improvement is not apparent yet in the four-quarter rolling average.</p>
          <p>The administrative expense as a percent of income were down slightly in the first nine months and we are implementing measures to bring this ratio further towards the objective of 35%. Sales growth continued to exceed our 10% target, while we were able to maintain strict pricing discipline. RoE is lagging and was impacted by the assumption changes on the variable annuities. Therefore, further improvement is required and we will focus on further improving our operations here.</p>
          <p>Slide number six, you see the capital ratios. The bank improved its core Tier 1 ratio to over 9% and Insurance Solvency ratio decreased seven points, but still at 261%, still a pretty healthy number. The reason for the decline was that the growth of our business caused a mild uptick in the required capital for Solvency.</p>
          <p>Slide seven, you see that bank core Tier 1 capital increased by 4.1 billion in the first nine months and at constant currencies we generated 3.9 billion core Tier 1 capital, driven, of course, by healthy profit levels and a slight decline in risk-weighted assets. This gives us a lot of flexibility in our capital management going forward.</p>
          <p>On slide eight, you see how well we are positioned relative to the new Basel III requirements. Changes will be important regarding capital and liquidity requirements; and although it is still uncertain what the final regulations will be, what we know, we can say that we are mostly largely compliant already with the Basel III proposed legislation. The impact that we see of Basel III and CRD III on risk-weighted assets will be modest, though basically, very compliant on asset leverage and on capital. And the impact of implementing Basel III would be limited to about a decrease of 70 basis points on our core Tier 1 of 9%. And as you know, we are well-positioned with our funding and our liquidity position and we almost meet already the criteria of Basel III for more than 90% today.</p>
          <p>Looking at the operational separation, it's gaining momentum. The Bank and Insurance will be operationally standalone by the end of this year. Final solutions will be in place for approximately 60% of all projects and interim solutions will be in the form of transitional service agreements and will then, over time, gradually be phased out. In line with the agreements with the European Commission, the WestlandUtrecht Bank will be operationally and commercially stand-alone as of the 18th November of this month.</p>
          <p>Separation costs for 2010 are coming in at the low end of our previous expectations and they are expected for this full year to be at about 85 million; that's an after-tax number. Costs in 2011 and beyond are harder to predict, but I only can tell you that we will be very vigilant and keep these separation costs really under control.</p>
          <p>And finally then, we made some important decisions on the Insurance divestment strategy and also on branding. Until separation, our business will continue to operate under the ING umbrella, the brand's umbrella; but after separation, the Bank will retain the brand.</p>
          <p>While we are not ruling out the possibility of one IPO, we now have decided to move forward on two IPOs, one European-led IPO that has solid cash flow and strong positions in developing markets and a U.S.-focused IPO that is a leading franchise in retirement services.</p>
          <p>This will really provide us optionality and flexibility, flexibility in timing, flexibility in execution and also flexibility in where market environments in Europe and the U.S. might be more attractive. Also, with respect to Solvency II, there still is a lot of uncertainty and it could well be that not until late 2012 it may be decided what this outcome will be. And we cannot take any risk here.  We need to prepare for the fact that it may be introduced.</p>
          <p>So in terms of valuation, we believe that a U.S.-focused IPO would benefit from a New York listing and a large investor base in the U.S. Furthermore, I think that U.S. investors are more familiar with the VA business and with the valuation.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the Bank. The Bank continues to show strong profits. Together with lower risk cost and lower negative market impacts than a year ago, this has resulted in strong underlying pre-tax results of 1.5 billion. Pre-tax result was slightly down compared to the second quarter, because that included an 86 million gain on the sale of an equity stake.</p>
          <p>Interest margin of the bank remained relatively stable over past year. The decline in Q2 was largely explained by a swing in financial markets, and that was reversed in the third quarter. Interest margin on the core lending and deposit business is stable. There is increasing margin in retail Benelux and ING Direct, and somewhat lower margins on new business lending to large corporates. Over time we would expect this to decline, but we &#x2013; for the next quarters, we foresee that margins will continue to hold up well in most of our markets.</p>
          <p>Cost income ratio at 53.4%, expenses increased by 11.9 in Q3, but that was largely related to foreign exchange. If we exclude foreign exchange and also market impacts and the one-off release that we had in Q3 last year, then expenses were up by only 4.1% and mainly explained by higher marketing expense, selective investments and opportunities for growth and system improvements, because we continue to invest in the long-term future of the bank.</p>
          <p>The cost income ratio excluding market impacts was 53.4. But I must say, a slight deterioration from Q2, but cost discipline remains high and it's an important focus and the 50% cost income ratio target for 2013 still stands. You see the risk cost declined to 374 million, that's about 40 basis &#x2013; 45 basis points average risk-weighted assets. The coming quarters, we anticipate that risk cost will remain in line with the average that we have seen in the last nine months and it was at about 53 basis points. The new risk guidance is below our previous guidance that we provided in the call that we had at the end of Q2.</p>
          <p>The next slide you see, slide 16, the non-performing loans, that declined from 2.2% to 2.1%. Non-performing loans for mid-corporates in SME and the Benelux declined for the first time since the start of the crisis. And at ING Direct, the non-performing loan rate for mortgages continues its downward trend.</p>
          <p>You see that on slide 17, you see that retail banking underlying result before tax increased further, driven by higher interest rates, higher results and lower impairments and almost all businesses showed a performance improvement compared with last year and the second quarter of this year. Belgium was lower because of releases, one-off releases in the third quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Commercial Bank doing well. Excluding real estate, the profits increased again in the third quarter and the quality of earnings also improved as the core lending activities offset the decline in financial markets. And you see that the real estate losses have narrowed to 6 million now this quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Insurance, we see strong improvement in operating result, reaching 473 million in the third quarter, which is the third consecutive quarterly improvement. I think I am satisfied with the operating performance given the low interest rate environment and approved divestment profile that we have elected.</p>
          <p>Result before tax were impacted by assumption changes on the variable annuities in both U.S. and Japan, but before I move to non-operating impacts, I would like to spend a few minutes on the operating results in detail.</p>
          <p>You see slide 21, the spread on the general account increased substantially this quarter, driven by reinvestments of cash in the Benelux and lower expenses in the U.S. Investment margin increased to 87 basis points and the actual investment spread standalone was 92 basis points and has really trended upwards in the last three quarters.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide 22, the current low interest rate environment, if that were to persist a number of years and I think that's an important slide, we believe our operating income would only marginally be impacted by it. The vast majority of our income is coming from fees and premium-based revenues. And investment income only represent 21% of the total. So our structurally low yield would lead to a modest decline in the investment spreads.</p>
          <p>However, we have flexibility to reduce the credited rates which would limit the impact of low interest rates on the investment spread to about 10 basis points or just 2.5% of operating income. So I think also here, well positioned.</p>
          <p>Technical margin and the fee both increased in the quarter. Technical margin going forward, I think you need to calculate more or less at a level of 200 million. That can be a little lumpy from time-to-time, but that has to do with the &#x2013; that the expected mortality results from time-to-time can deviate from the assumptions we have made.</p>
          <p>Administrative expense, they were up at constant currencies 3.9%, but compared with the second quarter, they were up by 1.1%. Cost discipline is important, as you know, in our management and the U.S. will work on a program that they will reduce their expense next year by another 100 million. That will come later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>When you look at the individual regions of the Insurance organization, most businesses showed an improvement in operating performance. Only the Benelux was lower, but that had to do with the seasonality of high dividend income and one-off expenses in the previous quarter, which is &#x2013; especially the high dividend income is, I think, standard in Europe. The operating result in the U.S. increased 37%, driven by higher margins.</p>
          <p>Slide 26. Net result of the insurance and the impact by the assumptions on the VA. You see that we started with a result of 473 million, operating result. The VA assumptions brought it down by 356, some other operating impacts and the end result and underlying pre-tax profits of 18 million. But then we have special items, goodwill and other special items, mainly restructuring, that brought the result down to a net profit &#x2013; a net loss of 656 million.</p>
          <p>When we look at our sales, our sales are continuing to grow strong. Sales, measured in APE, were very healthy this quarter at almost 1.2 billion, and particularly strong in Asia and Latin America, where we continue to benefit from the strong distribution of our leading life and pension franchises. In Asia, the sale of COLI products that we launched in the first quarter of 2010 continue to be doing well and we also had new products in Hong Kong and Malaysia.</p>
          <p>The measures we have taken on the VA &#x2013; on the U.S. VA have reduced the DAC and have stabilized the reserves but induce earnings volatility in the past. Here you see that the measures that we are taking, how they are helping. The U.S. RBC ratio, the capital ratio improved to 425%. Reserve and adequacy on the Legacy VA is reduced by 1 billion and the DAC balance is reduced by 1.5 billion. But that leads to high degree of volatility, as you can see on the bottom of the right side of the slides.</p>
          <p>As a result, we are working on a number of changes now for Q4 and Q1 that will improve the reserve adequacy of the U.S. Legacy VA business and will reduce the earnings volatility going forward, and it will bring accounting and hedging for the U.S. business more in line with what U.S. peers are doing.</p>
          <p>Starting in Q4, the U.S. Legacy VA business will be reported as a separate line of business and that will improve transparency. This fact will trigger a DAC write-down of approximately 1 billion and the 1 billion is based on numbers at the end of Q3. And the reduction is needed to bring the reserve adequacy up to the 50% confidence level.</p>
          <p>From Q1, we are studying a number of changes that will bring our accounting then much more inline with what U.S. peers are doing. And that will include the introduction of a reversion to mean assumptions for determining DAC that will reduce the earnings volatility going forwards; a move towards fair value accounting of reserves for guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits as of the 1st of January 2011, in order to better reflect the economic value of the guarantees. That will allow us to substantially increase hedging of interest rates on the legacy VA book that are causing significant earnings volatility.</p>
          <p>And also as of September, the difference between the current book value of the reserves and the estimated fair value is between 1 and 1.3 billion. And that would be reflected, but then there is the numbers as they are on the 1st of January in the shareholder's equity as of Jan 1, 2011. And we'll strengthen the reserves by the same amount.</p>
          <p>So again, combined, these measures are expected to improve the reserve adequacy on the U.S. VA to well above 50% confidence, as well reduce the K factor to below 50%, substantially reduce the interest rate risk on the book, reduce the earnings volatility and will allow us to recognize earnings on this book at a small positive run rate going forwards.</p>
          <p>Also, our U.S. management, slide 30, is taking steps to further sharpen the focus and to enhance profitability. And the focus will be on the leading retirement services and strong individual life business. We will close the wholesale distribution channel for annuities, but we will continue to distribute our rollover annuity products only through our own distribution channels.</p>
          <p>Additional cost savings from administrative expense and head count, reduction of about 630 &#x2013; 680 FTEs are expected and will result in a reduction of &#x2013; will result in a savings of cost of about 100 million per year starting in 2011.</p>
          <p>So, let me wrap up and say, our business is making significant progress. We continue to strengthen the insurance franchise to eventually bring down two strong companies to the market. And we are now ready to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Spencer Horgan [Deutsche Bank]. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just in terms of the bank firstly, maybe. The interest margin you've talked about before declining to 120 basis points over time and obviously continues to run above that level. I was just wondering, does the news flow you've had on Basel III sort of increase your optimism that maybe long-term interest margin could remain above 120 basis points?</p>
          <p>Then the second question is in terms of these various charges you are intending to take in the Insurance business, I assume it doesn't really change the statutory Solvency ratios, but is there going to be any need to move capital around the group back into the Insurance business? So for example, upstream it from the Bank into Insurance or can you contain this within insurance? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is on interest margin longer-term and the impact of Basel III. May I have &#x2013; Koos, will you take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Spencer, it's a bit early to say that because on the one hand you could say that Basel III will lead to a reduction of expansion of balance sheet and therefore, the ability to produce loans will become less in the financial institutions and that leads to better loan pricing. On the other hand, the liquidity rules are not completely clear and there could be a fight for savings money and that could have a margin narrowing effect. So and to be honest, the precise rules on liquidity, they are not 100% crystallized out. So I find it too early to already say like Basel III will have an upward or a downward effect. But overall, loans a bit positive, on the savings side, will be a bit negative, but the extent to which, we don't know yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Spencer, then the question on the will there be capital from Bank to Insurance? I think at this moment, we are looking at planning that Insurance will take care of its own capital, but if needed, we stand ready to make capital available. Because we have, let's say, as a group still the interest to create the highest possible value for the group. So if that adds to the value of the group, we certainly will take that position and make capital available when needed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Duncan Russell [JPMorgan]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. First one is, you were talking in the press release about IPOs. Just to be clear, you are not ruling out trade sale or spin-off of the Insurance assets, are you? The second question then is, what would make you do one IPO rather than two IPOs? I can't think of the reason why you would do one IPO. So could you just elaborate on that? And then third one, could you give us the MCEV of the U.S. Life business, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Duncan, can we rule out anything? No, we cannot rule out anything. All options are always on the table, so I think that's pretty clear. One or two IPOs, you cannot think of one or reason to do one. Well, I can think of a reason to do one, but then market circumstances will be really, really very good and it's so easy to do one that you say, let's go ahead, because it's easier to do one IPO operationally than two. But if you look at where markets are, if you look at where our businesses are, the location, the timing and the flexibility that you want to have, I think at this moment, preparing for two IPOs is the best way to go and should this incredible paradise show up, then one IPO is still possible. But I would say at this moment, we prepare for two. And Patrick, the MCEV?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>MCEV, yeah, we don't disclose MCEV at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What's the book value then of the U.S. third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We gave that at the end of the fourth quarter and we'll probably do an update at the end of the year. But we don't disclose book values by business. In total, it was 21 billion for all of Insurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Farquhar Murray [Autonomous Research]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, morning, gentlemen. Just two questions from me? First, just in regards to the accounting standard for the variable annuity book, are we right in thinking that's FAS-157 or you elected fair value option under IFRS?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, with regards to the 1 billion to 1.3 billion kind of hit in the start of the year next year, could you just give us a sense of what the sensitivities are around that number, particularly to interest rates if indeed, we need to try and change or reflect that number?</p>
          <p>And then finally, I shall throw in a third actually. On the interest hedging strategy, do you know what the costs of that will be on a recurring basis? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Book value, we'll ask Matt Rider to answer the first two questions and Koos to do the last one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with respect to the accounting standard, the decision as to whether it's a 157 or 133, it would likely be more of a 133 under U.S. GAAP. We would likely go to more something to full fair value. We would like to be &#x2013; under IFRS. We would like this sink them up as much as possible. But that decision has not been &#x2013; has not been made yet.</p>
          <p>I think importantly on the interest rate sensitivity, it will be a little bit sensitive as you get into the &#x2013; as you restate your figures for the January 1 equity. However; that's also a bit of question as to what extent we begin the hedge that interest rate exposure, starting within this year. So I think probably not exactly the right thing to do to give you a sensitivity on that, because it depends both in terms of the liability, but also to the extent that we would begin to hedge that.</p>

          <p>And if you look at the interest hedge, what does it do for your results? In essence, the most likely form of hedging would be receiver's swaps. Those would be marked to market as of the 1st of January against those liabilities. But on a cash flow basis, yes, you are receiving fixed versus paying floating, so your first year, you expect to collect more money out of that.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a follow-on. Can I read from the comment on interest rate sensitivity, that you probably intended to hedge that reasonably quickly?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>The speed at which we want to hedge this, I mean, we will look forward over how are we going to do that over the fourth quarter and into the first quarter? I mean, we don't want to give an exact timing on that. And we just do whatever is reasonable in markets.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much indeed. A couple of issues. Presumably the fact that there isn't an overall Insurance CEO very much rules out the one IPO at the moment. I mean, you have to do something about that. So, I'm wondering just what the strategy of the management changes is and a bit more background to it? Secondly, you've impaired, I think, the goodwill on the CitiStreet acquisition. Does that reflect what is going on in CitiStreet? And can you give us an update there?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on ING Direct U.S. I think you took in some reversals of impairments into the NIM in first and second quarter, could you quantify what they were in the third quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is not a matter of, do you have the CEO, yes or no? Because that is &#x2013; I think that is not the important issue. The important issue, what is the most successful way to go to market and I think that is what we have decided, two IPOs and that had consequences and so that is the basis for our decision, not whether you had one or two CEOs available. You can always have a CEO available. CitiStreet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The CitiStreet &#x2013; the impairment is for the entire segment. It does relate to CitiStreet, but does not imply the CitiStreet acquisition was not a success. In fact, it's the opposite. Cost synergies there are running well. We expect 50 million run rate savings, which was offset by an integration cost of less than that, 25 to 30. Going forward, we would hope those cost synergies will accelerate to the 70 million mark. So we were very pleased with the CitiStreet acquisition.</p>
          <p>In respect to your other question on ING Direct, the impact on income was 55 million in the third quarter, which is a small reduction from the 64 in the previous quarter. We had a logical change in how we amortized that premium over time, which led to that reduction.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning gentlemen. Thomas Nagtegaal, RBS. Three questions from my side. First of all, can you explain a little bit how you're going to do the VA interest rate hedging? Are you going to give away all potential upside when interest rates rise again?</p>
          <p>Second, what will be the impact of the DAC impairments on, let's say, annual VA earnings? So how much annual DAC amortization will be reduced? And third, Basel III, here, you give the 70 basis points impact at this point in time. Could you give an indication how much it will be before you sign? How much of the deferred tax assets are you going to use? Do you have any view on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The hedge, Matthew, are you doing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I take the hedging, I mean, this is sort of standard stuff for interest rate hedging, we would do it with the combination of swaptions and swaps. In terms of the amount of interest rate exposure that we would be hedging, you asked if we would be giving up all the upside as a consequence of rising interest rates. The answer is no to that, because we'll only move the WB block to market. Now after moving that block to market, we would expect something on the order of about 40% of our interest rate exposure to be hedged, so we've not given up the upside, but we have eliminated some of the downside. So I think that's actually quite important.</p>
          <p>With respect to the impact going forward on VA earnings, you will notice that we take down the DAC by about &#x20AC;1 billion, so obviously, that is going to be an increase over many years in terms of our &#x2013; in terms of what we would have otherwise reported. But I think that &#x2013; I think in last quarter, we reported something on the order of something like &#x20AC;100 million loss. We would &#x2013; per quarter. We would expect to see something on the order of some nominally positive gains. So you can get a difference from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And the Basel III question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. For the Basel III question, the 70 basis point was indicated if we would do this right now. So that is ignoring future earnings, but the &#x2013; if we abstract from that part, the biggest issue there is 70 basis points now is 50 basis points two years later because of a write-down of DTAs . So that is in effect the part where you said the difference between the old start or a start as per 2012 and ignoring earnings is 20 basis points.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. I've just got a few questions. Firstly just on the U.S. business and its earnings going forward, just want to bring together all the comments that you made. Are you basically suggesting that we could have slightly higher than the current U.S. operating profit run rate as the total earnings of the U.S. business that's with the VAs and everything else altogether? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two is, you are going to rebuild your reserving in the U.S. to above &#x2013; you're well above the 50% confidence level. What comfort can you give us that this brings you into line with peers? And is there any case you made that you will be more conservative than peers as a result of this? The third question is on the U.S. on the two IPO base case. What would be in the U.S. and what would be in the European listing in terms of the geographic businesses that you have? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with respect to the operatings in the U.S. going forward, I think that's right that you would expect some kind of a marginal increase in earnings as we go forward as a consequence of these changes. I think quite importantly though that if we start to see some positive movement in equity markets more so, then you will see more of that kind of operating result coming through over time.</p>
          <p>The other question with respect to the reserving and how we're going to move that and the fact that we will end up with reserving well in excess of the 50th percentile confidence level. You asked whether that would bring us more in line with U.S. peers, it would be difficult for us to comment on the amount of reserve adequacy that U.S. peers have. So that's point one. But I think that at least in terms of the accounting for the WB benefit and bringing that more toward a market value basis and being able to hedge interest rates going forward, that is really the thing that brings us into line.</p>
          <p>The movements that we make in terms of separating out the VA as a new line of business, the consequence that, that has on writing off DAC. We know that that has a positive impact on earnings. It has a positive impact clearly on reserve adequacy for us. It has a positive impact on getting our K-factors down to more normal levels, but it's difficult to comment about those things relative to U.S. peers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just also just follow up. I mean, you're writing off quite a lot of DAC and you'd be less of current level with 0.5 billion. You're going to move to an accounting policy that doesn't really vary that much, if you move to mean reversion. And you never gave us the kind of book value of just the VA business, but I'm guessing there isn't going to be much book value left as a result of this, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, true. The book value will be written down significantly and we would expect to see clearly more stable and stable earnings at a more positive level going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The point I am trying to make is, I mean, if you could just give us a qualitative answer, that would be really helpful. I mean, the book value of the VA business as a proportion of the U.S., is that going to be quite a small proportion now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'll clearly be smaller.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Your question on the IPO, the two IPOs, what's included. Of course in the U.S., we'll include the Life and the Retirement Services and in the European, we will include the European organization, both the Benelux, Eastern Europe, the rest of Europe and Asia. We have not decided yet what we will do with LatAm, where it will fit. We are still evaluating what the best option is and that will take some time.</p>
          <p>Also, with respect to the Investment Management business, the main business will continue to be in the Netherlands, in Europe. But at the same time, if you do a U.S. IPO, then probably the Investment Management in U.S. will go with the U.S. But we'll make arrangements so that we have partnerships and that our customers who are global customers, will have the benefit of the knowledge, the expertise, the products and the distribution. That all will stay for them as is when we were one company.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Nick Holmes [Nomura]. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, there. Thank you very much. A couple of questions, I am afraid to say, yet again on your variable annuity book. The first is coming back to the confidence level, now you say that the reserve strengthening takes it above the 50%. I wondered if you could tell us how much above the 50%, I mean, what sort of level? And I think 90% is your normal confidence level for reserves, isn't it? So the question is, how much would it take to get you to 90%?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the mean reversion. Just wondered why you haven't done this before. I know you've considered it many times. I mean going back to the Michel Tilmant area and why basically haven't you done it and why are you deciding to do it now? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with respect to the confidence level, what we do in the fourth quarter is we'll &#x2013; so we'll right off DAC to the level of the 50th percentile confidence level. That will take a billion of DAC off. And then in the first quarter, we'll move to market value on GMWB. So now you'll effectively get a bit of a cushion between 1.0 billion and 1.3 billion. In terms of percentage levels, that might be something in the area of 70%, but we haven't calculated that one yet. Now with respect to the &#x2013; sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could I just very quickly ask though, would you take another billion to take it up to 90%, which is the normal level, isn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would &#x2013; okay, so I want to comment a bit on the 90th percentile level. So certainly the 90th percentile sort of rule that we have within ING, is an ING rule. It is predominantly more European-based. And as we move toward more of an IPO scenario, the rules in the U.S. are going to be far more dominant. So I don't even really want to comment on the 90th percentile level in the United States, because it's frankly irrelevant among U.S. peers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now with respect to the mean reversion, we actually had done mean reversion years ago. We switched it back, so that we would be more truing up the DAC balance and so on. But now as we look to do the two separate IPOs, one U.S.-focused, we observe that virtually all U.S. Insurance companies do mean reversions. So this is just one other element to put us more in line with U.S. peers.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Morning. Just a couple of quick questions, just on the NIM, you're still being positively impacted by repricing of the assets. When does that effect roll-off and what will be the impact there?</p>
          <p>And just on the Insurance, can you just talk qualitatively about the economic capital of the Insurance business and where it's moved to as of today?</p>
          <p>And finally, just in terms of the DAC write-down, I mean, why did you choose to write down so much of the DAC when you could have probably written it down to level of the 50% confidence and moved to a mean reversion approach, which would be broadly in line with the U.S. peers? Why did you decide to really reset it heavily? Thanks?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Johnny. In respect of net interest margin, what we are seeing is that, as Jan said earlier, is that it has been stable and resilience over the past five quarters and 140-odd basis points.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we are seeing growth in mortgages at good margins which we think will help sustain that margin going forward and some more pricing of the loan book. So we think those factors on balance are probably going to be &#x2013; outweigh some of the negative effect on the investment book, where you may get lower spreads on reinvesting there. So broadly it's a positive outlook and it's consistent with what we've seen over recent quarters. We think it will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to economic capital of the Insurance company, this is &#x2013; it's not a number that we disclosed in our quarter. So I would be uncomfortable even disclosing qualitatively what that might be. I don't have the numbers in front of me. And then the &#x2013; with respect to the DAC write-down, why so much?</p>
          <p>So I think the first point here is that we follow the IFRS accounting rules in our accounting policies and this DAC write-down is simply a consequence of separating the VA book into a new line of business full stop. Now having said that, I think it's important to get the U.S. into an IPO-able situation, so writing off a significant amount of DAC reduces a lot of equity, reduces a lot of expense of the amortization going forward; and puts us in a place so we can begin to report earnings going forward, especially as we come out of &#x2013; especially as equity markets begin to improve further.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If it's given that you're moving to a mean reversion, I mean that alone is going to reduce the amortization expense for the period, I suppose.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Jan Willem Weidema, ABN AMRO. On the timing of the IPOs, you mentioned the earnings and market conditions as key for the timing of the IPOs. Can you comment on what kind of investment margin and admin expense ratio you would be aiming for before IPO-ing the businesses? Secondly, the decisions you've announced today, will those influence the free flow that you're targeting for the IPOs? And thirdly, on WestlandUtrecht Bank, do you consider integrating that into the European insurance business? And would that also be sufficient for the European Commission?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The timing of the IPO and what type of margins and expense ratios, will we have, well, that's a long-term forecast. I think we want to be a little careful of this. I can tell you that the timing as we are looking at it, is as follows. It takes a bit of time, let's say between eight months and 12 months, before you can do an IPO. There is a lot of things that need to be getting ready for legally, tax wise, accounting wise, you need to do a restatement. So a lot of preparation, including in this case, we also need to build up a lot of corporate services. So I would say it takes roughly a year planning-wise. So, sometime late 2011 at best, but more likely, somewhere in 2012 that we can go to market with an IPO.</p>
          <p>What will margins be at that time? I think we have said that we want to reduce our expense ratios in 2013 to 50% for the bank cost income ratio and we want to be at 35% for the Insurance company. What will be the investment margin at that time, or interest margin? Yeah, I think that's one of the questions that markets will determine at that time. As Patrick was saying earlier, at this moment, we see the interest margin to hold up quite well, but further than that, let's say the next one to two quarters, we cannot look.</p>
          <p>With respect to the free flow before the IPO, what do you mean by that exactly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much of the insurance business will be listed in percentage terms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All of the Insurance business at the end will go in either one of two IPOs, nothing will stay behind. All the Insurance business will go. And that was the condition that we had agreed upon the European Commission. With respect to the WestlandUtrecht Bank, we have at the 18th of this month, we have completely, operationally and commercially, established this as a separate company. We have hired investment banks to look at what we can do with the business, potential interested parties and that's the phase we are in right now. I cannot make any further comments on what the result will be of that exercise. But in due time, when we are ready to come forward with that, I think we will let you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Maybe one more question on the free float. Earlier you seemed to be willing to wait for an outcome of Solvency II and as you indicate, maybe already into 2011, you will IPO the insurance business, which gives you less time to retain earnings. So that I would guess then for the first tranche of the IPO, you would have to list more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I see. No, I did not understand you. I am sorry. No, no, what we will do, we will &#x2013; I was giving you the best possible that we could do in timing-wise, the earliest that was possible. We will look at, of course, what our market's doing. If we have a good production of earnings in the Bank and in the Insurance company, that creates lots of flexibility for us that we may not have to do an IPO. We can maybe do other things as well, but still put these businesses in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>But as one of the questions earlier was, can you do a spin? Yeah, it's possible, but then we need to have the earnings capability and also the timing to implement and execute that. So what I am saying is to you now, the two IPOs plus what we are planning gives us maximum flexibility and maximum optionality to take that route that is the most advantageous value-wise and given what the markets are doing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Benoit Petrarque from Kepler in Amsterdam. Just one question on Basel III, you see a 11 billion increase in risk-weighted assets. It's just 3% of the total risk-weighted assets. I just say that because the total risk-weighed assets on the financial  market division is 32 billion. So it's just 30% increase of the risk-weighed assets allocated to this division. It sounds a bit low compared to European banking peers. So can you just disclose if you feel comfortable with this 11 billion or you think it could be actually at the end a bit higher? And also how much is market risk, how much is CVA? Can you detail that a bit? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at the Basel III risk-weighted assets, there is various components. The 11 billion refers to the pure Basel III rules. Then we have the new trading regime and on the trading regime, you are talking in total about an 8 billion risk-weighted assets. Indeed, if you look at our total amount of trading risk-weighted assets in the bank, it is relatively low. It's not 32 billion; the trading risk-weighted asset is around 6 or 7. So therefore, it is a considerable increase of the trading risk-weighted assets, but then again the trading risk-weighted assets are low because our trading relative to our lending is low.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But this 11 includes trading, higher market risk value, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take the 11 that is Basel III and if you take the eight that is the new trading risk rules, what we call the so-called Basel 2.5.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions, maybe more fixed income focused, around the structure of the IPOs. Obviously you've got a lot of debt at the sub-holding company INGV, so should we assume that maybe the U.S. business gets sold separately and then INGV with its accompanying debt is separately IPO'd with owning the European and the other operations? And finally, could you give an update, please, on discussions with the EC over state-aid repayment and your latest thinking around the ability or otherwise for you to redeem debt as expected? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's too early to go into the details, how we will do the IPO, what structure that it will be. All I can say is we will be extremely careful and extremely vigilant in making sure that we get the best possible deal done, not only value-wise, but also structure-wise. And we'll take every aspect into account, not just the economic aspect, but also the aspect of where we put a debt.</p>
          <p>At this moment, we have no discussions with the European Commission on state aid or on that repayment, but as you can see from our balance sheet and the fact that we have a strong core Tier 1, we are looking, evaluating what options we have to do a repayment to the Dutch state. But at this moment, we have no concrete, let's say, options on the table, but still evaluating and if there is an attractive option, we will certainly look at that.</p>
          <p>Then your last question had to do with ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just &#x2013; I think you covered it. I just want to just quickly follow up, though. I mean, if I was a debt holder in INGV, should I anticipate maybe staying in a &#x2013; with ING Group post these IPOs? That's really the issue or maybe expect I should be floated off with maybe the European parts of the business, the Insurance business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you will have plenty of time to evaluate that, because it will take some time before we get into any particular direct action. For the time being, it is business as usual, albeit that the Bank and the Insurance company are operationally separate, but for the time being, they are still under one holding company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I was just wondering on the IPOs again, sorry; is it fair to assume you will prioritize a sale or an IPO of the U.S. business over the European one or not necessarily? And then the second thing, do you have an update on the timing of the judgment by the European court of justice at all at this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the IPO question. Yeah, I think what we will do is, as I said earlier, we'll take every aspect into account and when markets open up, the markets are there when we are ready. I think we have the option to go either in the U.S. or either go into the European market. I think that will be determined at that time. It's difficult to determine that now. I think we are flexible and that's the purpose of having done this, flexibility and optionality. With respect to the European court, we have &#x2013; I've noted &#x2013; I've seen that some filings were done with the European court, but there are no decisions here yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you still think mid-2011, basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's most likely, but you need to ask the European Court what their timing is. I don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Tony Silverman [Standard and Poor's]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Tony Silverman, Standard and Poor's Equity Research. Just like to come back to the net interest margin on banks. Do you take the message from what you're saying that the 140 basis points is obviously sustainable for a quarter or two. But do you regard it now as a sort of a through-the-cycle likely average, just putting Basel III to one side, if we can for the moment. Or are we &#x2013; really returning to the earlier question, has the 120 points guidance changed at all?</p>
          <p>Second question: was just thinking about the Insurance &#x2013; U.S. Insurance IPO going forwards. I mean, you are going to have a run-off of VA book and really a lot of fee-based business. And the general account, I think, which is not enormous, obviously sizable. But is that going to &#x2013; what will the capital requirements of that be going forwards? Is this one in the wrong ballpark? I think that it may only have a billion or two capital requirements altogether anyway.</p>
          <p>And just out of curiosity, a third question. The &#x2013; in short, what will the brand names of the Insurance and what sort of brand names will you dream up? Will they be completely different or will they not have ING in their title at all? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Tony, in respect to the interest margin for the Bank, yeah, Basel III, as Koos mentioned earlier, is again &#x2013; a bit of a game changer. It's not clear how that will pan out. And what we can see for the immediate future is that, as I said earlier, we think that the margin should be &#x2013; remain robust. We are seeing the potential for positive margin repricing in respect to the mortgages. So on balance we think it should stay strong for as far forward really as we can see, which is the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>And I think it's a bit too &#x2013; it's a bit premature to think about what through-the-cycle margins will be in Basel III. I think that needs time really to play out and see how the impact in terms of deposit pricing and loan, the credit spreads evaluate over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With respect to the question on the brands. Because your second question, we could not pick up. Did you hear that, Matt? Okay. We have someone that could understand your second question. So Matt Rider will answer that one. You want to do that first, Matt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so your question was on the ongoing businesses in the U.S. and the capital requirements of that, given an IPO. So basically, what would the U.S. business be composed of? The first, obviously, is the run-off VA business, but also there is a very &#x2013; it's a tremendous Retirement Services business and a fantastic Life business and that would be ongoing. I would note that the general account assets in the U.S. are about &#x20AC;70 billion, so certainly not inconsequential.</p>
          <p>With regard to the capital requirements going forward, as Jan said, I think we have a little bit of time to think about how to do the capital structure for a stand-alone U.S. business, but it is &#x2013; but I think we see progress in the capital ratios from an RBC standpoint in the quarter. I think last quarter, we were somewhat below 400% RBC; now we raised it up to 425. So the amount of available capital has been increasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the question related to the brands -- yeah, if you do two IPOs, we need to &#x2013; and the Bank will continue to own the ING brands. Of course, we will have to start working on and are working on what will be the brands and the brand name for the two companies. Again, here, we have some time. For the time being, they continue to operate under the ING brand. And when we get closer to the IPO, I think we will be using that and the publicity around that to introduce the brand name for the two companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Farooq Hanif [Morgan Stanley]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I hope you don't mind some follow-up questions. Just firstly, I wanted to ask a question about cash flow. Could you give us some indication of what the cash generation of the U.S. businesses, Insurance business, and the Insurance business as a whole? I mean, to what extent are the earnings a good guide to cash generation; and I'm talking really about a situation where you post-reserving, post-DAC write-down, you're just in a sort of steady state until next year. And could you also comment, especially in the U.S., to what extent the cash is sort of dividend-able? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question two is: just going back on the write-down, I mean, the 1 billion in 4Q and the &#x2013; up to 1.3 billion in first quarter as a pre-tax number, what is the tax impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on the first one, and I didn't quite get the second one, sorry about that, but with respect to the cash-flow generation, yeah, we are still trying to figure out a good way to be reporting this going forward. Because I think you know that within the U.S., really what matters is the cash flow on your statutory accounts. And so far it's been, if you look across all the insurance businesses, the cash flow has been sufficient to support the generation of new business, sort of interest on the debt that we have. But I think importantly, we've been building up some capital within the businesses especially in the U.S. So we need a good way to frame that a bit better going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're basically saying you can't really answer. I mean, do you think earnings are a good start and what deduction did you think we should make for capital required?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd prefer not to comment on that now. I'd rather get this &#x2013; I'd rather get this a little bit better because I don't want you to be making strange adjustments to an IFRS earnings number. We need to come back to you on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just, I guess, maybe a slightly different question. I mean, the fact that your RBC ratio in the U.S. has just improved to quite a solid level. I mean, are you just &#x2013; would it be fair to assume that any tied-up surplus you have is more easily released, if necessary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I didn't catch the last part of your question. We are building capital. It's up to 425%; that's a very good level. As a stand-alone company, it might need to be a little bit higher than that, but that's where it ends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess what I was just trying to say is that because your risk-based capital ratio is so high now, are you &#x2013; does that make you more comfortable about being able to release capital from the U.S., if necessary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we are comfortable with where it is right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question, which you didn't hear, was just understanding the tax impact on the DAC right now and the move to fair value in the VA business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the DAC write-down, that is a P&amp;L impact which will be tax-affected: 1 billion pre-tax, estimate 700 after tax. And then importantly, in respect of the move to fair value, this is a change in accounting policy. So it is reflected in equity, not in P&amp;L; so the number we gave is an estimate of between 1 and 1.3 is the net effect that goes through equity. It is not a P&amp;L element, so tax is not relevant. So one element, the DAC write-down is a P&amp;L charge which is tax-affected in the fourth quarter. The second is a change in accounting policy, which is reflected in equity with restatement of prior periods. It is not P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning everybody. I have a question with regard to the variable annuity product. On slide 29, you have mentioned that GMWB will be hedged by employing row hedging. My first question is why not a mixture of row and delta hedging, which seems to me more efficient in a challenging market?</p>
          <p>My second question regards also the variable annuity product, are you incorporating the cost of hedging into the price of the VAs or do you ignore it since you run it off? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on the first one without getting too technical, we are delta hedging the row. So in essence, we are not going to go into all kinds of strange options to hedge this, but you basically &#x2013; what you do is: you take your basis point values and you look at the simplest instrument to start to hedge that. So in effect, what we are hedging is the row. If you look at delta hedging on VA, maybe you refer more to the equities. That is something that we always continuously have delta-hedged.</p>
          <p>With regards to pricing and cost, yeah, in general, what we do is we have in the past priced these products given a certain amount of hedging cost in there. But it's a closed block, so we are not selling more VA. So in that sense, new pricing or things like that don't &#x2013; are not relevant for this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the cost comes at ING's account? The additional cost, hedge costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost is in the U.S. There is a margin which we are making on the VA product and then whether it is sufficient with the hedging depends on future volatilities amongst other. So that is something like the cost price is fixed and the hedging cost is something which is highly depending on market and market volatility as of now and going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. This is Raghu Hariharan from Citi. I just had one observing question on the VA. If you &#x2013; the first question was your decision to choose FAS 133 versus FAS 157. I guess in FAS 157, you can use your own debt &#x2013; credit spread as your discount rate and I was wondering why you would choose FAS 133? And the second one is just a clarification. Once you move your accounting reserves higher, what is the delta between your regulatory reserves and your accounting reserves once you take the charge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take that one. So the FAS 133 &#x2013; I mean you're absolutely right, the FAS 133 would not allow you to use your own credit spread, whereas the FAS 157 would. And therefore, if you're using FAS 133, it's actually easier to hedge the real interest rate exposure rather than trying to do some hybrid between the interest rate exposure and your own credit risk, so we choose for that.</p>
          <p>With respect to the accounting difference between the -- let's say, the newly restated GMWB reserves on a market-value basis and where our reserves are on a regulatory basis, they're actually very close. I think there was a question earlier about, sort of, the overall impact on all these changes on our statutory accounts and the fact of the matter is, it's quite de minimis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is a follow-up question from Farquhar Murray [Autonomous Research]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, sorry. Just one very quick follow-up. On the, again on the variable annuity business, the assumption change for the U.S. business is about 21 million, which is obviously a very trivial number indeed. I just wondered if there is a kind of balancing effect within that number; i.e., there are bigger gross impacts going on? And in particular, I just wondered if you'd give us some color around what you are actually experiencing in terms of utilization of efficiency relative to your kind of pricing and kind of operational assumptions? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the VA assumption changes, I think you noticed that there was actually a larger impact on the Japan business. Why is that? Because we frankly mark the liability much, much more to market. So when you see this &#x2013; it's a &#x20AC;21 million impact on assumption changes in the U.S., let's remember that that is an SOP sort of reserve. So there is a lot of smoothing and blending along with that.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at just the WB portion of those liabilities, we would estimate that there would be something on the order of the 200 million change on a sort of a market value basis and we've included that impact in the range of estimates that we give and our change to fair value in 1Q. So that sort of gives you a little bit better idea of the magnitude on a market-value basis.</p>
          <p>And then with respect to the giving some color on what we're experiencing, I think you know that we review our assumptions every year. We typically do this in the third quarter. This is part of our normal process. And if we see creditable experience that is different than our management best estimate and causes us to adjust that, then we do it in the current quarter. And beyond that, we would expect to have changes and experience assumptions going forward based on the data that we get as it comes in.</p>

          <p>But if we come back to, say, the 200 million, I mean, is that a kind of positive from long efficiency across the growth of the book plus offset by some utilization? I just want to get a sense of, what did you tweak in that?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Apologies about that. Just within the 200 million, I was trying to get a sense of what numbers you were tweaking; i.e., is it longer persistency, but more utilization and how do you experience the kind of changes that, obviously, you've ultimately made there?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's generally lapse assumptions Those are the ones that are affected in this quarter.</p>
