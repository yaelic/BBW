          <p>Thank you, Chris. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 2009 was an interesting year that tested strategic and execution capabilities across the United States oil and gas industry. We believe that Oxy passed last year's test with an A+. We achieved solid financial results in a very challenging</p>
          <p>environment.</p>
          <p>In a few minutes, Steve Chazen will provide details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2009. But first, I want to mention some highlights and key developments of the past year that we believe are integral to Oxy's continued success in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Notably, in 2009 we were able to grow our worldwide production 7% year-over-year while not increasing our net debt to capitalization. This brought us to the highest annual production volume in our history: 645,000 BOE per day net to Oxy. We expect a similar increase in oil and gas production both this year and next while continuing to focus on operational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Also noteworthy, during the next two weeks we will be announcing the financial &#x2013; official results, but also more importantly our 2009 production replacement. The results look very favorable. We expect to announce that the 2009 reserve replacement ratio is about 200%.</p>
          <p>In 2009 we maintained our A debt rating across all rating agencies. And we continued to build our pipeline of exciting opportunities, which gives us confidence that our production increases from continuing operations of about 5 to 8% annually over the last five years will again be an achievable target for the next five years.</p>
          <p>These results are attributable to consistent execution of our long-term financial strategy, as well as successful companywide initiative to reduce costs. We aggressively managed our oil and gas production cost in 2009's very volatile commodity price environment, reducing our oil and gas production costs per BOE by 15%, excluding production and property taxes. We ended the year with cash on hand of $1.2 billion, very little debt and one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.</p>
          <p>During the past 12 months, we also capitalized on some key opportunities to strengthen our position and achieve further growth. In the United States, we announced a significant discovery of oil and gas reserves in Kern County, California, with initial estimated reserves of 150 to 250 million gross barrels of oil equivalent. Steve will give you an update on its continued production growth in his upcoming comments.</p>
          <p>We also made numerous acquisitions of properties adjacent to our key operations in Texas and California, and expanded other areas of our core business.</p>
          <p>In the Chemical segment, we acquired Dow Chemical Company's calcium chloride operations. Calcium chloride is a premium salt with a variety of beneficial applications, including ice control on roads and sidewalks. Our product line has an approximately 65% market share of the North American market.</p>
          <p>There were also significant positive developments in our Middle East core operations. In Bahrain, we are partnering with Mubadala of Abu Dhabi on a project to redevelop the Bahrain Oil and Gas Field. Field operations began on December 1, 2009. And we expect to increase oil production from the Bahrain Field to about three times its current level of production, to reach 100,000 barrels of oil per day within seven years, and the increase will be of course gradual over time; and increase also gas production by more than 65% to approximately 2.5 billion cubic feet per day.</p>
          <p>It was announced in the fourth quarter that Oxy, partnering with a consortium led by Eni, was awarded a license for development of the Zubair Field in Iraq. Last Friday we announced the signing of the contract with the government of Iraq. And we expect Zubair to reach production of approximately 1.2 million barrels a day within the next six years. That's up from the current level of approximately 200,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>Solid production growth also continued at the giant Mukhaizna oilfield in south-central Oman, where we have a major steam flood project for enhanced oil recovery. As of year-end 2009, gross daily production was over 10 times higher than the production rate in September, 2005, when we took over operations. At that time, Oxy assumed the operation from another company.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to our 2010 capital expenditures, we plan to increase CapEx approximately 19% from the 3.6 billion spent in 2009 to about $4.3 billion for projects that will stimulate our continued growth while maintaining our targeted financial returns.</p>
          <p>Our 2009 results confirmed that Oxy is very well positioned to succeed in the volatile business climate that has presented significant challenges to our industry and to the global economy. We plan to maintain a low-risk, low-leverage profile and a consistent focus on building stockholder value.</p>
          <p>With our concentration on core areas, growth in production and reserves, very efficient operations and a strong balance sheet, we are confident in our ability to continue achieving sustained growth and delivering solid profitability.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn the call over to Steve Chazen.</p>

          <p>Thank you Ray. Net income was $938 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to 443 million in the fourth quarter of last year. 2009 fourth quarter net income included after-tax non-core charges, mostly consisting of a $115 million impairment of certain Argentine producing properties. The 2008 fourth quarter included after-tax non-core charges of 514 million for impairments, rig termination costs and plant closures. Core results were 1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to 957 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Here's the segment breakdown for the fourth quarter. Oil and gas fourth quarter 2009 segment earnings were $1.6 billion, compared to 339 million for the fourth quarter of last year. Oil and gas core results for the fourth quarter of 2009 were 1.8 billion compared to 1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008, after excluding asset impairments in both periods and rig termination costs last year.</p>
          <p>The increase in the 2009 fourth quarter earnings was due to higher crude oil prices and sales volumes and lower operating expenses. Occidental's average realized crude oil price in the 2009 fourth quarter was $69.39 a barrel, an increase of 30% from the 53.52 a barrel last year. Oxy's domestic realized gas price for the quarter is $4.37 per mcf, compared to 4.67 an mcf in the fourth quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Worldwide oil and gas sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 2009 were 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, an increase of nearly 5%, compared to the 620,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter of last year. Daily production volume increased 23,000 BOE a day from Oman and Bahrain, 6,000 BOE a day from Argentina and 13,000 BOE from California operations, excluding Long Beach. Partially offsetting these increases were lower Middle East volumes of 7,000 BOE a day caused by higher oil prices affecting our production sharing contracts.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter of 2009 worldwide oil and gas volumes increased 3.5% or 22,000 barrels a day equivalent from the third quarter 2009 sales volumes of 628,000 BOE a day.</p>
          <p>We began Bahrain production and development activities on December 1, 2009. Argentina volumes increased by 8,000 BOE a day. The third quarter included a 9,000 BOE a day loss due to the strike in Santa Cruz province. California volumes, excluding Long Beach, increased by 3,000 BOE a day.</p>
          <p>Oman volumes increased by 4,000 BOE a day from the Mukhaizna field. Exploration expense was $99 million in the quarter. Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $33 million, compared with 127 million in last year's fourth quarter. After excluding plant closure and impairments, the fourth quarter 2008 core results were 217 million. The fourth quarter 2009 results reflect the continued weakness in most domestic markets, but in particular U.S. housing, durable goods and agricultural sectors.</p>
          <p>Midstream segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 were 81 million, compared to 171 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in earnings was due to lower margins in the marketing business in 2009 compared to 2008, partially offset by improved NGL margins resulting from lower maintenance expenses, energy costs and property taxes in the gas processing business and higher income from the Dolphin Pipeline.</p>
          <p>The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the fourth quarter of 2009, in line with our guidance. Let me now turn to our performance during the twelve months. Net income was 2.9 billion for the twelve months of 2009, compared with 6.9 billion same period last year. Core results for the twelve months were 3.1 billion, compared with 7.3 billion for the full year of 2008. Income for the twelve months of 2009 included $168 million of charges, net of tax and 2008 included $491 million of charges, net of tax, for the items noted on the schedule reconciling net income to core results.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas production costs, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.37 a barrel for the twelve months of 2009, a 15% decline from last year's twelve-month costs of $12.13 a barrel. Taxes, other than on income, were $1.77 a barrel for the twelve months of 2009 compared to $2.62 a barrel for all of 2008. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect lower crude oil and gas prices this year.</p>
          <p>Capital spending for 2009 was $3.6 billion. Capital expenditures by segment were 79% in Oil and Gas, 6% in Chemicals and 15% in Midstream. Oil and Gas expenditures were 56% in foreign operations and 44% domestically.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations for the twelve months of 2009 was $5.8 billion. We used 3.6 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $1.8 billion on acquisitions and foreign bonuses. These items amounted to a $5.4 billion cash usage. We also used $1.1 billion to pay dividends. These and other net cash flows decreased our $1.8 billion cash balance from the end of last year by 600 million to 1.2 billion at December 31. Fourth quarter free cash flow after capital spending, dividends and taxes but before acquisition activity was about $850 million.</p>
          <p>The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the twelve months were 811.3 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.8 million.</p>
          <p>Our debt to cap ratio was 9%. Our 2009 return on equity was 10.3%, with return on capital employed of 9.6%. We'll now discuss some factors affecting our 2010 program. Beginning in 2010, we are making three reporting changes which will impact comparability between years.</p>
          <p>Historically, our production volumes have been reported as a mix of pre-tax and after tax volumes while our revenues are reflected only pre-tax sales. This difference is caused by our production sharing contracts in the Middle East and North Africa where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax. We have treated this as additional revenue but not additional production. To simplify our reporting and to conform with industry practice, our production and our revenues will now be tied. Beginning this year we will refer to production on this more accurate and consistent basis.</p>
          <p>To assist you in making comparisons, an historical chart is presented in the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules that shows what the previous 5 years and the 2009 quarterly volumes would have been on this basis. All references to growth and volume comparisons will be against these reformatted production volumes. For example the production from last year will be referred to as 714,000 BOE a day rather than 645,000 BOE per day for the year. This change will have no effect on the company's financial statements.</p>
          <p>We have combined most of our gas production in the mid-continent regions of the United States into a single business unit called Midcontinent Gas, in order to take advantage of common development methods and production optimization opportunities. This business unit includes the Hugoton field, the Piceance basin as well as the bulk of the Permian basin non-associated gas assets, which had been reported as part of the Permian business unit through the end of 2009. Starting in 2010, these assets will be reported in the Midcontinent Gas. As a result, the Midcontinent Gas unit's production will be approximately 75% gas and 25% liquids.</p>
          <p>Permian production will go from 84% liquids and 16% gas, to 89% liquids and 11%, mostly associated, gas. Included in the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules are charts showing what the previous 5 years and the 2009 quarterly sales volumes would have been for these business units if those Permian gas properties had been reported as part of Midcontinent Gas.</p>
          <p>Occidental's policy regarding tertiary recovery is to capitalize costs, such as CO2, when they support development of proved reserves and generally expense these costs when they support current production. In 2009, we capitalized approximately 50% of the CO2 injected in the Permian basin. Over the years, as the CO2 program matures, a larger portion of the injected gas supports current production. Beginning in 2010, we will be expensing 100% of the CO2 injected, in order to simplify the process of determining the portion that should be capitalized versus expensed. In 2009, $69 million of CO2 costs were capitalized.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead to the current quarter we expect oil and gas sales volumes to increase from the reformatted fourth quarter 2009 amount of 722,000 BOE a day to about 730 to 740 BOE a day at current oil prices. Increases will come from California, Bahrain and Oman. There will be less liftings out of Libya, which will not affect production but will affect sales.</p>
          <p>With regard to prices, at current market prices, a $1.00 change in oil prices impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $36 million. The average fourth quarter WTI was about $76.19 a barrel.</p>
          <p>A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $24 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $5.60 per MCF.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $75 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs.</p>
          <p>For the Chemical segment, the international markets remain solid. In the United States, we have a competitive advantage against foreign products; however, the housing and construction markets remain weak, which will limit improvement in sales volumes and margins. Chemical earnings for the first quarter are expected to be in the range of 30 to $50 million.</p>
          <p>We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the first quarter of 2010 to be in the range of 42 to 43% depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income. Our fourth quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in our supplemental schedules.</p>
          <p>For all of this year, we expect capital spending to be about $4.3 billion. Our capital program will continue to focus on ensuring that our returns remain well above our cost of capital. The additional capital from 2009's $3.6 billion level will be allocated to the Oil and Gas segment. Of this increase, about a quarter each will go to California and Iraq, about 15% to Bahrain and 10% to Midcontinent Gas. As a result, the capital allocation will be approximately 82% in Oil and Gas with the remainder being spent in Midstream and Chemicals.</p>
          <p>Our Oil and Gas DD&amp;A expense for 2010 should be approximately $10.75 per BOE. Depreciation for the other two segments should be approximately $450 million.</p>
          <p>Excluding the Kern County discovery, over the course of a couple years, we have drilled 39 exploration wells seeking non-traditional hydrocarbon zones in California. Of these wells, 12 are commercial and 10 are currently being evaluated. Occidental holds approximately 1.3 million acres of net fee in mineral leasehold in California, which have been acquired in the last few years to exploit these opportunities.</p>
          <p>At the Kern County discovery we are currently producing 145 million cubic feet of gas a day and 7,500 barrels of liquids a day from 15 wells. This is 5,700 BOE a day higher than production of 26,000 barrels a day which we disclosed last quarter. Cumulative gross production since the start of production through the end of December 2009 has been 19.4 bcf of gas and 1.5 million barrels of liquids. We expect to drill 8 wells in the first half of the year focusing on oil drilling and exploring the limits of the field. We also expect to add skid mounted gas processing facilities by the second quarter. This will add to our gas production once these facilities are installed.</p>
          <p>Copies of the press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings and the supplemental schedules are available on our website or through the EDGAR system.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On Iraq, Ray, you spoke briefly on the country, and on Iraq I wanted to see if you can expand on the next steps in that country to the best degree possible, meaning when do you expect investment activities to commence in earnest? And number two, what is the role that KOGAS plays in the consortium with this technical service arrangement that they have? So if you could comment on those two items, I'd appreciate it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dr. Irani. Good morning. We have teams assembled with Eni and KOGAS in Milan right now getting ready. We believe that in the second quarter we'll be commencing negotiation of development plans and kicking off de-bottlenecking activities so that we can get initial production up. Regarding the question of investment in earnest, this year will be mostly de-bottlenecking and gathering data, studying the data, developing the plans in preparation for much bigger expenditures coming in 2011, 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also, I think Steve mentioned that cash calls from E&amp;P declined by around 15%, which is obviously a positive result, and so on this point I wanted to see if you could provide an update as to how you envision this trend unfolding during the next year, meaning are there expectations that expenses are going to decline further and if so, any order of magnitude on that capture rate is appreciated.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the operating expenses, as you know, Doug, the U.S. business is really driven by the gas producers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And without being critical of any one party, they really haven't put a lot of pressure on the suppliers, so we don't see much change right now in operating cost since our oil producers really can't change much.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

I mean, in terms of pay zones, you've kind of alluded backwards and forwards that these things could be quite thick, so if you could actually give us some numbers on that, that would be great.</p>
          <p>And related to that, maybe some update on the development plan? If it is 200 million barrels let's say midpoint then obviously you've got a whole raft of ways that you could go ahead and speed up the drilling there. What exactly do you have in terms of plans for expanding the gas plant beyond the skid mounted plants that you're putting in place in the second quarter? And I have a follow-up on your production targets, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the pay zones in the gas condensate zone run 600 feet of net pay, and in the deeper oil zones around 400 feet of net pay, so it's fairly thick. And then especially in the gas condensate zones, pretty good permeability. So you're draining a fairly thick segment. So I think that's probably something -- the aerial extent doesn't compare with some other things, but it's very similar, as I said in the beginning, to an offshore discovery.</p>
          <p>As far as the gas plant, we really don't know at this point. The skid mounted thing, which maybe add 85 million a day, is not going to be enough because that's maybe only two wells. So we're probably going to have to get some more, and we just don't know big to build the plant at this point. Every quarter it looks like we need a bigger plant. So we're doing the engineering work. We're starting to build it out, but we -- every time we think we have a handle on it, something else happens which expands the size of the plant.</p>
          <p>So we'll be a little constrained in the next quarter or two on gas because we're within our ability to operate at that level, give or take 15, 20 million a day -</p>

          <p>Before I ask my follow-up, Steve, the production number at the end of the quarter, was that the maximum in the quarter or did you have any -- I'm guessing you're playing around with this a bit, so if you had any peaking rates in which case could you give us some insight as to what those would look like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It wasn't the maximum in the quarter. No. It was sort of what it was at the end of the quarter to provide some kind of consistency. When you're running at over-100 gas plant at 100% or maybe more of stated capacity, it's, especially in older plants, it's a stretch to keep it running at over 100%, so what you're looking at is sort of what it happened to be the day we measured it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. My follow-up is really you've given us an indication of 5 to 8% off the higher base I guess for this year for production, but I have to confess, Steve, I'm kind of struggling here because Bahrain is a big slug, California is a big slug, and then you've got the ramp up in Oman and various other things, obviously Century gas plant. Just help us how &#x2013; why is 5 to 8% the right number? It just looks like you might be sandbagging a little bit here.</p>

          <p>Good morning, guys. I may be extrapolating a little bit on Doug's questions on Kern County, California. I'd like to see if you could give us a bit more of an update, outside of Kern County it looks like you added three more wells or drilled three more wells in the fourth quarter there. I think going back to the last quarter's presentation you had expected seven. Just curious if there's sort a permitting delay involved there, or any significant change in your ex- Kern County exploration plans?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Some little permitting. It's just a matter of getting around to it. It may be that a well was in process or something and didn't get counted.</p>

          <p>And then with respect to the Monterey shale, that's something that you haven't talked too much about, I don't believe, and I guess you're not testing that directly so much, but correct me if I'm wrong in these sort of 39 wells you've drilled so far. But is that fair or have you actually put some let's say multi-stage lateral wells into the Monterey shale and gotten any kind of production response?</p>

          <p>We're doing them simpler drilling than that and we are drilling shale wells, and the pace of that is picking up nicely as we move through the year, whether it's the Monterey shale or some other shale that we probably don't want to get into, but so far we haven't done much in the way of high-cost -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. A follow-up question on California. I believe most of the production you highlighted in your slides comes from the gas condensate zones, and I think you were going to be drilling in the oil zones, and I believe, Steve, you mentioned about 400 feet of net pay. Can you comment at all on the drilling results you have seen in the oil zones and when we might start seeing production contribution from those? I'm talking about the Kern County area.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The oil zone, the gas condensate zone is a fairly straightforward zone. The oil zone, as I think we've indicated, is more complicated. The other problem is that when you drill the oil well, it is also produces gas, and we're a little tight on the capacity, so we ought to be able to see production out of that in the next couple quarters, but we still need gas plant capacity because even though you might produce 800, 1,000 barrels a day out of the oil zone, you're still producing 2 or 3 million a day of gas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's 800, 1,000 barrels a day per well from the oil zone is what you might think about?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, initially. And then you also produce gas, so I think you got -- we're a little constrained. And also the area, we're trying to outline the field so we know how big to build the plant because that's really what's controlling sizable increases in production.</p>

          <p>That's fantastic. And then just a final unrelated one in terms of Iraq, can you provide any comment on how much CapEx it would take to get to the 1.2 million-barrel a day target, I believe Dr. Irani you mentioned? And then how much your capital spending might be this year and the next few years? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you want to get to the end, bear in mind we like to look at net cash flow, and we've said clearly in our remarks earlier that the exposure to the company in total during the 20-year contract will be less than $1 billion. Taking into account the fact that this is a very quick recovery of spending, the press mentions all kind of numbers that seem to test the spending over 30 years, would be $20 billion, over five years, it's this and that. The advantage of this contract is high early cost recovery. So Oxy's total capital spending in the project will be less than $1 billion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. As you kind of are thinking about the chemical acquisition from Dow and as you think about your company-wide portfolio, should we expect the Chemical and perhaps the Midstream business as well to continue to grow in pace with your upstream business so that you're kind of 80% upstream CapEx and then the associated free cash from the other business remains constant as your upstream business grows?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is no strategy of balancing growth in the Chemical business and the upstream business. The Chemical business, as we have said repeatedly, is a solid net cash generator to the company to invest in the upstream, and from time to time we opportunistically look at bolt-on acquisitions to our business. Calcium chloride business became available with attractive returns to us. And frankly this year, with the bad weather, it's even performed better than we expected. So we look at things which fit into our marketing and manufacturing capabilities, and I think over time one would expect that the upstream business would continue to be the major part of the company and maybe growing as a percentage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Midstream, which I think is a bigger number, the Midstream business is really influenced just this year -- last year and this year by the plant, the Century plant. Once that plant is done with, the Midstream capital will plummet. So the percentage in the oil &#x2013; you're talking instead of going from 4 or 500 million in the Midstream you're probably going to wind up in the $100 million range. So your percentages will shift even more heavily to the &#x2013; so the Midstream business is really supporting the Oil and Gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. When we think about on the upstream side the conventional versus unconventional opportunities in your portfolio, and clearly $5 a barrel finding and development costs in California is extremely attractive, are there other unconventional oil opportunities outside of your current portfolio that could be interesting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at lots of things, and so I think we study everything. It would be fairly hard for us to duplicate the economics in California, but we continue to look.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a last follow-up on Doug's question. As we're working through the restated volumes, can you give us an idea of what growth guidance would have been percentage terms under the old reporting methods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. Same order of magnitude. I mean, it's just a range that's used. We try to be in the high end of the range, but it's not really that precise.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If oil prices go through the roof, just as an example, we can't be in the upper range. So the 5 to 8% we feel is a solid range we can achieve on a sustained basis over the next five years. To speculate what it could be on the upper end would be misleading, frankly. We think 5 to 8 is a very solid rate of growth, maintaining high returns, remember. We continue to say we expect high returns, and not just growth. So we could grow faster, but we believe that the continued emphasis on efficiency, cost control, CapEx, et cetera, solid discipline across the board is more important than just uncontrolled high-volume growth.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Could you ask me looking forward as some of the other companies out there are looking to right-size and somewhat optimize their current portfolios, are there opportunities that exist out there today that fit within your understanding as where you want to grow that are attractive to Oxy at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are opportunities. We continue to look at a large portfolio even during times when people weren't willing to sell. It always takes two to tango, and it also depends on the price that people want, but most important, as Steve has continually said and I have repeated, any acquisition we must add value. We're not going to buy assets to have a play on the price of oil or gas. So only we will buy assets when we believe we can increase production, cut costs, and get a high value out of those properties. So we continue to be extremely attentive to those opportunities, and during the fourth quarter we had a number of opportunities that came along and we took advantage of it. Steve, do you want to add to that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Is there further opportunities that you see going forward? We have seen a number acquisitions obviously on the unconventional side with some of the supermajors.

But as this point we have a decent portfolio for the next five years at least, but again we look at everything, so you shouldn't be -- but if we can find something that adds value that we can do that's a reasonable size, we would consider doing that, but we don't feel pressed to do anything.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had a question on Kern County and then a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You said that the aerial extent of the field was perhaps more modest compared to others, as you put it. I wondered how significantly you have defined the aerial extent to this date and if you could give us some sense of the size of what you have? And secondly, you've commented in past that you have seen no depletion from the reservoirs to date. Has that still been true with an additional quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question is we haven't seen the limits of the field yet. So we're not really in a position to say. The aerial extent continues to grow, and so we haven't seen the limits of field. We may have seen it on one side of the field but not on the other three sides. So we're not &#x2013; we don't know. On the depletion, the wells generally don't deplete very much and we're also not necessarily pushing the wells as hard as they might at this point. So right now they're holding up pretty well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My second question is on capital spending or rather on acquisitions. You spent about 1.1 or 1.2 billion in the quarter. Some of that of course included Phibro, which recently closed.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Dow acquisition was an earlier in the year. It was 2.010. We spent about half the total on oil and gas and the other half in the midstream business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't said. Obviously, if we added 200,000 acres in California last quarter, we obviously spent some money to do that.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Two questions regarding the 200% reserve replacement you referenced. First, could you tell us what the main areas for reserve bookings were?

          <p>A couple of things. One, can you comment at all about how Phibro has been doing and any expectations you have based on purchase price, what type of results you're kind of hoping for them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We hope for a lot, but we've only owned it three weeks, so we always hope, but they're doing fine . But we've only owned them three weeks. They mark to market every day so every day they have a different result, so I don't think we want to speculate on that because we don't know anything.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. In Argentina, we have a robust drilling program again this year, and we're working in 25 different fields and production is running just under 50,000 gross barrels a day, so there's nothing unusual to report there. As Steve pointed out, there have been some labor relations problems last year tangible on a provincial basis, it wasn't isolated to us, but things are looking fine right now and we hope they stay that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have &#x2013; as I recall there was a price cap or something like that that will be lifting here hopefully in the not too distant future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are constraints to the sale, and it's complicated as to how we sell on the internal market versus the export market, and there's a number of allowances that we've been able to earn by increasing production in certain provinces. So it's improving, but it's always subject to local political considerations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry for the follow-up, folks. I just wanted to circle back on one thing you said in your prepared remarks, Steve, about free cash flow of $850 million in the quarter I guess after dividends, CapEx and so on. Obviously, if that's the run rate, we're looking at north of $3 billion of cash in a given year. I'm just curious as to what your latest thoughts are about how you're going to manage that given that you've now given us a fairly modest CapEx budget for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We almost never build cash, so our cash I don't think has ever hit 2 billion, so I think we'll keep the cash. One way or another we'll find opportunities. I think this is a probably pretty decent year for opportunities for us outside of the capital program. We see a little more activity in some of our areas. While we didn't spend a lot in the Permian last year, we still did 21 deals. So I think it's fairly active, especially for private people who are worried about their tax rates. So I think we'll have a pretty decent year for acquisitions this year and, if there's excess cash, we'll be responsible in returning it to shareholders one way or another.</p>
