        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. I'd like to welcome you here today with Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli and G&#xE9;rard Lamarche. We're very pleased to have you with us to present the half-year results of GDF Suez.</p>
          <p>These are the first half-year results that we're presenting to you in the new configuration, you will recall that at the same time last year, we presented the first pro-forma figures of the new Group barely a few weeks after the actual merger that took place on the 22nd of July last year. So today, the merged Group has been in existence for just over a year and the accounting work linked to the opening balance sheet that we also reported to you on during the Investor Day last November and the presentation of the annual results in March. That work is now fully completed.</p>
          <p>So, after a few words of introduction, I'll hand over to G&#xE9;rard who will run through in detail the results of the first half of 2009. And then, I'll give the floor to Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, who will outline our key strategies and recent developments.</p>
          <p>So today, we'd like to convey four messages to you. The first is that in the midst of the most severe economic downturn for half a century, GDF Suez has achieved a strong operating performance that strengthens its objectives. The continued profitable growth of the first half illustrates, we believe, perfectly the strength of our business model, which is both balanced, diversified and integrated.</p>
          <p>The second message is that this growth is underpinned by strong cash generation, up 65% in free cash flow and then a debt reduction, which makes us quite unique in our sector. This debt reduction has allowed GDF Suez to strengthen its financial position during the crisis. The third message is the group is fully aware of the current macroeconomic and sector difficulties. It is addressing them thanks to its strategic positioning and also targeted and energetic measures that extensively anticipated and offset the effects of the downturn.</p>
          <p>Fourth message, we confirm the objectives that we set ourselves in March for the year 2009 in spite of an economic climate that we view with caution for the second half, and if we maintain these objectives it's that we have strength that we know we can rely on.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the key figures first of all. The group is growing with revenues of 42.2 billion, up 2.3%. This is profitable growth because EBITDA totals 7.9 billion, which is also up by 2.2%. Let me recall that our objective is to achieve in 2009 a level of EBITDA that is higher than that of 2008, which was already a high benchmark because our 2008 results were historic results for the group and in terms of EBITDA, we plan to do even better. So, we are on the way to meeting our objective.</p>
          <p>Net income group share totals 3.3 billion. It's down 6%. We remain in the lead table of the top three in the CAC 40. Let me draw your attention to free cash flow, totaling &#x20AC;6.7 billion, up 65%, and this reflects the strong cash generation achieved during the first half.</p>
          <p>Net CapEx, 4 billion over six months, totaling 5.6 billion in gross CapEx, taking account of the disposals, and this CapEx figure is fully in line with the &#x20AC;30 billion program over three years, eight, nine and 10 ['08, '09, and '10], and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will return to that.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're strengthening our financial structure, because net debt is down over &#x20AC;1 billion and the gearing ratio is also improved by 300 basis points. At 43%, gives us the best financial structure of the major utilities. This improvement was maintained with a high dividend policy of &#x20AC;1.40 during the first half, with an exceptional dividend of &#x20AC;0.80. The debt reduction also strengthens our rating of category A, and it's our objective to maintain that.</p>
          <p>Let me stress that we are emerging from the crisis after these difficult months with a financial structure that is stronger, more robust than that which existed before the crisis. We're also confirming the payment of an interim ordinary dividend of &#x20AC;0.80 to be paid in cash on the 18th of December 2009. And that's in line with our policy of offering an attractive return to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now, what are the key factors underpinning the strong performance of the Group? Firstly, our diversified, balanced and integrated business model, and I'd like to stress that a key part of our business is largely protected from the effects of the crisis and continues to grow. Infrastructure: Very stable. The sales to our millions of customers in France and Belgium or our sales throughout the world contractualized through long-term contracts, which in difficult times offer a strong underpinning for our growth.</p>
          <p>To this, there are factors that contributed to efficient operational management, which allowed us to weather the crisis successfully. We can mention here the effect of our efficient hedging policy, which today makes it possible to take account of the price of the spark spreads and the dark spreads favorable during the period 2005, 2008.</p>
          <p>The indexation formula for our gas sales contracts, E&amp;P and key accounts, this indication also delayed the impact of the drop in the price of oil during the second half on our results for the first half of 2009, even if the impact will be fully felt during the second half of the year 2009.</p>
          <p>Also, in terms of the factors that allowed us to perform well, the strong availability of our power generation capability in Belgium, which allowed production costs that were particularly competitive, the availability rate of our nuclear power plants, which was 82% in 2008, rose to over 90% in the first half of 2009, and then the arbitrage gains achieved by our global gas and LNG division during the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>And, also, the weather conditions had a favorable impact. It was cold, indeed, very cold during the first two months of the year. So, each of these factors contributed to grow EBITDA, more than offsetting the effects of the downturn on certain activities. So that we quantify at &#x20AC;0.4 billion in EBITDA and then of the tariff delay on regulated gas sales amounting to &#x20AC;363 million for the first half essentially focused on the first three months of the year. But 363 million of tariffs delayed during the first half, that's 184 million more than during the first half last year. Over and above these figures that demonstrate the strength of our performance, what are our strategies? What are our strengths to meet the downturn in the sector of challenges?</p>
          <p>Firstly, we're fortunate to be one of the unchallenged leaders in the industry since the merger. The U.S. publication Forbes ranked us as one of the &#x2013; as the leading company for services to local authorities and on the basis of 2008 and we're also ranked 17th worldwide across sectors. Of course, it's not without effect to be viewed as such in this industry, where the confidence of consumers, the utilities, public authorities and the various stakeholders is absolutely key. This means that we are well-placed as a partner in the major projects. Nuclear in Abu Dhabi, hydro power plants in Brazil or the major gas projects such as North Stream and that's what Mr. Putin said to Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois and to myself when we met him.</p>
          <p>The unique position of the Group makes it a natural and sometimes key partner in such cases. This leadership is demonstrated through our financial capability and our financial strength, but also the skills and commitment of our teams throughout the world, not to mention the Group's values that are one of these characteristics.</p>
          <p>We have the critical mass and the necessary means to respond to the scale of the industry challenges. So, we can confidently view our expansion over the long term. Now the scale of the industry challenges and recent developments confirm the relevance of our business model and development strategies and generating new opportunities. So, what are these challenges, firstly?</p>
          <p>Price volatility and declining demand in certain sectors which are suffering from the downturn &#x2013; Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will return to this; strengthening the competitive edge conferred by our base load power generation capability in one of the most efficient in the industry; our diversification, essentially geographic, but also the energy mix; diversification of the contractual frameworks makes it possible to tap growth where that growth lies today, and these assets will be key when the upturn comes; and GDF, perhaps more than other industries in this sector, has been able to develop a balanced, flexible and diversified model both in terms of its business as well as its reach. We can also seize opportunity thanks to the flexibility of our business portfolio, both in gas and in electricity.</p>
          <p>As we saw during the first half, the issue of the security of supply creates a favorable climate for capital investment as we've seen in the various recovery plans for supplies, infrastructure, generation means and opportunities for renewables and LNG. Regulation also generates opportunity because it leads ultimately to broader competition, which means that we can maintain our integrated model. Let me cite the opening up of the French market. We've seen some positive developments such as the confirmation of the compatibility of our integrated model with the third Infrastructure Directive. That directive has now been adopted, all potentially positive developments through the work of the Champsaur commission in France.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, discussions are promoting the revival of nuclear energy through the developments of new capabilities, EPR or the extension of existing nuclear power plants. So with regulators, we're seeking a constructive, frank and forward-looking dialog. Issues such as the access of the French market in gas infrastructure or Pax Electrica II in Belgium demonstrates that we're seeking to transform into an opportunity what may initially be perceived as a constraint. So in these two cases, we'll be launching new profitable capital of investments in infrastructure in the case of Axcess France, and in the case of Pax, we'll be developing in Germany with the swap for 1,700 megawatts with E.ON as part of the Pax Electrica II.</p>
          <p>Climate change and sustainable development opportunities give us possibilities in power generation, also in the environment and services with global leadership in energy efficiency services thanks to our division that is dedicated to this, which during the first half achieved a very good performance.</p>
          <p>So, we have strengthened all our positions during the first half. We've expanded in E&amp;P and LNG. Algeria Touat 110 billion (sic) [million] additional barrels Group share, but also in Qatar, a country that is key for the future of the Group and Azerbaijan and in Australia more recently with a very fine project, the Bonaparte project in partnership with Santos Exploration Production and potentially a liquefaction floating unit that will be led by the Group that is operating a breakthrough on the part of GDF's sales in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a key market, the world's leading market for LNG, demonstrating that through LNG, the gas market will become a global market and, in this respect, we seek to be a global player.</p>
          <p>We've also expanded in power generation in Europe, Middle East, but also in the Middle East, where we've been able to in &#x2013; 6 billion in project financing; in total today we have 21,000 megawatt of power production projects under construction worldwide. That's the equivalent, in electrical power, 13 EPRs that would be built simultaneously worldwide.</p>
          <p>We've also expanded in gas supply with a major contract of 700 terawatt hours over 15 years with GasTerra in Holland, but as you will no doubt recall in successfully managing the Russian/Ukrainian crisis without any interruption in supply for our customers. We've also expanded in nuclear energy in partnership with leading companies such as Areva, Total, Iberdrola and EDF. And lastly in renewables, we have over 6,000 megawatts under construction, essentially hydro, but also wind, solar, biomass. And in energy efficiency services, for example in hospitals and data centers or in district heating, Paris; London for the games; or, in eco districts, France, Netherlands, Belgium. So, all these industrial developments in line with the industry challenges is supported by targeted measures in the face of a deteriorated economic climate.</p>
          <p>So, these measures are to continue to rollout the Efficio performance plan. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will discuss that with a priority on cash flow generation in order to finance our CapEx program, whilst respecting strict selection criteria and without hesitating, if need be, to swap some of our activities. Our disposals amounted to 1.6 to 1.7 billion during the first half. Appropriate cash flow with extended debt maturity to have adequate resources to support our growth, and that irrespective of the bank conditions.</p>
          <p>The well reception of the payment in shares of the exceptional dividend is part of that. At the same time, we've continued to implement the structure optimization, streamlining the Energy Europe and II division, covering Europe and activities and gas and electricity. Excluding key accounts, this now has a single headquarters around five geographical areas: Benelux-Germany, rest of Europe, Middle East-Asia, North America and Latin America. That was the latest transaction stemming as a direct consequence from the merger. The merger at the top and then a number of units, services, Global Gas, LNG, we had to complete the reorganization. That's now done and we're now in the ultimate configuration of the Group.</p>
          <p>And we've also actively continued our discussions with the governments and regulatory authorities for gas and electricity prices and our involvement in nuclear projects, infrastructure and in hydro or thermal power generation. We're also involved in the Recovery Plan through our investments, also in discussions around the Champsaur and Recard reports on the opening up of the electricity market and the carbon comps to curb energy consumption in Belgium. We have fulfilled our commitments in terms of competition: The E.ON swap and the exit of SPE, ultimately our market share in electricity will be of the order of 65%, more than offset by our improvements in other European markets.</p>
          <p>We'll be more Pan-European, less Belgium, but greater overall. We're also prepared to begin discussions with the Belgian authorities on the questions of the extension of the lifetime of nuclear power plants and how we can continue to expand in Belgium and from Belgium in the nuclear sector, but also in renewables and other energy activities. In Brasilia, Abu Dhabi, Bangkok, Houston, we seek to reaffirm further our status as a responsible company that is competent, that is mindful of local communities and we want to become and maintain the key partner of our stakeholders worldwide.</p>
          <p>So, all these measures will strengthen our performance as long as we view things. For the near future, we remain extremely vigilant in spite of the signs of an upturn appearing the first half, the second quarter show a sharp decline in the demand of our electrical industrial company in waste recycling as Jean-Louis Chaussade mentioned.</p>
          <p>And Suez Environnement was commendably able to offset that downturn through improved performance in other areas, the reduced gas and electricity demand, we expect that trend to continue at least in the third quarter. I also mentioned the delay and the impact and the fall in oil price &#x2013; oil prices. This impact will end during the second half. And, of course, the basis of comparison here for Q3 2008, that will be particularly challenging for the global gas and LNG division, because it's over that period that we achieved major arbitrage gains in LNG in 2008. And it's so &#x2013; fully in the second half that we'll be seeing the drop in EBITDA of the LNG division that we announced. That was an exceptionally favorable year, in 2008. In 2009, the EBITDA level will be higher than that of the year 2007 for global gas LNG, and G&#xE9;rard will return to that in detail.</p>
          <p>We are, however, confident in our ability to achieve our objectives for 2009, because we can continue to rely on our strengths As you've seen during the first half, most of our business franchises are continuing to hold up well and even grow, contracted sales, retail market flexibilities in gas and electricity worldwide through our teams and we plan to enhance those trends in the second half.</p>
          <p>Our hedging policy will be improved, and of course the price and commodities have picked up since the low point to the end of 2008, early 2009. Since the 1st of April 2009, we stopped losing money in France on our French retail gas sales. Efficio is a major plan to continue to improve operating performance targets in line with our objectives. This secures our objectives and we plan to continue this daily discipline, apply it both industrially and financially and final point, we'll continue to benefit from the plant commissionings because we're investing continuously and the CapEx plan of &#x20AC;30 billion started in 2008. So, with all this, our 2009 targets remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>Over now to G&#xE9;rard for the results of the first half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to you all. As G&#xE9;rard has just said, the performance in the first half shows the resilience of our business model in the face of the economic downturn. The impact of the crisis that we estimated at &#x20AC;400 million on EBITDA in the first half, and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli will come back to that. This impact has led to considerable falls in industrial volumes and market conditions, which are far more difficult in Europe, than in &#x2013; and in United States. There has also been a considerable fall in commodity prices, which was very substantial in the first four months of the year with an up-tick in forward prices at the half-year.</p>
          <p>As far as gas and power prices are concerned, however, there were no signs of recovery for the moment. However, our results enable us to generate very considerable cash flow, which support our industrial developments and which have enabled us to keep one of the soundest balance sheets in the industry. Results are in line with the objectives that we've set for the company, and make it possible to maintain our targets for 2009 as G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet has just said.</p>
          <p>Before going into detail of results by division, I'd like to say a few words about the comparison basis for these accounts. To facilitate the comparability of these accounts, we established, as you know, pro forma accounts for the first half of 2008, because the merger occurred in July 2008. And they were built on the basis &#x2013; these accounts are on the basis of the accounts we presented for the first half of 2008. In other words, these financial statements are based on the assumption that the merger occurred on the 1st of January, 2008. The impact of remedies is isolated on a specific line. Suez Environnement is integrated globally.</p>
          <p>And the purchase price accounting is now final. It has only changed marginally compared to what we told you in November 2008. The final performer accounts of the first half and the reconciliation with those that we presented to you last year were conveyed to you on our website and they are also provided as appendices for the documents you received for this meeting.</p>
          <p>That being said, let's talk about the two major messages that we'd like to get across to you from these accounts. First of all, a very strong resilience of our businesses in an economic downturn, and a very strong generation of cash flow, which has led to a fall in our net debt. Compared to the first half of 2008, which, of course, was historically high, as you know, and in the current economic situation in which commodity prices are down and the crisis is biting, our indicators show a very good resilience.</p>
          <p>Revenue up by 2.3%, EBITDA &#x20AC;7.9 billion, an increase of 2.2% flat in organic, and operating income 5 billion, slightly down 1.6%. The net income attributable to shareholders &#x20AC;3.3 billion, that's down by 6.3%. This is basically due to the increase in borrowing costs, because of the increase in our debt last year. By adjusting for the contribution of companies sold in the remedies and the exchange with E.ON, the fall is only 4.5%. So much for the resilience of our results.</p>
          <p>The second issue is generation of cash. Free cash flow is up by 65%, to 6.7 billion. This is due to the slight increase of EBITDA that I will go into in a few moments time, lower tax payments than last year and a reduction in working capital.</p>
          <p>Net debt: 27.8 billion compared to 28.9 in the first half of last year. This pie chart, which I won't comment, shows how balanced our balanced model is with our eight divisions, which all have more or less the same weight and indicates the resistance of our domestic markets.</p>
          <p>Now this slide, which breaks down EBIT of the first half among divisions, let me make the following points. First point, the exchange rate effects have a limited effect of only &#x20AC;56 million negative on the left-hand side, and this is explained by the stronger dollar, which has made it more or less possible to offset the fall in the pound Sterling and the Brazilian real, and currencies in Eastern and Central Europe.</p>
          <p>Second point, contribution of 300 million of acquisitions that we made basically in the second half of last year. The gas fields in the North Sea, NAM, the virtual power plant purchased from ENI, and the power assets of FirstLight in the United States.</p>
          <p>Third point, across the growth in EBITDA of 2.2%, which shows a balance between businesses which had sustained growth in the half like Electrabel, Energy Benedelux and infrastructure. These are stable factors underpinning our EBITDA.</p>
          <p>And then you have businesses which have weathered the economic crisis very well. Global Gas and LNG, energy services, and international energy. And here, the basis of comparison last year was very, very high. So today, of course, it looks less flattering.</p>
          <p>And then you have the businesses which are less directly affected by the fall in industrial volumes, this is the case of energy in Europe and Suez Environnement. And so I take Energy France out of all that because Energy France of course has been impacted mainly by the delay in price adjustments accumulated in the first half, but I'll come back to that in a few moments' time.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look now at the results of the eight divisions. Let's start with energy in France. Revenues for Energy France, &#x20AC;8.3 billion, that's an increase of 9% compared to the first half of 2008. That growth, which we don't find in the other indicators, is basically the result of changes in energy prices. EBITDA however, is down by &#x20AC;300 million, because, as I said, we have the &#x20AC;363 million delay in gas prices in the first half, negative prices on power prices, and less good hydroelectric generation in the first -- since March -- than in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Investments, &#x20AC;472 million, make it possible for this division to continue its developments in electricity generation with conventional thermal, CCTG and <mark type="inaudible" /> as well as in wind energy.</p>
          <p>On this slide, you can see the chronology of our delay in price adjustments. The bad news is that we had a very high figure in the first half, but the good news is that since the first half, and since the 1st of April 2009, our prices now make it possible to cover our costs entirely and to start to recover the delay in price adjustments from the 1st of July. Today, we are in the process of clawing back that 363 million.</p>
          <p>This is a trend which is going to accelerate in the second half because -- you will see this in the graph here -- because you can see the seasonality of our businesses with sales of course, much high in the winter. And this should make it possible to accelerate the claw back of that 363 million.</p>
          <p>So, for the whole of the year, EBITDA in Energy France should be up substantially, because last year, as you will remember, in the basis of comparison, Energy France accumulated in the last quarter of 2008, 400 million of delay in price adjustments and now the situation has turned positive.</p>
          <p>Contrary to what I've just said for Energy France, however, revenues for Benedelux, 6.8 billion, is more or less stable compared to 2008. But, there has been a very substantial increase in results. Stability of revenue of Electrabel is basically due to volumes to retail clients holding up very well, whereas there has been an average fall of 13% of volumes of power sold to industry in Belgium.</p>
          <p>EBITDA and operating income, 1.185 billion and 909 million, respectively, are very strongly up, plus 43 and plus 57%. Now, this is basically due to two reasons. First of all, production cost has been reduced thanks to very high availability of our nuclear power plants. Availability was 90% in the first half. Last year, we had some major maintenance programs in our nuclear power plants and we had availability higher than 80%.</p>
          <p>The hedging policy, this is the second reason for power over three years, has made it possible to have higher margins in 2009, which corresponds to the spread of the time and the forward price of 2005, 2008 prices. The capital spending in Benedelux, &#x20AC;747 million. They cover the building of three major compounds, two in The Netherlands, in Rotterdam and in Flevo, and one in Germany in Wilhelmshaven.</p>
          <p>We have also acquired the Stadtwerke Wuppertal for &#x20AC;230 million. And so that said, the agreement on the asset exchange with E.ON was concluded on the 31st of July 2009. For the whole of the year 2009 therefore, the results are going to be very good for this division if the availability of nuclear power plants remains about 90%, and there is no reason that it shouldn't because there are no major maintenance programs scheduled and a stabilization of the fall in volumes sold to industry, which is basically the situation that should prevail in the third quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Energy Europe, as I said earlier on, is one of the divisions which has been the most hard hit by the economic downturn and by the significant fall in volumes sold to industry in Italy, in Spain and in the U.K. The recession effect however, has been cancelled by very positive scope effects because EBIT, 533 million, that's up by 5.5% and that's a scope effect which corresponded to &#x20AC;121 million of EBITDA. And the biggest factor here is taking over the virtual power plant in Italy after the sale of Distrigas. So EBITDA was up by 5.5%. Let me say that our business in Eastern Europe, Slovakia, Romania and Poland have had positive organic growth of EBITDA in the first half.</p>
          <p>Capital spending was 726 million, distribution of gas in Turkey and Italy. In Italy, we bought out the minority shares in Italy, Investimenti. Also covered a 50% of a gas power plant in Greece. In the second half, what are we expecting, we are expecting for the division EBITDA, which should continue to grow organically in spite of a very low probability that we shall actually purchase Romana Gas.</p>
          <p>At the international, revenue up by 5.4%. That benefits from favorable exchange effects. The dollar stronger by 300 million and positive scope effects of &#x20AC;254 million, thanks for the acquisition of in Seneca in Singapore, FirstLight in the United States and Ponte de Pedra in Brazil in May 2008.</p>
          <p>Apart from the non-recurrent elements in 2008 in Brazil, you remember that I told you last time, that last year there was a very considerable increase in power prices in Brazil and we sold power at very high prices, and that led to 100 million non-recurrent effects on EBITDA. Apart from these non-recurrent elements, EBITDA was up by 2% with very positive performances in two areas: Asia and Latin America. In Latin America, Brazil has weathered the situation very well, and a growth of 9.5% apart from the exceptionals. Asia-Middle East, up by almost 3% in the first six months with the continuation of our developments in the Middle East. Whereas Thailand has had &#x2013; has suffered more of an impact on industrial demand in the first half, particularly in the areas where we sell. But, we do see signs of a recovery in Thailand starting in June. In North America, however, results are down affected by the fall in gas prices and the fall in our margins on LNG business.</p>
          <p>Capital spending, &#x20AC;1.1 billion, are high and remain high and reflect the development of our businesses in Brazil with Jirau, Estreito, those are two major work sites which are on track. And in the Middle East, the industrial commissioning of those plants will occur after 2009, but we're investing in 2009. The effect of our 2009 acquisitions should lead to positive growth in the full-year 2009, in spite of the fall in volumes and margins in LNG in the United States. In Asia, we see some signs of recovery.</p>
          <p>Global Gas and LNG, this division has revenues of a little more than &#x20AC;12 billion, up by 8.8%. EBITDA is close to &#x20AC;2 billion, it's up by 4.4% from one half to the next. This increase can be explained by various developments in the business units. Exploration and Production for instance, E&amp;P, as expected, has suffered a very strong impact of the fall in market prices for oil, down by $57 per barrel for oil and &#x20AC;9 a megawatt-hour for gas. EBITDA is down by 7 &#x2013; down to &#x20AC;760 million in the first half compared to 923 in the first half of 2008. As far as generation is considered, you can see the figures here. It's slightly positive and should be stable for 2009 as a whole.</p>
          <p>The other business units in this division, supplies, LNG, key accounts and trading have, however, had good results in the first half. EBITDA, which has been improved in a non-recurrent fashion by &#x20AC;309 million by trading gains in the first half. I'll come back to that in a minute. By a very cold winter which has I mean &#x2013; that we sold more and by better supply conditions. EBITDA has been held back, however, by the fall in the commodity prices and by inventory effects because we built up our inventories during the summer, we built them up in the summer last year when gas prices were very high and we sold gas during the winter.</p>
          <p>Capital spending by Global Gas LNG, &#x20AC;678 million. This basically concerns the gas field of Gj&#xF8;a in Norway, assets in the Gulf of Mexico on the basis of our transaction with ENI. And we announced on the 18th of August development of the Bonaparte project in Australia. This is not in the first half accounts, of course, but this project will enable the company to increase its resources by about 20% and to increase its supply portfolio of LNG to Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>Over the year, therefore, what should we expect for Global LNG? Given the price situation we have today for 2009 as a whole, EBITDA should be close to that of 2007, a year which was less atypical than 2008's. 2008 was a fairly exceptional year. In 2008, we had EBIT &#x2013; 2007 rather &#x20AC;2.3 billion of EBITDA to which we should add non-recurrent trading gains of about 200 million.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure now. Infrastructure is growing in a very nice and recurrent way. Revenue including intercompany services is almost &#x20AC;3 billion, up 6.8%. EBITDA &#x20AC;1.6 billion, up by 6.9%. This is due to four factors. The first is an increase in volumes sold by our subsidiary GrDF, plus six terawatt hours following the cold winter. And increase in reservations of capacity on the German network, plus 8.7 terawatt hours. This is consecutive to the commissioning of new power plants. We also have new access tariffs to distribution networks, plus 5.6 on the 1st of July 2008, plus transportation, plus 6% in the 1st of January 2009, an increase of 2.7% on the 1st of April 2009 of the average volume of storage in France.</p>
          <p>Capital spending is fairly high for this division, almost &#x20AC;800 million. 50% of that is basically maintenance CapEx, and basically the rest is development of our network, storage and finalizing our third LNG terminal in Fos-Cavaou. Over 2009 as a whole, this division should grow in line with the growth of its regulated asset base. In other words, about 3%.</p>
          <p>Services. The results of the services branch also have weathered the crisis very well. Key performance indicators are stable compared to the first half of 2008, which you can see on this table. After the beginning of the year, which went very well, sales slowed in the second quarter, minus 4% in revenue, and this slowdown particularly affected the installations business unit.</p>
          <p>In the half, stability results, therefore, is the result of various development facilities in France. <mark type="inaudible" />, we've continued to see revenue up by 4.8%, and EBITDA up by 4%. This was due to the cold winter in the first quarter, but also good sales.</p>
          <p>Engineering businesses have never really slowed down, so we've seen further growth in engineering with good order books. But installations, Ineo and Endel have of course been hit by the economic recession, particularly in France in the construction industry, but also in the U.K. and in the Netherlands. One positive point here, however, is that the operating margin is up slightly at 4.8% compared to 4.7% thanks to cost cutting exercises, which have been very significant and which have enabled us to reduce our overheads and costs. Capital spending is down by about &#x20AC;100 million and this division should have a stable operating result for the whole of 2009.</p>
          <p>Environnement, Suez Environnement, well you have the figures from Suez Environnement yesterday from Jean-Louis Chaussade, so I shan't dwell on that. Let me simply say that for 2009 the objective of Suez Environnement is to achieve a stable operating performance compared to 2008 at constant exchange rates thanks to a good sales performance, but also thanks to further acceleration in its cost cutting program.</p>
          <p>So, having gone through the results of each division, let me come now to the consolidated results and to explain the reconciliation of EBITDA to operating income and to net income. The main point I'd like to show you here, on these figures, and I'm not going to comment on them all, is the increase in amortizations. This is due to our development. The amortization at the end of half was 2.486 billion up by 192 million. Below the operating incomes, you will see &#x20AC;280 million in variation of mark-to-market of commodities. This is a charge, which results from the change in commodity prices in the first half as well as the unwinding of positive positions, which are not qualified as cash flow hedges at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>The result of our sales, our disposals, one on <mark type="inaudible" />, 250 megawatt hours of nuclear capacity to SPE, this was one of the remedies. It also integrates the 6% of Plexus sale, and also adjustment on provision for the Macau dispute. So the result of income from operating activities, 5.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Final table, on the net income, starting at operating activities, financial results minus 708 million, the cost of debt is up, this is due basically to a volume effect because debt increased quite substantially last year following the return to shareholders at the merger and the capital spending.</p>
          <p>Average cost of debt in the half is slightly down. It was 4.9% in the first half of 2008, and in average in the first half of 2009, it's 4.8%. Tax payments, 1.1 billion. If we adjust the effective rate by capital gains, we have rate of 28.2% compared to 5 &#x2013; 25.8%. So tax rate is returning more or less, as I previously announced, to normal.</p>
          <p>Next slide, the first half shows the very solid performance of our business and our results. So let's have a look at the generation of cash. As I said previously, free cash flow &#x20AC;6.7 billion, that's an increase of 65% compared to the first half of 2008. This could be explained in the following way: I've just referred to increase in EBITDA, 7.9 billion. You can see here that we had &#x2013; tax expenses are down by 900 million because we recovered or, well, refunded the taxes we paid in excess to European administrations in the first half of 2008. And we have, of course, used the Suez tax losses that we had at the merger.</p>
          <p>We've also had a positive variation in working capital requirements given the very strict management of counter party risk and then seasonality affects in the first half, which means that we were paid what we were owed during the winter and the reduction in inventories in our gas business.</p>
          <p>On this slide, you have the detail of our capital spending: 4.4 billion over six months. This is in line with our investment program of 30 billion. This capital spending is made up of 1.2 billion for maintenance investment, 3.1 for development CapEx. Let me simply say here, that we have increased our stock of non-productive capital by about 2 billion, and at the end of June, we had 9 billion of non-productive capital on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Acquisitions in the first half: 1.4 billion. I told you in my initial presentation of the divisions, what these acquisitions were. You can see the details here and the disposals. We did dispose of 1.7 billion in euros worth of assets, with &#x20AC;600 million of capital gains. This was more or less the normal flow of things. This has led to a reduction in our debt. If we look at the net debt at the end of December, add free cash flow, reduce net CapEx. Four minus 1.2, that's 2.8. Dividends paid, 2. FX 800 million. And as G&#xE9;rard said earlier on, there has been a &#x2013; the tremendous 6/4 dividend paid in stock because 80% of shareholders chose the dividend in stock rather than in cash. And debt is now less than two years of EBITDA, and that's something we're very proud of.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet is very sound, and because we have abundant cash, &#x20AC;12.5 billion of cash, so that's more than two years of payments ahead. The fixed rate debt or capped debt is 80% of our debt, and -- because we think that interest rates are low and can only increase in the future. The debt in foreign currency is stable as compared to the end of last year. 56% of our debt is in euros, 27% in dollars and that covers us against exchange rate variations. The average maturity is up from 6.6 years last year to 7.6 years with the bond issue. So we've tried to extend the debt maturity as much as possible given the favorable circumstances, I've referred to gearing.</p>
          <p>What I think I would say, too, is that in the first half, we have managed to secure a very large project financing, 6 billion, Jirau, <mark type="inaudible" /> in conditions which were not easy. And we've managed to do that as we intended to do it, so when we started the project and our rating of course is maintained as a strong A. Now, we therefore have maintained our objectives for 2009. We maintain our target for EBITDA growth for 2009.</p>
          <p>Let me look at the half-yearly changes. The blue line is 2008, the red line is 2009. In the first half, we had an opportunity to arbitrage 300 million because of the high availability of our nuclear power plants and lower gas prices. 96% availability on nuclear power plants in the first half, so last year we had EBITDA which was higher than last year. In the second quarter, we were impacted by the fall in commodity prices and warmer weather, so we are a little lower than this Q2 of last year. Q3 will be affected by prices on E&amp;P, lower trading gains and that will be the low point of the year. In Q4, however, we should see a recovery in our businesses and, therefore, EBITDA will be equal to or higher than the EBITDA of last year. And let me give the floor to Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard. Good morning to you all. I'd like just briefly &#x2013; just to go over with you four points that characterize this half. The first point is a quick focus on energy prices and to tell you that we're on track, we're consistent with the price assumptions that we set out to you at the beginning of the year and the price levels seen on the market were very sensitive to commodity prices. As you know, the second point, the general economic climate and of course the &#x2013; we were affected by the economic downturn. We assumed that we would be able to not be affected, but as G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet said, the specificities of GDF Suez's business model allowed us to hold up well during the downturn and to leverage new opportunities.</p>
          <p>The third point is that we're preserving the future with a very controlled, rigorous management of our CapEx program, but we're in growing markets with industrial expansion projects which will underpin the Group's growth in the out years. And the fourth point, time is right to implement and to accelerate our Efficio performance improvement plan and that the economic downturn that we're currently experiencing allowed &#x2013; encouraged us to move faster in this direction.</p>
          <p>Just a word on oil and electricity price assumptions. On the two upper charts, you see the oil and electricity prices. These are the commodities that affect us first and foremost. And let me just say that these prices that we see are consistent &#x2013; are in line with our assumptions that we presented to you at the beginning of the year, that are just set out bottom right on the chart. These energy prices, and it comes as nothing new, have dropped sharply since mid-2008 and early 2009.</p>
          <p>But there's an upturn &#x2013; that was an upturn during the first half, after a low point, which was at the end of 2008 and Q1 '09. On average, during the first six months of the year, the oil prices held by just above our assumptions and for electricity prices just below. But, on average, for the year, we will be on target with the figures that we indicated to you.</p>
          <p>The second comment that I'd like to make here, just on the chart bottom left, natural gas spot price, and oil price trends. We see this is a new and recent development as certain correlation mismatch between gas and oil prices, you can see this for the gas spot price, Brent IPE, and for gas NBP, it's happened before, but not for some time now. What are the effects of this situation for the Group? Well, firstly they're focused on the Global Gas LNG division. It has some effect on the BI division, because there are some gas-fired power plants. And so these effects can be positive or unfavorable. They're unfavorable for our exploration/production activities, where 20% of which exposed on volumes that are produced on gas spot prices, by definition what we sell in the U.K. that has a negative impact on our accounts.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, it allowed other business units of the Global Gas &amp; LNG division to generate positive trading gains during the course of the first quarter. So, difficult to know whether this correlation mismatch will continue, and if so, for how long. There is &#x2013; this development, as we see it, reflects the short-term oversupply of gas, against the backdrop of demand that is impacted by the economic downturn. But when the recovery comes, this will be lessened, but if this trend were to continue, it will strengthen a competitive pressure on the gas business. As to the global impact on our global business it's pretty positive and should be neutral for the whole year.</p>
          <p>The marked impact of the decline in commodity prices since last fall has led to a reduction in demand, a downturn in industrial activity, but you'll see that we've held up well. There is perhaps an interesting development in terawatt-hours sold. As you can see here, the trend of our sales of natural gas and electricity in Europe. Well, you can see that overall we've held up well and that overall sales are holding up, there is no decline in sales, both in gas and electricity, and it's quite extraordinary at a time when the downturn was very severe and deep. We've been able to offset sales decreases in certain sectors, sales to large industrial corporations by other sales short-term. We were of course being able to take account of a milder &#x2013; that is a colder quarter for us than other periods to sustain gas sales that are more sensitive to weather.</p>
          <p>And electricity, we've continued our sales development. What is the case for France also applies for &#x2013; to the Benelux. You see that gas sales are holding up well there. And on electricity, G&#xE9;rard Lamarche indicated a reduction of the order of 13% of electricity sales to key accounts. We've been able to offset that by sales elsewhere whereas the decrease in Europe was quite substantial.</p>
          <p>The Europe division excluding Benelux and France was slightly harder hit owing to the quite sharp &#x2013; sharper decline in demand in those countries, Italy and Spain in particular. And the severe industrial crisis, but volumes for us are less. As to Global Gas sales, we can see there that, they hold &#x2013; their sales are holding up well, because the Global Gas and LNG sales essentially to industrial clients, so we are &#x2013; during our sales development, we've been able to tap new countries.</p>
          <p>Sales in Eastern Europe, we've been able to boost our short-term sales with the very active management of our book of business with some positive weather effects to clients that sell to retail customers. And they've seen their sales increase. It's the case in France. And when we look at these three factors, well, these positive development offset the reduction in uptakes by some of our industrial customers of the order of 15% in the contractual quantities of industrial clients, with at the same time a very substantial downturn of the external sales of LNG because conditions were not too buoyant.</p>
          <p>So overall, we consider the impact of the economic downturn on our accounts. This is an off-accounting &#x2013; it can be assessed at &#x20AC;400 million for the first half for this, which is essentially based on reduction in industrial activity affected by the crisis. The ensuing reduction in volumes and the consequences on our business, there are three main effects: Energy demand contraction, particularly depressed market conditions in some countries, and a decline in industrial activity affecting energy services, installation and maintenance as well as for Suez Environnement in managing and recycling industrial waste.</p>
          <p>Overall, we can say that these 400 million can be allocated a third to each of the effects on this slide. If we extrapolate over the year as to the effect of the downturn, we can consider that the impact of the crisis for the Group will cost about &#x20AC;600 million over the full year. That is in the midst to one of the most severe downturns of the century. The impact of the crisis on EBITDA will be less than 5% of our EBITDA.</p>
          <p>These difficulties that we're all experiencing today should not overshadow the underlying momentum of our growth, which is driven by an increase in energy requirements worldwide. That's why we're preparing future growth whilst controlling its expansion. And you can see that during this period, we've maintained our CapEx objective at 30 billion for the period 2008-2010, which was announced at the time of the merger.</p>
          <p>We're 18 months at mid-term. We are clearly here at the midpoint of our program because accumulated net worth &#x20AC;15.7 billion that's pretty much half of the CapEx program. And you can see that it's sustained by substantial free cash flow generation. And during this period, we have managed to complete all our funding projects. We haven't had to curtail any of our projects including internationally, we were able to complete the financing for the major projects in the Middle East. For instance, on the 26th of July, we announced a completion of the funding package for the combined desalination plants at Al Dur in Bahrain.</p>
          <p>And the amounts involved were very substantial, of the order of $2 billion, but we're of course using this period to regularly review our asset portfolio and G&#xE9;rard Lamarche mentioned some disposals, because we're continuing. And we seek to wish to use this portfolio review to undertake targeted disposal in order to leverage the Group's financial flexibility, with gross investments of 5.7, and net CapEx at 4 billion this year and we will continue to act accordingly in the future.</p>
          <p>So briefly, what have we achieved during the course of this first half? You have to bear in mind that in France, we continue to implement the increase in electricity generation, thermal power plants. Three plants under construction costing 100 million apiece during the first half and a more staged implementation of our wind power program in France. Half-on-half we've increased by 200 megawatt, our wind power capacity in France with about 525 megawatts. And we have 300 megawatts currently under construction in Europe and internationally, it's power generation that's driving the CapEx.</p>
          <p>Coal-fired plants in Germany and in the Netherlands, projects in Thailand, hydro in Brazil with a beginning of the Jirau Dam project, and we'll return to that regularly during the coming months and year, because it's one of the largest CapEx projects in the Group.</p>
          <p>We've started to build a gas-fired plant in Greece in partnership and we filed out minority shareholders in Italy, gas distribution in Turkey, and we've strengthened our operations in Germany. All that accounts for the CapEx for this half. In the Global Gas and LNG division, as you know, the bulk of the CapEx is driven by exploration and production during the half. We completed the acquisition of ENI assets in the Gulf of Mexico, withdrew investing strongly in the Gj&#xF8;a field in Norway, which is very substantial and we'll be an operator for that and that will be commissioned next year. And we formalized three major projects in exploration/production for the future.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the Touat project that was announced in July that we've been able to book 110 billion of oil-equivalent tons in reserves as an operator in Qatar. That's an important development and an announcement made last &#x2013; of our involvement in Australia with the project of an integrated and cutting-edge LNG project, a very substantial, very promising, which will, of course, cover several years.</p>
          <p>In infrastructure, there's the importance of maintenance CapEx. 50%, 1.2 billion over the year of what we're doing in this sector, that's half for development, and half for maintenance. And here we have a huge need for expansion to promote gas flows, notably in France. All that's part of an agreement that we concluded with the European Commission and is Axcess France that we completed during the course of the first half in other sectors. As you can see, we &#x2013; investments are down given the economic climate, so controlled development at the same time, we seek to improve efficiencies and boost our performance, that's the Efficio plan. Our target for this year is at &#x20AC;650 million, where at mid-term, &#x20AC;340 million in efficiencies achieved.</p>
          <p>As part of this project, these efficiencies pile on cost reductions and expenses that we wish to accelerated both in the divisions and headquarters as well as revenue improvements integrated into our global objectives, boosting the Group's competitiveness and also meeting the regulatory requirements. Just to give you a few examples of achievements, as part of this first <mark type="inaudible" /> single purchasing plan that we've put in place, we've been able to generate some 80 million in savings. We have a better management of our fleet of LNG carriers, saving the equivalent of one year of freight on one vessel. We have reduction consulting and travel costs and all these efforts will be continued and increased over the coming weeks and months.</p>
          <p>So, you can see, ladies and gentlemen, that the solutions implemented during the past months in the midst of this very severe economic downturn, both in terms of better cash management as well as to continue the Group's industrial development which underpins its future growth, allows us to face up to the economic downturn. And we expect to fully benefit from the future recovery.</p>
          <p>Back to G&#xE9;rard for the conclusion.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, indeed, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. So, by way of conclusion, and it will be a very brief conclusion. I'd simply like to recall that in the first half of 2009, the Group has implemented its business model, very resilient business model, has generated considerable cash in a difficult economic climate. That has made it possible to maintain our CapEx program at &#x20AC;30 billion over three years and keep that on track, while reducing debt levels and implementing a very forward-looking policy of return of money to shareholders.</p>
          <p>And I think it's this structural soundness of our business model and of the Group combined with the commitment of our people, technical, commercial, all our people basically that our development model that we have designed to be flexible, diversified, balanced gives us an ideal position to benefit from the recovery in growth on our major markets, when that recovery occurs.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. And with my colleagues here at the top table, I'm prepared to answer your questions. So let's have the first question, please.</p>
