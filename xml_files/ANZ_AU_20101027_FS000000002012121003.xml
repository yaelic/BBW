          <p>Good morning, everybody. Welcome. Welcome to the 2010 ANZ Full Year Results Announcement. We're presenting today from the ANZ Centre, which is at 833 Collins Street in Melbourne. We have people joining us at our Martin Place offices in Sydney, as well as, of course, on the web and by phone. And a special welcome also to our retail shareholders who will be joining us over the web.</p>
          <p>Our CEO, Mike Smith, and CFO, Peter Marriott, will present to us this morning for about 25 minutes or so, and we'll then move to questions. I'll take you through the housekeeping for that at that point.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Many thanks, Jill. And good morning to all of you. Today, as you know, we released our full year results for 2010, which, I might add, also marks our 175th anniversary. So it's our birthday as well.</p>
          <p>Peter Marriott, who is here with me today, assures me actually he wasn't with the bank in 1835. But I know he'll answer the questions as though he was. I've also got a number of the management board here as well who may wish to answer some questions from you later.</p>
          <p>What our 2010 results demonstrate is that ANZ has made real momentum in every area of our business. It also demonstrates that we have made momentum in our strategic ambitions to be a super-regional bank in Asia Pacific. And I think our strategy now makes even more sense in a post-GFC world. And we expect Asia, ex-Japan, to grow at around 8% in 2011 compared to about 2.5% in the U.S. and Europe. Australia is expected to continue to perform well and in New Zealand the recovery is also gathering momentum. We remain the only Australian bank to give shareholders a material exposure to Asia's growth and one of only a few banks in the world to give investors a pure play to Asia-Pacific. And I think we're actually unique when you consider the significance of our domestic businesses here in Australia and in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>Turning to the full year numbers. While the focus is mainly on the financial results the reality is that over the long-term these results are a reflection on how we are serving our customers and how we are contributing to the communities in which we operate. As we go through the results you will hear me highlight the continued strong performance in customer satisfaction, particularly in Australian Retail but also in Institutional and Corporate Banking here in Australia and in New Zealand. We were also named the leading sustainable bank globally by the Dow Jones sustainability index for the fourth year in a row.</p>
          <p>Let me now give you a brief overview of the results. We reported an underlying net profit after tax of $5 billion, which is up 33% on last year. Our statutory profit for the full year was $4.5 billion, which was up 53%. While these are good headline numbers we need to remember that we had record provisions last year as a result of the GFC and the economic downturn that followed. And this year provisions have improved quite significantly, they are down 40%. Importantly, though, we have had good growth in profit before provisions, which was up 6%. The increase in underlying EPS was smaller, it was up by 18%, but you also have to bear in mind that we had a 14% increase in the weighted average number of shares on issue.</p>
          <p>Group margins were up 16 basis points. Although, margins in the Australia division and the retail division were down, reflecting deposit competition and higher wholesale funding costs. Importantly for shareholders, the proposed final dividend of $0.74 is 32% higher than 2009, bringing a total dividend to a $1.26 per share which is up 24%.</p>
          <p>If I now turn to the regions. In Australia, while income and expenses were impacted by acquisitions, in particular INGA, Phil Chronican and his team delivered a 42% lift in profit with profit before provision up 14%. Lending growth saw retail profits grow 8% despite margins pressures in the second half, which was driven by higher funding costs and the drag of the mortgage book.</p>
          <p>Market share growth was a feature. Lending growth of 12% was driven primarily by 1.4 times systems growth in mortgages. While household customer deposits grew 11% or about 1.2 times system. We have achieved this while maintaining our number one ranking on overall customer satisfaction in retail.</p>
          <p>Commercial banking's contribution was strong with profits up 30%. Asset growth of 3%, excluding the landmark acquisition was encouraging against a backdrop of negative system growth and there were large decrease here in provision charge.</p>
          <p>In Asia, as you can see, earnings from Partnerships and Institutional were the main drivers of a 21% lift in profit to U.S. Dollars 620 million. We told you last year that 2010 would be a year of consolidation for the Asia-Pacific and Europe and Americas region, following the acquisition of businesses from Royal Bank of Scotland and the six integrations that we've actually completed this year.</p>
          <p>Alex Thursby and his team have built what was a presence in Asia into a real business. Customer deposits were up 72% with lending up 45%. Retail deposits doubled to almost $10 billion. Deposit acquisition from the new businesses has been stronger than we expected with new customers being attracted by ANZ's strength and by our regional offering.</p>
          <p>During the year, we also achieved a number of other milestones in our regional expansion plans. We established a locally incorporated subsidiary in China. We opened two further outlets in China and announced plans to open a new operations hub in the city of Chengdu.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, we obtained QFB status. We obtained a universal banking license in the Philippines and opened a new operations hub in Manila. And we've now received full approval from the Reserve Bank of India and our branch in Mumbai will open in the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>At our August trading update, I spoke about the opportunity we were examining in Korea, where a 57% stake in the Korean Exchange Bank has become available. We hope to reach a conclusion soon about whether we'll continue to pursue this opportunity. But as I have said before, we will only proceed with a transaction if it satisfies all of our disciplined acquisition criteria.</p>
          <p>Turning to institutional. Shayne Elliott and his team have done a great job turning around our institutional business and they grew profit 23%. While revenue growth was lower mainly due to a more normalized contribution from global markets. Customer revenues grew 9%, reflecting the growth in client numbers and the strength of our client relationships.</p>
          <p>Our super regional strategy is underpinning this performance with inter regional client flows up 10%. And flows into Asia from elsewhere in the network up 20%. Institutional and corporate banking were also rated number one for lead domestic bank relationships in Australia and in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>In New Zealand, while the economy began to stabilize during the year, growth has been a little bit inconsistent by sector. A 48% decline in the provision charge was the main driver of a 40% rise in profit off what was the lower base in 2009. Costs continue to be well managed, which is going to be increasingly important in the lower margin environment in New Zealand. Improvement in credit quality has been most evident in the retail and institutional sectors. However, there is still some uncertainty around the rural and commercial sectors.</p>
          <p>With Jenny Fagg unfortunately having to step down due to health issues, David Hisco was appointed as New Zealand's CEO last month. And whilst it's early days, he's certainly hit the ground running.</p>
          <p>Our market rate in New Zealand was a drag on the Group as the recession there worsened, and of course, the reverse is now true. And I am increasingly optimistic about what we can do in New Zealand in 2011.</p>
          <p>The Group is continuing to build a solid bank through our focus on the balance sheet. Since 2007, we have grown capital from 6.5% to just over 10% today. Our loan to deposit ratio has declined from 166% in 2007 to 141% today. We have raised around $24 billion in wholesale funding in 2010, plus another 2 billion in pre-funding for 2011. The 2011 objective is going to be broadly consistent with that that you saw in 2010.</p>
          <p>Our super-regional strategy is continuing to give us diversification in our funding base, with Asian deposits helping us to reduce both our short-term and long-term funding gap by over $13 billion in 2010, which is almost double where we were at the end of the first half.</p>
          <p>Disciplined use of the balance sheet has fed through into margin improvement, despite what has been happening in the global economy. And we are building on this by working hard to understand what our customers need rather than just trying to sell them product.</p>
          <p>Looking at the global economy, the world is turning out pretty much as we expected with the great sense of fragility in the U.S. and Europe but with growth in Asia and the other developing economies. Australia remains strong but it has some very important challenges ahead. Despite being supported by Asia's growth we need to remember that the past two years we've been riding the wave of billions of dollars of stimulus spending. To be blunt, without a renewed commitment to bold economic reform and productivity improvements, Australia's current growth rates will simply not be sustained. And I think New Zealand has recognized the importance of further reform and is embarking on that.</p>
          <p>Australia now also has to breakout of its short-term mindset and the distraction of recent stupid arguments and act decisively on economic reform. This includes pro-growth tax reform, infrastructure investment and more support for education and research.</p>
          <p>Now, just summing up, the 2010 results show that having weathered the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, we're now starting to put some runs on the board.</p>
          <p>ANZ is a more predictable organization for shareholders and a better place for our customers to do business. Three years after announcing our super regional ambition, we are delivering on the promises that we made to you. We're now increasingly recognized for our geographic diversification, which focuses on the world's best-performing economies and the increasing linkages that our corporate and our personal customers have and want with the region.</p>
          <p>We've also established a world-class team of experienced bankers throughout the company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to deliver on our strategy. While global economic growth will continue to be soft over the medium term, the momentum we have in our regional focus I believe sets us up very well for 2011.</p>
          <p>I'll now ask Peter to take up or talk to the results in a little more detail and then we'll open it up for questions. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. And good morning to everyone. I'd like to start first of all by looking at the big picture. And as Mike said, the overall statutory profit result is up by 53%, but we always focus more on the underlying earnings and backing up the non-core items, we had 33% growth in our underlying profit.</p>
          <p>I think amongst those non-core items there are no surprises in the second half, for the full year and for the second half was dominated by acquisition-related adjustments as I showed it with ING and RBS and I think that's in line with what you would have been expecting.</p>
          <p>Looking at that underlying profit result, clearly the big driver has been the improvement in the credit position with that 40% reduction in provisions. But I think the pleasing element is also to look at that profit before provisions. To notwithstanding the exceptional markets income that we had in 2009, we've still been able to generate very good profit before provisions growth year-on-year.</p>
          <p>FX has been headwind to us of about 4% but that's been largely offset by the benefit of bringing on board those acquisitions. Pleasingly as well, when you look at the second half and down the bottom of the chart we then back out again the effective acquisitions coming through and look at what happened to the base part of the business.</p>
          <p>And you see that once again we've had a profit before provisions growth of 2% reflecting continued income growth and driving up. And that then coupled with some further reductions in provisions meant that we headed at 19% growth in our profit. So good momentum across the business.</p>
          <p>Now just look at that in a little bit more detail. What you'll find in this results announcement is because of all those acquisitions, we've put a lot of pro forma analysis in there where we've assumed that the acquisitions effectively took place on the 1st October 2008 and then looked at how was our current portfolio of businesses performed across the two-year period, to give you a further insight into that momentum.</p>
          <p>But obviously it gets through some of the noise that otherwise existing in expense growth, for example, because the businesses we acquired had high cost of income ratios, and lets you see what was the true underlying trend.</p>
          <p>And you can see that our pro forma income growth on that basis was 7% and I think that's particularly pleasing given that the reduction in income in our market's business would mean that the rest of the business grow at about 10, so very good momentum in there, but then flowed through into us having good growth in our profit before provisions.</p>
          <p>Once again on this pro forma basis when you look at the second half, we've had 3% income growth and that's 5% for the rest of the business and then down in markets, so good momentum. And then our pro forma underlying profit is up by 2%, again, reflecting the flow through of that income growth.</p>
          <p>So let's look at income in a little bit more detail and what have been the key drivers behind this year's income growth. These numbers adjusts for markets as appropriate and also for foreign exchange, as do all of our pro forma numbers. And what you see here that from net interest point of view we had 11% interest growth and that was driven primarily by that 28 basis point improvement in margin that you'll see in a moment.</p>
          <p>Our actual interest earning assets only grew by about 1% and that was a story of strong growth in the mortgages portfolio here in Australia, some strong growth within Asia Pacific's assets for institutional. And also then a flat environment in New Zealand, and some contraction in institutional lending here in Australia. Overall, coming out to that modest growth in average interest earning assets.</p>
          <p>Fee income was obviously impacted by the exception fees. Changes that took place in the first half, so that this year had $180 million lower income across Australia and New Zealand as a result of those exception fees. But you see in the second half that there's some more momentum in that fee income because most of the impact of that fee change was in the first half.</p>
          <p>The markets business as Mark alluded to in 2009 for banks globally was an exceptional year. All banks had stand out performances in their markets business. And as you can see from the chart in the top right hand corner, 2009 clearly stood out. But the overriding point here though is that there is a good momentum in the business. We sort of rule a line through '7, '8 to '10 and then recognize that 2009 was an exception. There is still well over 20% growth occurring in that business.</p>
          <p>Then a strong contribution from other income, and that's come from basically two components. First of all, there have been pro forma numbers. They include our wealth management businesses, the former ING Australia and ING New Zealand. And the return of the equity markets meant there was much stronger performances in income and wealth management income. And then, secondly, the partnership businesses in Asia had strong income growth flowing through into these numbers.</p>
          <p>Then, let's look in more detail at the NIM. And the pattern, I think, here on the net interest margin is similar to what we've seen in previous halves where, once again, there is the drag coming through from higher funding costs, particularly on the wholesale debt raisings.</p>
          <p>But, increasingly, the driver is actually the higher deposit costs. And you'll see that was particularly true in the second half, where the funding cost impact was only about 2.6 basis points, but deposit competition was negative 5.9.</p>
          <p>We've been able to reprice. But, nonetheless, our margins, whilst up in the second half, were down in Australia &#x2013; particularly, retail Australia &#x2013; and were up in institutional and up in New Zealand so that overall they're up. In that other there, the 5 basis points is the benefit of bringing on Landmark and RBS, who have higher margins, as well as some other factors.</p>
          <p>From a cost management point of view, you know our philosophy has been to manage our expenses with the objective of maintaining neutral to positive Jaws. And you'll see that this year, we pretty well did it. If you adjust for the roundings, the income growth was 7.2% and the cost growth was 7.6, so essentially it's flat. And that's notwithstanding, as you can see from on this chart, that the exceptional income growth overstated &#x2013; exceptional income growth for markets overstated the Jaws in 2009 and in the flip side, it's depressed the size of the Jaws in 2010. So again, across that two-year period, we've maintained quite positive Jaws.</p>
          <p>Most of the expense growth, as you can see from the chart on the right, has come out of the Institutional and Asia-Pacific businesses. Asia-Pacific was up 22% and the non-Asia-Pacific part of Institutional was up about 9 and then Australia had about 5% year-on-year cost growth. So the focus is particularly on the high growth and strategic parts of our business there within the Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>On the provisioning front, clearly the second half was a very pleasing outcome. I think lower than what most of the analysts was expecting. And as you can see from that chart on the left hand side, it's principally been improvement in the Institutional side of the portfolio. Indeed, in the second half, there were no new impaired assets over 100 million and of course it's been those impaired assets over 100 million that's been the principal driver of the individual provisions coming out of Institutional previously. And &#x2013; but then, in the half, all of our businesses were down in their IP charges, with only exception really to that being some increases in Regional and Commercial Banking here in Australia, a little bit in small business. But in order of magnitude, those numbers are very small.</p>
          <p>So that result means we had an individual provision charge that was around 42 basis points in the second half, so getting down to more average levels as we come out of this high point of the cycle. Then, from a collective provision charge point of view, you will see net-net across the year, there was essentially no collective provision charge, which means that we retain all of those management overlays that we came into the year with, and there's been no net change to those balances.</p>
          <p>On the impaired asset side, once again the same pattern, significant drop-off in the level of new impaired assets coming from Institutional business. The New Zealand business is flat in its level of new impaired assets, still stress over there in Commercial and Rural, but being contained. And in terms of Australia, again, it would be flat with the exception of some parts of Commercial and notably the regional Commercial banking and a little bit in Business banking.</p>
          <p>Looking at the divisional performance, clearly the &#x2013; all of the divisions had very strong input growth off the back of that overall reduction in provisions. So the real interest, I think, is to look at what's been happening with the profit before provisions. And at the divisional level within Australia, you see, we had very strong profit before provisions growth of 11% and continuing on although, a little bit lower in the second half, recognizing margin pressure that we've mentioned previously.</p>
          <p>That 11% was driven by the wealth business and commercial in particular as the drivers of the improvements there. Institutional, in profit before provision sense, was down by 4% year-on-year. But as you can see from the footnote, that was driven by the markets business in the sense that that exceptional income not being repeated in 2010. If you looked at the businesses excluding markets, the profit before provisions was actually up by 12%. So that transaction banking, specialized lending, et cetera, parts of the business are doing very well.</p>
          <p>Within New Zealand, clearly year-on-year relatively modest growth in PBP. But margins started to turn and you can see in the second half, we've got 8% growth in profit before provisions in the New Zealand businesses and that's been driven by an improvement in margin as the effect of closing out our fixed rate mortgages and particularly the effect of repricing the portfolio, fixed rate mortgages ,starts to come through.</p>
          <p>Asia-Pacific was a tougher period in profit before provisions terms, obviously impacted by lower markets earnings, particularly out of Europe and America's portion of Asia-Pacific, Europe and America's. And but also we have kept the spending going, investing and building the business, building up our front line staff and also building up the enablement functions that are required to support that growth in a controlled manner.</p>
          <p>And so we've haven't backed off on that, which means that with some softness on the income side, the PBP is relatively modest.</p>
          <p>Then, summary, and looking at some of the points, which then drive through to the outlook as well.</p>
          <p>Clearly as you can see from the orange line there, there's a decline in the rate of improvement in our net interest margin and I think we said at the time of the trading update that we expected the margin to start to plateau and indeed the interest margin in Q4 was exactly the same as Q3. So it has now flattened out.</p>
          <p>Going forward there are obviously pluses and minuses &#x2013; there's still considerable repricing benefit to come through within New Zealand is still parts of the portfolio in the Commercial and Institutional book to be reprised but its becoming a more competitive in environment as well.</p>
          <p>So with that lower level of interest margin benefit coming through, it's putting more emphasis upon the need for some balance sheet growth. And also in particular as well the non-interest growth focusing on fees and activities within banking that don't require as much capital.</p>
          <p>Markets revenue, again, exceptional 2009. It's been a more difficult environment in 2010, but there has been a significant investment in that business level of sales people and trading people have been increased significantly. So there's a lot of underlying momentum, but of course, markets businesses are always difficult to predict, but there should be continuing upward trend in there subject to market conditions.</p>
          <p>From a cost point of view, we've always been above average relative to our peers, from a cost point of view. And that reflects the Asian investment in particular and also within Institutional. We will continue to manage this with that jaws philosophy, as the over writing discipline here could obviously to the extent income was difficult to predict and costs are hard to stop, you can get small variations there. But our philosophy remains to manage to neutral to positive jaws.</p>
          <p>Provisioning point of view, there is clearly a downward trend. As I said, we now got to the point where individual loss rates in the second half are actually sort of below the long run averages. The signs would suggest that 2011 should be lower than 2010. But obviously we're still dealing with a choppy environment overseas. And there are some patchy areas of risk within the economy and parts of the portfolio. So it is hard to predict, but nonetheless more likely to be downwards.</p>
          <p>From a currency point of view as I mentioned earlier, we had a 4% drag year-on-year from the stronger Australian dollar. If you look at the current spot rates for the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and the New Zealand dollar, there would be a drag now of between &#x2013; somewhere between 1 or 1.5. But obviously, the outcome on the Australian dollar will be another factor that will influence our results in 2011.</p>
          <p>So I think, clearly, the key driver of the results for the year has been that reduction in provisions. But when you peel away from that, you can see that our businesses have had good revenue momentum, and we've continued to invest and grow in our strategic franchises.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Peter. We'll move to questions. We'll go to the floor in Melbourne first and then to Sydney. For the people in Sydney, if you could please stand up when you ask your question. That way we can catch you on the camera. Otherwise, you're just a voice in the distance. So we'll go to the floor here, first.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Craig Williams. I'm an advocate of the view that risk needed to be repriced was one of the great lessons of the financial crisis. Has the industry, in protecting mortgage customers from genuine funding cost increases, repriced commercial lending, perhaps, too quickly?</p>
          <p>In doing so, commercial lending demand has been more muted than many have expected. In addition, rising group net interest margins have now made the task of responding to so-called lunatic fringe led by Joe Hockey in demonstrating a need to reprice mortgage credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, that was an interesting question, Craig. I think that you are right. I mean we had to reprice. We had to reprice for risk, and I think we've done that fairly effectively. I think the issue in the commercial and corporate book was not so much pricing as a lack of demand for or a lack of willingness to invest in capital projects in particular. Because quite understandably people were waiting to see when the economy and when conditions would actually normalize or certainly some of the volatility had come out. And we're actually now beginning to see an increase in demand in the commercial and smaller side &#x2013; the SME market. We are not yet seeing massive amounts of demand at the top end of town because again the balance sheets are still very cashed up. They're holding a lot of equity. But there will come a time when that equity is &#x2013; that is expensive to hang on to and they're going to need to look at turning out or putting on their balance sheet some term debt.</p>
          <p>So I think that that's all positive for us. You know I think that there will be momentum going forward. In terms of repricing mortgages on the variable rate mortgage book in particular. As you say, that's become a political football, which is somewhat &#x2013; is somewhat hard to understand in that really the beneficiaries of these rate increases have been the depositors. And what very few people tend to point out is that we actually have far more depositors in the country than we have people with a variable rate mortgage and so there are actually more average Australians benefiting than not.</p>
          <p>But I think we have to be cognizant of the political environment in which we operate and therefore we have to be careful with what we do, what we have tried to do though is ensure that we run the business as a business should be run.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Matt Davison from Merrill Lynch. Just a follow-on question on the asset rate pricing, Mike. You'd long being probably more optimistic than you appear and have delivered a stronger result on that front. If we look at the institutional asset re-pricing of over 50 bps in the past 12 months and New Zealand over 60.</p>
          <p>I'm just interested, did that surpass your expectations and as you look forward now particularly with a bit of a slowing in the bond markets for corporates, whether you could see those start to turn down, or would you continue to say them hold at these levels? And I guess as a broader question, your margins now about 30 basis points above the peer group here in Australia. Obviously there's business mix differences, but do you view that as sustainable from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are going to begin to see pressure on margins. And then I think that that's realistic. I think that certainly in the institutional business we will begin to see further pressure on margin. I still think that there is some way to go in terms of the improvement in margin in New Zealand because that's really a dynamic of the mix of business particularly the fixed rate mortgages and as the fixed rates reprice then of course you can do improve the margin.</p>
          <p>But I think that credit cost in the commercial and in the middle market is actually here to stay for a bit. And I don't think that we should be looking to reduce that significantly. Because, back to Craig's point, I think we're actually charging for the risk properly now. And I think we have to resist some of the pressures to reduce this too much but I think where we will actually see an improvement is probably &#x2013; there seems to have been a degree of sense coming back into the deposit market and I think we should see a bit of an improvement there.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; as an outlook there is definitely going to be pressure. Can we maintain this sort of level? It's definitely plateaued at the moment, I would like to maintain it and certainly that's what we will try and manage to &#x2013; but there will be pressure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. Mike, I just was interested in the institutional costs growth has been some big investment going through that in the last year or so. I just wondering when that ends and we sort of get more of a plateaued or normalized level of cost growth in the insto bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean insto, I think we all accept, was very under invested. We are playing catch-up there and we will continue to invest in the business but, at the same time, we will be seeing an increase in the revenue line there as well. I mean, you know we won't continue to spend unless we get a return. But Shayne, do you want to make some comments on that? I think it may be sensible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of the investment we've been making &#x2013; most of that has historically been in building out our transaction banking platform. The vast bulk of that is behind us, we had some implementation costs across Asia, which will continue over the next 18 months and the next area of investment for us will be in the markets area, mostly around the foreign exchange platform. The total spend on that will be less than what you spend in transaction banking, but nonetheless a reasonable amount. So we'll continue to invest that horizon as you know over the next 18 months to two years in terms of the vast bulk of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only other point I would add there is that the investment that Shayne was talking about there, in cash management transaction banking, is already paying dividends. The increase in income there is already very significant.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Jon Mott from UBS. Got a question on capital and the core Tier 1 ratio. If you look at it now, it's at 8% and if you roll forward to Basel III I think you got some indications it's going to come down, potentially quite substantially from there. If you then look at your peers north of us up in Asia. I think Standard Chartered just put through quite a substantial rights issue trying to get their Basel III core Tier 1 to 10, and HSBC is not that far behind. So if you do have growth ambitions as a liability gatherer in Asia, where do you actually expect your core Tier 1 will need to settle under Basel III?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's still too hard to call that one, Jon. What we are seeing is that, whilst the Basel III capital requirements were announced in September and everybody has taken those as given and that's all going to be &#x2013; everybody is going to conform with that. We're now faced with a bunch of regulators who are saying that well, actually, it's not sufficient and those noises are coming most particularly out of the U.K. and out of Switzerland, but there's also a degree of concern, I think, in Europe and Continental Europe and also in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So I actually don't believe that this issue has yet gone away. I think that the Australian regulators and government have done a great job in actually ensuring that some of the silly proposals that were being bandied around have been taken off the table.</p>
          <p>But I still think that there's some way to go before this &#x2013; that works its way out. And until that time, I'm comfortable maintaining the sort of level of capital that we have at the moment. It is a &#x2013; there is a bit of a cushion there. It is a little bit on the high side, but I think it's prudent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might add to that too, Jon. You've obviously, I think, looked at the slide on the Basel III regulatory capital. And whilst there are some additional requirements under Basel III, if we also align ourselves to all the other Basel III measures, in fact, we come out with a core tier 1 ratio of 9.2. So we're not far away from the 10%.</p>
          <p>So it ultimately is going to depend upon how it's implemented. But I don't think actually we're that far away from even the benchmarks that you mentioned. And clearly, certainly the best placed of our peers in that regard.</p>

          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. Just a follow-on question on expenses, but this time in relation to the Asia region. If you look in the second half, you had 15% expense growth versus 5% revenue growth. I just wondered, looking forward to FY '11, were the drivers of profit growth there going to be more on the expense line or on the revenue line? So if you could give us some more color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it'll be on both. I mean the real reason for that expense growth was the RBS acquisition. If you remember, those businesses came into &#x2013; were acquired by us and they had a cost income ratio of 100%. And Alex Thursby tells me he can probably do better than that. I sincerely hope so. So it will be both. There will be a drive to actually extract the value from those businesses, in terms of additional income, but there is no doubt there will be some cost saving too.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Just a question on the moving the corporates up to Asia. You've done well to take &#x2013; free up some of the excess liquidity in Asia, but can you just talk about the opportunities and what you seeing, in terms of taking corporates back up to the Asia region and accessing some of the loan growth into pushing some of the loan growth up to Asia from Australia domestically?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've been pretty successful in this and what has been interesting has been the appetite for good quality Australian names in the Asian markets, but particularly from other banks. And our whole DCN capability has been built around this opportunity, but it's not only &#x2013; it's not only Australian businesses, we've also had a fair amount of success in moving U.S. and European corporates who do business in the region, who have actually accessed the debt markets in Asia. I don't know if Alex would like to add a little bit more to that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">

          <p>I think the trend will continue for Australian corporations to move into the Asian debt capital markets. As Mike said, the requirements and the liquidity access there is good and the main clearance is still very positive and we are starting to see some U.S. and European corporations also access those markets. So I think you will see the trend line continue as we move through the next 18 months or so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. Mike, I'm just wondering if there's any update on your target of 20% earnings from Asia Pacific, Europe and Americas by 2012? And whether it's too early to talk about your intentions in the medium term, so where you'd like Asia to get to beyond 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, we are at &#x2013; we're about 16% now and &#x2013; well, 14%, yeah, okay. We're on track. We came from 6% and we're basically traveling pretty well. And I think we have to understand that there are some issues, for example, the currency, which moves against us a little bit. But that will come back the other way. That's swings and roundabouts.</p>
          <p>The underlying business, both in terms of the acquisitions we've done but, more importantly, the underlying operations, are all tracking fairly well. And whilst we have to remember that that was an inspirational target, I still think we are on track to get there. Where do we want to get in the medium-term? I think that's really very much a consideration of what further acquisitions we do. But I would be looking, at some stage in the medium-term, perhaps over a further five years, to move that up to somewhere like 30 to 33%.</p>

          <p>No. I think there is still a fair amount of room in this. Obviously, we have to be cognizant of the fact that we have to fund our offshore operations at the same time, but there is still, I think, a significant amount of opportunity open to us. So this number will grow.</p>

          <p>Scott Manning from JPMorgan. Just interested in the importance of the India banking license. Just what that allows you to do with that one branch in terms of the broader institutional and FX presence there, and also whether you're interested in having a look at the RBS assets that are still there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one branch does give us access to the market. It is basically important that we actually build our institutional business to start with. And it is critical that we give access to the global markets business, the DCM business and indeed the relationship management for covering the corporates that we bank in India.</p>
          <p>So that one branch is going to be very significant, but that will be the first of an expansion plan. We will build the business there. In terms of acquisition facilities, I think we have to just wait and see what happens. The RBS deal is still around, there are various regulatory issues that have not enabled that to proceed with a couple of the other suitors. So you never say never, but at the moment, we're not looking at it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brett Le Mesurier from Axiome Equities. On the funding side, your long-term wholesale funding has been increasing, your deposits have been increasing, and your short-term wholesale funding has been decreasing. Do you see that trend continuing and where do you think your short-term wholesale funding will actually finish in a couple of years' time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's quite a difficult question to ask, because it really does depend very much on the vagaries of the market and what is going to happen and in terms of where rates move. Suffice to say, I think the important bar on that chart is the growth in customer deposits. I mean, that is the one that we want to continue to grow. Obviously, having a degree of long-term funding is also important for our total funding mismatch. But the short-term element, there will always be some. So it's not a question of saying that that number will go to zero. It won't. But I think that the trends &#x2013; if you look at the trends, they're going the right way.</p>

          <p>James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. I was just wondering on the BDDs. We heard one of your competitors yesterday say that the trajectory in BDD reduction has slowed quite materially and that they're most like to stay above the long-run average in 2011. Just your view as to what your book is showing and where 2011 is likely to end up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We've still got a few. I actually think that there is no doubt that we are seeing a positive trend there. We have seen &#x2013; you've got to remember that last year was probably the height of the crisis. The year before was pretty steep as well, and you always get a build-up and then a rundown.</p>
          <p>Will the B&amp;D charge go back to pre-crisis levels? No, it won't. I think we're going to go into a more normal phase. And I think that that's an important consideration when looking at pricing for risk, because obviously risk has to price in that provisioning level. Anything you want to say on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Let me repeat what I said earlier. We'd, of course, give you expected loss numbers that our colleagues in risk have calculated for the portfolio. And you see that in the second half, we've actually dropped slightly below those expected loss levels.</p>
          <p>So you've gone away from being well above average, you're not going to be below average, but we don't think it's going to go down to the 6, 7 and 8 basis points we had before. It's going to be a more gentle downward trend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. No I think what we've said is, as we've said all along in this, is that the Bad and Doubtful trend &#x2013; we see the big end of town come through during the GFC crisis, we saw that, and we've managed our way through that. We would also say that the mid-market commercial element small business would start following that through, and that's what we've very much seen coming. So while the number of accounts, there will still be a number of accounts we have to work through, the actual size of the accounts and the provisions should fall away. And the non-performing loan balances have now stabilized and they're starting to reduce.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Just, if I could take your mind back a year ago. We've heard on your Jaws you were expecting slightly higher costs and perhaps lower revenue, but you were looking at delivering neutral to positive Jaws over the two year period and as we were going through Peter's slide, the summary slide, it sounded like you are saying that perhaps environment has changed. In light of that, are we still able to expect neutral Jaws at least and therefore we should have positive jaws in 2011, given that on the underlying business you delivered negative jaws this year? Or do you need to change that guidance that you've given a year ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; if you didn't understand that piece, but certainly, I mean, if you look &#x2013; our jaws has effectively been zero this year if you take out the acquisition and foreign exchange adjustment. And next year we would expect the same. We will continue to invest though. I think that is important both in the institutional and in Asia. And indeed in Australia as well.</p>
          <p>I think the important thing in Australia next year will be the wealth management or development of the plan, the execution of the plan for wealth management. I think that's going to be important. I don't know if you like say something about that, Phil?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Mike. Obviously, we took full ownership of the ING businesses back in November or December last year. And while we've done a first level of integration in order to map them properly into the business it's really only now that we're getting traction at making them functionally integrated. We've got new leadership which, who started only a few weeks back.</p>
          <p>But next year we would expect quite a solid contribution to come from the better integration of the wealth product set into the Australian business. And that's clearly in the face of the type of margin compression we're facing domestically. That's clearly a new source of growth for us and will help round out, as Peter mentioned earlier, the need to get a better mix of non-interest income into the business.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First thing is, congratulations on a great result. But I had two very quick questions. The first one, Mike, last result you confirmed that an element of the overlay collective provisions related to legal risks on perfection of security. Can I confirm that's still the case? And the second one is, I was wondering if Peter could refer to slide 37 on the capital? And if we have a look at the brown bars these are the things that basically we know will definitely detract from capital under Basel 3. NAB were at pains yesterday to suggest that those brown bars are definitely coming but NAB seem to be indicating that the full alignment to Basel 3 was unlikely given APRA are taking a harsher stance. Which on the numbers there would actually suggest that your co-equity tier 1 Basel 3 on that basis would actually be below 7%. So we then overlay that with that means if in fact you are deemed to be systematically important bank. Could you run us through the downside on that particular slide? So it was the collective provision perfection of security and the downside of slide 37 should the full alignment to Basel 3 not occur as has been indicated basically by APRA and even NAB yesterday.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I'll answer the first bit, because I think it's a bit easier. On the collective provision, Brian, we've maintained those overlays and you're right I mean the overlays cover most of the things but one of them is litigation. One of them is tax and the other is concentration and fourth is economic condition overlay. So we have maintained that because we still feel that there is still a bit of uncertainty out of there and what we would hope to do is transfer that collective across to actually to compensate for business growth &#x2013; i.e. balance sheet growth that we don't have to hit the P&amp;L, flip back and then take it away again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Brian, in terms of your second question. Yes, it's certainly right in terms of those the blue bars on the chart you're referring I think some of the comments coming out of APRA's speech is done by John Lake who would suggest that they are still inclined to keep maybe some part of these. But I think if for example 10% was to become the new black then 10% would be measured based on FSA standards.</p>
          <p>And if they're measuring it therefore in U.S. dollars and we're operating in another currency because our regulator requires a different set of deductions, then surely it'd be a different benchmark. The key thing if we go out of our way to do is we always re-calculate our ratios based on FSA, Basel, people can see what is the comparable level. And if it's simply that our regulator's got a more conservative set of deductions, then you would expect there to be a different capital ratio because it's at the end you got to look at the substance of this.</p>

          <p>Quite respectfully that some of those blue bar adjustments are ridiculous like for example the accrual of the dividend. The reality is that the yellow bars are coming out and the blue bars are unlikely, isn't that the case?</p>

          <p>Brian, I acknowledge that for each of these blue bars there is a good logic, but at the end of the day a set of rules needs to be defined. And we should measure ourselves against those rules and shouldn't be artificially penalizing ourselves with a tougher standard. If the ratio is a bit based on one set of rules then we should calibrate our capital requirement to those rules and to those ratios.</p>

          <p>Yes, Good morning, everyone. A question for Phil, please, on the wealth management operations. Could you elaborate a little bit more on what's going to happen next year? We have OnePath, which will be introduced, I think, next month. What are your ambitions in terms of improving the cross-sell? What's the current number of products sold for ANZ in Australia?</p>
          <p>And then if I look at the results, I notice a very strong growth in general insurance. Can we expect that to continue? And the last one on that subject, the aligned PHISA numbers, we've seen strong growth in the second half partly as a result of two smaller units growing quite strongly. What's the sort of network that you feel is needed for ANZ's ambitions in wealth management in Australia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There was quite a lot on that question, but let me have a go at it. The rebranding of the businesses, particularly the funds management and insurance businesses, under the OnePath brand is going ahead. As you say, in the next couple of weeks, we'll go public with that. And that's in accordance with the original sale and purchase agreement with ING.</p>
          <p>What we're looking to do next year effectively is to better integrate the distribution of the product suite into the ANZ network. So there's a couple of things happening there. One is that we will be putting a lot of focus on in affluent distribution channel within the ANZ branded businesses in order to make sure that we can properly segment and target the core priority market for wealth management product.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to grow our capability in funds management and insurance businesses by making sure that we have a modern and up-to-date product set and also having some investment go into the administration platform side of the business so that we can support that growth.</p>
          <p>We currently have about 9% of ANZ's customers who hold a proper wealth management product and I'm leaving out the people who hold credit card insurance because we have a very high penetration there but it does tend to distort those percentages. And we would think that over the some reasonable timeframe we can take that wealth management penetration from somewhere around 9% up to something more like 20%. Now that may take three, four, five years to achieve but it will come from having that distribution network properly aligned around the ANZ customer set. In the meantime, the non-ANZ's distribution network remains very important obviously it drives a lot of the volume for the businesses particularly for the insurance business. And one of the real high performers for us over the last year or so has been the Life Insurance business as well as the General Insurance.</p>
          <p>We are pretty comfortable that we've got enough aligned dealers so we're not looking to grow that channel aggressively. Indeed it's with all the regulatory changes that are coming ahead with commission structures and limitations on advice. We just need to be a bit cautious about exactly what role aligned dealers are going to play going forward. So we've got no particular plans to add to that network at the moment. Some of the dealerships themselves are adding advisors because there has been quite a lot of dislocation with what's gone on elsewhere in the market. But that shouldn't be misinterpreted. There's no particular plan to grow the aligned group.</p>

          <p>Thanks. I don't think &#x2013; there's no more calls on the phone from what I can see. We did have a couple of web-based questions but both of them are simple data questions. So I will get back to both of those people after the presentation. Do we have any last questions from the floor in Melbourne, please? Craig?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Craig Williams, again. You talked about reform earlier in your presentation, Mike. Just wondering if you could pass some comment on how you see &#x2013; how you'd like to see structural issues like the lack of eligible liquid assets in this market and high reliance on wholesale funding by Australia's banking system being addressed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the regulatory requirements or in terms of our management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I suppose there's structural issues there that create some deficiencies in the way of the Australian banking system is constructed &#x2013; apparently some of that can be addressed through tax reform and the like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What would you be calling for in terms of changes in that respect to address these issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the first thing that has to be done is to be very clear about what APRA will require around the liquidity requirements that Basel III will impose, because in my view that really &#x2013; it would be sensible for the central bank to make that call, because they are responsible for the maintenance of the stability of the financial system and it would seem to me that it would be sensible for them to be &#x2013; to actually determine what instruments are repayable and what are not in terms of &#x2013; the last thing they need is a concentration risk in a time of crisis.</p>
          <p>Now if you only &#x2013; if you can only take sovereign bonds or whatever, then what happens to that bond price if everybody has got to repo that? I mean it's &#x2013; some of this stuff hasn't really been thought through properly. In terms of what the market can do, I mean the things like the issuance of covered bonds and whatever would be important. I think really the key is to get a better appetite within the superannuation funds for fixed income until that happens it's quite hard to see who is going to buy this paper.</p>
          <p>So you know, anything that can be done around that that sort of change would be welcome. And I think as you mentioned earlier, there was obviously some tax changes that could encourage that sort of behavior. So I think the best price is sort of, it needs to be looked at. But in terms of ANZ we want to sort of take destiny in our own hands here and we are moving to become less dependent on that wholesale market and that's something as you've seen the changes in the last three years and the balance sheet have reflected that.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Do you have a follow-up or &#x2013; no. Anybody else. No, looks like we done. So &#x2013; the web was just there was a simple question about what the ROE was, so I can get back to that gentlemen. Yes, I will respond to both of those.</p>
          <p>Thank you. So no more questions here. I take it there are no last questions in Sydney. So we thank everybody but by all means if you do have questions for the afternoon, please feel free to get back to myself or the other people in the IR team. And thanks for attending.</p>
