          <p>Chandra and Maha will give us a brief overview of the company's performance and that'll be followed by the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue or earnings guidance. Anything said on this call which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be construed as a forward-looking statement, must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the analyst presentation emailed for you and also available on the website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chandra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kedar. First, let me give you a bit of color on Q4, then talk a bit about the year and then the year forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of quarter four, we are quite happy with what we have been able to achieve. We have delivered a growth of 2.3% in constant currency and 2.4% in dollar terms. The volumes have been at little over 3.2%. And particularly I'm happy that both U.S. and UK have done well. Both of them in constant currency terms have grown over 3%. And Europe has had a decline, but that's not a concern because we are coming off a very strong Q3 and in fact, even a strong Q2. So, we think Europe will do well from here.</p>
          <p>Then from a industry point of view, we have had BFSI to be flat, which again is good in the current circumstance. But, again, the pipeline has been good in BFSI. We have also signed three deals in BFSI this quarter. So I think we will see growth from BFSI from here.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of other verticals, all the next range of verticals; Retail, Manufacturing, Hi-Tech, Life Sciences, have all shown good growth in this quarter. So, overall, the deal signings have been good and our employer addition this quarter has been very good and we have added 70,400 gross, which again is a record from an employer addition point of view.</p>
          <p>Yearly, we have grown 31% on revenue terms, which is again very good, because from a volume point of view it is 23% plus, and from a pricing point of view, it has been 1.3% pricing addition as well, pricing growth as well. So on a yearly basis, again, we have done well and we are quite happy with where we are in terms of the margin. We are exiting the operating margin at the right level for us to perform going forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of employees, I already talked about the gross numbers and also on a net basis we have added close to 40,000 people, which is our highest ever. In terms of utilization, we are a little bit lower than the last quarter and also in terms of the trainees, we have been taking in trainees and I'll come to that in a minute.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of customer migration, it's been an excellent quarter and an excellent year. When you see the migration of customers across every revenue band, whether it is $1 million, $5 million, $10 million, or $100 million, the revenue band has been extremely positive and you can see the momentum in the customer metrics.</p>
          <p>From a deal point of view, the deals have come across the board from market point of view as well as from an industry point of view. Even in this quarter, we had deals, two deals in the U.S. and then a couple of deals in Europe and then deals in Latin America and UK as well. So, similarly if you look at industry point of view, we've had financial services bringing in deals as well as other industries like retail and telco.</p>
          <p>So, overall, I think we are happy with where we are, and from an increment point of view, we have given a 8% average hike to all our employees for the year going ahead and we have paid 100% of our variable pay and high performers will get double digit. So all of this are naturally a good start.</p>
          <p>From a deal pipeline, the number of deals that we are creating is also quite healthy. The order book we have had this quarter has been very good. If we go by the order book we have had in the past so many quarters, I think it's consistently improving and doing well.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of demand outlook, I have already mentioned the U.S., I feel that is doing better, and on the discretionary spend I would say that it has eased and we are seeing projects coming in as well. So, we expect to see ramp-ups happening in this quarter on all dimensions from a discretionary as well as annuity projects, from industry dimension, also from market dimension.</p>
          <p>Specifically, <mark type="ph" /> one word (7:10) for Telecom. Telecom has been tough last year, and probably across all industries it produced the least growth. But I think we expect the year ahead will be good for Telecom as well for us.</p>
          <p>With those words, I would just say that we are confident of delivering good growth in the next fiscal year. And I'll turn it over to Maha and then we can take questions later on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chandra. Our fourth quarter revenue was up INR132.593 billion, represents 0.4% Q-on-Q and 30.5% Y-on-Y. The revenue in dollar terms is $2.648 billion, which is a sequential growth of 2.4% and year-on-year growth of 18%. In constant currency, the revenue is $2.641 billion.</p>
          <p>The break-up of our sequential INR growth of 0.42% is below. Volume growth was plus 3.26%. Constant currency realization was minus 97 basis points and currency impact was minus 1.87%.</p>
          <p>Full year revenue for FY 2011 was INR488.9 billion, a Y-on-Y growth of 31%. In U.S. dollar terms, our revenue of $10.171 billion translates into an annual growth of 24.2%. The individual elements of our full year INR revenue growth is as follows: volume growth 23.05%, constant currency realization plus 1.13%, currency impact plus 7.99%, effort mix that has moved into offshore, it was negative 1.17% and therefore the total is 31%.</p>
          <p>Moving on, our EBIT margin declined 155 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 27.7% largely due to currency impact and lower utilization this quarter. The impact of various market levers are as follows: currency impact was minus 71 basis points, productivity improvement was plus 36 basis points, SG&amp;A increases was minus 120 basis points, total minus 155 basis points. For the full year, we have an EBIT margin of 27.6%, down 44 points year-on-year. The benign currency, which contributed 218 basis points plus and improved productivity which gave us a plus 133 basis points, benefits largely mitigated the minus 289 basis points impact of higher wages and the minus 106 basis points impact from higher SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Our net income margin in Q4 expanded 26 basis points Q-on-Q to 22.1% on the back of higher other income and a slightly lower effective tax rate. For the full year, the EBIT margin decline, higher tax provisions and the lower other income net to 163 basis points Y-on-Y decline in our net income margin to 21.8%.</p>
          <p>Let me spend a few minutes on cash flows. We ended the year with free cash flow of INR55.6 billion, a 6.5% growth year-on-year. On a year-on-year percentage revenue basis, a higher tax payout this year took away 2.3% from the free cash flow. This is, as you know, because projects executed in SEZ are also included from March payments. Higher losses on our revenue hedges took away another 1.3%. If one adjusts for these two one-time events, our free cash flow would have shown 39.6% growth year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Our accounts receivable at the end of the year translated into 81 days outstanding in dollar terms, which is an improvement of one day year-on-year. Investment funds as of March 31 was INR107.7 billion. The board has recommend a final dividend of INR8 and a special dividend of INR8 bringing the total for the year to INR25, which is a payout ratio of 46%.</p>
          <p>It has been a satisfying flow through year that saw tremendous global economic uncertainty. We were still worried about the U.S. economy, imminent sovereign defaults in Europe and the roller coaster ride of their currency and hence delivered a full-year revenue growth much higher than that of the industry and a steady operating margin.</p>
          <p>Lingering uncertainties aside, the picture today is better than what it was a month back and as the global economy was to trade through the various challenges, we have two very powerful reasons for optimism. One, the market for our services is growing faster than before, thanks to technological development as well as changes to the business and regulatory landscape. Two, our service delivery model has not only found broader acceptance with clients, but is eventually a much default factor model for the industry.</p>
          <p>Winning share in a growing highly competitive market requires continued investments and gross management attention. Caught up in the grind of quarterly numbers, there is always the risk of succumbing to short term pressure on the cost of benefits. Therefore at TCS our focus is firmly fixed on that big opportunity out there, so while maintaining our cost discipline at an operational level, we continue to invest in our SG&amp;A, in adding people across the world, and equally important keeping them happy and motivated. The weaker currency was particularly helpful this year because we got to do all that and still keep the operating margin where we wanted it to be.</p>
          <p>With that, we can open the lines for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Cowen &amp; Co. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can you give an update on project plans in the discretionary areas, considering last quarter's challenge <mark type="ph" /> move back plan (14:23)? Do you expect the clients to start making spending decisions in March? And also in this context, have you seen any instances of scope reductions or some funding off of this pressure? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from what we said last quarter, I think that discretionary spending really could happen, as I said, we are still using and we are seeing those decisions getting made and ramp-ups happening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to repeat what you're saying, we haven't seen any decision &#x2013; continued decision delays on these sort of instances where our scopes and projects are getting reduced or is getting reduced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. See, what I have said is that last quarter the first couple of months, there are likely to be delays and it was so. And later on, we are slowly starting to see the decisions being made. And we feel as we speak, the decisions are getting made and projects are beginning to ramp up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Then just a follow-up question on BFSI, sequentially, can you talk a bit about some of the sub-segments within BFSI that you are seeing there, whether it's starting <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:43), et cetera? And if we should expect sequential growth picking up speed in the next few quarters? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>BFSI, we are not down sequentially. We have been flat sequentially. And when this environment is happening, I think the discretionary projects didn't kick in, as I said, and that's the reason for that flatness, but I think from here we'll grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from RBS Equities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Congrats on overall performance. So just on the BFSI, do you believe is it the new normal wherein the outsourcing growth is likely to remain volatile Q-on-Q? Or do you believe that what has happened in this quarter and last quarter was an aberration and things will normalize soon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I have said, I think the primary reason for BFSI growth being flat this quarter is discretionary spend delays in the beginning of the year &#x2013; calendar year. And we feel there is niche and then we are pretty confident that from here it should grow. And apart from that, I can't really comment on anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Besides even the discretionary spend, the growth coming through the outsourcing within the BFSI, are you seeing any kind of a change in the normal demand trend behaviors, or do you believe that that has only room to go up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are not seeing that because as I said, we have signed three BFSI deals this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And they are all beginning to ramp up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And they are all annuity type of deals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so, overall, as you believe that most of the discretionary projects are being started. So you believe from the first quarter of FY 2013, it would be back to normal? Or still do you believe that the normal trend in terms of spend to budget ratio may take another two to three months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's beginning to ramp up now, and as we speak, it's ramping up, as I told you before. So I think we should see the pickup from here, but I don't want to say whether it's going to be another two, three months delay, because we are seeing the ramp up beginning to happen now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so just a last question, any demand back in different in Europe versus U.S.? And do you believe Europe has a scope to grow, especially UK and Continental Europe again higher than company average entering FY 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we will do well in both North America and Europe, which is UK and Continental Europe put together based on the deals we have signed and what we see in the marketplace. I think we are expecting to do well in both markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Congrats and all the best to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sandeep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Diviya Nagarajan from UBS India. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Excellent prepared numbers in what seems to be a tough environment. Just following up on some big questions on the banking sector. We have seen growth slowdown in December and March, and now we're talking about projects ramping up from here. So would you believe that the banking revenue for U.S. at least has bottomed out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And could you shed some light on what's driving growth in the Telecom segment? It seems to have picked up reasonably in this quarter as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Telecom sector, we are seeing opportunities both in terms of optimization and in terms of transformation. In the transformation, we are looking at opportunities like multi-channel opportunities to give us some of their customer vacancy systems. In optimization, we are looking at more offshoring type of deals. So we are seeing a combination of these kind of deals and that's what is pushing up the growth. And in fact, we should do better from here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you also give some color on which segments in Telecom are driving this growth and some geographic color as well, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the growth is coming from U.S., Europe and Asia and it is distributed I would say. And what was the other question you had?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the segments within Telecom that are going to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are getting it from both telcos and a bit from equipment companies as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a couple of questions. Your top clients this quarter don't seem to have grown very well. Is there any seasonal pattern that we should read into it? Or do you expect this to develop in this next quarter onwards? And lastly, is there any impact that if you can quantify the impact of things like the deals to gain through this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll talk about both. I think while I can specifically answer both questions, I think it's important to understand the philosophy on both fronts. The company faces loss today and the customer profile that we have is so distributed, if you look at customer metrics, we have done exceedingly well across all revenue bands. If you look at on FY 2011, in particular, it gives a big picture from FY 2011 to FY 2012 perspective, if you notice number of 1 million, 5 million, 10 million, 20 million, 50 million customers, it's been pretty significant additions both in terms of migrating and also adding new customers.</p>
          <p>Specifically, if we want to give you a statistics look at the 5 million customers, we have added almost 37 customers. If you look at 10 million from 143 it jumped to 170. And even 50 million jumped from 27 to 43. 8 to 14 in 100 million. It's very, very holistic growth. And as you grow, you can't be measuring one client at any point in time because there will be volatility and clients when they get larger, they're always going to not give you as much incremental revenue as much as the average client is going to give you. In fact, that's the right metric. So that's the way to view it. But I think since you asked the question, let me tell you nothing wrong with the top line. It's trending around nicely.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of the deals to gain, in a year we do several large deals. Some deals get announced in the press with a lot of fan fare , some deals we don't announce with fan fare either because of the timing or because of the client confidentially, there are so many things.</p>
          <p>So, again, trying to take one deal and then figure out that deal is influencing the revenue is not a right way to look at it. But again, since you asked the question, let me tell you, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:23) is not the material contributor to our overall growth this quarter. We have only project for &#x2013; revenue for one month and I don't want to start disclosing numbers at a deal level then there is &#x2013; than there is really within this <mark type="ph" /> one (23:40).</p>
          <p>So my take on that is that there is no material influence of one client that has affected the numbers. As you can see and as I highlighted, I'm very happy that U.S. grew 40%. I'm pretty happy we delivered 3.2% volume growth. I'm pretty happy that we delivered 3.2% U.K. growth and BFSI is flat. And four of the next two verticals, Retail, Telecom, Hi-Tech and Manufacturing have done exceedingly well this quarter. Personally, heartily, when I look at the operating metrics, I couldn't be happier.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Congratulations on a good quarter. Just following up a bit on the BFSI discussion that we've been having so far, Chandra, it would be helpful if you could give us a bit more color in terms of the deals that you have signed and whether the &#x2013; what the mix is in terms of perhaps annuity services versus discretionary spend, including whether you can push out in regulatory kind of projects? That will be very helpful and any geographic color perhaps you can add as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The three deals have come from, one from U.S., one from Europe and one is from Latin America. All the three are annuity in nature. All three deals, all the three or are all the three are annuity in nature.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are these sort of more a result of like vendor consolidation or increased outsourcing? And, again, whether you can push out in the regulatory side of projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is a bit of consolidation, bit of optimization, and we have transformation of the whole IT infrastructure in these three organizations. These are the three factors and we hope that we will get incremental revenues in all the three places on regulatory side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. That's very helpful. And just secondly on the margins, as you enter next year, clearly, the rupee as well as utilization are tailwinds and you articulated earlier that you're expecting stable pricing. So what should one expect going forward really?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have a couple of comments, and I think Maha should elaborate and give you more details. But, I think the way to look at it is that we are &#x2013; Maha very clearly articulated the kind of investments we have made. And we consciously took advantage of the fact that the currency <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:41). And those things are going to help us whether it is the investment in mobility, investment in beginning platforms, big data tools or cloud, a number of new platforms we have initiated. If you look at all of those areas, there is a significant amount of investment going in. And our utilization levels are a little bit below this quarter, and that should again help us.</p>
          <p>If you look at all of that, we have taken advantage of what other opportunities that we could get. In the near term in Q1, you will see headwinds primarily because of the good wage hike we have given. We have not only given a good wage hike in India, 8% is the company average, but goes toward double digit for high performers, but also have given good wage hike in established markets as well as other emerging markets. So that will be hindering our margins on account of that in Q1 in addition to whatever currency may do, which I can't really comment on it. But I think we are pretty confident on the margin overall on a yearly basis. Maha, you want to add something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Mitali, I think there is no change to our stated position so far in terms of our aspirational margin. Basically if &#x2013; from the driver point of view pricing, we have said we are not really factoring in anything higher as far as margin is concerned. We do expect to have a good utilization this year, mainly because we have built up reasonable amount of capacity into the system. And then as I have already talked about is the expected increase as far as next year is concerned, we are controlling attrition through these wages, incentives and increments and so on.</p>
          <p>And SG&amp;A costs will definitely be enough I think to push higher growth. So taking all these into account, I think we are definitely &#x2013; there is no cause for concern with regard to the operating margin. As Chandra said, it will start slow mainly because there is a wage increase that is coming in right now as far as this quarter is concerned. But it would &#x2013; as the growth takes place over the year, we should be able to keep up to our aspirational margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Just to confirm the aspirational margin that you're referring to was about 27% that is the level if I am right. I just want to &#x2013; again, what sort of currency level are you factoring into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's say currency is a moving game, but anyway as I &#x2013; 27% and then the kind of currency average that we have had, which is about 48% or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Very helpful. And just lastly one quick question. When we entered the quarter this time, the visibility was not great and we did see delays. We did see some delays in ramp-ups. Entering the quarter now, do you feel more comfortable on the visibility?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Congratulations to management on a good set of numbers. I just had couple of questions on wage hikes; you've given 8% in India and perhaps emerging markets, but is any wage hike that you have given in developed markets onshore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Viju. We have given, as Chandra mentioned 8% in India average. As far as developed market is concerned, it is 2% to 4% on an average. Developing countries, it is 6% to 8% on an average.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. The other question I probably had was on visas. Now I know this is not a new issue, you've been combating this constraint for a while now. Do you think is it maybe incrementally, particularly over the last quarter or so, impacting your ability to fulfill demand? Is that becoming an obstacle, however small, in terms of demand fulfillment, because it seems that your product is looking quite good on demand generation side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, I mean it is a challenge and it is taking a lot and lot of time, more time than ever before in terms of planning and execution. And so since it's important to us, we're willing to put the time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thanks. And the last question would be, you expect a normal seasonal pattern to the growth, where typically H1 tend to be stronger than H2 with Q1 and Q2 looking pretty good, nothing really back-ended about your effort getting performance that you expect, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, I was saying that when you're looking at the growth in FY 2013, you expect the growth to be pretty frontloaded, in essence you don't expect too much to happen in H2, the so called back-ended growth. You expect a lot &#x2013; I mean I would expect that a normal pattern would be a H1 rather than H2, where H1 is first half growth. I expect that that's the same thing that you'll also have in this year, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Congratulations on a great set of numbers. First question is on the linearity of the March quarter. Clearly, I think compared to what we were expecting in early March based on January/February, last month seemed to be a lot stronger. Could you elaborate on how the exit rate demand environment was better than the first two months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the discretionary spend started easing up a bit. And also &#x2013; India also has delivered, sometimes the India business throws in a huge surprise and they are also delivered. But U.S. and Europe &#x2013; UK have done well, so I think a combination &#x2013; I won't put it down to one single factor, there is a combination of things coming together, and also no major negative surprises. When things don't look good in multiple dimensions, one negative surprise can give you a big beating, so no major negative surprise and many things coming together. Nothing in great proportion, but everything in the right way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just for FY 2013, hiring guidance sounds a bit light. I know your utilization was running low exiting the quarter. So maybe you can highlight what are you expecting to drive good result? Are you expecting the demand and supply environment to be very benign so <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:00) low right now? Or are you expecting some, possibly a bit more on utilization gains, and also <mark type="ph" /> realization (34:09) gains for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ankur, you know this as well, and it's very difficult to give a number upfront. But basically if you look at our situation, the following needs be taken into account. We have had a huge hiring during the last 12 months, 70,400 people and our net attrition is 40,000 people. And on that base and attrition for the &#x2013; based on all the good work done, where everybody has come down and our IT service attrition is a tad above 11%, which is very healthy. And if you look at all of that, I think we have got lot of opportunities there from a bench point of view. Second, our utilization is lower than that we were in the last couple of quarters, and overall price is increasing, with our capacity and price increasing our utilization should only be going up. It shouldn't be coming down.</p>
          <p>So I feel &#x2013; if I felt confident about 83% before, I would be comfortable with 83.5% now. So, we've constantly pushed that as well. So that also gives another dimension. The third dimension is that there will be a lot of project destocking that can happen given the visa situation. It's very difficult to predict now. There will be a planned and developed at the project level, at the execution team level, who will take calls on local hiring and contracting and so on and so forth. So that will provide certain softness as well. If you take it into all of that into account, 50,000 is a good number to go with, and we've already given offers for more than 45,000 trainees. And so, we will see where we are, and also it should help us to drive a non-linear business a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the onsite hiring, I know &#x2013; I think in your earlier interviews on television, you highlighted the onsite hiring last year was around 1,600 in the U.S. I guess we should expect it to be a lot stronger this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that number should not be taken like that, because it's pretty complex to explain, because one is onsite hiring where we hire people on a planned basis. But apart from that, there's a lot of other hiring that happens in the U.S. for project execution, and that may be very project specific. So I think I wouldn't put a number at this stage, but our intent is to keep building the U.S. workforce, and we are visiting more campuses than before, and we'll be adding more people on our &#x2013; at the training level and at the lateral levels, but there is a lot of project specific hiring that will go on, and that we want to keep it very flexible. We don't want to be very rigid about it, because what's important to the customer and execution on the ground.</p>

          <p>Great. Thank you. I was curious on the level of your wage increases, given that the Indian market seems to be the &#x2013; the Indian economy seems to be a little bit slower, and things are still sluggish, and you have a little decline in utilizations, if all the metrics are the same, maybe you could have come in a little bit lighter, lower on your wage increases.

          <p>I think there are multiple ways to cut this, and you can look at it from different places, but from our point of view we have had a great year, and employees have contributed. And I think they deserve a rise. And also going forward we see the momentum, and we feel that the right thing to do is to go ahead with what we feel is right and reward at the same time retain and then don't lose momentum. And if it's going to put pressure on operating margin by another 50 basis points or another 60 basis points, we will deal with it.</p>

          <p>I think our business model has always been about gaining market share in addition to creating new opportunities and creating demand. So, you always have a market share gain and demand creation. And I always feel that our market shares will continue to increase. And I don't want to talk about a specific competition or anything like that, because we focus on customers and we try to be relevant and we try to capture opportunities. And we will increasingly also focus on creating demand. It's very important from a top leadership point of view to create demand as well. So, a short answer is I think we'll continue to gain market share and there will be enormous focus on the company's part to create demand as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I think you talked about this earlier, but I just wanted to get a fair clarity on it. I know you talked about it a bunch in the call. What is changed in the mind of your clients that you feel has caused a reacceleration, if you will, in the business? And what could change going forward? I mean what's the <mark type="ph" /> run (40:08) market, is this new business that's coming in? Or is this a change in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:13) last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, if you remember last quarter I had &#x2013; I mean, I probably should play the transcript, but I don't remember the exact words, but &#x2013; what I was trying to communicate is that, I gave enough data points to show that a good number, a good percentage of our clients have depended on the budget. And then I also said that a significant portion of the people who have depended on the budget, I think two-thirds of some number I gave, had decided on flat or an increase in budget. So I did not cause any alarm on the budget side. But what I did say, though, is that we expect the discretionary project trend cost to get delayed and we are not sure about that. We are seeing a lot of softness on that front. And we said that it is likely to be over a period of time. And we feel that that is happening. And you can never predict it to the exact degree. And I could plan on 10 projects starting and I'm happy if it is 8 or 12. I get very worried if it is four and I get extremely happy if it's 15. So those things are not &#x2013; even with our best efforts, very difficult to predict, so I could have gone wrong in between, but overall the message I gave and I believe that, that's beginning to happen.</p>
          <p>If we take Telco, for example, as I said they are spending on a multi-channel. They are spending on customer-facing systems. They are really spending on optimization of any kind, whether it's in infrastructure or in the application maintenance portfolio, how can we optimize, it's a major theme in Telcos. Then if you look at Retail, there is a huge spend on digital. Digital means so many things. It's &#x2013; family is one thing, Social is another thing, largely the major area that's being addressed by customers. Then, if you take the Utilities, we are seeing supply chain, we are seeing opportunities in asset management, where we are building large systems for customers and we are seeing manufacturing doing the same thing.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing traction in auto companies. I mean, we are seeing traction on, but each one is different. That is say the customer is different, the industry is different. And it is not the same thing. I can't just say, I'm doing AMS, I'm doing IPO. That's not the way it works. And we got to disaggregate and sometimes within the same customer grouping, two different customers behave differently. So all those things are stuff you have to deal with and we are dealing with, and we learn every day and then we try to apply it. So those are the types of deals that are happening.</p>
          <p>And I'll tell you what I'll be happy with in some stability in my annual data news in the new markets, whether it be LatAm, whether it is Asia, whether it is India. And sometimes we struggle because we suddenly get a good discretionary project and then if a discretionary project scale down, there is not enough annuities to keep it. So our effort is to ensure that those things come off the curve in terms of a good annuity under <mark type="ph" /> CTIS (43:28) and I hope that happens this year.</p>

Are you seeing strength in one over the other, and maybe you could just give us some comparative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we have done very well in multiple service lines in BPO, in infrastructure, in Enterprise Solutions and Europe as well, Continental Europe, as a region, all across $1 billion from sell to start. IT is always going to do well, and because of what we call it as IT. You only call AMS as IT, it will still grow. But if you want to take into account all the new technologies, whether it's in digital, whether it's mobile, whether it is multi-channel, social, all of those things are IT, because they are going to transform the systems. So there is plenty of opportunity. So I don't believe that the core IT services sector growth is going to be lower, because it's reinventing itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just lastly from me, are you seeing any commoditization in the business at all, in the BFSI sector or any of your sectors? And how do you look at you becoming a larger and larger organization, are you thinking about more and more about the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:56) between head count growth and how do you manage that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a good question, but see always there is a portion of the business that's getting commoditized. That's always happened. I mean, last year was something, this year is something else, next year will be something else. What we invest today as a new technology two days from now it's getting commoditized. And sometimes it's getting commoditized faster. And the only way to address that is to ensure that we are operating at the best efficiency. So sometimes customers like proposals on managed services, if you're able to go to managed services and able to take responsibility for outcome, and getting it from head count, then you have flexibility, they have flexibility. They get what they want and you kind of bringing in all the know-how and program management expertise, expertise everything else. And to be able to deliver what they want at the same time get what you want in terms of your financial needs. So I think there are ways to handle that, and platforms are key.</p>
          <p>I have to just bucket anything into this way or that way. And the business is pretty complex. And it's evolving, too many things happening at the same time. And we have got to learn with every customer and then try to build on it.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good evening. This is Anantha from Credit Suisse. Can you just, you mentioned the financial services are fairly stable. Do you see any different trends between capital markets versus insurance, versus the commercial tax within BFSI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to say, I did not say financial services sector is stable. And what I was &#x2013; see I don't want to comment on &#x2013; using any qualifier. I don't want to give any word. So I'll not use any word like caution. So I don't want to also use words like &#x2013; but all I'm saying is that customers are spending, financial services customers are spending. Whether you take our first customer or second customer or third customer, all of them are spending. And the spend patterns are different. And as long as we can align the growths, they're looking good. So what was the actual question you asked?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question was whether the trends are uniform across capital markets versus banks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me put it this way, I think &#x2013; I'm not able to very clearly answer the question, because if you look at our customer base, we have retail customers. We have retail banks. We have capital markets and we have insurance customers. We are growing or we are seeing pipelines happening in all and we are not seeing a particular shock against any one of them. So I think going by the deals we have done, I think &#x2013; we have done well in insurance, better than the other two, but I don't have any negative on retail banks or capital markets from our business point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Chandra. And just one final question to Maha. We've seen a kind of credit based increase in dividend payout this year we are talking one of that as a special dividend. So is there any change in the long-term dividend payout philosophy of the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know as a basic &#x2013; I don't think we have altered anything at all. This is the second time we are giving special dividend. We are &#x2013; actually, there is review that happened all the time with regard to what do we do with cash. This is a very important one. Of course, this year it got accelerated with crossing a milestone that we had. So it's a question of, are we likely to continue. That's the reason why we gave it as a special dividend. But I would like to reemphasize the point that we constantly reevaluate what do we do with cash.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Congratulations to the management on this set of numbers. One question to Maha, on the FY 2013 taxes and then a couple of questions for Chandra. One is, is there any change in the softness and the abilities? And also, since BFSI is almost 45% of the total revenue, and we are exiting at flat growth and will there be a market pressure on the overall growth for FY 2013 and a little light on non-linear revenues, how well we can get started?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question, you said you had a question on tax and tax, as far as we are concerned, it is playing out the way that we had emphasized. And certainly, we would expect to see a slight increase as far as next year is concerned in the tax rate, as we had said earlier and thereafter it will come down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. On the BFSI, I think it was your question that we are getting &#x2013; we're flat this year, this quarter what if &#x2013; what if &#x2013; again, is that the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It is flat in this quarter. So, you know, it is almost 45% of the total revenue. So, will it not impact the overall revenue growth for FY 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, BFSI, we expect it to grow from here. And also, our Telecom is picking up. It's very good, better this year than last fiscal year and a number of other verticals like Retail, Manufacturing, Hi-Tech, are all driving growth and BFSI also is going to do better from Q4 levels, as I have said. So I think we are quite positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the softness in Utilities and some light on non-linear revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, the Utility softness, first of all, it's a pretty small vertical. And again, we had a huge growth last two quarters, I think, double-digit sequential growth rates. And so, even if one discretionary project ends, and another one doesn't start, immediately you will see that that's what's happening because of the small base, and the high growth in the last two quarters. But there is nothing wrong with the client or nothing wrong with the sector per se.</p>
          <p>From a non-linear point of view, I think that's our biggest focus. We really want to drive that very aggressively from this quarter, not that we have not been driving aggressively but needs some amount of time for us to establish proof points and work with customers and so on and so forth. Our investment is only going up. And I have said that we will do a minimum of 10% incremental revenue in this quarter, and I didn't specify the quarter number primarily because the overall growth is still with a small base. But if you really calculate, yes we would reach definitely. Our incremental revenues definitely would be &#x2013; more than 10% of that will be from non-linear. So we are looking to shape the non-linear chain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question was on the utilization front. Like I agree that utilization is at low level but the kind of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:58) which will come 44,000 approximately next year, so will it not keep the overall net utilization at 80%, 81%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From utilization point of view, yes, it is &#x2013; we are expecting at 80.6% and including trainees it is 71.4%. We have given offers to about 43,600 and given the joining ratio, the trainees will come in. But we have been able to absorb the trainees here &#x2013; provide the training and then absorb them in projects. And given the number of &#x2013; since the utilization including trainees is at 71.4% that is one of the reasons why we have said that our hiring plan for the next year also we had given the numbers and kept it at 50%. So all said and done, I think we are quite confident of maintaining the utilization at the desired level.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question was regarding the SG&amp;A spend. Obviously, this year you have done a lot of investment on that front. If you can just help us understand where exactly these dollars have been spent, is it on new platforms in the area of cloud computing, or Big Data or is it just client mining on the traditional services, touch a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a combination. We have definitely invested in clients and will invest in clients, and our plan being of increasing. Definitely we are putting more resource. And from a technology point of view, we are investing heavily in mobility, big data, multi-channel, social, listening platforms. All those areas are technology areas that we are investing. The other aspect is we are doing more platforms, we are looking at platforms, not only horizontally, but the horizontal, vertical meeting points. So, sometimes we are creating a platform, sometimes we are just trying more things before we commit to a platform, so all kinds of such efforts, and we have a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:08) group which is building lot of IT, all the IT that we think are going to be building blocks. So there is a group focusing on that. I think there is a multiple different initiatives. We have overall budget, we try and distribute it judiciously.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And just in terms of if there is any quantitative breakup in terms of what part is being spent towards building new platform that can be shared?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Congrats on a good set of numbers. Two questions, one is in terms of verticals. What is the other segment that seems to be growing at more than 20% sequentially for the last two quarters? And secondly, for Maha, Maha is there any reclassifications in cash or investments to other current assets because this item seems to have gone up from around $11 billion to $65 billion on a quarter-on-quarter basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the others point of view, I think it is something that we cannot clearly classify into a particular segment because the solution is cost industry &#x2013; multiple industries involved and that is why we have really not made a call on putting it into one particular sector. The other way to do it is to take that and approach in certain percentages and we have not taken that call. We feel that is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:51) and it also brings into non-linear revenues as well, so we've kept it as it is.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you all for joining the fourth quarter and the annual FY 2012 analyst call. Really appreciate all of you joining in, especially some of you with your friends. And from our point of view, we are happy with the way we have delivered the Q4 numbers and the way the year has panned out. In a tough year, we started the year by saying that the pricing will be more or less stable, very unlikely to see <mark type="inaudible" /> (58:51) and it has proved to be so and we are happy that we at least had a 1.2% pricing improvement and the volume has been pretty good, 23%, in a difficult reserve regime to be not only able to capture these volume to be able to deliver to those volumes that have been pretty critical. All parts of the company have worked together and we have exhibited lot of agility and lot of flexibility with the way we serve our client.</p>
          <p>And industries-wise, Telecom was rather muted this year, lower growth than rest of the other sectors, but all the other sectors have done well. The company for multiple quarters has been witnessing a very holistic growth, a balanced growth from all the industries. And I think we are setup well to be able to continue that momentum from an industry point of view.</p>
          <p>From the market point of view, we started the year and all through the year there have been questions about U.S. and Europe, but our growth in these markets have been very, very good on a yearly basis. The growth in North America has been at the company average, and in terms of the UK, it's a little lower, but it's still pretty good. And in terms of Continental Europe, again it's well ahead of the company average and all the Emerging Markets have also done well, and LatAm had a neutral year on the revenue side had a &#x2013; LatAm from the region point of view and Telecom from the industry point of view had greatest growth. But LatAm did show very good improvement in margins, and we are set up very nicely for a good growth in that market as well, going forward.</p>
          <p>And in terms of customers, I think there's one single metric I'm extremely proud about, the customer metrics across all the revenue band has been excellent, and we hope to continue to stay close with customers, and do all the right things in terms of investments and understanding the nuances of the customers across markets and customers within industry, and develop our offerings and foreclose our investment to shape the future.</p>
          <p>In terms of non-linear, we have introduced the products, not only in BFSI, but also in a couple of other sectors. We are beginning to make the right moves in Retail, and we see opportunities in Healthcare and one or two of our government solutions have got potential. We will be trying to take investor market as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of platforms, both horizontal and vertical platforms, we've made all the investments in a number of them, and now our focus should be to be able to deliver results on those platforms by working closely with customers.</p>
          <p>On the employee side, the team has delivered a wonderful result for all through the year, and record addition on the gross level, record addition at the net level and attrition down, and we want to keep the attrition lower in India and international attrition is a little higher than what I would like. So, definitely there is going to be a focus in terms of bringing the attrition down internationally, whether it is Latin America, whether it's China, or whether it's other markets so that we can concentrate on the growth and not be with such issues.</p>
          <p>So I think the utilization is where it is and there is room there for meeting the growth and the margin is at the right level where we are feeling comfortable and with the wage rise there will be near-term headwind, but we think we can look at it at the year goes from a margin perspective. So, overall, I think that we are happy with where we are and we see good momentum and hopefully we have a very good year next year. Thank you so much.</p>
