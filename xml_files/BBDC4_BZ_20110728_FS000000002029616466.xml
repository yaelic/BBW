      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning everyone and welcome to our conference call. In recent months, certain international economic activity indicators have been below market expectations. At the same time, concern over the European fiscal issue and the ceiling of the U.S. debt has been accelerating. Nevertheless, despite the increased risk, the global scenario is still marked by abundant liquidity and high commodity price. As we believe this to be true, it's unlikely to change substantially in the coming months, thereby, favoring Brazil.</p>
          <p>On the domestic front, the inflationary pressure has been facing a monetary tightening, combined with a reduction in government spending and the macroprudential measures. A heavily <mark type="indiscernible" /> (03:17) should ensure that the inflation converges towards the targets of 2012.</p>
          <p>Although economic growth is likely to be more modest in this convergence phase, at around 4%, the long-term prospect remains highly favorable. The expansion of loans, including mortgage loans, has been based on sound fundamentals, including the improved job market and intense upward social mobility, generating a favorable scenario for banks and insurance companies with operations in Brazil.</p>
          <p>We believe that the expansion of investments in the infrastructure and education will play an important role in increasing the country's growth potential. I'll now go into more details regarding our results. On slide two and three, representing the period's main highlights, sf which, I'd like to emphasize on line two, the adjusted net income for the first half of 2011, which totaled R$5.563 billion, representing a growth of 21% over the same period of the previous year. The total assets, which represented 24% increase over the last 12 months, amounting to approximately R$690 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide three, it's worth noting assets under management, that's total R$934 billion as of June 2011. And the delinquency ratio, which came into 3.7% last June, showing an important recovery in comparison to the previous year. On slide four, this shows the reconciliation between book net income and adjusted net income in the respective periods. This quarter, as it has occurred last quarter, we had only one non-recurring items which was the constitution of provisions for civil contingencies for economic plans in the gross amount of R$69 million. After adjusting for this event, our book net income went from R$2.785 billion adjusted to R$2.825 billion, generating an annualized return of 23.6% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide five shows our net income in recent quarters. The increase in the second quarter was mainly due to, one, the increase in income, especially from credit card transactions, and two, the reduction in other operating expenses net of other operating income. This increase was partially offset by, one, higher personnel and administrative expense, and two, higher income and social contribution tax due to the end of the tax credit arising from the increase in the social contribution rate from 9% to 15% and, of course, the increase in the taxable income.</p>
          <p>In the six month comparison, the 21% improvement in our net income was mainly due to, one, the upturn in the net interest income, internally fueled by the higher volume of operations, two, increased revenue from our insurance group, and three, higher fee income. Slide six, this slide shows our operating efficiency ratios. The blue line shows our operating efficiency ratio, adjusted-to-risk, which remains virtually flat over the last quarter. In the six month comparison, the ratio improved by 2.4 percentage points, mainly due to the increase in net interest income net of provisions for loan losses due to an important improvement in delinquencies.</p>
          <p>The 12 months ratio, the red line, and the quarterly ratio, the red bar, also remained flat at 42.7%, 42%, respectively, a performance we consider satisfactory, if you take into consideration the organic growth we have been experiencing. We believe this indicates that we will remain close to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (08:06) level in the short term. In the mid-term, however, we'd like to remind you that we expect these indicators to improve with the conclusion of investments in organic growth, and tech knowledge as well as improvements in our segmentation process.</p>
          <p>Slide seven, total assets came to R$690 billion, resulting in an increase of 23.5%, or around R$131 billion, that's on June 2010. Return on average asset remains at 1.7%, while adjusted return on average equity, as we had already mentioned, stood at 23.2%. The capital adequacy ratio, or Basel ratio, closed the period at 14.7%, slightly down on the previous quarter chiefly due to the increase in the credit risk proportion, in line with the expansion of loan operations. We believe the accrued levels leave us in a comfortable position to sustain expected growth.</p>
          <p>Slide eightm this slide shows the relative share of our main operations in net income. Financial activities account for 72% of our net income, of which, I would like to emphasize that this funding accounts for 8%, showing an increase from 5% in the same period last year. This was mainly due to an improvement in the funding mix at the higher interest rate. I'd like to place emphasis on the insurance segment, which remains an important pillar of our business and which accounts for around 28% of our consolidated results.</p>
          <p>Slide number nine, we have consistently maintained high levels of unrealized gains, which totaled R$9.4 billion in the second quarter. The quarterly variation was due to the relative devaluation of the mark-to-market of our security both fixed income and equities, partially offset by appreciation of some of our investments, especially in Cielo. Note, that these figures do not include the potential goodwill from our own properties, in the total amount of R$2.9 billion sales.</p>
          <p>Slide 10, on this slide, I would like to highlight the constant evolution of the interest which is the portion of our net interest income, which increased by 20% in comparison to the first half of 2010 and by 4% in the quarterly comparison. This performance was due to the higher average volume of operations especially, in the lower and the funding portfolios. The quarterly reduction in the non-interest proportion was basically, due to reduced gains from treasury and securities operation, reflecting market volatility in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 11, despite the positive increase in the net interest income, the annualized net interest margin decreased to 7.6% of total average assets in the second quarter of 2011 differently from what we expected. Primarily due to the change in asset mix and reduced average net interest margin from insurance, in turn impacted by the assets index to IPCA, the consumer price index, and the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:58). It's worth noting that the important growth of our large corporate loan portfolio results in assets that generate lower margins.</p>
          <p>Slide 12, this slide shows a breakdown of our net interest income. The quarterly highlights were the evolution of margins for loans and funding, impacted by the higher volume of business and increase in average spreads. The reduction in the insurance segment was due to lower gains from assets index of IPCA and the fall of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:33), as we have already mentioned.</p>
          <p>In comparison to the first half of 2010, fund income performed best, reporting a 69% increase essentially, due to: one, the average amount raised; two, the improved mix; and three, higher interest rates.</p>
          <p>Slide 13, this quarter gross interest income from loans, the gray area, increased by 6% to R$6.548 billion. Once again, this growth was supported by higher business volume, as well as an increase in average spread. The red area shows the provision for loan losses, which increased by 3.3% in line with the 4.6% growth in loan operation, coming to represent 35% of the gross interest income. As a result, the net operation, the blue area increased by 7.6%. In comparison to the first half of 2010, the 12.7% of the net income was chiefly due to the increased volume of business, during that average balance of the loan portfolio grew by 23%.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, this slide shows our expanded loan portfolio, which goes to 2011 at around $R320 billion, representing an evolution of 4.5% in the quarter and also 23.1% in the last 12 months. Growth was chiefly driven by loans to large corporates, which increased by 5.8% in the quarter and 28% in the last 12 months. And, the loans to micro businesses and SMEs, which grew by around 5% in the quarter and 27% in the last 12 months. On the year-on-year comparison, the large corporate portfolio highlight were other loan risk operations, which includes products related to the capital market; two, BNDES/Finame Onlendings; and three, mortgages loan.</p>
          <p>Slide 15, this quarter our delinquency ratio came through 3.7%, slightly higher than the previous three months, it's important to mention that in this &#x2013; in the individual segment, we made a conservative change in our credit card delinquency criteria, which also contributed to increase the ratios. Given the behavior of the shorter delinquency, as we will see in the upcoming slides, and the maintenance of a strong job market, we expect this ratio to remain at the correct levels.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, this slide shows our delinquency ratio for loans that will reduce between 50 and 90 days in comparison with the national financial system. As you can see, confirming what we had already mentioned on other occasions. The delinquency ratios represent a seasonal behavior, for Bradesco and the market as a whole, increasing at the beginning of each year particularly in individual loans.</p>
          <p>I'd like to emphasize that for comparison purpose with that data set by the Brazilian Central Bank, the Bradesco ratios in this slide shows only the portfolios used in the Central Bank calculation. And therefore, does not reflect the delinquency of our entire loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Slide 17; this slide shows our delinquency ratio for loans reduced between 61 and 90 days, which as you can see, has remained stable in the last few quarters, indicating that delinquency is under control.</p>
          <p>Slide 18; this slide shows that we have maintained high provisions levels, with the surplus of R$3 billion in relation to the amount required by the Central Bank, or, R$8.1 billion in relation to expected gross losses for the next 12 months, the dotted part of the blue line, or even, R$10.8 billion in relation to the expected losses, net of recoveries, the dotted part of the purple line, of course for the next 12 months. This leaves us in a highly comfortable situation, should there be any change in Brazil's currently stable economic scenario.</p>
          <p>Slide 19; underlying what I mentioned in the previous slide, this slide shows the coverage ratio of the allowance for loan losses which, remains at a very comfortable levels, this slight reduction in the last two quarters was already expected, due to the nominal upturn in non-performing loans, which tends to follow the growth in the loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Slide 20; second quarter fee income moved up by 6.9%, mainly to the increase in revenues from investments in activities, with around 120% increase, followed by lower operations, with 9% collections with 7.6%, and credit cards with 7%, reflecting the higher volume of operations and expansion of the client base.</p>
          <p>The six-month comparison, the fee income claimed by 13.9%, led by income from consortium with 23.8%, credit card with 21.7% and checking accounts with 18.9%, primarily due to the large client base, which increased by 2.1 million new checking accounts in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Slide 21, operating expense increased by 3.7% in the quarter, driven by higher personnel expense, mainly to the growth in the non-structural portion, which was in turn primarily due to higher expenses from provisions for labor matters.</p>
          <p>Growth of the structural portion was chiefly the result of the lower concentration of vacations in the second quarter and the expansion of the workforce with a net addition of around 1,600 employees as part of our organic growth. The 12 month comparison, the increase was chiefly due the 2010 collective bargain agreement and the net addition of more than 9,000 employees, during this period.</p>
          <p>Slide 22, to give a better idea of the behavior of our operating expenses; on this slide we have broken down the impact of organic growth. We opened 25 new branches in the second quarter and strengthened our retail services structure by hiring around 1,600 new employees, as I have already mentioned. As you can see if this impact were excluded our administrative expense would have increased by 2.6% in the quarter and 14.3% over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Slide 23; other administrative expense present a small increase of 1.2% in the quarter, the 17.3% increase in the first half, in comparison to the same period of last year was compatible with the growth of our sales network and the consequence of the different quarters.</p>
          <p>Slide 24; this slide shows income from our insurance segment which increased by 23.1% over the first quarter. Basically, due to the life insurance and pension plans with 35.3% and auto and P&amp;C with 21.8%. The six month comparison is 22% upturn was led by life and pension plans and saving bonds. Second quarter net income totaled R$800 million, helped by the 23.1% increase in the revenue and maintenance of the claims ratio at the same level the previous quarter and they improved the <mark type="ph" /> demonstrativity (21:41) situation. In the 12 months comparison, the 11.2% upturn was primarily due to high revenue and reduction in the claims ratio.</p>
          <p>Slide 25; this slide shows some of the main figures from our insurance activity. A combined ratio reported 85.8% in the second quarter, presented slight improvement in comparison to the previous three months chiefly due to, again, the increase in the revenue and maintenance of the claims ratio. Our financial assets totaled $R103.8 billion. While technical provisions stood at R$93.9 billion, R$82 billion of which are related to life and pension products.</p>
          <p>Slide 26, shows our economical department; GDP, interest rate, inflation and exchange rate estimated for 2011, 2012 considering the currency inflationary pressure following a period of the strong GDP and credit expansion. Despite the more modest economic growth expected this year, we have good expectations for the recovery of these indicators in 2012.</p>
          <p>Slide 27, this slide shows the guidance for 2011. Basically, we are maintaining our original guidance with the exception of mortgage loans origination, which we are increasing to R$14 billion and insurance premiums which perform exceptionally well in the first half. We have made no change to our guidance for operating expenses, although we believe it will be, it will close the year at a slightly higher level than originally predicted, given that the organic growth in the second half of the year. We will certainly accelerate due to our projects to one, our project to replace Banco Postal, and two, to strengthen our services structuring in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:55) given that we will start paying civil servants in this state as from next January.</p>
          <p>Now, to conclude, we consider we had another quarter of good results. Despite the slight upturn in delinquency ratio, this quarter we kept a constant eye on the quality of our loan portfolio, the growth of which is found on a solid client base and is supported by our constant investment in technology broader than service development and the expansion of our distribution network.</p>
          <p>As you can see, our results from the business remain sustainable, independently of the current domestic and global economic challenges. Certainly these results were generated by our broad business diversity and ample penetration enabling us to monitor all the business opportunities in the consumption and finance market &#x2013; financial markets as well as in our different segments.</p>
          <p>Despite the more moderate economic growth expected this year, we remain optimistic over the long-term, thanks to upward social mobility and expansion of infrastructure, which will lead Brazil to a high level of social and economic growth.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention so far and we are now available to answer any questions you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. I have two questions, if I may, the first one on margins. Mr. Abreu mentioned that margins contracted in the second quarter and have been slower, weaker than you guys anticipated initially and he mentioned the change in the asset mix, which we agree as a loan &#x2013; consumer loans are growing much lower than the overall portfolio and that has a negative impact on your margin mix.</p>
          <p>How do you expect this to play out the rest of the year? Certainly, we're not expecting to see an acceleration of consumer lending, but rather the continuation of the same trends where consumers grow less than the overall portfolio. How do you think net interest margins are going to behave the rest of the year and therefore regarding your guidance, how do you get to your net interest income growth guidance of 18% to 22%, which is much higher than your volume guidance of 15% to 19%? That's the first question, I'll ask my second one later. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jorge, it's very difficult for us to give direction in terms of margins. If you consider this, it's possible changing mix. The mix of growth of the portfolio is different. If you see in the credit, specifically, we are observing a growth in margin, in the spreads in all different line of business, all right? But if you notice this in this quarter that if you look only for the margin for credit you see that we have a growth in the margin. In spite of we've been growing more in the large corporate segments, but even though in the average the margin in credit growth present an evolution this quarter.</p>
          <p>The difference this quarter was more linked to, for example, we grew more in terms of &#x2013; in relative base in asset security, so it has a lower margin. So, that is very difficult for us to give a net interest in margin direction, but to say that we can't consider it to be stable at 7.6% or even to give increase depending on the &#x2013; if you don't have any change in the mix very, very, very big change in the mix. But in terms of net interest income we are very &#x2013; you see that we have been growing around 19%, so it's close to, when you compare it &#x2013; remember we are going 19%, so it's very typical of this kind of the guidance. So, we have no reason to believe that we won't be around there, so even to increase going forward. All right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And my second question is on expenses. First half expenses, personnel admin expenses are up 17% year-on-year, your guidance is 11% to 15%. You did say at the end of your presentation that you think you're probably going to be above the &#x2013; the guidance.</p>
          <p>Can you help understand the magnitude of what you're expecting for this year? I mean, is it going to like stay in at the 17% level or because of the aggressive projects to replace Banco Postal and be ready to serve its government workers in 2012, you know can we think of you know, maybe expenses growing closer to 20%? I don't know I just wanted to get a bit &#x2013; a little bit of a color on expectations for that line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, Jorge.  As I mentioned, we don't have yet &#x2013; didn't finalize our complete plans to expense to replace Banco Postal and the investment that we need to go to accelerating regional &#x2013;  to grow regional . We expect to have to be &#x2013; to give to the market more color in the sense as soon as we have complete the plan completely we will be &#x2013; we plan to open this to the market.</p>
          <p>But in general terms, of course, you can see that we need to open more branches that we have in mind we don't have yet exact the numbers and it will certainly demand more investment at this second half of the year and what expense because we need to add more people like to have that. It's very difficult for us to give at this but assuming that we are growing in 60.6% if we are to consider the total administrative expense not 70% as I mentioned. It's only administrative expense 70%, all right? But to consider personal together, it's 16.6%. We understand it should be a little bit high. I will take a risk to tell you that we are now in our guidance is for 15% dependant, again, on how we really have to &#x2013; but what we know so far I think we it will be around 18% at the end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not 20%. I think 20% is too much. I think it will be -- but it's important to emphasize that we have good expectation in terms of growth in the fee income too, right. We are growing more that we have in our guidance and we have no reason to believe that we will not have gains in this process that we cannot be more than we have now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Domingos, a quick question on the asset quality side, if I look at your guidance page on 27, you never incorporated there a formal guidance on the NPL ratio or provisions or anything like that, but I recall you saying in prior conference calls that your expectation was for the NPL ratio to remain pretty flattish throughout the year and we've seen that, although in the last quarter we started to see a minor increase. I think it was 10 basis points quarter-on-quarter, a bit more than that in the individual's portfolio. Bradesco has continued to perform better than the system and better than some other peers. What are you seeing now as the most likely outlook for the NPL ratio for the rest of the year and into 2012, is still flattish the correct assumption or as we stay a little more, that maybe with the lag you know Bradesco will reflect more what we have been seeing in other banks and in the system as a whole?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, Daniel, we understand that we will keep at this level around 3.7% maybe you can reduce to 2.6% &#x2013; to go back to 2.6% is our expectation for 2011. With all that, we're assuming that the next year we will keep a very strong part of I would say employment rates, very good employment rate in Brazil. We will continue to have that and there is no reason to believe to have a big change in this level, right?</p>
          <p>We can assume that it would be relatively stable. It will depend of course that if you grow more in different portfolios, right? If you grow more with expectation that we continue to grow more in portfolio for corporate, that will certainly, we can have relative reduction in the average NPL but it doesn't mean that the situation in terms of delinquency is better for us we just have a change in the mix but if it is continuous, if we analyze line-by-line of business in different line of the business segment, we understand that we are working with that we'll keep stable going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are saying that for the rest of the year a flattish NPL ratio measure 90 days over in the 3.6%, 3.7% range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, around that. If you consider around 3.6%, 3.7% is flat for us.</p>

          <p>It's consistent with what you've been saying all along, so I praise you for that and then into 2012 for what you know now and given that you seem to be optimistic on the economy we saw that in your economy forecast reiterated in Page 26, there's no reason to believe it should be worse or higher than that either, but it is a bit too early to give a more specific guidance on that. On the provisioning side, therefore, we should expect that provision should remain on the levels we've been seeing in recent quarters, no reason to increase them because you are comfortable with the coverage level that you have and you expect the NPL ratio to behave in the way you just told us, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, it's substantial to grow following the growth in the portfolio, of course, right? If you are growing portfolio, it's reasonable to expect that the delinquency remain flat, but to that extent, the provisions tends to follow the growth in the portfolio right? We don't expect to have a big change in our &#x2013; we don't want to have to change any policy. We understand the level that we have of cover ratio and the total provision is very good levels, right? We don't think we need to reinforce our provisions, but we don't think it's good for us to revert part of the provision, but I think it's important to keep a very high, good caution on provision to face if we have any change in this environment, let's say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And consistent with this, Domingos, and we've seen the official response, you know from the Bank and even prepare a presentation when the topic of the credit bubble became very, very topical, and all the articles that we read. And you have not changed your view right, with respect to &#x2013; and consistent with what we are seeing at your own bank, that there's no reason to really be worried about that. It is premature to be talking about a credit bubble developing in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, it's a good follow-up question. It's very important. We have a very good view of credit.I think this theory about the bubble in Brazil is there is no consistent -- if you look inside what people are saying, there is not any argument that you can receive for any discussion. We know what we are doing here, we are growing. We know that we &#x2013; if you are growing great because you have condition to grow that, because the economy is growing, you have a good improvement. If you look at the impressive improvement on our unemployment rates in the last years, you see that it explain a lot what we are growing.</p>
          <p>You see the high level of interest rate that we still have in Brazil not great condition to imagine that we can create a bubble but if you assume that about more than 90% of our portfolio for individuals are fixed rate, there is no reason to imagine that we don't need to change the rate for the clients going forward unless we have a change. Again, we can have problems with delinquency if you change, revert the cycle, positive cycle, yes we can have, but not because we are creating bubble a thing like this.</p>
          <p>I think there is many, many arguments that we can give you to explain why we are confident really that there is no bubble at present and there is no condition to create that, it's important to say, right. But to say, in terms of mortgage portfolio, know that in Brazil we have only 4% of GDP penetration. We are very consistent in the parts to approve credit and we are growing this portfolio, yes, but we are very, very conservative in the way that we are growing. We don't finance more than 80% of the price of the house and the market value to the house. But in average,what we are doing is 65%. So, it's not a comparable situation in Brazil the situation that we have in other places to assume that we are creating a bubble. Right?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for the opportunity. I actually have a couple of questions. The first one is related to the insurance business. You saw a pretty big bump in the level of premiums sold in this quarter. I know you went through it and you increased basically your outlook for the end of the year. Could you give us some more color on how that's going to come? If we're really going to continue to see the strong growth that we saw in premiums sold? Particularly on the life side, which increased 35% quarter-on-quarter?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to the provisions on the civil litigation that were non-recurring once again. I was just wondering if we're close to an end to that, what's the expectation? I know the window for that closes soon. I was just wondering if you could give us some color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Carlos, just a minute I need to have a brief discussion with our people for insurance to give an idea. I just talk about the provision, civil provision for &#x2013; or civil &#x2013; for economic plans. I think we are now in the &#x2013; we just have some, let's say, some adjustment in provision. We do not have a big movement. We don't expect to have a big movement going forward. But you know that we are in the middle of the discussion in the courts, the high courts, and we have more, let's say, if you ask me now, if we have expectations to have deterioration in our situation in this process, I would say that we are more optimistic that we can have some good news in these front that bad news going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you mean possibly reverting the provisions that have already been made or just stop making new provisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say that, but it will depend, obviously, if we have a rather huge amount of provisions that you know that all the processes are, let's say, stopped, waiting for the decision of the courts. If the decision was in the good direction, yes we can revert. But again, what's important to say that we don't expect to have more discussion going forward. Not other &#x2013; more people came to complain about that because we are at the finish the time of our people to complain. Just a minute to tell you about insurance here.</p>
          <p>Okay, Carlos. I will try to tell everything they've told me. Look, what we are seeing a very, very good perspective in the market, better than they have, in all different segments. We see that we are growing in all the different segments that we are present. And we also tell just one reason why we have this &#x2013; we still have economy growing in relatively good way. We have SMEs companies that are developed that really creating a new market for insurance business, that we are taking advantage of this. And there it's always important to emphasize a very strong structures of, let's say, sales force that we have in insurance, that is really, that has been presented very good, they are performing very well. So we are, let's say, comfortable to increase the guidance that we gave, that's why. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my call &#x2013; my question. A couple of questions, the more big picture, Domingos. First, can you &#x2013; I &#x2013; can you comment a little bit about Bradesco's M&amp;A strategy? Obviously you have been linked recently to specific things in the press and obviously you can't comment on specific items. But there has been talk that the Central Bank would like some of the small &#x2013; smaller banks who may have issues around liquidity and may have issues around changing accounting and capital requirements to sell and to link up with larger banks. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy with regards to M&amp;A and potential non-organic growth opportunities you may see?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on monetary policy &#x2013; just your views on monetary policies and the possibility of more macro-prudential measures related to banks, it &#x2013; with inflationary pressures still there and the currency as strong as it is, the moves yesterday on derivatives, I'm just curious if you have an update in terms of what you &#x2013; how you're seeing the regulators look at the possibility of using macro-prudential policies as a way to ensure financial stability and potentially even for monetary policy reasons?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Saul, thanks for the question. Okay, we have a strategy to grow and our main strategy is to grow organically of course, but if we have opportunities of growth in Brazil, we are being awake to see that. We will be &#x2013; we understand that we will have opportunities to continue to have the new partnership with retailers for example in the credit card business, so we will be awake for these opportunities.</p>
          <p>We have this opportunity like we had last &#x2013; to buy, for example, some payroll fund stakes, like we had in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:20) last year and Rio de Janeiro now, saw some opportunities that we have. It's a combination of kind of M&amp;A and organic growth, because when we plan to buy a payroll, we need to sometimes to reforce some place to grow in these places organically too. But we have been awake for this situation.</p>
          <p>We don't see &#x2013; what to say about small banks? Unless &#x2013; when we see these opportunities, we see that &#x2013; we see if we can add more scale for us it's good, it's a good reason to see. Or if you have &#x2013; you are &#x2013; let's say if you buy a new, let's say, expertise in different business, that we are not there. We cannot see any &#x2013; want to analyze the small banks for our perspective. We don't see any of this situation that can give us some let's say position that we can imagine. We are not seeing any opportunities on this front for us, right.</p>
          <p>In terms of monetary policy, let's say that what we are observing that our economy is in the way that the Central Bank wants it to be going. We have a deceleration in the growth, in the growth prospects. You have &#x2013; we understand that there is no need of other macro-prudential measures, because, in fact, I think we are observing some convergence of &#x2013; to the inflation for the next year than what the Central Bank are looking for. There is no need of others, but again we cannot say that we won't have, it will depend on the evolution of the data that we have. For what we are seeing in our economy, we don't see any direction.</p>
          <p>The macro that we mentioned is that we had yesterday, it was another direction, right, it's a different direction, not only to &#x2013; in order to deal with inflation but in order to deal with the FX rate. I think there is a concern in the government that our FX rate is &#x2013; the real is too strong, when you compare it to dollar, for example, and could give some industry. Brazil is losing their competitive condition, so they are looking for that, so in &#x2013; is a different matter, macro, it is important to separate macro-prudential for like we had in the last &#x2013; at the end of last year, when they &#x2013; for example, when they increased the reserve requirements and they require more capital for different lines of business. This matter that we had yesterday was in other direction, right.</p>
          <p>So think about a macro-prudential in the sense of macro-prudential that it is to avoid the creation of any possible bubble like that. We are not seeing the necessity to have. And to control inflation, we are not seeing at the moment any reason to have a new one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any indirect impact of the moves yesterday, either in your prop desk or in terms of making it more expensive to hedge your foreign currency risk of the higher tax on derivatives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, we need to see all the different angles of the matter to understand it, but in general terms I could tell you that we are not so, let's say, so exposed in FX rate. Normally, we know that we have cost of &#x2013; to rather position like that. You can change a little bit but you have other alternatives to make that will be analyzed, that is why it is difficult for us to give a sense. In general terms, I'd say that it's not --for us, for Bradesco, it's not for our clients, right? For us, I don't think it has a significant impact in our numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Mr. Mario Pierry from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everybody. Let me ask you two questions, Abreu. Let me go back also to the asset quality a little bit more. First, we're clearly seeing, right, the bank growing slower than the industry on the individual loan portfolio. So, I would like to understand, why &#x2013; what are you seeing that the rest of the market is not seeing. And, if you have been tightening your credit granting standards, in individual loans, if you can give us an idea, what is your approval rating today and what it was, let's say, six months ago or one year ago?</p>
          <p>And, then the second question, I think you mentioned during your presentation that you have made a change in credit card delinquency criteria. I would like to understand that and to understand if that is at all related with the increasing in renegotiations of credit card loans? I think we were doing some calculations here. We are estimating you were renegotiating about 4.5% of your credit card loans and about a year ago you were renegotiating 3%. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure if I understood your last point but let me tell you about, I will check if <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:25) approval. I don't &#x2013; I wouldn't take a risk to say that we are seeing different than the market are seeing, Mario, but what we continue, you know that we don't have a specific movement and say now we need to tighten our model like that because we of that. Our policy is to improve our models every day. We understand that with credit we are not in the way that now we can be to lease more models or not, right?</p>
          <p>All the times we are looking. We need to expect, even though we have considered individuals are long-term commitments, we need to be conservative all the time, right? We &#x2013; let me check if I have the approval rates. Okay. Sorry, we don't have the approval but certainly it's reduced but not because we are different. It's probably because once we have increased interest rates, it's normal that the base of possible clients tends to have deterioration because the mass of good clients tends to be away &#x2013; out of the market during the period when you have high level of interest rate. That's why it's normal to have a reduction in approval, right?</p>
          <p>I don't know if I answered your question correctly but for this, we don't have this number. We will check if we have that. We can give the number later. In terms of the credit card change, I don't know if I understood your point &#x2013; your last point but I will tell you what we did, right? Remember that in the &#x2013; at the end of last year, we have migration of card portfolio to another system, right? Our previous system, we were not be able to &#x2013; wouldn't have, for example, cards when you have &#x2013; you know that we have some side business in the card when people buy, for example, in ten installments in the card, right?</p>
          <p>In the previous program or the previous system that we have, it was &#x2013; it wasn't &#x2013; we couldn't see when we have, for example, you stopped paying the first installment. We just considered this one installment, we didn't consider the nine that we have together because we didn't have position in the system to have that.</p>
          <p>The new system, we are able to have that, so that's why the difference that we have now. When you have a situation like that, if you stop paying, we consider all the commitments that we with me &#x2013; and not only the one that we have done. This makes this &#x2013; we understand we have &#x2013; we're going to have this portfolio in cards. We see that we have the only portfolio that we have a growth in delinquencies. That's why we saw that we expect this is not the only because we have the deterioration in the situation, in terms of delinquencies, but we have this change in the model.</p>
          <p>Two, I'll try to resume what the impact of this, to have an idea before. It used to take, let's say, 18 months to have a total provision in one credit like that, and now we have 12 months to have that. So, we've reduced the time that we have. In other words, we are capturing, the delinquency ahead, right? We didn't change any part in terms of negotiation of credit cards, anything, it's just things that we are &#x2013; the way that we are capturing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, that's very clear. So you're being more conservative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This one &#x2013; let's say, to be honest, it's more &#x2013; it's &#x2013; let's say, it's more correct if you ask me why didn't this business before, I'd say this business &#x2013; is a business that has been growing in the market. We are in the process to build the new system. So there is no reason to change one system, while you are building another one. So we have an expectation really to have this improvement sooner, that's why we didn't have that. But to be honest now we are more correct, let's say. If...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that is more conservative than we had before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>. And what about the credit card renegotiations? Are you seeing any &#x2013; a pick-up in renegotiations of credit card balances?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But other credit cards &#x2013; as I mentioned, we did not change any policy in terms of negotiation in anything. And we are, as I mentioned too, we saw all the portfolio that we have in terms of the delinquency. We know that it's a matter that is a concern to everyone. And we saw all the lines of business, you see any change in terms of delinquency, the short-term delinquency in the more than 90 days, we see any changes in lines like normally the market likes to see, like overdraft for example. But we didn't see it. The only portfolio, again, that there was a deterioration of delinquency was in credit cards. And we understand the biggest part of the deterioration because it's changes in the model, not because we are seeing any different movements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But we have &#x2013; we have expectation that we can have a new movement of delinquency to increase delinquency here because in credit cards, because we are increasing the minimum payment growth going forward. So, it certainly will bring a new change in the delinquency level for credit cards. But again, it's something that you would have in the future that you will bring back &#x2013; bring to the present, let's say. We are accelerating this process, but that's being that we are &#x2013; in other words, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (60:33) of losses continued the same. But maybe you see it in a different moment of the &#x2013; we are accelerating the process, let's say.</p>

          <p>Most of my questions have been answered, but I want to talk about Basel III regulation. Do you have any update that you could share with us, regarding any new developments between the conversations you might have had with the Central Bank, regarding the guidelines that were published in February of this year?</p>
          <p>I understand &#x2013; I still got the other questions regarding the treatment of the insurance business, I think you had previously indicated about the R$6 billion impact. Has that changed and also do you see any, let's say, upside &#x2013; versus the guidelines that were provided in February in terms of the treatment of tax credits? For instance, if you could give us some color on that, I would appreciate it. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Marcelo, we didn't have any changes. The only thing that we have is that Central Bank direction that they gave us, the schedule that they have. We didn't have any change on that. I want to give that, let's say, exercise in February, last February. We understood that it was the worst scenario that we could have. We have &#x2013; we didn't have any direction with the Central Bank yet, but for what we are seeing in the global environment, then we will see &#x2013; what they want to plan in the Basel III. We have expectations to have some release here too, right? So we cannot, to that number &#x2013; we didn't change any assumption in that exercise that we made because it was again, we understood it was the worst scenario that we could have, to have &#x2013; from that we, personally have expectations to have more release than to have more tightening in this process, we understand. But again, we don't have any to be direct to your point. Since then, we didn't have any direction, any movement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thank you. And just if you'll allow me one more question. I mean, regarding your SME strategy, did you feel the need lately, I mean to be a little bit more conservative in, let's say, in the lower end of the SME segment and maybe focus a little bit on the high end? We've heard from some of your competitors that they might be &#x2013; they were a little bit worried about the low end side and trying to focus on not such small businesses. Is that the case for you or business as usual? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we are, as I always like to mention that we are conservative and we are, let's say, if I can put that also carefully with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (64:09) all the time, right? In SME segment, it's important to emphasize that we know that we are making improvements in our segmentation process and the way to understand it, you have space to capture more that we have capturing so far in this market, right? That's why we have been able to grow with the same &#x2013; keeping the same level of risk. We are not seeing any movement. So it's a market that we work with certainly the biggest part of the portfolio we have some collateral. We work all the time so that's why we are comfortable to continue to work in the same business as usual.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Ms. Regina Sanchez from Ita&#xFA;.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. My question is, again, about asset quality. We are noting that some difference between &#x2013; and the NPL ratio trends among the large cap banks. What would you consider the reasons to see a better trend after this? So you think it would the lower mix or a good underwriting policy or geographic propositioning to capture better asset quality clients?</p>
          <p>And then more specific, on slide number 16 of the presentation, you showed an increase in the 15 to 90-days NPL ratio for companies of 30 basis points differently from the system, which showed a decline of 10 basis points. I know this is consistent, it is not the overall portfolio, it's consistent with what the Central Bank released. But what could justify this difference? I mean the lower mix in the corporate segment is changing inside Bradesco. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Regina, because it &#x2013; we really need to explain that. First of all, it's very difficult for us to compare &#x2013; or with our competitors, because it is very difficult for us to see exactly where they are going more. So we understand this is more kind of mix, right? We know that we are improving our models for the times that we are good models for developing our business, that we are improving our operation, yes, we know that. But I assume that they are doing the same, All right? We can &#x2013; we must &#x2013; we tend to think that the difference is exactly the mix. Maybe they are growing more in the more risk portfolios that's why they have &#x2013; they could have this change.</p>
          <p>In our case, in particular, the corporate &#x2013; just one single  thing to consider about delinquency for 15 to 90-days. Sometimes we have a big client, a large corporate to &#x2013; just want to have a specific client, that we have &#x2013; sometimes we have &#x2013; they keep &#x2013; you have need to replace some contracts like that. Sometimes we have this situation. But, let's say, it's not something that will be the &#x2013; if you discount only this one single case that we mention, our rating should be make this exercise, we made this exercise, our ratio to be 2.8%. In other words, to be stable at the same level that we don't have these changes. That today is not to be all about this.</p>
