          <p>Good morning. My name is Demetrice and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter and Year-To-Date Operating Results for FY '11. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Demetrice. Good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our third quarter 2011 operating results for the 12 weeks ended May 8th.</p>
          <p>As with every conference call, I'll start by saying that the discussions we've having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And that these statements involved risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.</p>
          <p>The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks as notified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>To begin with, our 12-week third quarter operating results for the quarter, our reported EPS came in at $0.73 a share, up 7% from last year's reported Q3 EPS of $0.68. As I'll discuss in more detail in a moment both this year's and last year's results and a comparison of these results, each included one item of note, which we outlined in the press release. They include the following: first, last year in Q3 our SG&amp;A line was reduced or benefited by a $14 million pre-tax reversal as part of a charge related to a Canadian tax liability so a one-time $0.02 per share benefit was included in last year's reported earnings. Second, this year in Q3, as you saw in the release, we had a pre-tax LIFO charge of $49 million pre-tax or $0.07 a share.</p>
          <p>As I indicated in the previous quarter's earnings call, inflation clearly is back and to expect LIFO charges at least for this quarter and the next and who knows. So the $0.73 reported Q3 EPS number includes a $0.07 per share charge for LIFO. In Q3 last year, and in fact all four quarters last fiscal year, there were no LIFO charges. I'll speak a little bit more about LIFO when I review with you our gross margin in a moment.</p>
          <p>We continued to benefit a bit this year in Q3 from FX tailwinds, our foreign operations earnings results when converted and reported into US dollars helped us this year by a little over $14 million or $0.02 a share. That's assuming that FX exchange rates were flat year-over-year. With the dollar weakening relative to many of the foreign currencies in the countries in which we operate, that's been a benefit to our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned in each of the last two earnings &#x2013; quarterly earnings conference calls, effective at the start of this fiscal year, back in September, we began consolidating the results of our operations of our Mexico venture. Historically, these operations had been treated as an equity method investment, thus we only reported our 50% share of the joint ventures net income within non-operating interest income and other line item on our income statement. Since the first quarter of this fiscal year we were required to adopt a new accounting standard, which makes it appropriate to fully consolidate the Mexico joint venture operations into our statements.</p>
          <p>So in effect, it adds about 3% to the top line sales as well as to assets and liabilities. 100% of the venture's financial statements are now included in our P&amp;L and balance sheet and cash flow. And then the 50% portion held by our joint venture partner is backed out at the bottom of our income statement to offset it, such that there's no net effect to our bottom line or earnings per share, but it does change some of the percentages, and we will, as we've done in each of the last two quarters, point that out to you. The discussion of gross margin, SG&amp;A, basis points and of course the interest income and other line we'll talk about.</p>
          <p>In all, as we go through these numbers, we look at our Q3 results, the sales have improved, membership renewals continue strong and new signups as well, and as I'll discuss in the next 20 or so minutes, our underlying margin expense percentage are continuing in the right direction. Further, we've got a lot of new openings coming up planned for Q4 '11 and into fiscal '12.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales for the 12-week quarter, reported sales were up 16% and our 12-week reporting comparable sales figure was up 12%. For the quarter both the sales and the comp sales were positively impacted by both gasoline price inflation and by the strengthening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year.</p>
          <p>On a comp sales basis, the 10% U.S. sales increase in Q3, excluding gas inflation, would have been up six. The reported 18% international comp figure assuming flat year-over-year FX rates would have been up 11%. So in local currencies our foreign operations were up 11% on a comp basis. And total company comps, again we reported a 12%, but excluding those two items, gas inflation and excluding FX changes, it would have been up 7% for the company overall in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Other topics of interest I'll review, our opening activities and plans. We opened one new location in Q3, that's in Tucson, Arizona, actually our third Tucson location. We also had two temporarily closed locations occur in Q3 due to the Japan earthquake. One in Makuhari reopened last week on May 20th, and the other in Tamasakai, which was more heavily damaged, which is scheduled to reopen in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal '12 this fall. In Q4 we expect to open a total of 12 locations including the Makuhari reopening and one relocation. At Q3 end we operated 580 locations worldwide. Assuming our Q4 openings go as planned, we'll end fiscal year '11 with 592 locations worldwide, up 20 from the beginning of the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Also this morning I'll talk about our expansion plans for '12 a little bit, our online results, our membership, a little bit of discussion of course about margins and SG&amp;A, which many of you have already prewritten about those are the things that you guys want to know as well, an update on our stock buyback activities and of course we recently announced a dividend increase and new stock repurchase authorization going forward for the next four years.</p>
          <p>So on to the discussion of the results. Sales for the quarter, again, were $20.2 billion, up 16% from last year's $17.4 billion. Again, comps on a reported basis were up 12%. The 12% third quarter comp, while not an exact month-to-month but on our monthly reports of February, March and April, we had an 8% in February, a 13% in March and a 12% in April in terms of comp sales. So the 8%, 13% and 12%, excluding gas, inflation and FX would have been a 5%, 8% and 7%, so March and April certainly higher than previous recent months and previous recent quarters by a couple or three percentage points. The 12% reported comp was positively impacted by a little over 1.5% due to year-over-year strengthening of foreign currencies, and as I mentioned, our international comps just looking at international not total company, the FX impact was 7 percentage points the reported 18% would have been an 11% on a local currency basis.</p>
          <p>Gasoline had a big impact, not only on sales, of course, but on how we &#x2013; on the percentages that we calculate for margin and SG&amp;A and the like and again, I'll talk about that in a minute. For the quarter our 12% reported comp results were a combination of an average transaction increase of just under 7% for the quarter and an average frequency increase of nearly 5%. The frequency trend during the past three months of February, March and April were plus four, plus five, plus four.</p>
          <p>These frequency figures, by the way, are on top of a little more than 3.5% frequency increase during the fourth quarter a year ago. I think part of it is the continuing focus on our strength in food and sundries and fresh goods, as well as gasoline. Not in terms of inflation but in fact because of the high gas prices and it's very much top of the mind, we're seeing a lot more gallonage comp increase as well, not just price increases, but gallonage comps. Our gallonage comps in Q3 were up 16%. That compares to the low to mid-single digit typical numbers that we've seen in prior good times.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region for the quarter, California, Midwest, Southeast and Texas were the strongest. Internationally in local currencies, again, we continue to do quite well, up in the low double digits in local currency. Korea and Japan were the strongest and U.K. showing some good life. As you know, U.K. local currency for the last couple years has been positive but just slightly positive. It was up 6% in local currency in the third quarter. And Canada's comp sales figures in local currency continue strong. Their economy has been quite robust the last couple years and after an 8% local currency comp in all of fiscal year '10, we've seen 8%, 5% and 8% in the last three quarters in '11. So Canada has been a good economy for us.</p>
          <p>In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, within food and sundries every sub category but tobacco was positive in Q3. The positive sub categories ranging from a plus 5% to a plus 16%. I would add a 2.5% hard lines comp, the strongest sub categories were sporting goods, HABA, health and beauty aids, lawn and garden and tires, electronics being the laggard, as we've talked about before. And typically in electronics you're seeing up units and depreciating average selling prices. Within the soft lines comp, which is in the high single digits, housewares, small electrics and jewelry were stand outs, and within fresh foods, positive low double digits. All sub fresh food categories were positive, each in the high single digits and low teens comp range.</p>
          <p>I mentioned that Japan was one of the stronger foreign local currency comp sales countries. We are constantly asked questions from you guys and others about what's going on there since the tragedy in early March. As you know, our Japan operations we opened our first location in April of '99, and we opened our ninth location in July of '09. And so on March 11th when the major earthquake hit followed, of course, by the tsunami and the aftershocks and all the other issues going on, we had nine locations in operation. Tragically, two members were killed when a parking ramp collapsed at our Tamasakai warehouse.</p>
          <p>With the earthquake, two locations were closed, ultimately closed for repair, one of which I mentioned has since reopened last week, Makuhari. And the other one, Tamasakai, which was the more heavily damaged one was planned to reopen in November. In addition, four additional Japan locations, new locations, are planned to be opened between now and November. So hopefully, God willing, by the end of November we'll have 13 locations operating in Japan. Two of those, by the way, were delayed from the July/August timeframe given the earthquake and the issues with supply of certain construction items.</p>
          <p>Japan has certainly been a growing, profitable, significant pro warehouse membership base operation for us. The recent tragedy that has struck Japan and its people, it's &#x2013; despite this tragedy, we have been able to continue the flow of product, I think, in some cases, as well if not better than some retailers in the country because of our ability to get in containers and distribute through that process.</p>
          <p>I'm proud to say that during the &#x2013; subsequent to the tragedy, as we've done in a couple of other things around the world, I'm sure many other companies do this as well, we've used the benefit of our members through the cash register to make donations to the Japan relief effort. And over just a couple of week period, we &#x2013; through our members, raised a little over $5 million that was passed on to the various in-country Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies designated for the Japan relief efforts. Lastly, we're asked about the issues' impact financial on the company &#x2013; on Costco; very minor reserves taken for losses associated with the earthquake. Those of course, the reserves were taken net of anticipated insurance coverage and they were not significant.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the income statement line items. In Q3, our membership was $435 million, up 10% or up $40 million from $395 million a year ago. That represented a year-over-year percentage-wise, an 11 basis point decline as a percent of sales. Excluding FX, again, the weak dollar has made all the foreign countries' numbers bigger. Instead of being up 10% and $40 million, it was up 9% and $33 million on a local currency basis. Of course, the percentage would be the same: 11 basis points down. As you'll see, the 9% dollar increase is a result of what I'll show you in a minute, the continued stronger renewals and strong new sign-ups during the quarter.</p>
          <p>At year end &#x2013; I'm sorry, at Q3 end, we had 24.3 million Gold Star members, up from 23.9 million at the previous quarter end. We had 6.3 million primary business members, rounding to the same number from a quarter ago. We had just under 3.9 million business add-ons, a total of 34.4 million households and including spouse cards, 62.6 million, up from the previous quarter at 62.0 million. At third quarter end on May 8th, our paid executive member base was a little more than 11.3 million, an increase of about 350,000 or 3% since &#x2013; from 12 weeks prior at Q2 end, so on a weekly basis, we increased the executive member rolls by 29,000 a week. We consider those quite good results in terms of continuing to convert people to the membership, which needless to say, they tend to on average, buy more and are more loyal. Executive members represent roughly a third of our worldwide membership base and about two-thirds of our sales.</p>
          <p>In terms of membership renewal rates, at Q3 end, business renewal rate was 93.2%, up a couple of tenths from Q2 end. Gold Star, 88.0%, up about 0.3% from Q2 end at 87.7%. So the total was 89.1% up from an 88.8% at Q2 end. In the last couple of quarters, we've &#x2013; these numbers historically had always been U.S. and Canada because the newer foreign countries, you have much lower rates to start with in the first few years. Worldwide, our number at Q3 end was 86.0%, up 0.2% from 85.8% at the Q2 end.</p>
          <p>Last point with regard to memberships, effective with our mailing to the March renewers, we increased our business add-on annual fee in the U.S. and Canada from $40 to $50. Historically, a primary business member was $50 and they could have, I believe, up to six add-on members, typically employees, family members, whatever. Separate memberships, but under the primary business membership. Historically, those were $10 less or $40 compared to the normal $50, and again, starting with the March renewers over the course from March to next February with renewal notices, those add-ons will be $50 instead of $40. No issue relating to the first couple months of that in terms of any major issues with our members.</p>
          <p>Of the 3.4 million or whatever number I gave you on the business add-ons &#x2013; I'm sorry 3.9 million, 2.6 million add-ons are in the U.S. and Canada, so roughly a little over $25 million in increased annual fees. Please note that this increase will flow into the income statement over about a 23-month period beginning in March of this year. I'll give you a quick example. Just doing simple math, assuming the 2.6 million were roughly one-twelfth a month, it's a little over 200,000, but if you assume there were 200,000 add-ons were March renewers, so in February they got their renewal notice, and assuming that they all pay their $10 increase in March, this incremental $2 million would flow into the fee income line essentially one-twelfth a month for 12 months starting in March through next February.</p>
          <p>With an approximate 200,000 April renewers, the same thing, that incremental $2 million will flow in over a 12-month period beginning in April through the following March, and so on. And this is due of course to our deferred revenue recognition accounting for membership fees. So a very, very nominal amount of the Q3 membership fees, essentially one-twelfth or so or one-twelfth or two-twelfths or so of the March renewers and one-twelfth of the April. Not a big deal so far.</p>
          <p>Going down the gross margin line, reported gross margin last year in the quarter was at 10.88%. This year it was 10.50%. So on a reported basis, down 38 basis points. I'll ask you to do a little matrix with four columns. The columns will be Q1 '11, Q2 '11, Q3 '11, and the last column will be Q3 '11 adjusted for gas inflation so without gas inflation. And that column simply reduces the sales denominator not by any gallonage improvement but by just taking last year's third quarter average gasoline price per gallon that we sold it at and assuming that was the price per gallon we sold it at for this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>As you can see, I'll just go through the line items, the first would be merchandising core; second, ancillary businesses, third, 2% reward; fourth LIFO, the fifth line item is total; and I'll add two additional line items, the impact that Mexico had on our margin, and as you'll see in a minute, our SG&amp;A, and then the last line item would be without Mexico.</p>
          <p>So going across our merchandising core in Q1 '11, year-over-year, was up 19 basis points; in Q2 '11, up 24; in Q3 '11, down 14; in Q3 '11, adjusted for gas inflation &#x2013; excluding gas inflation, up 17. Ancillary: minus 9, minus 5, minus 3 in Q3 '11 and plus 2 without gas inflation. 2% reward: minus 1, minus 1, plus 3 and zero. LIFO: zero, minus 3, minus 24 and minus 25.</p>
          <p>You might ask why there's another basis point in the last column versus the next to last column, it's simply because the denominator sales has been reduced because we took out gas inflation. So all told, the reported gross margin year-over-year in Q1 '11 versus Q1 '10 was up 9 basis points; in Q2 '11 up 15 year-over-year; in Q3 '11 on a reported basis down 38; and again adjusted down 6.</p>
          <p>Mexico, again as we consolidate these numbers, and by definition since these are pluses here, the gross margin is a little bit higher, plus 3 basis points, plus 6, plus 3 and plus 3. And without Mexico, the plus 9 would have been a plus 6 therefore; the plus 15 in Q2 reported would have been a plus 9 excluding Mexico's benefit; the minus 38 would be a minus 41; and the minus 6 would have been a minus 9.</p>
          <p>Now keep in mind, without inflation, the minus 6 and minus 9, the reported minus 6, still includes the hit of 25 basis points related to the LIFO charge.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, our overall reported gross margin was lower by 38. Again, the big impact was the &#x2013; the two big impacts were the gas price inflation and the $49 million LIFO charge.</p>
          <p>So let me go through this. Within the 38 basis point reported figure, our core merchandising gross margin was minus 14; in ancillary business, as I mentioned, was minus 3. Our Gas business, and it's currently higher level of price inflation, it really impacts these margin comparisons. Sales penetration of our higher-margin core business was down over 2 percentage points in Q3 from a little under 81% a year ago to 78%, whereas sales penetration at our ancillary businesses was up 2.6 percentage points. And within that 2.6, in fact gasoline was up 3 percentage points.</p>
          <p>So while standalone gross margins of our Core Merchandise business, and I talked about core as being food and sundries, hard lines, soft lines and fresh foods, they were higher year-over-year in Q3 by 19 basis points. The core's aggregate lower sales penetration, however, caused the year-over-year increases to show this minus 14 that you see in the chart. So the underlying businesses, the margins are doing fine and were up 19 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. That's food and sundries margins on food and sundry sales, hard lines margins on hard line sales, soft line and fresh foods as well.</p>
          <p>The Merchandise category gross margin increase year-over-year in Q3 was strongest in hard lines followed by Food and Sundries. Fresh Foods margins were up slightly in Q3 compared to these being down slightly in Q2 year-over-year. All in all I think it continued a good showing in our core gross margin.</p>
          <p>The impact upon executive membership showed a benefit of three basis points that would reflect a slightly declining sales penetration of rewardable sales. Again it's gas. With the gas price inflation, gas, tobacco and alcohol are non-rewardable items and given the gasoline sales penetration is up dramatically in the quarter year-over-year that's caused that impact.</p>
          <p>In terms of LIFO, as I mentioned, again a quarter ago in early March in the earnings conference call, inflation is clearly back. And we did expect and now did realize more in Q3. We saw quite a bit of inflationary pricing pressures, again beginning in late Q2 and into Q3. And we're seeing some more in Q4 so far. One possible caveat to the LIFO charge in Q4. Keep in mind the $49 million Q3 charge included about $11 million from gasoline price inflation alone. Since Q3 end, gasoline prices have come down the last couple of weeks, but that certainly does not &#x2013; certainly we have no way of knowing what tomorrow's inflation or deflation will be.</p>
          <p>Also as I've mentioned before and as I'm sure you guys all know with regard to LIFO, you guys all know it's a book charge to our cost of sales and in fact results in positive cash flow savings through the reduced income taxes as the company's on a tax LIFO basis.</p>
          <p>So now after taking all this margin information into account, I think the easiest way to summarize Q3 '11 over Q3 '10 gross margin is by looking at the right-most column of the matrix we just drew. Excluding gas price inflation, year-over-year in Q3 our core merchandising gross margin ex-LIFO was up 17 basis points. And so those trends so far have been in our view pretty good.</p>
          <p>Moving to the reported SG&amp;A, our SG&amp;A percentage year-over-year was lower or better by 43 basis points coming in at 9.86% of sales compared to 10.29% a year ago. Again the same impact; you've got a much bigger-than-average denominator in terms of sales that's impacted by gas price inflation more than anything. In terms of &#x2013; let me give you your chart here. Again four columns. The same four columns: Q1 '11, Q2 '11, Q3 '11, and Q3 '11 without gas inflation. The line items are core operations, central, stock compensation, quarterly adjustments, total and the two items below the total, the impact of Mexico and then the total without that impact.</p>
          <p>Going across and plus numbers here are good meaning lower year-over-year SG&amp;A basis points. In terms of core operations: in Q1 '11 year-over-year it was plus 17 basis points; in Q2 plus 13; in Q3, plus 46; excluding gas inflation it was plus 20. So still better by 20 but I think that's a fairer way to look at it than the plus 46.</p>
          <p>Central: Plus 1, minus 2, plus 3 and plus 1. Stock compensation: plus 1, plus 1, plus 2, plus 1. Quarterly adjustments: zero, plus 12; minus 8 and minus 8. Now again that minus 8 is the $14 million reversal of a Canadian tax liability a year ago with no compensating benefit to this year's SG&amp;A. So total reported year-over-year SG&amp;A comparison plus 19 or lower by 19 in Q1 year-over-year, plus 24 in Q2, plus 43 in Q3 and adjusted for gasoline inflation, plus 13.</p>
          <p>Mexico had a &#x2013; again, like with margin, it has lower SG&amp;A percentages than the company overall. So now that we're consolidating that helps those reported numbers I just mentioned. The Mexico impact was plus 7; plus 11; plus 6 and plus 7. So again, without Mexico impact: plus 12; plus 13; plus 37; and plus 6.</p>
          <p>A little editorial on these numbers, again in terms of Q3 '11 column with gas inflation, again it was a reported 43 basis point improvement. I think a more meaningful way to look at this is to look at Q3 SG&amp;A in the last column without gas inflation. Looking at this column, you can see the following: again, core operations was lower or better by 20 basis points year-over-year.</p>
          <p>I might add that both payroll and healthcare costs as a percent of sales contributed to this improvement; 11%, 11 basis points of the 20 basis points was improved warehouse payroll percentage. And four basis points was improved total benefits percentage, which I think is the first time we've had an underlying improvement there. We're still growing at a decent amount, but so are top line sales, even excluding gas inflation.</p>
          <p>Our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:45) expense was lower year-over-year or better by a basis point, as was stock compensation. Not a whole lot to explain there. Quarterly adjusted I mentioned to you. So overall we think a pretty good performance in SG&amp;A trend wise. We continue to work hard, and we're seeing some of the fruits of focusing even more so on SG&amp;A. Sales certainly help as well of course.</p>
          <p>Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pre-opening expense last year was $3 million. This year it was $8 million, so two basis points higher. We only had one opening in each of the quarters. The big difference, there really was no surprises, the big difference the big dollar delta if you will, year-over-year was about $4 million in international pre-opening costs in this year's Q3. Those are for openings scheduled in either Q4 or Q1, and as I mentioned we had a couple of delays of openings that were planned in July or August in Japan that were moved into the fall as well as two additional ones that were planned for the fall. So if those were alone, we're seeing the pre-opening costs, particularly those first two that were delayed in the quarter.</p>
          <p>I mentioned we've got a number of locations, a much larger number of locations planned for Q4 and into Q1 of '12, and I'll point that out in a moment. In terms of provision for asset impairment and closing costs, last year we had charges totaling $3 million per quarter compared to a charge of $1 million this year, not a big deal either way. All told operating income in Q3 was up $66 million or 13% from $490 million last year in the quarter to $556 million this year. Recall, please remember that the $66 million operating income increase was impacted by the $14 million expense reversal last year that benefited last year's Q3 earnings and by the $49 million LIFO charge this year that reduced this year's Q3 operating earnings.</p>
          <p>Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was essentially the same year-over-year coming in $27 million. These amounts mainly reflect the interest expense on our $2 billion debt offering that we did in February of '07. $900 million of that debt, by the way, will be, it was five-year debt and will become due in March of '12. We'll basically cut a check for it and see the earnings improvement from reducing interest expense to a greater level than improving &#x2013; than causing us a little reduced interest income from the use of that cash.</p>
          <p>Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $5 million, $5 million this year a number on the line item versus $10 million a year ago. So lower by $5 million. Actual interest income was higher this year in Q3 by about $6 million, a reflection of both higher cash balances and a little higher interest rate as we had actually locked in some still safe but higher than ordinary 0% interest income rates in preparation for paying that March debt payment.</p>
          <p>Offsetting this positive variance of $6 million and the actual interest income was $11 million variance related primarily to the consolidation of Mexico's investment income in our financial statements. In the current year, as I mentioned, 100% of Mexico's results are fully consolidated into each line item of our income statement. Previously like last year, the joint venture partners' 50% share was just added to interest income and other. So last year you had the benefit of the earnings of Costco Mexico's quarterly earnings. This year you have no benefit there and it's spread out everywhere else.</p>
          <p>So overall pre-tax income was up 13% on reported basis for $474 million last year to $534 million. Again, the two impacts I won't repeat, but they're in the press release. You can look at those as well.</p>
          <p>Income tax rate, our company tax rate this quarter came in 36.1% versus 34.5% last year. So about 1.6% points higher year-over-year in the quarter. Last year's tax rate, actually as I mentioned last year, had a couple of positive discrete items that helped lower the rate a bit. This year there are a couple of negative discrete items that hit it or increased our effective tax rate a bit. No big deal either way, it happens every quarter, but again a higher tax rate this year compared to last.</p>
          <p>A quick rundown of other topics. The balance sheet along with some other pertinent information will be in the supplement that is posted, will be posted shortly after the call. We have, as you know, quite a strong balance sheet. Some of you always ask since we don't include the cash flow statement until the 10-Q, what depreciation and amortization was for Q3? In Q3 it was $196 million, and year to date through Q3 depreciation and amortization was $582 million.</p>
          <p>Another metric that many of us and you look at are accounts payable as a percent of inventories, how much of our trade payables are being funded by &#x2013; how much of our inventories are being funded by trade payables. On a reported basis the number is over 100% &#x2013; in Q3 it was 106% compared to 108% a year ago. In that table, though, is not just merchandise payables, it also includes construction payables and again we've got 12 or so openings coming in the next quarter so there's, as you might expect, quite a bit of payable in there. If you take out that and just look at merchandise payables and merchandise inventories, the number a year ago was 90% of our inventories would be funded with trade payables up 1% to 91% in Q3 of this year.</p>
          <p>Average inventory per warehouse last year at Q3 end it was $10.336 million a warehouse. This year at Q3 end it was $11 million, right at $11 million. So up about $640,000 or 6%. Again, that number is impacted greatly by the FX. If you had FX, assumed FX with no impact from a year ago the same currency from a year ago, that $642,000 per warehouse higher figure would be $388,000 or about 3.8% higher year-over-year. And the increase is, of course, spread through many merchandise categories. There's no one category &#x2013; it ranged from like $20,000 to $60,000 per subcategory. Some of that's inflation, some of that's a little higher inventory but really no inventory concerns on our part.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx in Q3 we spent $139 million last year. In Q3 this year we spent $278 million. Year-to-date $818 million but again we've got a bunch of stuff coming up right as we speak. I'd estimate that our CapEx for the year will be somewhere between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion range.</p>
          <p>Costs below the line for Q3 sales and profits were up over last year, sales were up 11%, and e-commerce profits were up 31% for the quarter. While our average ticket has come down recognizing we are known for higher average tickets, higher average ticket merchandise on there, our site traffic continues to grow and was actually up 17% in the third quarter year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Next on the discussion, expansion. This year looks like will open a net of 20. We'll have opened 23 and that includes three relocations. I believe it includes two relocations and then the reopening of the Makuhari, which we closed and then reopened prior to this fiscal year end, of course, so a net of 20 net new units. Adding 20 units on the original base at the beginning of the year of 572 that's about 3.5% unit growth, so closer probably to 4% square footage growth given that the new units tend to be a little bigger and we constantly are doing remodels and relocations with existing units as well.</p>
          <p>Our square footage total at Q3 end was 82.916 million. Some of you asked for that number. In terms of expansion plan for '12 we're still at four or so months out from even the beginning of the fiscal year. There are currently 30 active projects on the current construction list. My guess is that figure for '12 will ultimately be around 25 plus and including about a little under half, about 12 or so outside of North America. So continue to ramp up in other countries where we have been pretty successful overseas.</p>
          <p>In terms of stock repurchases, since June of '05 and through third quarter end, we have purchased, repurchased 104 million shares at an average price of $55.02 or $5.7 billion. As you know I guess a month ago we had a press release announcing both an increase in our quarterly dividend rate, which we typically have done spring as well we had a small amount of stock repurchase authorization that was going to expire in July. Basically that additional authorization was canceled and a new $4 billion board repurchase authorization was put in place with a four year life to it.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of this year we bought back $150 million in stock. In the second quarter $94 million and in the third quarter $102 million and we would expect to continue to do so and we'll let you know each quarter. With that, I did mention the dividend increase, we increased it on an annual basis from $0.82 a share annually or 20.5&#xA2; a quarter. We increased it 17% effective with the current quarterly dividend or $0.96 or 24&#xA2; per share per quarter.</p>
          <p>With that I'm going to turn it back over to Demetrice and have you open it up for questions. Thank you.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Richard, just if you could talk a little bit about the inflation levels, what it was in the quarter? How you're seeing that? What you expect going forward? And how we should be thinking about future LIFO charges? It seems like this quarter, we have sort of a pretty big step-up and I'm wondering how we should be thinking about it going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, first of all, keep in mind, LIFO is a U.S. accounting phenomenon and we've got a little over $4 billion of U.S. inventory, so $49 million rough number would be about 1.2%, I'm rounding here, inflation from the beginning to the end of the fiscal quarter. Mind you also that this is an annual event, so in reality, the calculation will be done, what was your inventory at cost at the beginning of the year by item and then what is it at the end of the fiscal year? If you're early in the year, you're supposed to guess as best you can what you think it's going to be. We've always chosen &#x2013; historically chosen to take the entire amount that occurred in that quarter, and of course, a lot of these big increases came in the last 12 to 16 weeks.</p>
          <p>Just examples, and I'm not going to give brand names, but these are all branded items, everything from dry dog food of 3.5%; to all your detergents of 10%-plus; to various waters 10% or so; to all your plastic dinnerware, your plates and your plastic cups and everything, 8% to 9%; plastic trash bags, 4% on top of other ones. So again, you can't just say everything's up 4% to 10% because there's &#x2013; sometimes the private label is a little less because of our buying power, but the reality is these are hitting &#x2013; it doesn't rain just on us. My guess is it's impacting us a little sooner because we turn our inventory faster, so we're buying more recent, if you will. Mind you, we are able to pass on these increases, ultimately we all have to.</p>
          <p>We're going to try to keep &#x2013; if a manufacturer typically will say, "Okay, next Monday there's a price increase &#x2013; or a week from Monday. We'll allow you to buy four or six or so many weeks at the old price based on your prior six-month and average weekly purchases," we're always going to take full advantage of that, which I assume most retailers, be it supermarkets or other big discount stores are going to take advantage of. We feel that we always know we take full advantage of it, then we'll hold the price for a few of those weeks and benefit on the tail end of it and cover our costs. But we're going to hold the prices as long as we can.</p>
          <p>I've given you in the past quarters a couple of examples where we will hold it even further and eat into our margin, but again, those are the exception, not the norm. Ultimately, when all your merchandise is going up, you're going to have to be a) be competitive, but I think you've seen in my readings of some of your guys' reports out there on the supermarkets and the discount stores that ultimately it has to be passed on.</p>
          <p>There's still a lot of vendors announcing increases to retailers. I think there was an article in the Journal just a couple of weeks ago that cited four or five well-known consumer product brand names where their comments &#x2013; or maybe it was an analyst report, but their comments in the last couple of months of what they're announcing, and again they're announcing, they're not asking all the time and &#x2013; but we of course, have to be ever diligent, and Jim and Craig and Doug are constantly reminding the buyers that don't just take it for face value, push and push and push and be willing to switch sometimes.</p>
          <p>And so, overall, inflation's hitting everybody. It's going to continue, at least it's continuing so far this fiscal quarter. I can't tell you what it's going to be starting next Thursday, other than there are some pending price announcements &#x2013; price increase announcements from &#x2013; including some of the ones I just mentioned that are effective in early and mid-June, all the way out into that. And then so, those are pushing. I think yesterday we saw publicly there was one of the coffee suppliers announced 11% increases in wholesale coffee prices to their retail customers &#x2013; their retail vendors &#x2013; their retailers, and that was the fourth increase in coffee that they've passed on in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>So it's here. When will subside? Hopefully soon, but we are going to &#x2013; we probably get hit first. I think back in Q4 of '08 when we had a big LIFO charge when the floodgates of inflation had opened before they were shuttered quickly in late '08, with the economy and the stock market, I think again, then too, we were one of the first ones to have a big LIFO charge. I don't think you're going to be surprised &#x2013; I'm not going to be surprised by seeing other retailers on LIFO are going to do over the next several months when they announce various numbers. But it is what it is, and we're fighting as you might expect to keep them lower, keep them delayed and get as much at the old price as we can before it goes up, and we'll go from there.</p>
          <p>One other thing, I think I mentioned it, maybe I didn't mention it, one small caveat in terms of LIFO outlook for the quarter, and again we can't predict what exactly it is going to be. In the first couple of weeks, gas prices have come down. So whereas gas alone and $49 million charge was a little over $11 million. In the last couple of weeks it'll probably be $1 million, $1.5 million reduced. Not promising, even zero would be nice frankly out of whatever x is in Q4, but we'll see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Richard, just following on that, in light of the fact that we might see continued increases, any sense the $49 million in LIFO charge, doesn't anticipate continued price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the $49 million charge is simply the calculation of our LIFO inventory as of the beginning of Q3 and the end of Q3, period, end of story. I'm sorry fiscal year-end. So &#x2013; but it's the incremental amount. We had an amount at Q2 end, which was going to $6 million, which had it do that from the beginning of the year to that. So it's really the delta since Q2 end for the most part. Again, as I understand it now our controller Dave Petterson is here, he'll shaking his head yes or no if I'm wrong, he's saying no, but my understanding is that let's say we were just reporting our first fiscal quarter and we had this calculation indicated it's $49 million.</p>
          <p>If we believe and if we talk to our buyers and felt that you know what, pretty much the inflation party is over and from the venders perspective, and we've seen a lot, but the rate of increase has slowed down, we could correctly choose to take less of it, because if our anticipation was, hey, we know through the first 12 weeks of our fiscal year it was $49 million. And our best guess it's going to be, I'm making this number up, $80 million for the whole year, a totally made up number, then you might only choose to take quarter of the $80 million because you think it's going to be $80 million.</p>
          <p>Our view is that it is what it is. We're also in the third quarter, not the first quarter, and we are going to be, I think, take a conservative approach to it. I can tell you again there are price increases that have not hit yet our balance sheet, including some ones in later May and in June, that I mentioned some of those just a few minutes ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then if we could talk a little bit about the merchandise margin. You gave us a lot of detail, and I'm just wondering since you are lapping by the easiest compare from a year ago, the down 11, I'm sorry, down 10 basis points on your merchandise margin. How should we be thinking about that compared to ex-gas? I mean the plus 17, given the fact that Q2 last year was up against a tougher compare and then it decelerated to down 10, given that you had an easier compare, I'm just wondering how we should put the plus 17 in context up against that easy compare? And what maybe an apples-to-apples comparison is year-over-year ex-gas from year ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adrianne, it's hard to say. Who the heck knows what's gas? I read a research report yesterday from someone who follows not only us but Kroger and Safeway, who also have a lot of gas stations, and their view was I think correctly so, that with a declining gas price it's more profitable. You guys know that from what we've said in the past. That will help a little. It will also help because there'll be lower sales penetration from gas inflation. But again, I think the trend &#x2013; I don't have in front of me last year's exact numbers, but the trend in the last couple of quarters has been that the core underlying core margins have been up. I can't predict what tomorrow is going to bring.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. First question just on the increase in the business add-on membership fee, Richard, can you talk about what the rationale for that was? And how that's maybe influencing your thinking about an overall membership fee increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I know they've been some off-and-on discussions over time. I think originally that the focus on the add-on fee being $10 lower was simply for small businesses who've got two or three family owners or a handful of employees, it could be a benefit to them, and we wanted to incent in some cases perhaps that owner of that business to buy memberships for their employees. Over time two things have happened, particularly in the last few years. If you wanted to be an executive member and get the executive member benefits, you would roll out from under that primary business member and become your own member and you go effectively from 40 to 100. And so that has happened over time, that trend has continued.</p>
          <p>And I think the view at the end of the day was, is that we've got a loyal membership base, we think that we continue to provide even greater value, that every time, and I know this sounds a little noble, but we sincerely believe that when we have increased fees in the past, and this time as well, that we've created more, significantly more value than that increase. And at the end of the day, as you know, we keep things simple. And it's simpler to have a $50 instead of a $50 and a $40. And so it evolved into the $50. I don't think there was a lot of science that went into it other than that ongoing discussion, the ongoing trend toward some of those people moving out from underneath anyway to become their own executive member.</p>
          <p>In terms of the rationale going forward, I think what I said in last fiscal quarter, you guys all know after we sent out the first month of renewal notices that has an increase in it, we have not made that decision. We have shown over 25 years that we're not afraid to. We have shown, I've communicated to you time and again, that our renewal rates continue to be quite strong. We are not completely &#x2013; terribly concerned about what our members &#x2013; what our competitors' fee levels are. But we are also cognizant of what the economy is right now and we're not going to be completely arrogant out there. So at some point we'll see, and stay tuned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Then a second question, kind of a little bit different given that we get the segment data on a lag basis in the Q, but if you look at the last couple of quarters, the last three, four quarters, there's been fairly dramatic improvement in the profitability of other international, up 100, 90, 200, pretty nice improvement in Canada and really no improvement in the U.S. Can you comment on what's driving the significant improvement in the other international and Canada which are already dramatically more profitable than the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, and every country has a little bit of a different story. On average, forgetting about some overall metric &#x2013; looking at the overall metrics of your basic core items, in Canada we are the only club operator. In the U.S. we have dramatic competition in many of our markets. That's going to be some amount of basis points, more than 50 and less than 200, depending on where and how close. But it can be significant. You have a &#x2013; the other line item components that are different &#x2013; that can be significantly different as a percent of sales is payroll. And even though we're always going to pay relatively higher in a given country, the average wage in the U.S. is approaching $20, in another country it might be $9 or $12 or $15 or $8, and it really is in those kind of ranges.</p>
          <p>Conversely &#x2013; healthcare is the other big one. Healthcare in the U.S., for the last several years as I talked about healthcare, I talked about U.S. healthcare, which is dramatically higher than any other country that we're in, and grows at a dramatically higher rate than anywhere we're in.</p>
          <p>The other thing of course is comps. In Canada, as I mentioned, underlying local currency comps in the last two years now, two-and-a-half years, throughout this horrible economy in the U.S., has been pretty robust up there. They didn't have the craziness of the market breakdown and meltdown, and certainly they've enjoyed a pretty robust economy. So mid to high single digit local currency comps have helped up there as well. In Asia and other countries, I think part of it is, is Asia is a bigger and bigger component of other international. And as I mentioned also in this call, our comps in local currency in the U.K. has actually shown some life this past quarter, up six. It had been a bit closer to flat the last couple of years. And that was a bigger piece of other international, as we've gone from zero to 23 units in the three Asian countries, which on average are higher margin &#x2013; higher sales volume, more profitable businesses for us.</p>
          <p>And so &#x2013; now, why has been the U.S. coming down? You look at our comps over the last few years, our &#x2013; notwithstanding they've been quite a better of late and somewhat better over the last year versus the prior year or two. You had &#x2013; we've enjoyed for a number of years high volume, decent comp U.S. numbers and they got hit for a while. Again, they're coming back a little, but certainly we recognize, too, that our growth and profitability over the next few years while it will continue to come from some of this improvement and critical mass in countries where we are expanding now, a bigger piece of the ship is the 73% or 74% or whatever percent it is of our company that's U.S. And we're working on it and as Jim and Craig would tell you, top line sales growth is the best thing you can do for it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Dan Binder. Richard, just wanted to clarify a point on this LIFO charge. If I understood you correctly, you're saying that you're basing your LIFO charge in the quarter on where you think your inventory is going to be at the end of the year and the inflation that you're seeing to date. So is it fair to say that you have not factored in price increases that you know are coming next quarter? And if that's the case, based on what you know today, I mean very round numbers, what should we be thinking about for a LIFO charge in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the latter part of that question, we don't know. Keep in mind we booked the entire calculation of Q3 in Q3 because we're nearing the end of the year and we could have probably saved a little if we &#x2013; well, I doubt we would have saved anything because knowing what we know for some pending price increases in the first &#x2013; mind you, you're not getting price increases on 4,000 items but all you need is 10 or 15 of these big items and you know you're going to have some. We'll have to wait and see. I really can't tell you because we don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But I mean it's fair to say that the LIFO charge we saw this quarter is incorporating &#x2013; is it incorporating all price changes that you're aware of? Or just the ones that have happened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the ones that have happened. So, yeah. We're aware of price changes that will be a hit to LIFO, an increase in LIFO in Q4, but I'm looking at just that side of the equation, I'm looking at other things be them few that have come down a little and what else is going to happen? If you had a big increase in some key items throughout Q3 even if there's been a few increases over the course of the year you may be at the end of that so you're not going to have any increase in Q4. Gas, again was over 20% of Q3. I only have two weeks of history and I can't predict from that, but so far gas is less than zero.</p>

          <p>Well, I don't anticipate refinancing the debt. I expect to write a check for $900 million in interest, in semiannual interest expense payment in March of '12 and save 5 plus percentage risk with darn near a little over 0% interest income reduced and so that's a no-brainer. We've got plenty of cash, some of you would like to see us ramp it up more. We feel we've done pretty well by kind of on a regular basis as long as we feel good about our future, which we have and we continue to, we'll be a regular buyer. As you guys know the stock has moved very rapidly.</p>
          <p>We historically have in the last few years have bought through blackouts using 10b5-1s. Sometimes given the stock price the speed at which it moves, it moves past that little matrix that we have in place and we might not buy for a week or two, but at the end of the day we're going to continue to buy. I can't predict what it is. I can tell you the board authorized $4 billion with a four year life and that's as good a guess as anything in terms of simple math.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi, Richard. Just a few quick follow ups. One was just on the &#x2013; in the areas where you have seen some price increases I think one of your regional competitors had mentioned things like acceleration of private label and trade down to smaller pack sizes. Can you just comment on any sort of behavioral changes you've seen in your customer related to that if any?</p>
          <p>And then the other question was just the March/April acceleration, is it just increased traffic from your gas stations supporting that? Or is there something else going on that's causing the acceleration? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, traffic is certainly a big part of it, but the average ticket net of inflation, net of everything else is a flat to up slightly. I think it's overall improved a little bit. The net number has improved, but we try to give you as much information as we have ourselves on that. It's continuing. So far, so good and I hope the last two months portend what the next few is, but we won't know until we get there.</p>
          <p>We continue to see private label and increased sales penetration, partly because we keep adding items and starting last fall, we began &#x2013; as an example, expanding private label into some canned goods, fruits and vegetables, where the quality, the amount of water in the can is lower, the quality is a little better, in our view, it's a higher-end at a great price. And that helps that penetration. I think that if you go back to late calendar '08 when the stock market went to hell and everybody was feeling a lot poorer, during those next six months in '09, we saw &#x2013; I think, we saw like a 300 basis point increase in private label sales penetration. That was a real big change. We're not seeing that now; we're seeing normal progression in it.</p>
          <p>In terms of the trade down thing, you're really not going to see that here because we don't do it. We &#x2013; the only area where you are going to see some average price decline is probably in pharmacy where there's a &#x2013; we all read about it, there's some very well-known branded items that are going to become generic this coming year. But in terms of regular merchandise out there, even if they &#x2013; while we tested &#x2013; in fairness, we tested a couple of patio sets in the early calendar '09 with a &#x2013; instead of a $1,299 price point, a $999, but we still had $1,299 in there. And guess what? The $999 sold better, but it didn't end &#x2013; we didn't rush to do everything at $899 and $999; to the opposite, by spring '10 we got out of those price points and tried to trade the customer up, because if you're trading the customer down, it's darned tough to get them back.</p>
          <p>So we have not reduced pack sizes. The only time we're going to reduce the pack size &#x2013; I can't say we never &#x2013; the examples that come to mind is in the last few months are on what they call, limited quantity commodity resource &#x2013; limited resource commodities, like pine nuts. Some obscure item &#x2013; and these are not exact numbers, but let's say we were selling a 4-pound pack, and nobody but us sells a 4-pound pack, for $19.99; well now it's a 2.5-pound or 3-pound pack for $16.99 because the price per pound has doubled or whatever. So whatever that x is, there's been some examples like that, but for the most part, we are not reducing the ounces in the cans of coffee or the number of M&amp;Ms in the M&amp;M bag. And we conversely, are pushing the envelope the other way. And I think our customers are the higher-end customers so that we're not as impacted perhaps than some of the low or medium-end customer retailers, perhaps, but at the end of the day, we're not seeing the trade down thing.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard. When you're looking at some of these new member sign-ups, especially in the U.S. where you have the gas, how are they reacting to the gasoline? And can you look at the sales data and see how the availability of discounted gas is attracting members?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, Chuck, if you look at that 16% comp in gallonage in Q3, that's huge. Again, in good economies we've seen, call it, mid-single-digit numbers when I assume the overall U.S. economy gallonage comps were slightly lower than that, but still positive. I don't know the source, but I remember reading recently in this economy whenever total U.S. gallonage comps for the economy was x, it's now x minus a couple percent, maybe 2% instead of 4%, whatever x was. We went from that mid-single up to the mid-teens.</p>
          <p>So we are &#x2013; gas is top of mind. It's on the news many nights in many cities and again, that frequency, I haven't seen any numbers internally lately like how many of those members are doing an incremental shop. But we know that our traffic is up. When we talk about traffic frequency, by the way, we talk about front-end register frequency, not pharmacy or optical or gas station frequency. So clearly, part of our increased frequency is people coming to get gas and some proportion of those saying hey, I'm going to go in and shop a little bit. And some of those shops are incremental not just replacing one from two days later that would have happened anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gotcha. And looking at how the consumer is behaving overall, would you be able to give us some idea of sales, comps growth between consumables and general merchandise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, if you look at the subcategories, all the basic Food and Sundries categories are, other than tobacco, are pretty consistent and up in those mid-single or mid-to-high single digit. Again, a little of that again if you look at LIFO's not a perfect extract, but if you look at the $49 million on $4 billion, a little over $4 billion, that's a little over 1% inflation in our inventory. In that 12 weeks we saw inflation and a lot of that was in those consumer products. You look at comps in what I call the middle-price ticket discretionary non-food items, like small electrics and domestics and surprisingly jewelry, which are quite strong, in the teens and twenties and for months now &#x2013; I mean, it may vary, but on average they've been much stronger. So who the heck knows? Other than people are buying and maybe they're not buying as big a ticket but they're buying.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I mean it's hard to get surprised when we see weekly stuff here. I mean, what was your biggest surprise? LIFO. Again I feel good about the fact that despite my confidence that we are ever more competitive and we're always leading the pack in being the toughest out there. All you've got to do it look at our gross margins compared to anybody else. That we're able to still improve underlying margins while remaining very competitive. And I think Jim &#x2013; he hasn't been on a lot of calls in the last few years, like these calls, but he's always, when he's here, he'll talk to you. And he's always when asked that kind of question is basically saying, guys, margins aren't our problem. We're going to still be very competitive but the good news is we still know, I think we're smart enough how to make some margins. And it's still driving traffic. When they're ready to buy, they're in our, they're in. So that's good. And the loyalty is great. And I think there's really, haven't been honestly a lot of &#x2013; I can't think of any real surprises on margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think last quarter <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:30) Fresh Food margins. Can you just provide us with some details there in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the thing I mentioned in Q2, I gave again some examples which spooked everybody a little bit that as commodity prices, underlying raw material prices were rising there are some key items that we've chosen to see our realized gross margin go from low to mid-teens down to the low single digits in some examples, some extreme examples. And it would be like pizza. We're not going to change the price of pizza every day even though cheese prices skyrocketed. We're not going to change the 15 or so pack of muffins that restaurants and commissaries and day care centers and everybody else buy from &#x2013; I'm making the number up &#x2013; from $5.99.</p>
          <p>Well, and so what happens is, is the margin &#x2013; I don't know if it's a word &#x2013; but devolves, declines over a four or six-month period. And then finally they're allowed to take the price point from &#x2013; I'm making it up &#x2013; from $5.99 to $6.49. And we go right back to that high teens. So it's not a permanent reduction but it's kind of stair-stepped because we want to be fiercely competitive. And those are more the exceptions rather than the rule.</p>
          <p>In Q2, when I was sharing why I believe Bakery margins were down year-over-year in the quarter it was because we were holding the price, many of which we've since taken up. And so, again, trying &#x2013; I scared everybody saying this is the old, we're just going to keep them down and damn the torpedoes. That was not the case. We're going to be competitive, and hopefully you've got to take those price increases into account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you mentioned on the call color around SG&amp;A, historically we don't necessarily have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:11), but it's impacting our model pretty far, and it looks like one of the best performances historically. How sustainable should we think about some of the improvements that you called out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in terms of our focus on driving costs down, which I probably reiterated more in the last three or four quarters than before. I used to always say there's not a lot of silver bullets, we're pretty efficient. The fact of the matter is &#x2013; let's face it, Craig, who is our President, his background is 40 years in operations or maybe 35-plus in operations and five or so in merchandising, and certainly he would say himself he's an operator first. And he is completely focused on that, and so are the operators, the EVPs, the Senior VPs and all the way down. So I think there is some sustainability. Top-line sales are going to do more for it than anything else and again, I can't tell you what the consumer is going to feel tomorrow, but I feel confident that our merchants are at the top of their game and we have a lot of good stuff going on.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, as expected. You're always going to have a few that are a little better or a little worse, but overall existing U.S. markets are no-brainers. There aren't a lot of new U.S. markets. They tend to be no-brainers. They start off slower. Probably the thing that has been on the upside surprisingly successful is Asia and Australia. We only have one in Australia, but it's our best opening ever, sales wise. We have, and again some of these numbers are helped also by the weak dollar, because I'm expressing the number in dollars, but I think we have one unit this fiscal year that is darn near teetering on having a four in front of it, $400 million or very high threes. And so certainly that's fun.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, I will say again it's not like '02 or '01 and '02, or '02 and '03 when we opened in two years 61 units, 45 of which were in the Midwest or closing new markets, our Midwest and Texas, where we knew it was going to be slow growing. Those are all doing pretty well. And when we opened our 16th and 17th and 18th, or 15th, 16th, and 17th Chicago units this past fiscal year, in a one-week period, they all started off pretty well.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've got a lot of money. We feel the pressure not just from you guys, but from ourselves that we want to ramp up the expansion. Rick and I we're also our own toughest cost controller when a unit comes in and it's, oh, just spend an extra $3 million or $5 million, and Jim is as you might expect saying no, go find something more reasonable. So we are trying to open. The other thing is we &#x2013; I think this is our history, we've tended to be relatively slow growing in a foreign country until we get five or eight units, and then there's a little bit of a spurt afterwards. Look, Japan is a huge economy. It clearly &#x2013; look, not just Japan, Korea and Taiwan, the concept clearly works. There aren't a lot of players necessarily looking at going in, and we're profitable. So let's benefit from that. But I think probably more than anything is, is that we are certainly comfortable in all those countries, and we certainly have the money. Let's ramp it up a little bit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it's a good barometer. Keep in &#x2013; on the one hand you say, yeah, maybe it is a little bit but the other way &#x2013; if you look at it the other way is, is any incremental trend in private label when you switch from the branded item and the private label is 20%, 25% lower price on average. That's going to deflate it a little bit. That still inflates your inventory cost but it deflates your sales comp numbers, your item numbers. So I think it goes the other way little bit but I don't have the numbers in front of me to look at.</p>

          <p>It would be under ancillary businesses but it's kind of distorted because when prices are going up and even more exacerbated now because gallonage is so far up because it's such a high price, it's also a time when profitability, even the gross margin of the gas business itself is coming down a little bit. But in the matrix, you've got increased sales penetration times a lower margin number. They kind of offset each other in that matrix. We're trying to keep it simple and not do a 3-D matrix.</p>

          <p>So in electronics now it sounds like the TV trend hasn't changed much but maybe some of the computing and notebooks may be a bigger negative than TVs. Is that fair?</p>

          <p>Hey, Richard, a couple of questions. First, on the U.S. healthcare expenses, I think last year they were just over $800 million. Where do you see those coming in this year now that we're three quarters through and it sounds like you obviously did well with the benefits in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think dollar wise in the quarter they were up like 8% or 9%. It was below 10% in actual dollars. Again, that's a reduction in the level of increase from prior quarters and notwithstanding there's some things that have increased it like mental health parity effective the beginning of this last fiscal year. If you took that quarter and let's say, it was 9% or 10% times $800 million, that's $880 million or $870 million so it's probably in the high eights.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Good. And then just with respect to May trends in the U.S., any comment on any regional trends you're seeing thus far? I mean, there's been some crazy weather out there, I'm just wondering what &#x2013; how the business has gone so far in May?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have not really been impacted by the tornadoes and what have you since we're not very well penetrated down there. You don't want to be a boat seller in the Northwest, it's still winter. No. I'm thinking of just the regional operators at the last two budget meetings, there really hasn't been a lot of issues. I mean, the strength has continued. It's really all the ships have risen with the regional &#x2013; the geographically regional ships here have risen.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard. Just two quick ones from me. The first one is, are you seeing more opportunities for co-branded private label given some of the inflationary trends? And the second one is, are you seeing any more opportunistic buys in areas where inventories are maybe getting out of line a little bit? I'm talking about maybe the Apparel category and soft lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's any &#x2013; the answer to both is yes, there are some. Again, nothing like the first half of calendar '09 after the economy went to hell, but we are seeing &#x2013; we continue to do both and for a lot of reasons. But it's not like &#x2013; the huge inventory buildup problems that many high-end non-food manufacturers had, whether it was furniture or apparel or luggage or you name it or watches, that was &#x2013; that came all at once when the economy got hammered in late '08. Those types of over-inventory positions out there are fewer and further &#x2013; farther between. But we keep adding new stuff.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just my last question is, on California, you had talked about it being one of the stronger regions for you this quarter &#x2013; areas this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about any of the trends in California? Sort of what's really changed there? And what you're seeing in California?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the biggest change is that they're buying more. I mean, I'm just saying &#x2013; I don't mean to be cute, but it's across category and the regions that were hit the hardest after November or so of '08 have come back. Gas also. Our savings &#x2013; again, gas is all regional and there's more pricing volatility in Southern California than anywhere in the country I think, and our savings right now, I believe, in California are bigger than other parts of the country. But it's all a function of all the different state rules and winter gas and summer gas and you name it, there's those variances.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's Michael Exstein, but I'll take the opportunity anyway. Richard, can you just follow up on Chuck's question in terms of frequency? What's sort of the attachment? If you're 16% more gallons of gasoline sold, what was that in terms of frequency? And how &#x2013; if you go in and fill up with gasoline, do 90% of the time you go into the warehouse? Do you track that specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can tell you what we have tracked of late is the percentage of people that bought gas and shopped on the same day has not changed. It's still about 30%, low 30% and so if there's 16% &#x2013; if it used to have 3% or 5% gallonage comp and now we have 16%, there's 10% plus more people, about 30% of whom are coming in to shop.</p>
