      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So good afternoon once again. We are great to see you at this traditional nine-month information disclosure. Leonid Fedun, the Vice President of LUKOIL.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad to welcome you at this quarterly meeting. We do such meetings four times a year, two times abroad when we disclose our figures for six and 12 months and two times here in Moscow when we report on quarterly results.</p>
          <p>But let's start with those statements. It's just regular forward-looking statements defining some legal framework, our first slide here. First slide please.</p>
          <p>Well just to state once again that this year, the financial performance is the best ever. Significant increase in free cash flow. I want to emphasize that the company controls its production costs very well and increase in refinery throughputs and marketable gas production, a substantial increase in hydrocarbon production in international projects. And we finally developed an agenda to secure positive cash flow in the conditions of international financial crisis.</p>
          <p>The main facts for nine months. Revenue from sales about $90 billion. It's about 60% net income, more than 10 billion, $700 million, it's almost 10% higher than might expectations. Basic EPS is of 0.85 per share and net income -</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's the operator here. We can't hear anything. Has the call started? Hello, Marina?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the best indicator of the companies. Next slide please. Macroeconomic and tax environment were of course the main indicator which had the positive impact on our operations was growing prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Marina?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So all indicators have been growing steadily. I just want to draw your attention to this fact because Russian companies are much criticized for inflating up prices in the Russian market.</p>
          <p>Well gas prices in Russia went up just 36% while in Europe, it was a 6% increase. So when the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service is saying that we reduce them disproportionally as compared to Europe, but we didn't. So inflated them like in Europe and tax grew more than 100% and this tax tail is very, very painful for all our companies.</p>
          <p>The main operating results. Oil production down 2.6%. However, marketable hydrocarbon production overall went up 0.4%, reaching to 2,189,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well, it was a mainly due to an increase in marketable gas production plus 28%. And LUKOIL is becoming number three in terms of this indicator in Russia. Crude oil exports is going down. Well again, it's our consistent approach. We have been reducing our crude oil exports and we are increasing our refinery products exports and our retail sales are up significantly because it's the profitable premium market for our company today. And so of our petroleum product sales were up almost 15%.</p>
          <p>Well, our lifting costs, if you look at these graphics and if you compare us to our competitors in Russia and international oil and gas companies, the so-called top six, you will see that LUKOIL has the lowest growth rate of the past five years. And as compared to other competitors, we have a pretty positive performance in terms of CapEx per barrel of production. And you need to keep in mind that we have been investing heavily into new fields unlike other competitors and by these projects in the Timan-Pechora fields and Caspian fields and a lot of international projects as well.</p>
          <p>Well we successfully launched our joint project with ConocoPhillips, the Yuzhnaya Khylchuya field. It's the first greenfield in the post-Soviet period. So it gave us very positive dynamics in hydrocarbon production this year. So, as you can see, after the launch, our average rate for nine months was higher than the same indicator last year.</p>
          <p>So we're seeing really positive development in our production projects outside the Russian Federation. So as you can see, our marketable hydrocarbons production growth is &#x2013; has exceeded 180 barrel per day and marketable gas production is also growing. So our gas reduction abroad has been up 246% and it's expected to grow because we are getting ready to put on stream our two new projects.</p>
          <p>So we are increasing our value-added products output. So as you can see, the most profitable segment for us is refining in Russia. It's going up, so we launch two extra capacities at the Volgograd refinery and at North Sea. And in one year, our refining volumes were up 86,000 barrels per day. It's a very, very high indicator. And the refining output has now exceeded 1,100,000 barrels per day, and that makes us number one amongst Russian companies. So we keep growing in Russian refined products retail.</p>
          <p>Our retail station network has expanded by 15% and our daily average sales per station has grown as well. And so now the sales is about 10 tons per day per station, which gives us a pretty comfortable return on investment for our Russian operations and the Russian domestic market.</p>
          <p>Our international segment is also growing. We have more than 6 million tons of refined products; that's what we sell outside Russia.</p>
          <p>The main financial results. Well, I'm sure you've already seen them because we published them actually several hours ago. Total revenue for nine months this year was 56% up. Net income as compared to same period last year was 70%, up reaching $10.765 billion.</p>
          <p>What's interesting, that's what many analysts expected our net income to be. So congratulations, you were right. Well basic EPS 12.85. That's a 70% increase and the company generates quite a considerable cash flow.</p>
          <p>Well, our sales breakdown now. 82% of all our sales are generated by our international operations. The Russian domestic market contributes 18% of sales. It's important to understand for further analysis when we come to international oil prices. And I want to draw your attention to the fact that we emphasize high added value products because our main sales exports are generated by refined products and our target is to reach such performance so to refine all our crude oil that we produce in Russia at our own refineries. And from January 1st, we start operations at our refinery in Italy on Sicily. And so we will beginning our first operations using this refinery as our base, because you probably read today that we were entering the Argentina market with our refined products. So next year, we expect this proportion to be much higher, almost 10% higher.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses. So before we talk about operating expenses, I'd just draw to your attention to one figure. Some real actual ruble appreciation has been 23% it's important to understand and lifting costs were just 23%. And since we have our reporting in dollars and the costs are in rubles, so one can say that we control all our costs. This insignificant increase of operating expenses we had in other items. So it's related to an increase of share of affiliate companies or new economic enterprises, economic agents such as TGK-8 which contributes an increase in operating expenses.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing a lot of changes on our balance sheet and in this proportion, the crude oil we produce and crude oil we purchase. And under the American accounting system, our OpEx performance also changes.</p>
          <p>And that's why we're seeing these fluctuations here. But overall we think that, in the pre-crisis period, we managed to do the most important thing, which is stringent cost control.</p>
          <p>Now OpEx growth drivers. Our lifting costs in Q3 were down as compared to Q2, substantially down almost by two kopeks. Overall cost was 8.3%, refining costs 4.6% up. But as you can see this 2.3%, it was this contribution of TGK-8 operating expenses, the first time it's been included in our reporting. And of course all their c costs are now being consolidated.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A and transportation expenses. Well almost all tariffs were up in this period of time because the inflation in the oil industry has been the highest over the past period for the 20 years that I've been in this industry. And so I'm hopeful that the crisis will introduce more balance into the situation, those growing natural monopolies tariffs, transportation tariffs, construction companies' tariffs. So hopefully these rates will start going down.</p>
          <p>Well our traditional tax burden slide. Well in Q3 the highest tax payments of course. So as you can see, they exceeded all reasonable limits and today LUKOIL is the number two &#x2013; tax payer number two, maybe tax payer number one in the Russian Federation. Yes, Gazprom is paying less tax than we are. So we are tax payer number one in the Russian Federation, which makes us very proud.</p>
          <p>Net income reconciliation. I want to draw your attention to the statement we made last time. Well many were surprised why we were doing this hedging. And we explained it in the following way. In the Russian taxation system, when you have this so-called "Kudrin scissors", when you have a certain lag between duties introduced and the real oil price, about two months, so you face substantial risks. When the oil price is growing we are making a profit, when it's coming down we are making losses. Well profit is always good, but losses, it's obviously very bad, much worse.</p>
          <p>That's why our management team made sure that we hedge all our operations to get a positive effect. And so this income from hedging has been very substantial, $623 million. And with Q4 it will be even more substantial. And all our hedging efforts produced a profit in Q3. So we made 223 million of extra income already.</p>
          <p>Now our cash flow reconciliation. So as compared to nine months of 2007, our cash flow increased 475%, reaching $2.120 [sic: 3.230] billion. Free cash flow, and it's equivalent, as of end of Q3, exceeded $2.134 billion.</p>
          <p>Our CapEx. So we are making the main investments in exploration and production in the Russian Federation. So that consumes the bulk of this amount, more than $2 billion, and 1.670 (sic) [1.760 ] billion are spent in the Russian Federation on our internal projects. We spent about $300 million on our international projects in Q3 2008. $550 million was spent on refining and sales, of which 364 million in the Russian Federation. So the Company has been, and still is, one of the major investors in the Russian Federation and the biggest investor outside of Russia.</p>
          <p>But that all belongs to the past. Now let's talk about the future. So these days, we are finalizing our anti-crisis agenda, how to work, how to operate amidst this international financial crisis. And our main target is to ensure the positive cash flow.</p>
          <p>So how can we ensure a positive cash flow in a crisis without reducing our main operating targets? I emphasize that reducing without cutting on our operating targets, the main operating target is to have the positive growth of hydrocarbons production in our company. So these measures include decreasing capital and operating expenditures by optimizing them, optimizing total capital and operating expenditures, to abandon investment in least efficient projects to reduce costs to projects, investment to projects not related to crude oil production and refining and increasing investments and cost amortization of those investments in the projects that provide a fast return on investment, new projects.</p>
          <p>And we assume that the crisis, apart from being destructive in its nature, will also bring about some positive factors. For the oil industry, what is positive? Well, of course, number one is reduced inflation in the oil industry because this inflation has been about 30% over the past year in the oil industry. Now we are seeing a sharp decline of commodity prices, cement prices, metal prices, pipe prices in the international market. Also, we are seeing a sharp decline in contractor's prices because contracting work orders are down. And one more important factor that we need to mention is the positive effect of the ruble devaluation, well, not devaluation, but maybe a weakening of the ruble.</p>
          <p>Well, of course, everyone is concerned about the situation we are going to see in the oil market after December 17. One, we expect this planned OPEC meeting, and the Russian delegation, extended Russian delegation is going to attend this meeting and Mr. Alekperov will be part of this delegation. So we expect a substantial production cut and new measures to be announced to support these measures from the Russian Federation side.</p>
          <p>So we think that if about 2.5 million barrels per day, if these volumes are removed from the market, it's about 125 million tons of annual production, then the oil price next year will be in the range of 60 to $80 per barrel. And we assume that a price below $75 per barrel is not economically feasible for the oil industry, because according to Cambridge Research Energy Associates, according to their research, their data, that will mean about 6 to 7 million of oil production a day later on, and we will be seeing a significant shortage of production.</p>
          <p>Today, we are seeing lot a of alternative production schemes when oil and refined products are produced from food products. And remember the Bush plan, 5 million barrels per day of production. Heavy oil and oil sands production projects have been suspended. Deepwater drilling projects have been frozen. So as a result, as a result, we are now seeing a creation of a potential avalanche of shortage of deficit which could have fired back in three or four years.</p>
          <p>I just want to remind you that every year, every year, production worldwide is reduced by 6 to 9% depending on the oil volumes. And we need to maintain this level by introducing new oil fields by putting them on stream. And 30% of this growth is accounted for alternative or heavy crude oil sources. Now all these projects have been suspended, because they can only be profitable if the oil price is substantially higher than $100 per barrel. I just &#x2013; I can just tell you that in the current taxation system, the active projects would be profitable if the oil price is 90 to $95 per barrel.</p>
          <p>So we think that the target of $75 per barrel formulated by OPEC is objective. Well, whether or not it is achievable depends on many factors: collaboration, discipline, how well those suggestions are implemented and how well independent producers are associated with those proposals including the Russian Federation. And Russian Federation's contribution is 53%. And you know it was funny to read some articles, so if OPEC stops reductions, independent producers will take up this position.</p>
          <p>I just want to remind the writer that all independent producers are losing production; Russia is losing production, Norway, Mexico and the United States. So there is no one to replace this production and OPEC's share will objectively be growing several percentage points every year because there are no major discoveries in the world. And if OPEC prices stay low for another two or three years, then OPEC proportion without Russian Federation will exceed the 50% automatically in a few years' time.</p>
          <p>So some other factors I want to remind you. That's what we talked a lot about at the beginning of this millennium after this Asian financial crisis, the ruble was devaluated and everyone was surprised why Russian industry is up, why the oil industry is making a profit, why it is developing so successfully. I just want to remind you that 90% of Company's costs in Russia are ruble-denominated, and LUKOIL makes 80% of its revenue in hard currency.</p>
          <p>So a ruble devaluation by 1% will automatically, I emphasize automatically, increase our net income by 0.85%. So a 10% reduction, ruble devaluation by 10% will increase our net income by 8.5%. That's what many people do not take into account in their models for next year. And it's a happy equation. So if the price is down, the ruble gets weaker. And on the right here, you can see that it depends on how the ruble exchange rate on the oil price without Central Bank interventions.</p>
          <p>Objectively, at the oil price of $100 per barrel, the objective value of the ruble will be 20 to 23. That's exactly what it would be overall in one year. At $40 per barrel, 30 to 35, it's the objective, the objective value of the ruble that that we have now. So we think that there is a substantial lag between our real operating costs that we incur in rubles and the reporting that we produce in dollars. So this lag is huge today. In rubles, we are not growing. However, we are seeing a substantial growth in dollar terms. Now we are going to see an opposite dynamics that you will see in our Q4 reporting and in the later reports for next year.</p>
          <p>So that's what we are saying. Ruble devaluation will reduce our lifting costs, and we are already seeing some signs of it in Q3 2008. So either the oil price will be up or the ruble will continue to weaken. Today, the government announced an expansion of this by currency corridor. Well, that's the right step. Thus, we are creating conditions for stabilizing oil companies and other industries as well, those industries that substitute imports.</p>
          <p>One more factor that will have a positive impact on our operations that we need to take into account, it's a reduction in tax burden. So we appreciate the government support on this; without it, it would be too bad. So the measures taken in the middle of this year before the crisis are going to give us about $2 billion of net income, extra $2 billion.</p>
          <p>It's any changes in the mineral production tax petitioned and introduction of the tax holidays for a number of regions, in Timan-Pechora and Caspian and some changes in the accounting. Some extra measures introduced during the crisis have increased the rate of amortization up to 30%. It's different ways of calculating extra digits for oil and refined products and that should give us an extra 500 or $600 million of net income. And some other measures are being discussed now that could bring us now to 100, 300 billion rubles for the oil industry and our proportion is 25%. So we can expect some part of this pie. And also changes in calculation methodologies from the export duties reduces the negative effect of Kudrin's scissors, which is very important to us as well.</p>
          <p>So positive effects from the global financial crisis, optimization of all our investment programs. So now we have strong competition, very fast selection process. So we only leave those programs that do create value for us. It's positive results from our hedging operations, 623 million. That's what we made in this quarter and hopefully in Q4, we'll make a much more substantial amount. The positive effects from the ruble devaluation that I mentioned already are cost optimization and a considerable decrease in tax burden. So the government does understand that we have been a milk cow for a long time, but sometimes you've got to feed your cow to be able to be able to milk it in the future.</p>
          <p>And in conclusion, so LUKOIL is planning to keep developing exceeding market expectations thanks to the following factors. So we have support from the government as oil companies do to reduce CapEx and OpEx in 2009 without reducing our key growth projects. I emphasize that. And we expect to see increased production in 2009, accelerated refinery operations, modernization of refineries, increasing our gas proportion which is more profitable than oil, developing our international projects and taking measures to ensure a constant cash flow amidst a crisis.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. Now it's Q&amp;A session. So the floor is open, you have two mics there. But please introduce yourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I was just wondering, when are you going to announce this offer to &#x2013; that you gave eight minority shareholders and why haven't you done it yet? And the second question is, are you going to move the deal &#x2013; the De Beers deal a little bit and can the deal amount change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on your second question, well, De Beers probably overvalued their efforts on developing the diamond program in this global financial crisis. So they just decided to suspend this transaction. But it's their right and it's their problem. So our job is to finalize the analysis because we think it's a little bit more than 63 million of carats of diamonds in this pipe. So we are going to finalize the exploration of this deposit and then we'll think about how to develop it further. So we are not going to change any financial terms because in a crisis, this asset is much more expensive.</p>
          <p>But in regards to this TGK-8 offer, I just don't know what's going on there. If you need, we can provide you with extra information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a comment on LUKOIL's interest in acquiring Spanish Repsol assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd like to make this following statement. Number one, we appreciate the support of the Spanish government and of the Spanish media for discussing this issue and for their attention to this issue. And we appreciate the positive image of our company, the positive perception of our company. Number two, we appreciate the political support of the Russian government in this deal. Number three, we would like to warn all our shareholders through you that no transaction, no deal will be made without preliminary consultations. And number four, it's all just rumors and we do not comment on rumors.</p>
          <p>Just one more thing to add. We are buying two soccer players from the Spanish Premier League for Spartak. That I can tell you with certainty. And Mr. Karten is in Spain now together with Mr. Kelkov, and that's what we are working on now. And since all our team is now from Spain including the doctor, the physiotherapist &#x2013; well, actually, they are Danish, but actually they are like Spaniards, because they all speak in Spanish and I'm learning Spanish now in Spartak. So Spain is very close to my heart, but from the soccer point of view only.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Reuters, thank you. So could you elaborate on your agenda with OPEC? So LUKOIL, how much can you reduce your production and how are you going to suspend your exports?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well my name is Fedun and not [Pavel] Shmatko, thanks God. So you should ask this question to the head of our ministry, because OPEC is an organization that unites oil exporting countries, not companies. And companies work within the framework of the agenda imposed on them by the government.</p>
          <p>So my position was communicated to them orally and then written and I always emphasize that if you want to stabilize the markets, if you want to remove about three million barrels of oil a day and one million is already removed, that's the only thing you can do. Otherwise, you will have a price collapse that will then turn back to this unprecedented growth again, because many investment projects are either frozen or canceled today. So let's wait for those official decisions that ought to be taken.</p>
          <p>What I know is that we are going to have a very high profile delegation from Russia. And so I've heard what you've heard. Russia is ready to support these activities. And we as a law-abiding company are ready to execute these decisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mr. Fedun, just one more question. Maybe some expectations of annual results because we are in the middle of December. What is your net income in the production volumes or that you expect for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would be glad to share this information with you, but remember the notice, the forward-looking statement. I cannot give you any forecast without informing the London Stock Exchange and without consulting my lawyers. So I'm limited here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one more question, if I may. You recently announced that you will offer a 100 billion ruble worth of bonds to the market. And you've got a permit from the security exchange commission today. When are you going to do it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we registered our bonds indeed, but we're doing it because the Central Bank developed a loan program for companies where you can use your bonds as collateral. So that's why we are doing it. Should this program be launched, should the loan conditions be interesting to us, we'll use it. So we've just prepared a tool and we put this tool on the shelf. And whether or not we are going to use it, I cannot tell you right now. But we have this option and that could be a good option to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my final question now, well, the traditional for you and for Mr. Alekperov, do you keep increasing your participation in the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if I was increasing my &#x2013; so I've got too much probably &#x2013; at $50, so I should pause a little bit and wait.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Spain television. Is LUKOIL going to go to Europe with some deals in terms of acquiring some minority stakes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we bought 49% in Italy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about lower acquisitions, lower stake acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, theoretically, everything is possible, but it's pure theory. I'm a Doctor of Philosophy, as I have PG in philosophy, so I can discuss philosophy with you a lot. But I prefer to discuss facts. So we are talking about financial results. Yes, we made this acquisition. It's one of the best refineries in Italy. We bought 49% there, but we have an option to increase our stake.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">

          <p>So are you in talks about buying this part of CPC from BP, and how would you transport crude oil from the Caspian Sea then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we know that BP is selling its stake in our joint venture, LUKARCO. So they bought this stake when they bought ARCO and they bought this Atlantic Richfield Company. So they bought it, they got the stake. They don't need this stake too much. That's why they're selling it. Since we have preferential right on it, preemption right on it, so we are looking at it. But the Kazakhstan government also has this preemptive right. So legally, it's very, very difficult, sophisticated, so I cannot tell you much right now. And the second question is the transit of crude oil from Caspian Sea. Well using the CPC infrastructure, and we are now finalizing an arrangement, we are now talking to Transneft about our lone crude oil reception here in Kalmykiya. And we could transport this crude oil from &#x2013; through Kalmykiya to the Transneft system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Al-Fayed, Stancheft Telegraph. We decided to set up a joint venture with Petroleum Venezuela, so you've been to Orinoco and you've been to Junin-3. So what you've done so far, is it going to be a bilateral project or are you going to introduce the people <mark type="inaudible" /> with within this new partnership?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for the question. We are participating in two projects basically. It's a consortium of several Russian companies that we are part of. But we're not dropping this Junin-3 project, because now we have come to Phase 2, we've done the evaluation. And under the memorandum that we signed with PDVSA [Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.], so now we are finalizing some exploration there, but we are not dropping it. We're not dropping it. Well of course these projects are now very difficult given the price levels now. But we expect the market to turn around and hopefully, with the support of Venezuelan government and PDVSA, we will be able to successfully develop both projects. Please use the microphone, otherwise we can't hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well <mark type="inaudible" />. Just a follow-up question. This consortium, what was it planning to do? And do you mean that the projects the companies have, so they will keep working on them independently? Or one could talk about some merger of those projects within the consortium? And if not, if each company is going to keep working independently, so what's the idea of this consortium?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I will surprise you probably, but the consortium is going to produce oil in this region. That's its main target. And it's not only crude oil production, you need to refine it on the spot, because it's very heavy. API is 18 to 19, very difficult, when you need to build an upgrade for this entire oil-producing plant. So it's pretty difficult and it's pretty expensive. In regards to our project, so we are finalizing all the evaluations. And once it's completed, we need to talk to PDVSA about the terms of and conditions of participation. And it goes far beyond 2009. Well whether or not we're going to integrate the projects into one, I cannot tell you because that depends on the positions of other participants and the Venezuelan government.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what about West Qurna? Have you applied for participation in this new round?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's agree, there is West Qurna-2 and West Qurna-1. Now they are doing a tender for West Qurna-1, it's not our project. And indeed we were invited by the Iraqi Oil Ministry to participate in this project because &#x2013; but we now presented documentation and we're going to look at this project. West Qurna-2, we still assume that we have rights for this project. And we are in dialogue and we're having a very favorable and positive dialogue with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and we keep working on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my last question, if I may. So in your presentation, you mentioned the beginning of swap supplies to the Sicily refinery. If you could elaborate on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yesterday, we signed an agreement with one of Argentina oil and refined products distributor to supply our diesel and fuel oil to Argentina using ISAB Refinery on Sicily as our production basis. But that said, it's just the first thing but the project is beginning to gain momentum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On football, they say that Mr. Alekperov holds 20% of the gross shares &#x2013; well ConocoPhillips also has about 20%, and in your reports, we see ING Bank, Citibank. And so in which package are Alekperov and ConocoPhillips, just to clarify?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know we have two reporting systems and certain conditions here. One is U.S. GAAP and the other one is Russian accounting system. In Russian accounting system, you look at direct security owners, depositors, those who really hold those securities. And Mr. Alekperov's share is 2 &#x2013; 20-something percent, it's disclosed for the London Stock Exchange. ConocoPhillips is 20 and Fedun's, or mine, is 9%. Maybe &#x2013; I apologize, maybe our colleagues or investment analysts have some questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well a question for clarification. In your Repsol statement, you said that no transaction will be completed or made without preliminary consultations. With who?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With our shareholders of course, our main shareholders. In this crisis, we saw a substantial change of shareholder structure. Some of them left, but we're now seeing some new ones who recently bought huge stakes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it investment funds or it's American funds? Second clarification question on CPC. You said that Kazakhstan government has the same preemptive right as LUKOIL. Why not Russian government?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well CPC too &#x2013; not just CPC too, they have Tanguis 5% and CPC Kazakhstan. So there is CPC-R and CPC-K. There's three entities. But it's probably for Tanguis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what about the transportation system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's a sophisticated legal issue. I'm not a lawyer, it's difficult to discuss it. There are some issues here and we need to align our positions with the Kazak government.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're saying that the main issue is legal, not financial?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in November, Russia reduced oil exports to Transneft by one third of announced OPEC cuts. So where can this oil be in? If Russian companies refuse to export this oil in December, physically, where is this crude oil located?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. Obviously I have no idea. You need to ask each company. Well when each ton of crude oil makes you a $60 loss, oil companies try to export products, diesel, fuel oil, accumulate reserves, sell in the Russian Federation because it's counternatural to make a loss on your economic activity. From January 1, the situation will be different so we'll be on the plus side. And hopefully it will be there during the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on your Argentina supplies, you said that's going to be spot supplies, spot contracts. Could you talk about the logistics a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's so delicate, it's so sophisticated and it's a little bit too early maybe to talk about it in detail. So we were talking about supplying the refined products to ISAB basis. Then there they will be upgraded to the quality required by the Argentina market and then it will be supplied by tankers to Argentina. So from Russia to Sicily, Sicily to Argentina.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have a few questions. So once again, so we have people on the conference call and so let's hear something from investment analysts. So if you have any questions, it's a good time to ask them. Yes, microphone please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have a question from Les Sincoff from CTV Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Les Sincoff, CTV Capital. So on Khylchuyu, yesterday you said that the second part of the same infrastructure, construction is over, but drilling was not included. So when are you planning to finalize this drilling? And when are you going to reach 150,000 barrels of capacity next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the brakes and the cover, those fields which are less than 50% depleted. So it's going to reach a peak in the middle of the next year. So yes, all the work is done in the winter so in the summer it should reach its peak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In one of your slides you mentioned your net income expectations of two billion because of tax breaks. What was the oil price you used in your calculation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$75 per barrel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And recently Mr. Alekperov said that your CapEx is going to be calculated based on the pessimistic scenario $4.5 billion for next year. What about your production forecast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Production will be the same, no reduction even with this CapEx. Well of course you can do it just one year, for just one year. But on the 22nd we're going to have a Board meeting and it will take place after the OPEC meeting, so we rescheduled it, in order to not to virtually dramatize each other's decision. So after this meeting on December 17, we will be about 70% certain about the oil price. Now we have three scenarios: 50, 65 and 80. So which one we're going to work on. All three scenarios have been calculated and we're going to announce which one we'll be using on the 22nd.</p>
          <p>Well again, analysts in the room, so are there any questions? Because then we'll be getting questions from the Internet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question. So could you just elaborate on this put option? The parameters of the put option?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can give you this information in detail. Please contact Andrey.</p>
          <p>Right, question from analysts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[no audio].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we answered this already. The Russian government announced it's ready to cut rate with OPEC to reduce production. Repsol, I answered this one as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also have a question from the telephone line. So if you could just hear it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Sincoff, your line is open if you wish to ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> hedging operations. Has anything changed, as compared with the previous quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking about Q3 or Q4? For Q3, the net income was $623 million. For Q4, we do not know yet.</p>
          <p>[Russian]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have some preliminary estimates but we'll give you exact figures later. So Q4 should be not worse than Q3 in terms of hedging operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one question on dollar taxes. Well taking into account those discussions in the Russian government, what about those plans of reduced production tax in 2009? Would you expect any further reductions in the production tax in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, I got the question, mineral production tax reduction. Well it's being discussed now as some &#x2013; there are some interesting proposals there. Then there are some proposals to introduce individual tax rates for each company. We think the law should be the same for all companies and those tax rates should be set objectively, regardless of which company is involved. So you heard this press conference with Mr. Putin, the Prime Minister, and what he said was that taxes need to be reduced further. And so that's all we know at this point. Well scenarios, I already &#x2013; 50, 65 and 80.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So we've been going for an hour. So hopefully you are all tired. Thank you. Thank you for your time, thank you for your attention.</p>
