          <p>Welcome to the SABMiller 2012 Interim Results Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to SABMiller. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first half results presentation for our six months ended September the 30th, 2011. With me today is Jamie Wilson, our new CFO, here for his first set of financial results.</p>
          <p>As usual, our presentation does contain forward-looking statements which reflect our current best judgment, including risks and uncertainties. The company disclaims any obligation to update these statements outside of our normal reporting and seminar routines.</p>
          <p>So, let's get started. I believe the results we reported this morning are strong, considering the persistent economic weakness in many parts of the world and the impact this is having on consumer confidence and spending.</p>
          <p>Top and bottom line growth has been robust in most of our developing market businesses, driven by application of our organic growth strategies and returns on our investment in brands, sales and distribution capability and production capacity.</p>
          <p>Strong economic fundamentals are underpinning great performances in Latin America and Africa. And whilst growth is easing in parts of Asia, notably China, the region as a whole is still advancing. However, demand in our more mature markets is still weak and has not recovered in most beer-drinking demographic groups.</p>
          <p>Consumer confidence is low amidst employment fears, as are economic growth forecasts. The group's Organic Lager volume growth of 3% reflects this mixed picture with Africa and Latin America growing at 15% and 8% respectively, while Asia has slowed to 4%. Europe and South Africa are level with the prior year and MillerCoors sales to retailers are down 2%.</p>
          <p>Group profitability has remained resilient with Organic constant currency EBITA growth of 6%, despite the U.S. volume weakness and negative sales mix. Our developing market businesses have delivered not only strong volume growth but also healthy margin gains.</p>
          <p>As you know, we also announced two major transactions in the first half, representing further exciting growth avenues: Foster's, a big opportunity to deploy our commercial and operational skills; and Efes, a strategic partnership and great foot for our two groups which will provide a leading regional presence in a part of the world we believe has excellent growth prospects.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Jamie to take you through the details of our financial results. After which, I'll return with a look at our operational performance in the half. Jamie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day to everyone. My presentation will focus on results in an organic constant currency basis, as this reflects our underlying performance and profitability before foreign exchange translation impacts.</p>
          <p>The group has delivered good adjusted earnings per share growth in terms of all of our major currencies in the first six months. Adjusted earnings per share in our reporting currency of U.S. dollars was up 11%. The interim dividend is $0.215 per share, which represents an increase of 10% over the same period last year. We delivered good performance in the first half of the year despite varied trading conditions across our markets. Lager volumes were up 2.7% on an organic basis versus the prior year, driven by strong growth in Latin America and Africa and good growth in Asia.</p>
          <p>North America and Europe continue to experience difficult economic and trading conditions and consequently, consumer spending was suppressed across these markets. Organic volume, selective pricing and some positive mix benefits led to organic constant currency revenue growth of 6.3%, which drove EBITA growth of 5.6%.</p>
          <p>However, our raw material input costs, increasing marketing investment to support the brand development and increased fixed costs impacted EBITA margin leading to 10 basis points decline. Reported EBITA was up almost 10%, benefiting from the relative strength of our major operating currencies against the U.S. dollar in the first half.</p>
          <p>The Organic group revenue growth of 6.3% was driven almost equally by volume and pricing mix benefits, reflecting strong volume growth in our developing markets and firm pricing in South Africa, North America, Africa, and Asia.</p>
          <p>In addition to these pricing benefits, favorable mix benefits were generated across all divisions except for Europe, reflecting the strength of our local and international Premium Brand portfolio. Revenue from our Premium Brand portfolio grew 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth from our local Premium Brands in a number of key markets. Reported group revenue also benefited from the strength of the South African rand and the Colombian peso, the currencies in Central and Eastern Europe, against the dollar compared to the first half of the prior year.</p>
          <p>Group revenue per hectoliter grew 3% on an organic constant currency basis and all regions over in Europe achieved revenue per hectoliter growth over the period. Latin America benefited from selective price increases and favorable brand mix. Local Premium Brands grew strongly across the region, supported by good growth in Club Colombia in Colombia, Cusque&#xF1;a in Peru and Club in Ecuador.</p>
          <p>In Europe, revenue per hectoliter was in line with the prior year with moderate price increases taken where possible, largely offset by tactical discounting in response to competitive price reductions. In North America, MillerCoors benefited from the firm prior year pricing and favorable brand mix. The Tenth &amp; Blake Craft and Import division exhibited strong growth, supported by Blue Moon and innovative seasonal brand extensions of the Leinenkugel brand.</p>
          <p>Africa grew 8% overall, with growth of 11% in our African subsidiary businesses assisted by [price] in both the prior and current year and positive mix benefits. Mix benefited from strong growth in our local regional Premium Brands, in particular the Castle brand portfolio, which grew over 30% in the period.</p>
          <p>In Asia, revenue per hectoliter grew double-digits as a result of price and mix benefits in both China and India. China's mix benefited from increased presence in the Premium segment and on-premise channels through the continued expansion of Snow Draft. In South Africa, the performance was underpinned by robust pricing taken in both beer and soft drinks in the fourth quarter of last year, supported by positive brand and packs mix, driven principally by the continued growth in Castle Lite.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITA grew 5.6% in the first half of the year, largely as a result of the volume and revenue benefits previously mentioned. Cost of goods sold were adversely affected by higher brewing and packaging raw material costs, and increased fuel costs. Marketing spend increased in line with revenue as we continue to invest behind our local and international brands, particularly across our strong growth markets of Latin America and Africa. And in South Africa, we continue to intensify our market-facing investment which was partially aided by savings in other areas.</p>
          <p>Fixed costs increased reflecting additional spend to support market-facing and systems capabilities across a number of our operations and the corporate center. Our corporate center costs included incremental costs associated with our capability program. Overall, however, after adjusting for inflation, real fixed costs were broadly in line with the prior year on a constant currency basis per hectoliter. All regions other than Europe and North America increased their EBITA and with particularly good growth from Latin America, Africa, South Africa, and Asia. Organic EBITA grew 10.1% reflecting the impact of favorable currency moves of some $112 million.</p>
          <p>Margin in Latin America benefited from the year-on-year total volume growth of 9%, mix benefits and real fixed cost productivity, which more than offset higher raw material costs and marketing spend. Encouragingly, Africa delivered EBITA margin growth, after a number of years of margin decline, as the business more than fully utilized its new capacity footprint and benefited from price increases and favorable mix benefits.</p>
          <p>Asia's EBITA margin improvement was driven by a combination of volume growth, mix benefits and price increases. And in South Africa, pricing benefits coupled with lower overall raw material costs contributed to a return to EBITA margin growth. Group margin was impacted by trading and economic conditions in North America and Europe, together with an increase in corporate costs as previously mentioned. EBITA margin in Europe was also adversely affected by increased discounts and higher cost of goods sold, partly offset by lower marketing and fixed costs.</p>
          <p>Raw material input costs for the half year were up low single digits versus the prior year on a constant currency basis &#x2013; per hectoliter basis, in line with our previous guidance. Most regions experienced an increase in brewing raw material costs following higher barley and sugar prices, together with an increase in a number of packaging raw materials. Foreign currency moves partially mitigated these underlying commodity price increases in the first half of the year. Higher fuel costs drove distribution costs higher and total cost of goods sold increased low single digits.</p>
          <p>Total exceptional charges of $191 million have been taken against profit in the first six months of the year. Our business capability program related exceptional costs totaled $115 million in the first half of the year, mainly relating to expanded systems template design and preparation costs to deploy the global systems. The rate of spend is significantly lower than the same period last year. $15 million of the exceptional charges relate to the Black Economic Empowerment program in South Africa for non-cash IFRS to share-based payment charges relating to the employee component of that scheme. Restructuring projects in Latin America resulted in exceptional charges of $12 million and $15 million. Non-cash loss was generated on the disposal of the distribution business in Italy.</p>
          <p>Transaction related advisors costs associated with the potential acquisition of the Foster's Group Limited amounted to $18 million in the first half of exceptional charges. In addition, finance costs including an exceptional gain of $19 million relating to the proposed transaction were included there. $35 million of exceptional charges relate to the group's share of impairment of the Sparks brand in MillerCoors.</p>
          <p>Our business capability program continues to progress with cumulative net operating benefits worth $60 million in the first half of the year. These mainly reflect an expanding range of procurement initiatives together with efficiency gains and cost savings from the European manufacturing project. These benefits are net of higher IT-related spend.</p>
          <p>We continue to make progress in developing process and system changes. The template implemented in South Africa and corporate last year has been extended to cover a much fuller scope and has gone live in Ecuador at the start of this month. During August and September, remaining <mark type="indiscernible" /> treasury activities were transferred to our European Treasury Center.</p>
          <p>Exceptional costs in the first half have reduced compared to last year's rate and will fall following the second half as the central program structure starts to be scaled back. Preparation for rollout of the global template has involved some buildup of IT capability as global and regional structures are put in place. IT management has been strengthened to ensure that we get full value for these further charges.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA comprising EBITDA before cash flows from exceptional items, together with dividends received from MillerCoors, increased 7% on the prior year as the result of increased operating profit, partially offset by lower MillerCoors dividends and lower cash exceptional items.</p>
          <p>We have continued to generate further working capital cash inflows in the first half, building the significant working capital cash inflows achieved over the last two years. Capital expenditure of $680 million was $146 million higher than last year, following the continued capacity investments in Africa and Latin America in particular. Free cash flow continued to improve, up $235 million this year, principally as a result of higher EBITDA, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditure. Adjusted net finance costs decreased 19% to $229 million, predominantly due to reduction in net debt.</p>
          <p>And the group's effective rate of tax of 28.5% was 50 basis points lower than the rate for the first half of last year as a result of general tax efficiencies throughout the group and our successful appeal against <mark type="indiscernible" /> of Russian royalty cases.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position at the 30th of September has decreased over the last six months as a result of our strong cash flow, as well as benefiting from depreciation of certain currencies in which a proportion of our debt is denominated against the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>On the 1st of July we have repaid a $600 million bond from our cash resources. Our financial structure continues to strengthen with gearing falling to 28.9% and net debt to adjusted EBITDA down to 1.1 times. Our access to liquidity remains strong with committed headroom available to the group of approximately $3 billion as at 30th of September. This does not include the U.S. $12.5 billion facility put in place in September of this year for the purpose of the acquisition of Foster's. Our weighted average interest rate as at 30 September has dropped slightly to 6.1% from 5.9% as at March of this year. This has been driven in part by an increase in rates in Africa as well as the repayment of low-interest rate, short-term, floating rate debt from our strong flat cash flows.</p>
          <p>And now moving on to our financial outlook, which excludes the impact of the potential Foster's and Efes transactions, we expect the mixed trading conditions experienced in the first half of the year to continue throughout the remainder of the year. We anticipate that growth in the consumer demand will continue to be driven by most of our developing market businesses, whilst economic and trading conditions in the U.S. and Europe are not expected to improve over the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>As indicated earlier in my presentation, reported results are expected to be affected by adverse currency news in the second half of the year, given the recent weakness in a number of our key operating currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Full year raw material input costs are expected to be higher than last year, up low single digits with cost increases across a number of the key brewing and packaging raw materials. Favorable currency hedging positions are expected to partially mitigate these commodity cost increases. These commodity cost pressures are expected to continue into the following financial year. We continue to focus on all components of working capital, but expect working capital cash inflows to be moderate over the full year, given the significant benefits delivered over the last two years.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure for the full year is expected to amount to approximately $1.7 billion, up some $200 million on our last preliminary announcement guidance of $1.5 billion. Additional capacity related capital expenditure in a number of markets in Africa accounts for the bulk of this increase, including a new maltings plant in Uganda, significant capacity expansion at our Ndola brewery in Zambia and further capacity expansions in <mark type="indiscernible" /> Tanzania breweries.</p>
          <p>Full year financials, excluding the possible impact of the Foster's acquisition, will be lower than last year as a result of a lower net debt position. And second half finance costs will approximate to those of the first half. Finally our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be in line with the half-year rate of 28.5%, compared to the prior year full-year rate of 28.2%.</p>
          <p>In September we were pleased to reach an agreement with the board of Foster's on a recommended proposal to acquire Foster's at an acquisition enterprise value of AUD11.5 billion, based on estimated net debt upon completion and adjusted for the present value of historical losses. The proposed acquisition is to be implemented by means of a scheme of arrangement and subject to receiving all necessary regulatory and court approvals and approval of the Foster's shareholders at meetings which have now been convened for the first of December. We expect to complete the acquisition on the 16th of December. We obtained committed financing for the acquisition. Based on our currency and interest rate risk management policy we expect the blended cost of incremental debt to be around 5% on a pre-tax basis.</p>
          <p>In October, we announced our intention to form a strategic alliance with Anadolu Efes. We will transfer our Russian and Ukrainian businesses to Anadolu Efes and we will take a 24% equity stake in the enlarged group, which will be the vehicle for both our groups' investments in Turkey, Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, Central Asia and the Middle East. Subject to finalization of the definitive legal agreements and relevant regulatory approvals, we would expect to complete the transaction before the end of the financial year.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jamie. Now turning to a review of our divisional businesses. This is Latin America, where our commercial initiatives have driven strong volume growth, resulting from brand and pack enhancements and our focus on affordability in Colombia and elsewhere. In Colombia, Lager volumes grew 7%, benefiting from that price restraint, new creative platforms, activations for the Under-20 Soccer World Cup, and more focused trade execution.</p>
          <p>We've begun year round distribution of the previously seasonal Club Colombia Roja, which has attracted new consumers to the category, while upper mainstream Aguila Light continues its rise, up nearly 50%. The introduction of a smaller Pony Malta pack and extended distribution drove double digit volume growth for that brand and we recently launched a new, refreshing, good-for-you malt brand called Maltizz, complementing Pony Malta, put it in a different, broader soft drink market segment.</p>
          <p>Peru delivered robust volume growth of 11%, resulting in a further gain in beer market share. Cusque&#xF1;a volumes were up 25%, capitalizing on its Peruvian heritage and the centenary of the discovery of Machu Picchu, while Pilsen Callao's growth reflected its successful repositioning and new packaging. In Ecuador, a return to growth in the second quarter followed the cycling of government restrictions on the sale of alcohol on Sundays and our successful rollout of a direct service model.</p>
          <p>Despite relatively restrained pricing, we grew EBITA by 16% in organic constant currency and raised our EBITA margin by over one percentage point. Sales mix was positive with growth in Premium and Upper Mainstream volumes of over 20%, up three points to 20% &#x2013; 27% of regional Lager volume. This was accompanied by better operational leverage and continued cost efficiency improvements.</p>
          <p>As regards MillerCoors in the United States, industry trading conditions have remained difficult and we are seeing a polarization in consumer groups and in product segments. Premium Light's performance is still hampered by unemployment amongst key beer drinkers. But Coors Light is continuing its share gains within the segment.</p>
          <p>Consumer uptrading is affecting Premium Light volumes, driven in part by a reduced price gap to imports and crafts, with little or no pricing taken by brewers in those segments. The underperformance of Miller Lite is being addressed with new work. And we're optimistic about the prospects of the newly-rebranded Miller 64 in the ultra low calorie segment.</p>
          <p>The Tenth &amp; Blake division has led the growth in the rising Craft and Import segments with the Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's franchises gaining further strength and breadth with very successful seasonals. MillerCoors is also selectively expanding distribution of Peroni Nastro Azzurro. Their investment in category management is paying off with supplier recognitions from key chains such as Target, 7-Eleven, and Outback Steakhouse. A key independent retailer survey recently rated MillerCoors as the leading beer supplier; and distributors rated MillerCoors number one for category management in the well-known Tamarron survey.</p>
          <p>At MillerCoors' inception, it was category captain for 24% of its chain volume and this is now at 35% and climbing. There's evidence that this is benefiting retailers as the beer volume trend in retail accounts where MillerCoors is captain beat the trend in those led by a principal competitor by nearly three points. Profitability of MillerCoors benefited from gains in price and mix but these were more than offset by the effect of lower volumes, increased commodity costs, and higher fixed costs, including further investment in systems.</p>
          <p>In Europe, as has been widely reported, very poor weather with unusually high rainfall cast a pall over beer volumes in July and in early August. The effect was especially pronounced across Central Europe. Apart from that, the trend was for low single digit volume growth in the region. A broad pattern of competitor actions across most of the region is reducing industry profitability. These actions include permanent price reductions and moving brands, in some cases flagship brands, down between segments, with price moves of 10%, 20% and more. Significantly deeper modern trade discounts are being offered as well as unprecedented efforts to list branded beer in the discount channel at price tiers once occupied only by minor private label products.</p>
          <p>Some of our peers have undertaken major marketing and investment in economy brands, further encouraging down trading in the environment of soft consumer confidence. This latter point is particularly concerning as driving consumers into economy brands compromises the brand equity structure and profitability that we worked to create over many years. The impact of negative mix on industry profitability can be very significant.</p>
          <p>In this context we are maintaining our focus on the protection and growth of our leading brand equities in the Local Mainstream and Local Premium segments. We're striving to optimize revenue and limit the impact of competitor actions on our profitability, balancing volume and value share and limiting discounts. There is evidence of this approach in our revenue per hectoliter and EBITA margin performance, both of which are better than the peer group.</p>
          <p>We've also had good commercial success to report in Russia and Hungary where we've gained market share and in Czech Republic, led by Pilsner Urquell and Kozel. And during the period we acquired the rights to the St Stefanus brand, a Belgian abbey ale which we believe has good prospects as a niche part of our full portfolios across a number of markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to a very different context, our African businesses, comprising a broad portfolio of markets across the continent, have continued to deliver strong growth. Intensified market execution initiatives and in-trade investment are bringing new consumers into the beer category and resulting in share gains in competitive markets such as Tanzania and Ghana. Our approach of extending our price ladders up and down, reaching more consumers on more occasions, continues to bear fruit.</p>
          <p>In the Premium segment, our Castle family of Castle Lager, Castle Milk Stout and Castle Lite grew 34%, with Castle Lite's growth particularly strong. And lower down the price ladder we've expanded the Eagle franchise beyond Uganda to a total of five markets. And we've extended the reach of our traditional beers such as Chibuku beyond Southern Africa with availability in nine markets.</p>
          <p>The volume and operational leverage of our investments in capacity expansion as well as price and mix improvements resulted in pleasing growth in profitability and margins for the half year. Further expansion is underway in Nigeria and South Sudan. And as Jamie has said, we expect more investment in the coming year to meet the growth opportunities, notably in Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia.</p>
          <p>In South Africa the consumer economy was soft during the period, as the early recovery seemed to stall. Last year's World Cup boosted the prior year comparable, while buying power amongst poorer consumers has been affected by sharp rises in the cost of fuel, food and electricity.</p>
          <p>Strong revenue growth was delivered with price increases and improved mix, despite volumes which were level for beer and down by 3% in soft drinks. Better sales mix was driven primarily by excellent growth in Castle Lite, priced at an improved premium to mainstream and gaining share within the Premium segment.</p>
          <p>Our other focused brands have also shown better competitive performance with integrated campaigns and benefiting from leading sales service. This has all contributed to an overall stabilization of our market share within beer and of overall alcohol.</p>
          <p>Revenue management, variable cost savings and fixed cost productivity once again enabled increased investment in market facing activities, while also driving reported margins up by half a point. Soft drink input costs were significantly up due to sugar and resin. But despite this and the effects of an unusually wet, cold winter, soft drinks contributed to the margin growth due to significant savings from a re-engineering of the supply chain.</p>
          <p>In Asia, revenue growth for the half has once again accelerated and operating margins are rising. In China, the summer peak was marred by persistent flooding in the central provinces. But price increases have held up well. This year sales mix was enhanced by improved distribution of Snow's premium variants. These grew very strongly during the first two quarters and now represent over 20% of CRSnow's volumes. Thus, revenue per hectoliter, which is still extraordinarily low in China, was up 14% in organic constant currency. Snow market share continues to grow organically whilst at the same time CRSnow leads the overall industry consolidation with judicious bolt-on M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>In India, we are concentrating efforts in states where our brand and pack innovation and commercial capabilities can drive profitable growth. This approach has delivered growth and a welcome increase in profitability, despite an overall market decline in response to very large and unforeseen increases in excise duty in some key states. Australia delivered excellent <mark type="indiscernible" />, led by Grolsch, Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Bluetongue, with strong sales execution. And the Warnervale brewery is now in full swing.</p>
          <p>Now before I conclude, a reminder that our strategic priorities remain consistent and we continue to make good progress against each. We've made clear progress in furthering our balanced and attractive global spread of businesses. The proposed Foster's transaction will provide us with the leading position in the Australian beer market and with it the opportunity to deploy our commercial capabilities to enhance the category, to enhance the Foster's portfolio and its operations.</p>
          <p>At the same time, our proposed new partnership with Efes will provide us with excellent exposure to growth in Turkey, Central Asia, and a much enhanced business model and position in Russia. We continue to develop strong relevant brand portfolios that enable us to win in our local markets. You've seen the outcome in our results, and we illustrate a few examples here on the slide such as Cusque&#xF1;a in Peru, Blue Moon in the U.S., Castle Lite across Africa and South Africa; and Safari in Tanzania.</p>
          <p>Across our businesses, we are generating robust growth from category or segment-leading brands that are connecting deeply with targeted local consumers based on local insights and portfolio structures. As Jaime and I have highlighted, we continue to raise the profitability of local businesses, led this year by our developing market divisions. As I said, this is being driven by deliberate revenue management and sales mix enhancements as well as cost efficiency and productivity.</p>
          <p>And finally, we are further leveraging our skills and global scale, most clearly illustrated in the extension of our global procurement platform to new categories. This year's additions include key packaging materials such as cans and kegs and we've moved into the sales and distribution functions to include fridges and truck fleets, big areas of expenditure with attractive savings opportunities.</p>
          <p>And so to conclude, we expect the mix trading conditions experienced in the first half to continue through the remainder of the year. Economic and market environments in the U.S. and Europe remain difficult even as robust growth continues in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia. But overall, our revenue and profitability have proven to be resilient, growing despite the headwinds and benefiting from the consistent application of our organic growth strategies.</p>
          <p>Price increases will be taken selectively and initiatives to reduce costs and increase efficiency will continue, mitigating the effect of rising input costs and funding increased investment in brands, sales capabilities and systems.</p>
          <p>We look forward to completing our acquisition of Foster's and finalizing our alliance with Anadolu Efes. Our underlying financial position as well as our medium term outlook for growth in volume, revenue and profitability remain strong.</p>
          <p>And with that, Operator, we'll be glad to take some questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Graham, I was hoping you could expand maybe generally so, but about your pricing strategy, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. With volumes being weak and it appears input cost pressures are getting more difficult in the second half, I was curious about the flexibility that you think you may have with respect to taking pricing. And then particularly in light of what your competitors are doing, how much room do you think you have to take up pricing over the near term?</p>

          <p>Well I think the two situations are quite different. America pricing, as you're aware I'm sure, has been pretty firm and we expect it to continue like that. Some of the gap closures that have been talked about between the different pricing tiers have probably started to come &#x2013; or are getting towards coming to an end. But still overall pricing I think will remain firm.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. it's not really a pricing problem. The growth in the U.S. market is in the high-priced segment and there's leaching out of the Premium Light segment, or the Premium segment, up into the Super Premium segment actually. So, fundamentally, I don't think that the U.S. market constitutes a pricing problem.</p>
          <p>In Europe, pricing is very tight, but it's tight because of mix effects and promotional discounting and overall discounting more than anything else. It is possible to put through frontline pricing, but there is trading down going on. There's no question about it. In our markets, the top of the market is not performing as well as it is in the U.S., although it is performing better than the middle. The problem is more that the middle of the market is being undercut down into the economy segments and into economy channels.</p>
          <p>So, overall, pricing is more of an issue in Europe. It's more of a general issue, if you like, but driven more by mix shifts both channel and brand than anything else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess as a follow-up to that answer, as we see some margin pressure at both of these divisions, how do you think about stabilizing that decline? Is it through pricing or you're seeing more benefit flowing through on the cost savings line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no silver bullet to this situation. I mean there are cost savings coming through in both the U.S. and Europe. In fact, and both divisions have delivered heroic cost savings programs, the U.S. of course aided by the synergy extraction from the merger, but also subsequent costs savings. And in Europe, perhaps even more difficult to achieve the cost savings, but they have, nevertheless.</p>
          <p>And why it's so difficult is because things are volatile between the different countries and we've got a much more dispersed and fragmented production base, and in fact base of businesses there. So, in both Europe and the U.S., they are taking costs out constantly and new programs are formulated. We don't generally go out to the market with big packaged cost reduction programs, but there are cost reductions going on all the time.</p>
          <p>It's just very difficult to maintain margins in these circumstances because operational leverage is a major effect in beer. Now, overall, the margin pressures, which as I say, I think are being managed well in both Europe and the U.S., those margin pressures are being balanced by margin expansion in our other businesses. And so we are &#x2013; we believe that margins will stay relatively static, certainly out for the foreseeable future, including the next half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can I have one question on South Africa? You mentioned that you believe your share is now stable and your margin growth is starting to come through as per your expectations. As this is obviously the key Christmas selling period, do you feel that you've now got the South Africa business back on a competitive footing or do you think you will continue to invest ahead of sales to ensure that through this Christmas?</p>
          <p>And then &#x2013; sorry, a financing question, just for Jamie. Could I clarify the finance guidance? You're saying finance costs in line with H1. Are you saying 6.1%. Were you saying an underlying $229 million charge, because that's a quite a bit lower? And a final &#x2013; sorry, I know it's meant to be one question. But on the minority charge, I really can't square the $103 million charge. There's nothing in the notes to indicate that there's an exceptional element. So, could you possibly break out the $103 million? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, let me talk about South Africa and I'll ask Jamie to handle the other two. Yes, I think South Africa is, to the extent you can ever make a statement like this, fully competitive. You can never rest on your laurels. They are beavering away doing new things all the time. But the principal accomplishments have really been upping the quality of support behind the big brands in South Africa and improving the in-trade execution of those positionings, dramatically actually.</p>
          <p>So, if you &#x2013; I don't know when you were last in South Africa and wandered around the trade there. I think you'll see tremendously enhanced competitiveness at retail. You'll see, I think, good advertising, good support in consumer marketing. And I think that it is stable. We are still taking out and trying to find ways of taking out non-market facing fixed costs. I think we will be able to do that over time and invest them further in the market. So, you can't ever stop and declare a victory, but the business is performing well, I believe, and that's evidenced by the fact that market share is stable despite the fact that our exposure to the high-end in South Africa is disproportionately low. So, there is a built-in structural headwind, if you like, which we're overcoming. But we are doing it.</p>
          <p>Jamie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think your two questions on financing was first about the finance cost in the second half. I mean clearly our debt position is coming down and therefore we were expecting the finance costs in the second half to be broadly in line with the first half in terms of the total cost to the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you very much. I'd like to focus if I can on input costs and I guess there are two sub questions here. First of all, you've obviously said that the rate is increasing slightly, both this fiscal second half and into next year. Would I be right to assume that you're really talking about let's say mid-single digits if I talked about calendar '12? I know you don't normally talk about calendar, but is that sort of where we're heading towards?</p>
          <p>And also I read, or saw, Jamie's interview with Cantos this morning. And one of the things that surprised me about that is he said that glass costs if anything are coming down, whereas we've heard from companies like Owens-Illinois that glass costs are going up pretty sharply. And I was just wondering if you could reconcile those two points. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm happy to do that. I mean yes, your view on input costs is right. I mean, we are in low-single digits for this financial year, but there is a slight upward pressure in the second half, which will continue to next year, which will take us more towards mid-single digits for next calendar year. And that's driven mainly by a number of things; I mean the barley prices are continuing to stay high. I mean the total supply and demand of barley is still &#x2013; hasn't got comfortable position because in Europe we had some hot dry weather in the western half of Europe during the growing season and some wet weather in eastern Europe when actually the crops were coming out of the ground and being harvested.</p>
          <p>So, if you then ally that with similar conditions in America, we haven't really seen any easing of the pressure of the total stocks of barley that's going to create a downward pressure on barley. In terms of the glass point, I'm talking specifically from our perspective, we have been working hard to ensure that our packaging costs in conjunction with our procurement company, Trinity, have been coming down and we're expecting next year to see some savings in our glass supply costs, slightly balanced by the can side, which might be slightly higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can I ask a follow-up question on that, on barley? What about the southern hemisphere harvest? I know it's sort of early days, but how is that looking? And I assume that's factored into that sort of mid-ish single digit guidance that you're talking about for the calendar year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, I mean our estimates do factor that in. I mean it is too early to tell, at the end of the day with all these crops, until you actually have them out of the ground and in the warehouses you don't know exactly what the yields are going to be and what the quality is going to be. So, I really can't comment on what that crop will look like when we actually get access to it. But I don't think that it will have a material impact on, or we're not expecting a material impact on overall barley pricing.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Could I ask please, regarding the increased competitor promotional activity in Europe? I just wanted to confirm whether this is occurring mainly in Poland and Romania where your revenue per hectoliter was obviously negative today, or is it more widespread than that? And also, as we approach the key Christmas selling season, is that promotional activity getting any worse or any better?</p>
          <p>And then in addition if I may, the impression I get is that the business standardization program is perhaps progressing better than your original expectations and I wondered whether this meant that you might eventually exceed the $300 million of targeted cost savings, and indeed whether the revenue benefits from that program that you've alluded to have yet begun to materialize. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as your pricing and mix questions from Europe are concerned, as you would expect it's &#x2013; it is a mixed picture. You pointed out Poland and Romania, that's absolutely right. There have been similar events in Russia of course, but we are relatively isolated, or insulated, from that in Russia. In fact those tendencies are evident in Czech as well. So, it is pretty broad spread. The fighting against it is tactical, and a region-wide response is not appropriate, not called for. But certainly those two markets, yeah, Poland and Romania particularly hard hit, Russia hard hit, Czech actually reasonably hard hit as well, but we have very strong brand equities in Czech.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you want me to pick up the point on the business capability programs, I mean they are progressing well in terms of value delivery. I think I would categorize that more at the moment of achieving the benefits slightly quicker than we had anticipated. We're not yet prepared to say that we're going to exceed materially the number that we announced to the market before in terms of the $300 million. We may exceed it, but at the moment I think we're saying that we're just achieving some of the benefits more quickly. And in particular the point you're talking about, the revenue benefits, I mean, as I said in my comments, we have only just deployed the front office part of our template for the first time a few weeks ago in Ecuador. So, it's very early days yet in terms of that part of the program.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yes. My question is on input costs again, sorry. But, just in relation to the FX aspect, you mentioned that in the first half that the low single digit organic inflation was partially mitigated by favorable FX. Is that favorable FX factor going to reduce as we go into the second half and into 2012, so that actually your real input pressures are actually slightly greater than the change in organic would suggest?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, as you'd expect, most of our short term commodities, in terms of the ForEx element, are hedged for a reasonable period. So, for this year I'm not expecting material changes around ForEx affecting our input costs. I mean, obviously as you go out into the future then clearly there's a limit to how much hedging you are doing on those transactions. Certainly in the short term, we are pretty well covered.</p>

          <p>Good morning, gents. Thanks for taking the question. My question is really around LatAm soft drinks. You flagged double-digit volume growth of Pony Malta and the successful rollout of Maltizz. Are you able to comment on the profitability of Pony Malta versus beer given the lack of excise there? And also against some of the Coke CSPs given that you act as brand owner and not just bottler? And further to that, are you able to comment on opportunities to roll out Pony Malta across the wider LatAm region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't release actual margin numbers on individual products, but certainly Pony Malta has a very healthy margin and &#x2013; as do the other products that we sell in the region. Pony Malta itself we are rolling out &#x2013; have rolled out into other countries but we have other names. We have Malta Vigor, Maltin Power in Peru, what's the other one? Yeah, anyway. I mean it's based on local research into the name and so on, but the approach is relatively similar throughout.</p>
          <p>The new Maltizz is a clear malt, lighter, more refreshing, less nutritious. And we think that that has a separate opportunity, but they're all pretty strong margin performers, certainly comparable to beer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and I mean as a share of your soft drinks portfolio with LatAm, are you able to comment what proportion is comprised of brands that you own?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't got that number in my mind, I'm afraid. No, I mean, the two countries where they are not our brands are only &#x2013; well, no, it's not right. The two countries with big soft drink businesses where it's not our brands are Honduras and El Salvador where we are part of the Coke system, and in fact we have Pepsi range of brands and some milk and juices in Panama as well. But because of the nature of, as you pointed out, our franchise operations, the malt drinks are considerably more profitable per unit than those.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And just a follow-up question, perhaps for Jamie, point of clarification on the share of associates and joint venture taxation. It seems to be significantly ahead of the share of associates and joint venture's operating profit. Is there anything funny within that number or, I mean, are you able to comment on that?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not particularly. There's nothing particularly funny in that. I mean, at the end of the day, it becomes a mix issue depending on where actually the profits fall.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Graham, Morning Jamie. I'm sorry to disappoint you to stay with the tone of the rather dull questioning this morning. Just a technical question on Efes. In terms of integration of Efes into the broader European sphere of business and thinking more along the lines of Trinity, is there going to be an opportunity for some broader procurement potential cost benefits and also process optimization benefits from the transaction?. Although you will only have 24% of the entity, the enlarged volume base may well offer opportunities for the European business and, although it's been prosecuted on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Julian, it's a fair question and the answer is that we have no specific plans on that as yet. We haven't concluded the deal yet, in fact we haven't signed definitive agreements as yet and we are still looking at integration, planning, management, teams, that kind of stuff. That's all going on apace, but we're nowhere near being able to take a definitive view on that. The way the management structure will work is that we will have directors on the Efes group board, three directors. And we will also have directors on the Russia board where the most important integration has to take place. And we expect to continue to give quite a lot of input into how that business is run...</p>

          <p>...over time. Now, if there are procurement benefits to be had, I'm sure that we'll look at those. Obviously Efes themselves have their own arrangements. And it will be a question of where the greater benefit can come from.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Concerning your CapEx guidance, it's up from $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, and this follows a period that it moved a bit to a lower level. Are we now cycling up again for a longer time period? What is the expectation for 2012 on CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think the specific move up as we said, was to do with our investments in our African businesses which have been &#x2013; were not in the original guidance and we have seen with success those businesses, the requirements for that CapEx to move forward slightly. I mean I think we &#x2013; I don't want to give specific guidance at this stage, but I think we're broadly in the range of where we are at the moment, would be where I'd expect it to continue into next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. How's your utilization rate in Latin America at this moment? Does that need expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have announced a little bit of an expansion in Peru, where, which is obviously to align the capacity with the growth in sales there. But otherwise, I think we're quite comfortable. We've been through expansion in a number of areas in Latin America, so we're not under any pressure there at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when we closed the Bogot&#xE1; brewery and reassigned production and upgraded others, there was effectively a capacity expansion in that. The situation between Latin America and Africa, situations are quite different in the sense that Latin America has big breweries, by and large, a relatively small number of big markets. And so, the capital utilization is efficient. I'm afraid that's not really true in Africa, because we have a large number of smaller breweries and we're in fact increasing the number of breweries right now. Now, that is commercially the right thing to do. And we get a handsome return on it, but it's not capital efficient, per se, or certainly not, nothing like the capital efficiency we get in our bigger, more unitary businesses.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. My question is about LatAm and it is whether you expect to continue your focus on delivering value for consumer, or whether encouraged by very good volume performance, you might just prepare to open your throttle a bit on pricing in that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's &#x2013; these questions on pricing, I'm afraid I'm &#x2013; are, with respect, are not worth illuminating because the situation does vary from country to country. For instance, in Colombia, which is the biggest country, we think that our prices are a little bit too high if you look at the elasticity studies that we've done. So, we think that there's a great deal of merit in toning those down in real terms over time.</p>
          <p>That's not actually true across the whole of the continent. So, it is on a case-by-case basis. But I think &#x2013; and if one can generalize, I would say that the pricing approach that we're adopting right now is working well, so I wouldn't be inclined to change it dramatically.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, can I just go back to Chris's questions on your debt and minorities? When you say that in the second half you expect your net interest to be the same as it was in the first half, I assume that's before any interest related to the Foster's acquisition. Would that be right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Thank you. And on the minorities, I mean, obviously a lot going on in there in the first half. I just wonder whether you could give us a clue as to whether the second half minority charge will be similar to the one in the first half, leaving aside all the sort of ins and outs and ups and downs of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The minority charge for &#x2013; which part of the minority charge, sorry? You mean the &#x2013; the total thing, or are you talking any specific within that? The total we'd expect to be broadly the same and that's not commenting on tax or anything that relates into the movements and how we calculate that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, it is &#x2013; it's that observation that I was after, the sort of bottom line impact for the second half. So, if we can take it that it's going to be pretty similar in the second half...</p>

          <p>Thank you. We have a follow-up question from Adam J. Spielman from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, first of all, thank you very much for allowing me a second question. I noticed that you mentioned that Asia was slowing. And I think, as far as I can tell, you're really talking about China. So, if you can sort of confirm that. And are we talking &#x2013; if you can just expand on why that is, is it permanent? Is it in mid-price or is it equally in the Premium side of Snow? If you can just expand on that comment and how significant we should think it is. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the comment does relate mainly to China. But having said that, we did comment also about some pretty swinging excise increases in India which have depressed the market. Excise is state-based in India, so it's not across the whole market.</p>
          <p>Where is China heading? I don't' know that anyone knows. What you've got is consumers under &#x2013; well, business is under quite a lot of pressure because of tightening up of credit. So, credit is very tight, almost not available from the banks inside China. Consumer credit has risen, not that there's very much of that in China. And the consumer is feeling pretty beleaguered because of the, I think, well-reported cost increases that they've seen, particularly food. I mean, I think against that background for our business to have posted the organic growth that it has is pretty commendable.</p>
          <p>And again, like many other parts of the world, the interesting thing is that although the consumer is under stress in China relative to the past, certainly, they're still trading up furiously, or at least our business is getting them to trade up. I mentioned in the presentation the strong growth in our Premium variants. There is bottom of the market competition competitiveness as well and we are fighting that in our regions. But overall, you do have this paradox that even where the consumer is under stress, the top end corner of the world actually, seems to still do okay.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look at the rest of Asia, India, I've commented on in a value sense &#x2013; in a volume sense. In a value sense, actually India &#x2013; our Indian business is performing much better than it did because we are pursuing the profitable growth opportunities where they arise, rather than a perhaps more overall growth agenda.</p>
          <p>So, the commercial performance in India is a lot better than it was. And actually our little business in Australia is going gangbusters, it's been doing extremely well over the last few months. So, it's a very mixed picture. I mean the main comment, sort of underlying comment about economics, I suppose, or economically-based trends is related to China. But that's the situation in the other parts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And presumably, as you can read, I've heard obviously in different countries what you said but, you can't read too much into it because if credit is being restricted to companies, presumably the Chinese government could change that in a moment if it felt was <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Yes, of course they can. They can change that and they've also changed some tax laws as well which has withdrawn tax benefits for foreign investors and so on and they can change that on the turn as well. So, yeah, absolutely.</p>
