        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if I should say good evening or good afternoon or good morning for those in the States.</p>
          <p>But again, we are pleased to present to you, not only our 2010 results, but also our forecast and our understanding on the way the company is going to run in the mid and long-term. And the way we consider it is the best to get access to the additional profits coming from oil and gas prices &#x2013; to start with oil, and then gas in the longer-term &#x2013; in our profits and return to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Well, apparently, it's almost in London, time for a drink, and we'll keep you until it's possible. But I know we are also using Internet. And let's do it.</p>
          <p>So we decided as far we want to be more flexible, more returning to growth. I will start, then Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re, our CFO, will talk to you about results. And I will restart and take over with the outlook.</p>
          <p>So our first new dynamic strategy is not a strategy which is becoming more dynamic, it is implementation. We definitely keeping the almost &#x2013; understanding that we are in a long-term company, the cycles are long, we need to invest to make money. At the same time. And then we are getting the benefit of what you have been sending as messages, some which we understand and use, some which we consider as not being part of a long-term strategy, and which we'll keep for a long-term strategy.</p>
          <p>So, first, and not the least, bolder exploration. It's true that we have probably been a little bit, I'd say, sitting on our successes. And it was time to go to more frontier place, more I would say new ideas. And that is why we can do it. Because we are a good company doing profits and being able to take risks.</p>
          <p>So bolder exploration strategy is not only words. It's first moving to &#x2013; we'll come back on it &#x2013; to $2.1 billion capital investment. It's also moving to new areas like Guiana, back to Brunei, back to Azerbaijan with Absheron <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>Second, we strongly believe in our long-term strategy of hubs partnership, and that's why we're still moving on to new "hubs." Canada, which can be considered as not new, but you will see it. It's totally new. New partner, Suncor. New fields, quicker to be developed, quicker to get access to new production and reserves, and at the end, more efficient.</p>
          <p>Capital growth means also accelerating asset sales. And what we mean by this is not just selling for selling. We have a good balance sheet. We have a strong discipline on investment. But it's true that at the time you can sell assets at a high price and you can also have access to new reserves at a very cheap price, it's probably better to find a solution where you don't sell, because you don't believe in oil prices.</p>
          <p>You sell because you can sell mature &#x2013; company's mature fields, or not strategical one, like what we did in Angola with the Block 31, or selling our Cameroon activities or Valhall in Norway. And on the other side, get access to longer term reserves, undeveloped, like Gladstone in Australia, like maybe one day soon, Uganda, and some others.</p>
          <p>But for doing this, it's true that it's the right way, and thanks for the message, yes, we can sell some of our assets, still keeping our strong understanding that we believe in higher price of energy, so we have no reason to sell just for selling.</p>
          <p>Implementing plan to reduce European refining capacity, but I remember when we discussed in the same place not too long ago, and talking about will we be able to close the Dunkirk refinery. I know that some of you were skeptical, to say the least. It's done. In a proper way. Because it was needed. It was needed because we have to adapt our downstream activities, both refining and chemicals, to the demand. And especially in OECD, especially in Europe, where we are most exposed and definitely faced to a declining market. Also we'll come back to it.</p>
          <p>And at the end, because it's not any more what some people call greenwashing. We more and more consider that we need to go involved in the real sense in new energies projects, not as just a simple player, just trying to fight and compete with the Chinese or Indians, which is impossible and certainly not profitable. But to find ways to participate to something which is important, bring new energies, which are needed to just fill the gap between potential offer and potential demand.</p>
          <p>We continue and we see more and more, some kind of a common understanding on there will be not enough precise energies to cover the demand. There will be a lot of reserves available, but not easy to develop soon.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we need to be part of those, trying to make it also doable to develop solar, biomass, biofuels, and if possible, too, one day, nuclear when it becomes profitable and acceptable.</p>
          <p>But it's not just for image, it's a real business plan. At the same time, it represents a very small part of our investments in the year to come. So you have on one part of the slide our investments for 2010, where we spent in dollar terms almost $21 billion. But net after the sale of assets, $15.9 billion, $16 billion, which is lower than our business plan.</p>
          <p>On what is still part of the picture to start with, and having been in Davos this year, for the first time, I was surprised to see &#x2013; first, I mean Davos has been changing totally. If we don't pay attention, it will become more and more Chinese Indian. Not anymore what we call in France, people &#x2013; sorry for this &#x2013; no publicity &#x2013; but Sharon Stone was not present. But there was a lot of people coming from China, India, Africa coming and willing to discuss with us on what is the future. How can we share it? What is to be done? And especially what can we do with companies like Total.</p>
          <p>So that was frankly a strong, for me, interesting moment. And especially on this relationship with acceptability of our operations. And it was raised by most CEOs, chairmen, to say, I mean, if we want to continue to work in this business, we have to do it in different way. So it's not any more pleasing. It's not any more image. It's not any more communication. It's survival, in a good sense. It's do it or quit.</p>
          <p>And I must say that we totally support this. Why? Because of one simple reason. We operate in countries where they need from Total and others more than just we produce, we sell and we quit. So definitely, that will be more and more part of our business plan, not as being an addition, but being part of what we're doing to be a good operating company.</p>
          <p>Before all of this, of course, priority to safety and industrial risk management. We had to learn, we have to learn from what happened in Macondo. Not as being to challenge one company, but just to say look at what can happen if something like this occurs to you. Mean that it can be close to more than big problems. And if we don't do it, because we believe in it, I mean just do it because you know what it means. I mean, whatever you do, you can be the best everywhere. You should make mistakes like this, you can just keep your company.</p>
          <p>So definitely, even if we are not in the Gulf of Mexico, even if we think that we are being &#x2013; doing better in North Sea and especially in the Gulf of Guinea, we still have to be very strict on improving our safety regulations, our rules.</p>
          <p>And that's why we have decided to re-start promoting &#x2013; it doesn't mean we started &#x2013; but to re-start promoting our structure of safety, which is what we call the 12 golden rules. It's an example but a strong example of the commitment of the management on additional security, even if the company has been quite good in improving its results for the past years, in decreasing our &#x2013; what we call the recordable injury rate by 16% between 2009 and 2010.</p>
          <p>But definitely more than ever, Total will be extremely adamant to be the company being &#x2013; aiming for operational excellence. Cannot find a better word than the word which is on this slide.</p>
          <p>So that was the introduction, and I will now let Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re, our CFO, to tell you about our results, and I'll come back for the outlook.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. I will try during about 10 slides to explain what we have done in the last year.</p>
          <p>The adjusted net income increased by 26% to $13.6 billion, mostly driven by upstream. It's interesting to note that our net operating income from this segment increased by 33%, which show that we have been able to capture the increase of the oil price. And the net operating income goes up to $14 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>The return on average capital employed also benefit from the environment. The average ROACE is 17% and 21% for the upstream. You can see also a very strong rebound on the ROACE for chemical, thanks to the environment.</p>
          <p>Another point I'd like to stress out is on the right hand side of the slide is that any segment of the company contributed positively to the cash flow of the company, the net cash flows of the company being $6 billion this year.</p>
          <p>Next, so we have a strong cash flow funding our investment, and obviously the dividend that you need, with $30 billion cash flow, 21.5 from operation, basically. And the proceeds of the sales of about $5.7 billion, which funds the gross investment, the dividend and reduced debt. Our gearing, which was 26% end of 2009 was down to 22% end of 2010.</p>
          <p>The dividend $6.8 billion is financed very easily, so there is no concern about that. And the balance sheet is as strong as you can imagine with gearing of 22%.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we made a lot of things and sell varied assets as we never did in the past. On the upper right side of the slide, you see that we have sell asset for $4.6 billion, and acquired asset for about $4.7 billion. This is the first year that we managed so deeply our portfolio. The main acquisition we did was the Barnett Shale with Chesapeake &#x2013; was in Canada. The restructuring of our operation with Suncor.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; still pending, we have Uganda, which is still pending on authorization to be given by the authorities. We sell assets on the other side. We sell Jarden's Mapa Spontex, and we are in the process of selling the Lindsey Refinery. It's a long process, I do acknowledge that. But it will be done. And we entered also in the GLNG project in Australia. We sold Valhall. We sold Block 31 in Angola, all in aggregate, making for $4.7 billion of cash, which was used to fund the acquisitions we did.</p>
          <p>Upstream performance was obviously very good. This is a recovery for Total that we post a 4.3% production growth. The production for this year was 2.33 million barrel a day, driven mostly by LNG plus 40%,  also gas plus 6%, and liquids, which were down by 3%.</p>
          <p>Upstream results were increasing by 23% the net operating income per barrel, whereas the price of oil in average increased by 20%. And as usual, I would say the technical costs of Total are the best of the industry. This is a great advantage we have, and we will continue and maintain this advantage for the benefit of our operation.</p>
          <p>We have launched &#x2013; and down to 2011 &#x2013; six major projects in order to sustain our growth and of course the profitability. Surmont Phase II was launched at the beginning of 2010. Then you have Laggan-Tormore, CLOV, the Halfaya project in Iraq with CNPC being the operator, West Franklin, and GLNG, which I was just talking about, with Santos in Australia.</p>
          <p>You see on the right hand side of the slide that both projects are extremely sensitive to the oil prices. That those six major projects will generate more net operating income than the average of our portfolio. Just to give you figures, using $80 per barrel scenario, the average of our portfolio in 2010 was generating $13 per barrel of net operating income. Those six projects would generate $21 per barrel in the same environment.</p>
          <p>We not only launch new projects, we also renew deeply our exploration acreage. We are more focusing on targeting big assets, big fields. I will just point out a few one. Malaysia, Brunei, Angola, the pre-salt blocks that we acquired a few weeks ago. The same in Brazil, where we made a discovery, with Shell being the operator.</p>
          <p>So you see that we reorientated our exploration works towards bigger discoveries, and this protects  &#x2013; the potential for our exploration assets increased by 33% down to 2010. This is one of the key reorientation of our strategy to target big discoveries.</p>
          <p>The replacement rate was very good this year, and this is including acquisition of course, of 124%. If you exclude that position and use the same price than in 2009, you had replacement rate of 95%. It's quite flat. But acquisition is part of the business. And this, we are quite confident that using this replacement rate &#x2013; having this replacement rate will contribute for us for our future goals in the company and in the production.</p>
          <p>The reserve represents &#x2013; the 1P reserve represents more than 12 years of our production. The 2P represents more than 20 years. And both 12 and 20 years that has remained quite stable time after time.</p>
          <p>We had a strong contribution from LNG project. Some time I heard some of you telling me that LNG is not profitable. This is wrong. With 20% of our production coming from LNG, this represent 25% of our adjusted net operating income.</p>
          <p>We increased our exposure definitely in this year and last year from LNG coming from Yemen, from Qatar, and also from the recovery in Nigeria LNG, where the production was very low in 2009 and recovered in 2010.</p>
          <p>Please trust us when we tell you that LNG is a profitable business. And you see the figure of 20% of the production represent 25% of the adjusted net operating income.</p>
          <p>Some major changes in Downstream and Chemicals. Refining, first, we closed Dunkirk. As it was said by Christophe, it was not obvious to you &#x2013; some of you &#x2013; and we did it. We modernized the Normandy refinery in parallel of closing one of the units, the D9 unit. We are in the process currently of starting the Pork Arthur Coker, and we are in the process of selling Lindsey. I know this is a long process. It is a slow process, but it will be done.</p>
          <p>In marketing, we established a joint-venture with ERG in Italy. We are the third largest distributor now in Italy. And we are in the process of selling the U.K retail network. It is more easy to sell than the Lindsey refinery, I have to say.</p>
          <p>In the Petrochemical, we started the Ras Laffan steam-cracker in Qatar. And we entered into a joint venture for coal-to-olefin project in China.</p>
          <p>In the Specialties, we sold Mapa Spontex, which is &#x2013; and part of the Resins division also &#x2013; for an approximate aggregate of $1.2 billion. So we are divesting some non-core assets. There were a rumor on the market that we were ready to sell all of them. This is wrong. This is not true. Some other specialty chemicals assets are currently not in the pipeline of sale today.</p>
          <p>The European refining is facing difficult time as we commit to reduce our capacity and to reduce our exposure to this European refining business. We basically did it. The last event to happen is the sale of Lindsey oil refinery. If you compare &#x2013; on the left side of the slide, if you compare the capacity we had in 2006 and the capacity we'll have end of this year, this would be a strong reduction from 2.3 million barrel per day down to 1.8 million barrel per day.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we are in the process of decreasing the break-even. I fully acknowledge that the write-off we did on our refining assets participate to that. But this is not only the issue of writing down some assets. It is also the contribution of work done by our engineers and in order to optimize our refineries in Europe.</p>
          <p>And I think that's it. We'll leave the floor to Christophe for the outlook, because as you know, he has a vision.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick.</p>
          <p>I can tell you I believe you when you say LNG is a good business for Total. I strongly believe you. But I mean, remember sometimes you've told me, don't be so rude with our friends. I would have never said they are wrong. I would have said they might not be totally right. Be careful.</p>
          <p>Outlook. Well, let's go to the basics. I mean environment. Favorable medium to long-term environment. You have on that slide the oil, natural gas and refining margin.</p>
          <p>On oil, you know our old story, which by the way, has not been changing too much, even if the old peak oil &#x2013; and I'm not suppose to use it any more &#x2013; but the day where we might be a little bit short of capacities is coming. And when you look at this graph and the 2010, '20 figures. You see that we are at $93 million barrels per day of production of liquids, which is not too far of the 95, which we consider as probably in 2020, '23. It's difficult to say. Probably the day where we'll be at 95, which is the way we see it today, probably the maximum level of production available.</p>
          <p>If you add to this the H2L GTL what we call the gain on processing, and the biofuels, you achieve the 100 million, 101 million barrels per day. Which is, by the way, becoming more and more, the view of most of the energy players. I hope, as I was saying this morning, that now that most people agree on this, it's not going to be wrong. Because at the time, we were the only one to say it. And still we see it that way.</p>
          <p>Now it's very important to understand why the understanding of the market being always long and using all reasons to go long is because of this. It's not only because of Egypt. It's not only because of &#x2013; I don't know what, or cold weather or whatever. It's just because the fundamentals out there. And if you look at this in details, you will see that definitely the possibility to make it higher are becoming more and more difficult.</p>
          <p>So be careful. Today we are at 100. Doesn't mean that we might not go backward. Doesn't mean that it will be always climbing. And to a certain extent, I hope it will not be climbing too quickly, as part of accessibility and that the market can accept at the pump, being in Europe or in the States.</p>
          <p>On the gas, you might tell me that why are you just talking about Europe and Asia. Well, maybe, because I mean, Total is much more, I would say, linked to it. We are in Europe. We are in Asia. We are very little exposed in the United States, even if we believe in Shale gas, as you know. But I mean, if you look at just Europe, we see the end of the bubble, thanks to demand, by somewhere around 2014, 2015.</p>
          <p>Why? Because demand is growing. And if you look at the way first to that, especially gas coming from Russia, gas coming from &#x2013; even LNG. It starts to be a concern if you don't find new ways to develop new LNG businesses.</p>
          <p>So are we too optimistic, too pessimistic? Difficult to say, but you see it already in the market.</p>
          <p>The big gap between the HH price and the NBP price, thanks &#x2013; of course it's not yet 2015, 2014, but we see already that the European market is much more sensitive. Willing to consider the risk of being long or short, even if it's probably today much more linked with the winter season than something else.</p>
          <p>Don't forget also the cost of logistics, flexibility is also a concern. You cannot just bring ships from one place to another in two minutes time. And in our slides, you see what has been the work done by the trading division of Total on the LNG business, is trying to move more and more ships from one place to another to get access to the best markets.</p>
          <p>And the end, not the last, refining margin, even if on that slide, you see in 2015 that we have been only able to reduce &#x2013; if I can tell this &#x2013; the additional capacities from around 6 million barrels to 2 million, it's 6 million to 2 million, but coming from different places.</p>
          <p>So the additional demand, not coming from &#x2013; definitely Europe and OECD. It's coming from Asia, which means if we really are capable to reduce our capacities to this level, it means that refining margin will regain activity. And that's the reason why, even if you want to reduce our exposure, we still consider that this business is a good business for the company as being a really integrated business. And as you certainly understand, we're working more and more on bringing new additional synergies between refining marketing and petrochemicals.</p>
          <p>Objective for 2011, 2012. I repeat what I've said to start with. Priority to safety, priority to acceptability. It's a must for industry. More and more, we have to understand that with higher price, we'll have to find ways to make it acceptable. It's not only easy to say, you know, it's not our fault, price of oil is not under our control. Refining margins are what they are. Marketing margins are what they are. Then depending on markets, its linked with the euro-dollar rate. So it's not our fault. That's not sufficient. We have to find ways to have our clients to accept higher prices, because that is the way it will be.</p>
          <p>And to consider it's not our role, to consider is &#x2013; it will be just followed, that's not the case. So let's be not only prepared for it, let's be working on making this acceptable in bringing something else  in exchange, which is most probably more concerned about environment, more concerned about the way our clients leave and the way they can definitely, at the end accept a higher price, which definitely will be at the end to be paid and suffered by them.</p>
          <p>Start up of 10 large Upstream project &#x2013; I will come back to it. That's a long-term of the company. Launching of 12 other major Upstream projects, that's FIDs, I'll come back to it. The rejuvenation of our exploration &#x2013; I like this word &#x2013; portfolio. Give me a feeling of also being younger. It's also part of our strategy, and I will also come back on it.</p>
          <p>Definitely we have to continue to work on adapting our Downstream activities, Refining and Petrochemicals, to the market and demand, which doesn't mean just decreasing. Which mean decreasing it's where it's needed, making it more efficient and competitive where it's possible. And definitely is to looking for new opportunities like in the Middle East, like in Qatar, like in Korea, like maybe one day in China, to make of this profitable activity an additional way for Total to grow and make additional profit, not only in one sector. We strongly believe in Upstream, but not Upstream as the only, I would say, company's activity.</p>
          <p>And more than ever, pursue our active portfolio management, we've been more active. While I insist is true that some of few have been challenging us on this and you're right, at the same time, at a certain time, we were just willing to be wrong to get the benefit of higher price. That's what we did. It's definitely true that the market today is giving a lot of value to producing assets, even declining portfolios &#x2013; if we can sell it and buy long-term asset at a cheaper price with long-term potential and using our skills, which means selling, producing activities and buying non-producing assets. Definitely that's where the company can not only make money, but grow and grow in a profitable way.</p>
          <p>So the 10 projects are there. The next wave starts mid-2011, which means have the full impact much more on 2012 and 2011. That's why you see on the left part, which is not new I hope to you, that after a strong growth in our production in 2010, we will have a period of calm. I can use this word in 2011 &#x2013; i.e. the same production. We still mean that we have to find new production to cover the natural decline of our fields. And definitely you'll see the new restart of our production in 2012.</p>
          <p>We have the list of the project. You know them. They all are part of our &#x2013; I would say traditional business plan, except a few new ones. And that's something which has been definitely considered as a priority for the E&amp;P division, is to be able to bring project from projects to development and then to production in a much quicker way.</p>
          <p>So it's part of what you've heard as being a change in the E&amp;P division. It's not only changing the names or changing the divisions. It's just making it more aggressive, both on exploration and on bringing field production from the date you go to basic engineering to production. So 2013, you'll see a strong, important new production. 2017, which is by definition, the reason of our commitment to new growth.</p>
          <p>12 major projects. 2011, 2012. Those are FIDs. So it's not new production. You have the dates of production. I will not go on them one by one. But I mean it's a good mix of portfolio, conventional, deep offshore, heavy oil, unconventional gas and LNG. All of those projects are today well moving. Definitely on time.</p>
          <p>And the question mark on Shtokman will have to be lift before the end of March, when we'll decide on the FID. And as you remember, we have decided to split the FID, one part being gas pipe, one part being LNG. The LNG part being decided by the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>Exploration budget increased to 2.1 billion. So it's not only to go to more aggressive place, but also increasing the investment base. So between 2010 and 2011, it's moving from 1.8 to 2.1. If you go a little bit backward, which is not so long ago, five years ago, 2006, it was 1.5 million.</p>
          <p>We have a list of the different place we are targeting. Most are not only new place, but definitely  some are frontiers. And if you ask me which are the one which are the important one, I might say, I don't know. But if I start to say something still, Guiana, which has been just starting drilling. Spud is on the way. Azerbaijan spud took place in January. And the Brunei is in the next days or weeks.</p>
          <p>But all the others are part of what we will be drilling in 2011, which means a large numbers of wells, and I hope a large number of discoveries, including &#x2013; to please my British colleagues here &#x2013; including the UK, which has been, for the last past years, one of the number one of the class. So you have just one thing to do is to continue. Good luck.</p>
          <p>Next, please. That is the one you prefer. So we'll not use it. Because it's a challenging one, is on its fourth year, which means four term, four quarter and third quarter. As you probably see, we don't say any more quarters. We say years. And then you have to find out where we are on &#x2013; in the year. But I mean that's not the major thing. The major thing is our reassuring commitment on 2% production growth from 2010 to 2015.</p>
          <p>So it is a central precept, but we moved it from 2009 to 2010, and from 2010 to 2015. So we're not using the fact that we have been already doing 4% plus in 2010. So it means really new growth. And definitely, with the list of those projects, as you've seen before, we are quite comfortable on reaching this.</p>
          <p>Is it challenging? I don't know. But 2% increase in production when we see the average increase of oil demand by 1% in the years to come. It's a good number. And definitely it's part of our wish to get additional production and operating income.</p>
          <p>Downstream Chemicals, well, Patrick has been almost covering the subject before, i.e. in the way we have to achieve this target. The target is just is very easy to move from 9% rate of return, ROACE, in 2010 to 13% in 2015. So an additional 4% and doubling of cash flow. That's not only doable, it's a strong commitment. Of course, it's linked with the environment. And for this we are using the 2010 environment, which is almost equivalent to a mid-cycle environment.</p>
          <p>But I mean with all which has been done and is underway, to be more careful on safety, to be able to reduce our capacity and improve the break-even levels. To definitely improve the competitiveness of our Petrochemical activities and being more present in the Middle East and be more present in Asia, and still keeping our tools, our units in Europe, in a good fit and competitive, we strongly believe that this goal is our goal. And 13% in coal business, which is not &#x2013; and definitely not in alignment with the environment of the Upstream &#x2013; is strongly considered by the company, by the management, as a way not only to diversify our risk, but also to make good profit for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>CapEx $20 billion. That's net of acquisitions. Now, we &#x2013; I don't know if we presented this slide with the projects still to be done. I don't think Patrick used it. Okay &#x2013; but, to make it short we have in the $1 billion, which is in dotted line above the 20. So the 20 becomes 21. We have the difference between $4.5 billion of acquisitions already decided but not yet paid, and 3.5 billion of divestment already done, but not already received.</p>
          <p>And if you take this into account, which mean not new &#x2013; potential new projects &#x2013; that brings it to $21 billion, which is what we need definitely to continue to bring additional production, additional reserves and additional competition to our Downstream activities.</p>
          <p>Financial flexibility increasing at 100. We had a problem with Patrick to say &#x2013; I mean was it a strong message. Doesn't mean that we believe that is only at 100 that we are more &#x2013; no, it just mean that we believe that what is important is that at 100, we can get better return and better potential for growth.</p>
          <p>Today, we are at 100. And it's very important that the contract we're signing and the contract which we are preparing for the long-term take it into account that at 100 and even more, we still continued to grab part of the additional price. And it's not left to whoever &#x2013; consuming countries or producing countries. So we have been very careful, and we have this on many of our slides to show that all of our new projects are bringing additional return with higher prices, and also bringing more return than the average portfolio return that we have today.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; net to debt equity ratio &#x2013; the gearing &#x2013; Patrick has been telling you that we pulled back from 26 to 22. We still keep the 25, 30 as being the bracket in which we have to stay to be keeping a strong balance sheet and strong capacity for the long term.</p>
          <p>As you see, 2010, 22, we moved it for being between 25 and 30 in 2011. Definitely, it will depend on the environment. It's what we'll be seeing at $80. It's probable that at more than 80, we will have gearing less than this. And maybe, we could think of having a higher dividend if our profits are getting higher. But you have all the ways with this to calculate the sensitivity of our results on higher price of brands, additional production, refining margin and of course, at the end, the remaining sales of Sanofi-Aventis.</p>
          <p>Based on this, we have &#x2013; the Board of Directors who took place yesterday decided to propose to the AGM of May to pay a dividend for the order of &#x20AC;2.28, which is the same amount than in 2010. And don't forget, as I was saying this morning, that we start from now on to go to quarterly dividend, with the first quarterly dividend being based on the first quarter of 2011m with the first payment being paid in September 2011. So which means a quicker cash to our shareholders and also a way to be quicker to adapt the dividend to our profits and our forecast.</p>
          <p>To the last, as kind of a conclusion, but in our business, we never have a conclusion. Definitely, priority to safety, reliability and responsibility. That's not only Macondo. It is the only way to be capable to develop our activities in a sustainable way. We need to make sure that all of the changes we're doing and will be doing are for bringing additional value to the company, and we are absolutely certain that we still have a lot of capabilities within the company to add more value, even using the same assets.</p>
          <p>Definitely, we need to keep growing, and we are believing in this, when you see the numbers of projects which are to be developed, entry into production. And decision of FIDs to be taken in the few years to come. And AGM. That's not only to please Patrick. It's our strong belief. Definitely we keep this same way of developing our business, the same consistency of discipline in our investment policy. And definitely that is a link between the two. A strong policy of return to shareholders.</p>
          <p>And just to make it a little ping, you remember why we decided not to be too arrogant in our policy in Iraq, that's just because of this. You cannot ask us to bring more value to the shareholders, to be more than $13 per barrel in profits per barrel, and go to projects with margin which are below $2. Whatever the return could be, it's very important to us just to be sure that we keep our industry in what it is &#x2013; companies to be able to deliver growth in a sustainable way, taking more care of the environment, taking more care of the climate change, taking more care of our clients, and just being able to move in an environment which will have, sometimes, to suffer in increasing energy prices, and make it still acceptable and profitable to all of our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And we are ready for the questions, if it's now the proper time.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> what do you think? I mean, as you look at what you'll get out of this increasing exploration spend, do you think you have the capability to generate a new conventional pole or hub to complement your business?</p>
          <p>So the two that you're kind of developing are most unconventional with Canada and Australia. Do you think that your exploration has the capability and the opportunity or access to actually generate something that is &#x2013; would stand as a new hub for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good point. I mean, you've seen that we don't consider unconventional oil and gas as exploration, even if we should. Because I mean, it's not obvious, because people said there are 8 billion barrels equivalent that exist.</p>
          <p>But forget this for a moment. I was talking about what we're doing already in the U.K, and definitely the Laggan-Tormore has been proving what we were expecting from it. Not only the result of buying and selling, but also the success of new exploration wells on Alwyn is working still well.</p>
          <p>Am I correct, Patrick? Good. So I'm correct. But I hope he is correct.</p>
          <p>And then definitely just moving into new areas. Brunei is one part when we have been, I think, extremely successful in getting access to large parts of the new acreage, which has been shared between Brunei and Malaysia. And I think that we have been doing better than one of our competitor, who has probably forget to sign at the right time. But now, we have a large portion of the working interest in probably what we consider one of the best potential area for not only one discovery but as a hub.</p>
          <p>In Azerbaijan, we are redrilling at Absheron, which is a new license. Definitely it's not the same target we are looking at. It's not the same place. But I mean, again, it's exploration. But we look at it as an important, I would say, potential for not only one discovery, but some of those.</p>
          <p>Angola <mark type="inaudible" /> pre-salt, we had access to three new blocks. It's not Brazil, it's Angola. Might not be as good. But I mean, if you don't take risk, you will not get it. It really looks like Brazil, and also it's part of something which can become a new hub.</p>
          <p>So I mean, I can give you like this, a lot of facts where you see that we're not just going in one part and say, take it or leave it. But also be ready to make it as a real potential for successful drilling.</p>
          <p>And then again, it's exploration. But it's true that we have been missing, but something which is very important is you need to drill more than one or two frontier wells per year, if you want to be successful. And that's been not only well received, it's under way. Now I will tell you more when we will get the result of the wells.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions if I may. The first one is on your Downstream business. After selling the UK retail business, Lindsey, and the refurbishment of Normandy, are you going to be happy that that's rebalancing the portfolio enough? Or do you think that you still need to do more in Europe? That's one question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is, you were hinting that if oil price stays where it is, your CapEx numbers are what you're thinking, you may be increasing the dividends. Is that the way that we should be thinking about that? Or what's the priority in terms of getting that extra cash from disposals or higher oil price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On purpose, I was a little bit provocative, because usually I'm waiting for &#x2013; and when do you increase the dividend? So I prefer to start saying, okay, if it goes the way we think it's going, that might be opportunities, but I will come back to it.</p>
          <p>On your first question, I mean the first thing was to definitely meeting our targets and commitments, reduce capacities by 500,000 barrels per day. When the Lindsey refinery will be sold, this commitment is done.</p>
          <p>Now, it's true that it all depends on demand, but we don't see demand restarting to grow in Western Europe and in the States. So definitely there will be need for additional move. But I mean, certainly I will not disclose what could be those targets. And definitely it all depends on how much is the decline in demand, but also what are the opportunities. Doesn't come all with the day you want. It doesn't come all with the time you think is the best time. And at some time you also have to be careful to what is the sensitivity of the population and states on this. But definitely no scoop.</p>
          <p>I mean if we want to stay competitive, if we want to stay sustainable in this business, as we want, there will be a need for additional decrease of capacities in the years to come, while at the same time, we will keep respecting our commitments, when and where we have been taking commitments.</p>
          <p>But as Patrick said, a lot of people were extremely question-marked on are we going to be able to close Dunkirk. It has been done. And if we need to do more to make it sustainable and profitable, we will continue the same way.</p>
          <p>On the dividend, I was a little bit on purpose trying to make you move in on, wow, there might be opportunity. Okay, at the same time, today at $80, we have of a payout of 50%, which is the average of our strategical goals today. We will see what's going to be the future.</p>
          <p>Our policy is just to make sure that each time the company is improving and keep being strongly, I would say, optimistic on its environment and its capacity to grow. I mean definitely, we will have our shareholders to take part of this growth and return.</p>
          <p>Now, we will never give any thing like X dollar per barrel plus equal X cents per euro or per dollar more. That's not the way we do it. Just the message is, if it goes better, dividend will go better.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> from RBC. You've got a nice list of all the Upstream projects, which support your 2% growth to 2015. But missing on that list is Uganda even though it goes through to 2018.</p>
          <p>Does that mean that &#x2013; I'll say when it is signed, that's upside potential for your growth? Or does it mean that when it is signed, it might be after 2018? Or does it mean that at this rate, it might be 2018, by the time it's even signed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it means that on exploration, we are using what we called PS, Probability of Success. We don't use this for projects like Uganda or &#x2013; we could say there are X percent chance that on 10 deals, 2 or 3 will be done. So this one is not part of it.</p>
          <p>But I mean, there might be some others with more problems. If it comes, it's additional. But I mean some might be also late. So it's better to keep it as potential.</p>
          <p>But today, we cannot say when it will start for one simple reason. We are very confident that it will be signed &#x2013; by the way it has been already signed by Total and our two partners. It's depending on now the state approval &#x2013; state approval &#x2013; I mean, I don't like to sell anything before it's done, but  I think Total have more than chances to be in any kind of deal.</p>
          <p>The thing is, we have been taking some delays. And I think you all know this. The problem today is, we are too close of the license expiration date, and we need to renegotiate this, or to negotiate this before we sign a final agreement.</p>
          <p>So it's just a question of time. You are and we are during an election period. Not the best time to sign deals. But just be sure that I am very optimistic. I am taking the risk of telling you that we strongly believe that it will be done. But it's not part of the 2015. And that's why it's not on the list. It's not because it will be after. It's just not in.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> within the downstream, you've given us targets on cash flow and returns. Can I just ask why in the upstream, given that you've talked about the improving unit profitability, would you consider actually giving us a cash flow target on a per barrel basis or a return on capital target?</p>
          <p>I'm just trying to think, rather than focusing purely on just the volume growth numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we &#x2013; it's a most complex answer, as you know.</p>
          <p>Just start with &#x2013; each time we decide a project, we do it with, as I said, strict discipline. Today, it's $80. And we see the sensitivity at 100 and more, not only to make it okay at 100, assuming we're to make it profitable. But I mean is this project sensitive to higher prices? Are the contractual terms making it &#x2013; bringing more when it comes to higher levels.</p>
          <p>Second thing is technical cost. We have one side of technical cost, and we have been able to match our target, which was $1 more versus 2009. It's 1.2. A little bit sorry for this. But as Yves-Louis will tell you, the E&amp;P general manager, that if you take into account the production which is not taken into account because of the price of the oil, that's 3%, then exactly the technical cost will be $1 more.</p>
          <p>Now what is important is not this &#x2013; is to keep this capability to keep our projects under control. And mean that when you start a project, you consider that the IRR will be sufficient to challenge your existing products. And also making it part of the portfolio mix, making sure that if you have to offset lower return, you can have longer cash flow.</p>
          <p>And you know that I &#x2013; you are trying to get something more from me now for many years, but I can't even tell you more than the result of it is, we are developing projects which are all better than the existing one as an average. And second, that they all are bringing more cash when the price of oil is increasing.</p>
          <p>Now again, for the rest, it's very difficult to say. It's very much depending on when you started it or not. And that's we have to be very careful on, as I was telling you, making sure that when you decide a project, you quickly start developing it and you quickly go upstream before everything get changed.</p>
          <p>Because we are still in the world that I maybe shouldn't say this, but which is not totally crystal clear. A lot of people were saying two years ago that they see the cost of project declining. Well, they'd be probably a little bit more optimistic than they should. For one good reason. There are a lot of projects still. And also lot of additional requests in terms of security and environment, which are making them more expensive. So each time you can, do it. And then see the next.</p>
          <p>But I mean, then, how it works, are we making a very, very sophisticated calculation? Yes, of course, we do. That's why we have Jean-Jacques Mosconi which is our expert for this choice of strategy. But at the end it's just the result of what it is. So sorry for not being able to give you a better answer than, yes, we keep discipline. And that is the best way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Christophe. Theepan from Morgan Stanley. Just coming back to exploration. We've seen a modest increase this year. I'm just wondering if you could sort of give us a break down? Is that an increase in drilling or is it a combination of increase in drilling and seismic spend? And then do you see Total going forward being more aggressive, as you see the sort of the ready-to-drill part of that portfolio increase?</p>
          <p>And then, the second question is just coming back to your comments on portfolio management. I assume that Total looks at portfolio management. It's been looking at that for quite some time. And there has been a change in strategy.</p>
          <p>When you look at the portfolio today, and I don't expect you to give explicit numbers, how much more opportunity is there to do some of the transactions that you executed last year? Because I guess, at some point, there is a limit in the portfolio to what you want to sell. So I was just sort of getting a sense of how much more there could be &#x2013; do we expect a sort of similar sort of level to last year, this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's obvious that 2010, in terms of exploration, result has not been the best year. And at the same time, we've been able to cover our target, which is a mix of what we call short-type so acquisition of undeveloped reserves and exploration.</p>
          <p>And if you remember, when I said that we want to bring each year the equivalent of 1.4 million barrels, it was not only through exploration. 2010, it's a result of the decision taken in 2005, I don't know when. When probably I was in charge, by the way. But today, what we are doing is working on new place. And what I've been telling you about our portfolio is for 2011.</p>
          <p>So definitely 2010 is over. And the result when we produce it, you will see it's not bringing the 0.7 we would have to like to bring as an average. But it is an average.</p>
          <p>Now for the first year, since a long period of time, we have increased what we call our portfolio of expected resources. And that's, as you know, something we don't disclose. But it's something we can say, being totally credible, because those are based on real figures.</p>
          <p>The first are that thanks to the new acreages, the new portfolio we've been entering into our business plan, that we are able to see, a chance, by definition to get more results from exploration. And it's true, that was not the case in the past three years.</p>
          <p>So there is no mystery and only luck if you don't bring more capabilities to discover, you can not get it. Because at the end, it is not only luck, it's probability. And that's why we are much more optimistic today than we were last year.</p>
          <p>Now again, you see the list. And it's difficult to say how many of those wells will be positive. In terms of numbers of wells, we deliver this usually, but I don't have the figure for 2011. How many wells, Jean-Jacques, you remember? <mark type="inaudible" /> It's much more than 40. 70 wells.</p>
          <p>Okay. Are you talking about operating? No. Globally, how many wells?</p>

          <p>75 wells in 2011, which is a large number. We have been drilling more than this. But again, it's not only a question of numbers of wells. It is true that you don't just sit. When you move from 1.8 to 2.1, the cost of wells, especially when you go deeper. And that's where the new plays are, and that's where the frontiers are, and that's where the risks are. But that's where we have to go. <mark type="inaudible" /> But at the same time it's where we have to go. So it's a mix of wells and additional cost based on the duration of wells. But definitely it's an aggressive program.</p>
          <p>And definitely today &#x2013; almost the same 2012. After, as you know, it become difficult to predict. But 2011, 2012 will be very strong period for exploration. And then we will see if the new acceleration aggressivity of the company is working. If not we have to change the exploration. And don't, don't deliver this message. There's a good man.</p>

          <p>And your thoughts around portfolio management and how much more can Total do?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it also depends on &#x2013; for instance, take Brunei. I'm using it because we strongly believe in Brunei. So I'm taking a big risk in this, which means if it is dry, it'll be more than an upset. Not only for exploration, but I mean that's a place where we have been working on the political side.</p>
          <p>We have been &#x2013; don't use my words, but I mean we've been very much pushing Brunei to continue to defend their interest, even against being in Malaysia. And we could do it even if we were in Malaysia.</p>
          <p>But I mean we have been defending this because we work in it first, and also because we consider that it was the &#x2013; I would say the most ethical way, which was not to give everything to Malaysia. Believe it or not, it's not only &#x2013; only pure, I would say, return.</p>
          <p>Now, we are in it. We have been working for more than seven years to keep it back. If you remember a time where we had the Malaysian ship coming and forcing us to quit the area. This was not so long ago. So I mean after all that fight, if from the top, we cannot find something, even if we had nothing to do with, it will be extremely disappointing.</p>
          <p>But as to give you an idea of sometimes on those big plays, we have to find opportunities which are based on open or not open, access or not access. Today, there is a new debate on Artic seas between Russia and Norway. How is it going to move, I don't know. And I will not tell you what we're doing, because that's too sensitive.</p>
          <p>But on the side of going on to existing players like Brazil, Angola, Nigeria, definitely, if you want to be really active, also you have to find opportunities in places which are today not open, but it can be open if you just use your capabilities of partnership, of intelligence. And at the end, making it accessible when everybody thinks it's not.</p>
          <p>So, yes, I am definitely optimistic. As far as now, we have a strong support from our teams to set to be, themselves, more risk takers than they used to be. It's not only a management decision. It's also a decision of our teams to set to take more risk results report.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think the second question of Theepan was to ask if we believe we can sell as much assets as we sold in 2010, and I think the answer is yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is we can do more. But I mean, will we only do it, if we can do it. Oh, sorry, if we have to do it. So with the gearing of that level. We don't need it.</p>
          <p>Now if we have good opportunities, we will do it. And we have a list of assets ready to be sold. And it's true that it's not difficult to sell. But as far as difficult to buy, just like for the real estate business. It's better to buy before you sell. I think so. For real estate, I don't know. But for oil and gas, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask two questions? Firstly, you talked about costs earlier. Do you want to give us a kind of technical cost target? Like you talked about $1 per barrel increase of last year. And kind of indicate whether that's &#x2013; if there is an increase happening in 2011, whether that's a cash cost or a depreciation cost?</p>
          <p>And the second question was on cash again. It's not in your list for Phase II, and the next increase. So can you tell us what's going on in terms of the FEED and the negotiations with the government about plateau and costs, et cetera? Because it seems to have stalled somewhat in terms of progression.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first question is easier than the second one. Even if there is a link between the two, by the way.</p>
          <p>Today, with what we see is probably going to be $1 more in 2011 versus to &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; yes, 2011 versus 2010. So almost the same increase than in 2010.</p>
          <p>Why? Because the costs are roughly moving in the same way. So $1, which is $1, but it's today less than 100 versus 80. So if we can be doing more than $1 out of 20, you have the answer. It's a good &#x2013; sorry?</p>

          <p>No, no, no. DD&amp;A. On cash again &#x2013; shouldn't say this, but we'll say it. I mean, maybe I'll need a lawyer. Or a crystal ball.</p>
          <p>We are doing everything to move from Phase I to Phase II. Phase I is now on the way, and you know the dates. If it's true, it's true that we will probably have to go through discussions with the State because of the cost, because of the timing. Even if, legally speaking, it's why we shouldn't need lawyers, it's all following the rights we have in the contract.</p>
          <p>Now it's true that we have been always to be disappointed by the result of our works altogether. And definitely, I mean without just being willing to say things which are not nice, but that's what it is. I mean we are taking additional delay on this. How long? How much? I cannot tell you. It doesn't depends only on Total.</p>
          <p>Now Phase I, and it's a priority, has to start quickly to bring cash, and easing to project to be self-sufficient, and also bringing cash to the state, which will certainly be part of making them happier, and less concerned about the future.</p>
          <p>I know it's not the &#x2013; - quite clear answer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just back on exploration on Angola. Just that's a bit of core area for yourselves, and you could say you're a bid and master in that area. Did you have any particular edge when you were bidding for the sub-salt drillings? Did you get the blocks you wanted to get? Do you have any edge for the geology of the southern part of Angola?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I hope so. But I mean for this, I really depend on our geologist. We are not there to tell them which is the block to take. Even if at the end, I mean we had to discuss with them on how much can we spend in terms of burners. Because it was a mix of different things to get access.</p>
          <p>But we have those three blocks. It's done. But those three blocks were requested otherwise -you can't get blocks you were not bidding for. That's &#x2013; I mean there are some other ways. I know it happens in other countries.</p>
          <p>So in that one, it was clear. So we got three of the blocks we wanted, okay? If we challenge one block, we would have preferred another one, but at the end, it's still exploration.</p>
          <p>So no, we are quite happy with the result for Total. Definitely, it gave us a chance to enter into these pre-salt basins, which are &#x2013; I hate to say it is a Brazil style. Because, I mean, I still find it a little bit far away to be considered as equivalent.</p>
          <p>But if you look at the ways the geologists are presenting it to us &#x2013; Patrick can confirm this &#x2013; it really looks like &#x2013; now, again, it's very deep below the sea level. But it's exactly the target and the permits we wanted to get. It was really part of this wish to be more active and more aggressive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And just secondly, your projects starting up in 2011 and 2012, how do they compare on operating income per barrel, relative to your $13 and your $21 for new sanctioned projects you made last year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have this &#x2013; the answer on one of our slides. Nine? But are you talking about the six projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. The ones &#x2013; those are sanctioned in '10. I'm talking about the ones starting in 2011 to 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't have here the breakeven per project. But, I mean, this strategy &#x2013; and when we decide a project &#x2013; so the FIDs are not yet taken. So I cannot answer before. But I mean, if we decide to do it, it would be because it is what we say, i.e., better than what we have.</p>
          <p>But I mean that's a rule, so I cannot give you the answer until we go to FID. We know the capital cost. And we'll take a decision to move. Those projects have not been, by definition, decided yet. But I mean, our policy is very straightforward. It is not less than what we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now, of course, at $80.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Neill Morton at Berenberg. There seems to be a concern in the stock market that, given flat production outlook for 2011, the high cash balance on the balance sheet, and the value locked up in Sanofi, perhaps not least your share price performance, that Total is considering a large upstream acquisition. Could I invite you in this public forum to assuage those concerns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which means?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which means deny it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, flat production, I cannot deny. And again, when we said 2% per year, we never said that there will be no flat years. And the year 2011 has always been known by all of you as a flat year, even if it's better than we anticipated at the time, thanks to certain acquisitions we have been doing. So that's very clear.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of gearing and in terms of acquisition, et cetera, we will certainly not change our limits, which means 25, 30, without something which will be so of huge interest and strategical value that will force us to do it by any means.</p>
          <p>But otherwise, I can deny that we will spend money for just increasing, without respecting our discipline and our commitments on a strong balance sheet and a strong financial discipline and a dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Is this answering to your point?</p>
