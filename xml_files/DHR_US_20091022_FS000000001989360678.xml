      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. We'll start this morning by providing an overview of what we are seeing across our businesses and end markets to lay a framework for our quarterly results and our outlook for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with how we are executing in a stabilizing yet still challenging economy. Results within our Professional Instrumentation segment were essentially in line with our overall business results. Environmental continues to be relatively resilient, while Test and Measurement saw sequential improvement, though overall remains weak. Our Medical Technology segment, with the exception of KaVo, largely outperformed as a result of its high consumables mix. The Industrial Technology segment, absent our niche Aerospace and Defense businesses, improved sequentially, particularly in North America, while tools and Components businesses continued to experience soft demand.</p>
          <p>Even in this environment, we continue to focus our efforts on capturing market share. Videojet, ChemTreat, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, DEXIS, Radiometer, and Matco are among the businesses where we believe we have taken notable share from competition. Geographically, China was our best performer, with mid single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Europe and the emerging economies continued to be very soft, while the U.S. saw modest sequential improvement in many end markets.</p>
          <p>Our margin performance was again strong in the third quarter, with our core operating margins improving sequentially by 140 basis points from 14.2% in the second quarter to 15.6% in the third. In addition, each segment saw sequential improvements in core margins.</p>
          <p>Additionally, our cash flow was once again robust, as we generated $472 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Despite the incremental restructuring costs and lower volumes experienced across our business, year-to-date free cash flow was down only modestly.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we announced a top-up to our previously communicated 2009 restructuring initiatives, which are now expected to approximate $250 million and are expected to provide annual cost savings of approximately $220 million. So with that as a backdrop, let's move to the details of the quarter.</p>
          <p>We reported today third quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.05, representing a 5.5% decrease from last year.  Adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.89, which was $0.02 above the high end of the 0.77 to $0.87 adjusted EPS guidance range we provided in July. Revenues for the quarter decreased 14.5% year-over-year to $2.75 billion, with core revenues down 14%. The impact of currency translations reduced revenues by 2%, offset by acquisitions, which contributed 1.5% to sales growth. Across our businesses orders solidly outpaced shipments, as we billed approximately $100 million of backlog during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year gross margin for the third quarter increased 90 basis points to 48%, largely due to year-over-year cost savings relating to our restructuring initiatives and ongoing cost reduction efforts, as well as lower commodity costs, which more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes and additional restructuring costs in 2009. Operating margin in the third quarter increased 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 16.9%, with lower sales volumes across most businesses and the impact of incremental year-over-year restructuring costs more than offset by a one-time gain resulting from the litigation settlement with Align Technology and the benefit of restructuring and cost reduction activities.</p>
          <p>Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 19.1% as compared to 24.5% in the prior-year period. Our effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by discrete tax benefits of $37 million or $0.11 per share related to the favorable resolution of various international and domestic tax matters, which was previously included in our guidance for the quarter. For the balance of the year, we anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25%.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flows for the third quarter were $503 million, a 16% increase year-over-year. For the first nine months, operating cash flows were $1.3 billion, a 3% decline year-over-year. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $472 million, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 134%. Our year-to-date cash flow performance includes $136 million of cash payments as a result of our restructuring initiatives. Of particular note, we reduced inventories by over $113 million or 10% year-to-date, which is roughly in line with our core sales decline of 13%. We anticipate that our conversion ratio will remain strong over the balance of the year, and as a result, we are optimistic about our ability to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for what would be our 18th year in a row.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of six companies, with aggregate annual revenues of about $130 million, to strengthen our environmental, test and measurement, product identification, and dental businesses. We also announced our intention to acquire AB SCIEX, Molecular Devices, and PaloDEx, all of which we anticipate closing in the fourth quarter. We are optimistic about our ability to continue to deploy capital in this environment and are encouraged by our active opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our operating segments, Professional Instrumentation revenues decreased 12.5% for the quarter, with core revenues down 13.5%. For the first nine months of 2009, revenues decreased 14%, with core revenues down 13.5%. Operating margin for the third quarter declined 450 basis points to 15.6%, primarily due to lower sales volumes and the incremental impact of year-over-year restructuring costs incurred during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Environmental platform revenues declined 2.5% in the quarter, with core revenues down 2%. For the first nine months, revenues decreased 2.5%, with core revenues down 1% year-over-year. Water quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate in the quarter. At Hach Lange core revenues declined at a low single-digit rate, but with lab and process sales improving sequentially from the prior quarter due to an increase in project activity. Despite the top line declines and prior year restructuring costs, Hach Lange's operating margin expanded more than 100 basis points over last year.</p>
          <p>Trojan's core revenues grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter, with strong growth in wastewater applications as well as continued shipments for the New York City drinking water project. ChemTreat's revenues were up low single digits year-over-year, driven by sales of our boiler cooler water applications. New account generation continues to be robust, and we believe we are capturing share in many of our end markets.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we acquired Hexis Cientifica, a Brazilian-based distributor of laboratory instruments, microbiology products and basic lab equipment. Hexis is the primary distributor of Hach Lange products in this strategically important emerging economy. Also in the quarter, we acquired PowerChem Technology, a US-based provider of geothermal solutions for steam, brine and cooling water systems. The geothermal segment is an attractive adjacency for ChemTreat and provides access to end markets poised for accelerated growth in the coming years, as demand for clean and renewable energy increases.</p>
          <p>Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues declined at a high single-digit rate year-over-year. At Gilbarco sales declined at a low single-digit rate, as continued growth in our Passport point of sale systems was more than offset by lower dispenser sales, principally in Europe. Veeder-Root's sales were down in the quarter, with sales of our enhanced vapor recovery solution slowing in advance of the year-end implementation deadline in California.</p>
          <p>Moving to Test and Measurement, revenues declined 23.5% in the quarter, with core revenues down 25.5%. Fluke, Tektronix, and Fluke Networks all improved sequentially from the previous quarter, with signs of stabilization in the U.S. and China, while Europe continues to experience weak demand. For the first nine months of 2009, core revenues decreased 25.5%.</p>
          <p>Fluke core revenues declined at a mid-teens rate in the quarter, with sales declines of core test products in Europe more than offsetting growth in China. Across Asia, we shipped more than 100 thermography units, which are being used for H1N1 flu detection at airports and schools. In the U.S., we believe that the inventory reductions in the distribution channel are largely behind us. During the quarter, Fluke launched a series of new important products, including the 233 digital remote display multimeter with wireless capabilities and the Ti32 thermal imager, a thermographer at the mid price point range.</p>
          <p>At Tektronix, sales were down across all product categories and geographies, as customers continued to delay investments. Like Fluke, we believe we have worked through the U.S. distributor inventory destocking issues, and in the third quarter our orders improved at a high single-digit rate over the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Sales from our Fluke Networks and tech communications businesses collectively declined at a double-digit rate, partially due to a difficult year-over-year comparison at tech communications which benefited from a large Australian network management shipment last year.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we acquired AirMagnet, a leading enterprise Wi-Fi analysis and security provider based in California. This business complements Fluke Networks by providing product leadership in wireless test solutions.</p>
          <p>Moving to Med Tech, revenues for the quarter decreased 8% compared to 2008, with core revenues down 8.5%. For the first nine months of 2009, revenues decreased 9%, with core revenues down 6%.  Med Tech operating margin for the third quarter was up 960 basis points from the prior year to 21.9%, due primarily to the one-time litigation settlement gain. Despite the revenue decline, core operating margin was essentially flat versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>Within our dental business, core revenues declined at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. Sybron core sales were relatively flat in the quarter, with higher sales of our orthodontia solutions and disinfection product lines offset by soft sales of general dentistry consumables. Sybron enjoyed mid single-digit growth in orthodontics, driven by a strong response to our new Damon Q product, which provides dentists greater treatment flexibility, easier wire changeovers, and a smaller bracket profile for improved patient aesthetics. During the quarter, Ormco announced an exclusive collaboration arrangement with Align Technology to jointly develop and market an orthodontic solution combining Align's Invisalign system and Ormco's Insignia custom orthodontic bracket and arch wire system. We remain very excited about this strategic opportunity.</p>
          <p>KaVo revenues declined at a double-digit rate in the quarter, with weak demand across the major geographies and product categories, as dentists continue to delay capital spending. In addition, channel inventory reductions continue in certain geographies. In the quarter, DEXIS launched its new Platinum Sensor, which has the ability to take vertical and horizontal bite wing X-rays with a single sensor, thus eliminating the cost and inconvenience of using multiple sensors.</p>
          <p>While the environment remains challenging, we are encouraged by the cost actions we have taken, and with the recent number of new products we believe that we will see sequential improvement in both top and bottom line performance in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Axis Dental, a leader in dental rotary instrumentation. Axis provides Sybron with a strong sales force, an established brand, and valuable channel relationships in the sizable rotary segment. Subsequent to quarter end, we also announced our intention to require PaloDEx Holding, a Finnish-based manufacturer of dental imaging products. With the pending addition of Instrumentarium Dental and SOREDEX, we will add two strong brands to our imaging group, which is expected to strengthen our product portfolio in all key categories of digital imaging. This acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.</p>
          <p>Leica core revenues declined at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, with strength across Asia more than offset by weak demand in the U.S. and European industrial and life science research markets. During the quarter, Leica received a $10 million microscopy order in Japan, the largest single order in the company's history. This was a great win for the team in a region where we have significant local competition. The order will begin shipping in the fourth quarter and will continue into next year. In addition, Leica launched the SCN400, a new digital pathology slide scanner during the quarter, and initial feedback in the U.S. and in Europe has been quite positive. Recent reports from our sales team indicate that orders related to U.S. stimulus funding have increased sequentially, however shipments have only begun to materialize.</p>
          <p>Leica Biosystems core revenues were essentially flat in the quarter, with strong growth of our advanced staining consumables offset by soft instrument sales. In Europe, distributor inventory levels were adversely impacted pending launch of the new Bond 3 system, which is due out this month. The Bond 3 advanced staining system provides faster staining capability, greater flexibility, and increased efficiency to the histologist.</p>
          <p>Radiometer's core revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate for the quarter, driven by continued strong consumable sales, primarily in Europe and Asia, resulting from past success in growing our installed base. In Asia sales benefited from double-digit growth in Japan, as well as the recent launch of the ABL80 compact blood gas analyzer in China.</p>
          <p>In the quarter we announced the pending acquisition of AB SCIEX and Molecular Devices. As a reminder, AB SCIEX is a leading designer and manufacturer of mass spectrometers used by researchers and clinicians to identify and quantify specific modules &#x2013; excuse me, specific molecules in complex samples. Molecular Devices supplies high performance bio-analytical instruments and consumables that accelerate and improve research productivity and effectiveness in life science research and drug discovery. The acquired businesses will expand Med Tech annual revenues by more than 650 million to nearly $4 billion. The acquisition remains subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, but we believe we are on track for closing in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 20% for the quarter, with core revenues down 18%. For the first fine nine months of 2009, revenues decreased 21.5%, with core revenues down 16.5%. Operating margin for the quarter was 17%, a 120 basis point decrease compared to the same period last year, due primarily to lower sales volumes across the segment as well as incremental restructuring costs incurred in the quarter. Product ID revenues were down 11% in the quarter, with core revenues declining 8.5%. For the first nine months, Product ID sales decreased 15.5%, with core revenues down 9.5%.</p>
          <p>At Videojet, we have begun to see stabilization across most geographies, with printer placements improving sequentially from the prior quarter. We launched the 1610 small character continuous ink jet printer, ideal for high speed applications in the quarter, the third version of our 1000 series product platform. And while it's still early, market feedback has again, for this new product, been quite positive.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we acquired FOBA Technology, a German-based manufacturer of laser-based marking and engraving systems. FOBA strengthens Videojet's channel in Europe and North America in core parts marking applications and increases its exposure in the fast-growing niche verticals such as medical and smart cards. Also in the quarter, we acquired Wolke Inks &amp; Printers based in Hersbruck, Germany. Wolke markets a leading thermal ink jet printer with significant channel presence with major pharmaceutical customers and OEMs. The business expands Videojet's presence in the attractive pharmaceutical vertical market, with specific functionality to target track and trace applications.</p>
          <p>Motion revenues were down 34% in the quarter, with core revenues down 30.5%. Year-to-date, sales decreased 36.5%, with core revenues down 30%. We saw sequential improvement in several end markets during the quarter including electronic assembly, semiconductors and elevators, particularly in the U.S., though overall levels are still soft. European end markets did not show the same sequential improvement, as customer factory shutdowns across Germany continued to impact performance.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, Kollmorgen launched the AKD servo family of drives designed to expand machine performance and increase integration speeds with easy-to-use plug-and-play capability &#x2013; or excuse me, compatibility with Kollmorgen motors. Customer feedback has been very favorable here as well.</p>
          <p>And finally, moving to tools and Components, revenues for the quarter decreased 20.5%, with core revenues down 20%. Year-to-date, revenues decreased 21.5%, with core revenues down 21%. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.6%, an increase of 160 basis points from the prior year, due to the benefit of lower commodity costs, increased productivity, and cost savings attributable to prior year restructuring initiatives, which helped to offset both lower sales volumes and incremental year-over-year restructuring costs incurred in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Mechanics' hand tool core revenues declined 16% in the third quarter and 11.5% year-to-date, primarily due to lower sales to both consumer and professional channels. Performance in the third quarter was also negatively impacted by a difficult year-over-year comparison with Advance Auto &#x2013; with the Advance Auto stocking order which occurred in the prior year period. Sales of our domestic china tool brand Sata grew at a low single-digit rate during the quarter.</p>
          <p>So to wrap up, we continue to execute well in a difficult economic environment. Our investments in innovation, sales and marketing are clearly driving market share gains. Our restructuring and cost reduction progress is evident in our margins. Our free cash flow remains strong, and we're putting it to use in acquisitions, and it's strengthening our competitive positions and accelerating our sales and earnings growth potential. We strongly believe that we will emerge from this downturn as an even stronger and more competitive company in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Our expectation is for the fourth quarter core revenues to be down about 10%, a sequential improvement from the third quarter, notwithstanding four fewer selling days in the fourth quarter. Given our strong performance in the third quarter, we are increasing our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook from $3.28 to $3.48 per share, to $3.40 to $3.50 per share. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share outlook is now $0.99 to $1.09. The additional restructuring charges that we approved in April and August are expected to reduce GAAP EPS by approximately $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.45 per share for the full year. As a result, we expect our GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.75.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2009 we expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.41. These ranges include the additional restructuring items just mentioned, but exclude the impact of acquisition-related costs for deals that we have not yet announced resulting from the adoption of the new business combination accounting standard that went into effect in 2009.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Deane Dray with FBR Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Deane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Deane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions. The first would be, just give us a sense of how the month of September tracked versus your earlier comments in the quarter that July and August had done well or just above expectations. And then if you could, you don't often comment about backlog, and that, interested in hearing more about that 100 million in backlog. Would that be contributing to core revenues, or just what's the mix within that backlog?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Deane, I think that as we look at September, it more or less played out as we had anticipated and certainly had hoped. So we really went I think wire to wire through the quarter with good inflow. We certainly saw, I think, some of the destocking end early in the quarter, but that was a firm dynamic throughout. I think we kept waiting for Europe maybe to show itself in September a little stronger in line with what we were certainly seeing in the U.S., certainly in China and India. And that really didn't materialize. But I don't think we were expecting that. So I think all in all, we were pretty pleased with the way the quarter started and certainly with the way it ended.</p>
          <p>With respect to the backlog, clearly we don't talk about that a lot, but certainly there's a lot of interest out there in what's happening sequentially, what's the current book of business, so we throw that out there just to provide a little bit more color. Certainly building backlog as we did during the quarter would suggest that our order books were up year-over-year more strongly than the core revenue number that we printed. And we're certainly encouraged by that, particularly given that we built some backlog in some businesses that have really felt the full brunt of the downturn like test and measurement. So all-in-all, I think it's one data point among several that suggest we do have a stabilizing economy at hand, and the business is by and large performing pretty well in it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Larry, just to clarify, within the composition of that backlog, will that all flow through core revenues, or is there a mix in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will all come in the next couple quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we ship, it will be core.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. That's what I was looking for. And then just lastly, the commentary about gaining market share, and you gave a full array of businesses, and maybe it's tough to generalize, but how much of that is coming from new product launches, or is it pricing competition, or maybe even some of your weakened competitors? How would you characterize that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think it's tough to paint the full Pareto chart out. I would not attribute much to pricing or us being advantaged vis-&#xE0;-vis weaker competitors as a result of the economy. I think it really comes down to two things, hard to quantify, but clearly we're in a very good place with our new product launch cycle. You've heard us talk about the new products at Videojet, one example this new DEXIS sensor is something that we're very excited about. Gilbarco has done a great job both with the point of sale program, which we call Passport, and what they've done with advanced vapor recovery. And so, and you heard in our prepared remarks a number of new products coming to market here in the fourth quarter. The slide scanner at Leica, another exciting technology we're going to bring to market. So that's one big piece.</p>
          <p>The other is a lot of what we've done I think to improve our go-to-market, making sure that we're protecting our spend in that area, as we obviously have cut dramatically throughout the organization elsewhere. You see at ChemTreat, we're clearly, we're just putting feet on the street, good, good selling execution there is helping us. I think you see that with the improvements that we're seeing at Videojet. Certainly what we have been able to do in some of our international markets, I would attribute it to just better sales and marketing execution as those growth tools within DBS I think get greater traction across Danaher.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the down 10% core for 4Q, you called out the four fewer selling days, it was four not three, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, four.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What impact does that have? It seems if I just do some back-of-the-envelope calculations, it's maybe a seven point impact from the selling days, but could you maybe just try and put some numbers around that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nigel, it's a little hard to calculate. I think you could mathematically say it's five points, four or five points. I don't think it's that much. It has more of an impact on the consumable business, which is kind of more of a daily order run rate business, less on kind of the capital purchases. My guess is it's two to three point impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to quantify. But I don't think it's the full mathematical impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Dan, you just called out the fact that consumables will be hit harder than the equipment businesses. Obviously consumables is higher margin. Does that mean we should expect maybe a bit more pressure on the gross margin in the 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, I think we're very pleased with our sequential improvement in margins. And I think we'll see another improvement in the core margins here in Q4. I haven't looked enough at the gross margin mix for Q4, but I don't think it will be that much of an impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And do you want to give maybe a bit of a detail on the business by business core, sorry, segment by segment core earning outlook for 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from a revenue perspective, Nigel, if we just look at it from a segment perspective, I think we have got the potential for Instrumentation to be a little bit better. I think that Med Tech should be significantly better, in part because we're going to get through a lot of the destocking that we have seen around KaVo. I think Industrial probably will be in line, maybe a little better, and I think tools will be better, if for no other reason because of the absence of that Advance Auto comp that we talked about in the prepared remarks.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Bob Cornell with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I was going to ask you again a growth question, but got beaten to it, but that was &#x2013; previously you had been saying you had about 160 million of cost savings I think rolling over into 2010. You've done more in the way of restructuring. Maybe you could just go into a little more detail about maybe what you have been doing on all of this restructuring? I mean I think you've had programs that started in last year's fourth quarter. We've sequentially ratcheted them up over the course of this year. And you had increment in the current quarter. What is the outlook for 2010 in terms of restructuring benefit, and maybe just a little bit more color on what's been going on with all of these restructuring programs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Bob. Let me just provide a couple of key points. I'd start with just reminding everybody that we're always in restructuring mode. We're always looking to take costs, waste, moot, out of the business. That's a key tenet in the Danaher business system. We accelerated that activity beginning late last year. You saw us call that out as we did in the fourth quarter. With the program that has been further accelerated during the course of the year, we're going to end up spending the better part of $250 million this year on top of the 80 plus we did last year. So we're talking about an investment all up of approximately $320 million.</p>
          <p>What we have done is obviously exited a number of positions out of the organization as well as reduced our overall footprint, both in manufacturing and in selling and other administrative activities. So if you look from a facility count, we're going to end up being down 43 rooftops when this program is over. We will have exited about 10% of our associate population, about 5,100 jobs. And again I think we feel optimistic that the execution has gone well this year. It's why we topped it up a few months ago yet again and see that really occupying our activity through the rest of the year. We'll try to protect obviously selling and R&amp;D as best we can and root out the waste and the unnecessary capacity everywhere else.</p>
          <p>I don't think, Bob, that you should expect to see us top this up yet again this year. I think it's our hope that as the economy stabilizes, we're not talking about these sorts of call-outs next year, but that we will perhaps get back to quiet restructuring, the pay as you go sort of activity that you see us implement in more normal times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Well, we'll work on it some more. You mentioned stocking, destocking a couple of times in discussing various businesses. Where would you characterize the whole destocking phenomenon when you look across the portfolio of Danaher businesses, and are you in fact benefiting a little bit from some restocking in some businesses? How would you characterize that evolution stocking, destocking, stocking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on balance, we are certainly being helped by the end of the destocking, but I don't think we have yet seen a material positive effect from restocking. I mean certainly in Environmental we don't do a lot of distribution. Much of what we do is direct at Hach Lange, there's some, obviously distribution is more important at Gilbarco Veeder-Root. I don't think we have seen a positive benefit there. Certainly the absence of some of these dramatic declines in Test and Measurement, as we indicated, are going to help Fluke and Tek as we go forward, even before we see a pick-up. I think Med Tech is certainly where we have seen the most dramatic perhaps inventory reductions in the channel, particularly around KaVo, to a lesser degree at Sybron, but even Sybron felt a little bit of that around the consumables business here in the third quarter, because the sell-out numbers at retail were certainly better in the U.S. than our sell-in numbers. Product ID by and large a direct business, that doesn't apply, though internationally we have certainly seen some of the smaller distributors take down consumables. Motion, we have certainly seen it, but again no positive effect yet from a re-stock. And tools has certainly felt it, both in industrial distribution and at retail. But again, I think net, net we welcome the stability. We await the re-stock, but are really watching sell-through at this point to see when the real up-tick will present itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a final question from me. How would you characterize the benefit to Danaher from holding price relative to some of the commodity price declines you've seen in the last nine months relative to any hedges you have in place? Are we still getting a bit of a tailwind there, or how is that working?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are. And you can see it most noticeably, Bob, in the Tool margins, where our core margins were up 300 basis points year-on-year. The tailwind was less in Q3 than it was in Q2, and it will be less in the coming quarters. I would note that the core margin increase in tools, probably about half of that is commodity benefit, but half of that is execution. So we're not going to see the big multi-hundred point improvement in margins in tools, because it's going to become much less of a tailwind commodity. But think because of execution, we're still going to do fine from a margin perspective there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How come you guys haven't gotten more pressure to give up price in some of those markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say we have a little bit. Our overall price has gone from 1.5 point to more like a point, 0.2. And that is a sign that we're still getting roughly the same amount of pricing consumables, but more the industrial equipment products we're getting a little less price.</p>

          <p>Steve, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us an updated view of your thoughts around capacity for new acquisitions coming up over the next couple of quarters, given the 1.6 of cash that you've now got in the CP line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, of the 1.6 that we ended the quarter with, about 1.3 billion, 1.4 billion is spoken for between MDS and the PaloDEx deal, that's both of which are signed and announced but are not closed. But if you just look at our next five quarters of cash flow, our billion of capacity under commercial paper, it's probably well north of $2 billion in the next three, four quarters without even thinking about having to really raise any term debt or impacting our credit rating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as you talk about AB SCIEX, given the complex deal structure, that closing still on track timing wise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We just got shareholder approval at MDS. There are some regulatory approvals we're waiting for that are we think coming shortly. And we're still confident there will be a fourth quarter closing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And does the environment, the bid-ask spreads that are out there, continue to improve to your favor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say the fact that we have signed eight deals in the last eight weeks is a positive sign. And I think a number of discussions we're having right now are encouraging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you look at the impact of acquisitions in your free cash flow for the quarter, can you give us some color about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd have to look at it. You actually have a little bit of a negative now, because under the new accounting rules, your expenses run through your cash flow. But I can look at that off line, Steve. I don't think it's a big impact, because we didn't have a lot of acquisitions the last three, four quarters. And the deals that we just closed, we closed late in September. So they didn't have much of an impact. I don't think they had much of an impact to Q3 cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as we look at the sequential changes in the sub-reported business unit segment, sorry, from the second quarter to third quarter and the first, the Dental business, again endodontics and consumables is what is dragging that down versus orthodontics and infection, because that's the one that's down mid-teens now versus low double digits from last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Steven, we probably weren't as clear as we could have been in the script, and the Sybron business was essentially flat in the quarter and ortho was up a little bit. General dentistry was down. The equipment business was down 20%, and that blended to a down low-teens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the equipment business you think is, you're explaining mostly through inventory destocking still?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the first issue there, Steve, clearly is a lower level of spend, particularly for big ticket items, both in the U.S. and in Europe. I think that coupled with the destocking that we're seeing this year are I think the two primary reasons why we're down the way that we are. But again, as I have said, I think we have a lot of improvement opportunities in front of us at KaVo. I'm encouraged by what I have seen. I was with the team in Europe two weeks ago. I'm with the team in the U.S. in fact tomorrow. I think we're beginning to get the traction I'd like to see us have in that business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tech margins absent restructuring were comparable to Q2, just low double-digit. We believe they're going to move sequentially to mid-teens here in the fourth quarter, again absent restructuring.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Could we just follow up a little bit more on restructuring, Larry or Dan? And just help us thinking about the benefit variance as we move from '09 to 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, the way we're looking at it, of the 250 million spend this year, there is an annualized benefit of 220. Roughly a quarter of that we're going to get in the second half, or let's call it 60 million in the second half. We were pleased with what we got in the third quarter and we think we're tracking well in that regard, and we'll get about 150, 160 benefit rolling forward into 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the incremental on top of the 60?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So a 220 total, 60 this year, 160 left over for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I see there's a comment in the Q that some of this 250 maybe actually doesn't get spent or executed on until the first half of next year. Does that weight those benefits then for next year more into the second half, or does that kind of come through in a linear fashion over the course of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Jeff, I think that's right. I think as you &#x2013; as we've tried to highlight, I think we've bitten off a lot here to get done. Some of it may spill into early next year in terms of the spend, and if we execute on that path, clearly some of the benefit will be more back-loaded and potentially a little less. But yes, I think we are pleased with the execution we have seen through nine months. A lot of work to do here in the fourth quarter, and we're hopeful we'll get through that. But it will be tight, which is why we flagged it again in the Q.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any spillover benefit into 2010 from the 80 million of '08 actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very little. I mean we thought we'd get 100 million this year and we're tracking awfully close to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Larry, when you were just piecing together the &#x2013; kind of the GAAP walk on guidance, can you just true us up, maybe Dan, really just on kind of the tax items. You said tax 25% in Q4, so there's no more unusuals in tax?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. So in the fourth quarter, and we have posted this on our website, a kind of a quarter-by-quarter look with the one-time items. We'll have about $0.30 of restructuring in the fourth quarter and probably about $0.04 of M&amp;A expense, and that's primarily the deal expenses on the PaloDEx and the AB SCIEX deals. So at the midpoint of $1.04 of adjusted EPS, you have $0.70 GAAP EPS adding back to get to adjusted $0.30 of restructuring and $0.04 of M&amp;A expense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just on deals, just the complexion of things like as you've said, I think Dan, eight deals in eight weeks. Obviously AB SCIEX is sizable, but should we &#x2013; is there anything to glean here from what we've seen? Should we expect a lot of little deals? Is that's what's breaking free? Or are there actually sizable things in the pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, I think what you're seeing is another frankly typical Danaher acquisition year, where you're going to have a couple of big deals, and we've put the SCIEX/Mol Dev pairing in that zone, some smaller situations and a number of bolt-ons to put together an average year of 12 or 15 deals. So I think that distribution is shaping up as it has in years past, but the six deals that we have flagged here that some of you may not have known about that we closed out in the quarter tended to be our bread and butter. But there certainly are some larger situations still very much percolating in the M&amp;A process that we're optimistic about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm not sure you can glean too much prospectively, but of the six deals closed and those two deals pending. The collective purchase price is about 1.5 times revenues, which is lower than the last couple years. Now part of that reflects lower margins, given the downturn, but that often bodes well from a return perspective is going in at a little lower revenue multiple.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just kind of maybe one other thing that's got two parts, is just I think all companies here are kind of struggling with kind of trying to get their arms around what costs actually come back. Everybody has leaned on 401(k) and merit raise and all kinds of things as we have progressed through '09. I'm sure you're looking at some commodity price pressure or commodity cost pressure I should say into 2010. And is there anything else that just kind of bleeds in that we should be thinking about as we're thinking about this restructuring walk we talked about a little bit earlier just in my set of questions?</p>

          <p>Jeff, in addition to that, some potential commodity headwinds next year, and again that would primarily be around motion and tools for us. We, like a lot of companies, have done things around wages this year, whether it's in furloughs, wage freezes, decreases, by and large lower bonuses. We are in the process of looking through a lot of that as we go through budgets. Some of it will depend upon how the overall environment is, and we'll talk more about this in December. But there will be some headwind from some of those types of items.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just &#x2013; I might have missed this. So what was the restructuring benefit in the quarter? You said 60 million in the second half. What was it in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's probably a little &#x2013; it's probably my guess would be 20, 25 million from what we have done year-to-date plus another what we did in Q4. We thought we'd get 100 million this year and we're roughly tracking 25 million a quarter. So you might be 20 from what we've done this year and 25 what we've done last year, and you see that in the sequential lift in core margins Q2 to Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And on the commodity front, what was the &#x2013; you talked about tools being half commodities. Does that include the modest price benefit of tools, or is that all just the cost side of the equation? Maybe you could just tell us for the company what the cost side of the equation benefited you?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I don't have that outside of tools, because it's not that significant outside of tools. But I would say sequentially commodities were more of a headwind than it was in Q2. So we got...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So quarter-over-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, quarter-over-quarter we got significant margin improvement, and that was despite sort of slightly higher commodity costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. In the Q you had an added disclosure around tax legislation that is being debated, and the last sentence said that changes here would adversely impact you guys. Are there &#x2013; is there anything specific that we should be watching that would hurt you guys more than any of the other changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, nothing specific other than what some of the general discussions about raising the effective tax rate for U.S. multinationals.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one last question, just on the deal, the M&amp;A expenses, sorry, which deals were those for? Was the $0.04 for which deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's for deals that we have signed like MD &#x2013; like SCIEX and PaloDEx, that we know we're going to have here in the fourth quarter. There's also a small amount of kind of one-time non-cash charges related to inventory step-up and deferred revenues from deals we closed in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, and these are like smaller deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The deals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the six we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So going forward, I mean given that these deals &#x2013; you guys do a ton of smaller deals every year. I mean are we going to have basically an adjusted EPS number every quarter now, given that you're going to do a few deals every quarter, and you'll be kind of like showing maybe two to $0.03 a quarter or will now &#x2013; will this kind of be absorbed going forward as the economy improves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suspect, Steve, given the new accounting rules, which again, I think particularly the expense having to have transaction expenses run through the P&amp;L, which I don't think is indicative of the performance of the business, we'll be calling it out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, isn't that though part of your ongoing business? Wouldn't you consider doing deals, given the frequency of that, just basically a part of what you guys do as a company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And that's very much reflected in our cash flow statement. I don't view it as &#x2013; my view, and I think others have the view, that that's part of the cost of buying a company, the transaction costs.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of &#x2013; I mean one main question and one follow-up. But the main question would be just looking at your businesses in terms of geography, could you give us some color on how much China is a percentage of your business right now and emerging markets as a whole? And then also, looking at the three major geographies, North America, Europe and Asia, where the trends are the most positive and where they are the most negative across your businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly Asia is the most positive, when we focus on China and on India, which in aggregate probably will be about 1 billion, 1.1 billion, 1.2 billion for us this year. We were pleased they were actually both up for us in the third quarter. We hadn't seen that pairing in awhile; both up about a mid single-digit range. But as we said in our prepared remarks, the rest of the fast growth or the so-called emerging markets were soft. We saw that in Latin America. We saw that in Eastern Europe. But China and India were the standouts for us. The U.S. I would say was probably number two. Not that we were growing, but again I think the stabilization was encouraging, the backlog build was encouraging. Of the three, I'd slot Europe last just given that stabilization did not firm up as much as it did in the U.S.  But obviously a pretty big gap between what we saw in North America and in Europe compared to those two high growth countries in Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then the second question would be just looking at the business development environment and looking at acquisitions, in the pipeline of acquisitions you have right now, are you &#x2013; is it mainly sort of add-ons and bolt-ons or maybe even significant acquisitions in existing verticals that you're in on the strategic platform? Or is there some material sort of potential to get an additional platform?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that, as we were talking a moment ago, the funnels are always chock full of every type of opportunity, from big potentially transformational situations all the way down to small channel or product bolt-ons. I think as we look forward here, certainly for the rest of this year, I continue to believe that it is highly unlikely that you're going to see us create a brand new platform. Obviously with SCIEX and Mol Dev coming in, the Med Tech business is going to be close to 4 billion in size. What we think of as our Life Science Diagnostic group is going to be up 40%, which is not a small number, obviously. So we're excited about that, obviously lots of activity around Product ID, Test and Measurement and Environmental as well. But again, just don't think we'll see a new platform in the near term.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've already covered quite a bit, but just a couple quick ones here, specifically at Motion. A couple distributors in that industry have been commenting on kind of increasing pricing pressure. Has that business been more problematic than most from a pricing perspective lately?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not to date, but I wouldn't refute what you're hearing from distribution in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there specifically as well, is kind of destocking more or less as far as it can go from your perspective? Or is there still some room to see some additional destocking going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, those are very different questions. I wouldn't rule out the possibility that we could see it go down further, but I doubt it. Again, I think there, as we've seen in some other businesses, I think folks are pretty close or at levels that they're comfortable with. We might argue that maybe they're a little light. So at this point, I think the destocking, absent another external shock to the system, has probably by and large run its course, though again, we're going to see a little bit of that for us at least still play out around certain dental lines and to a degree in tools. But otherwise particularly in Motion, I think we're pretty close.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, Dan.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, in the past you've talked about certain pieces of your business being kind of internal maybe leading indicators. I think the Motion business fell in there, Product ID. If you were to sum the &#x2013; take a snapshot of that at the end of September, just characterize where we are. It sounds like we're maybe a little past stabilization in the U.S. and maybe not quite there in Europe? Or how would you characterize those businesses that you look at as being leading indicators?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we clearly, Rick, we will get a lot of data points, both in our own order books and the sell-out and bill schedules with our own customers. It's hard to circle a date on the calendar, but I think we're clearly at a point where the U.S. is quite firm. Whether you look at the book-to-bill at T&amp;M, sell-through at Fluke, just again this inventory issue seemingly having run its course, what we're seeing, say, with the consumables at Hach Lange, in Videojet as well, just a lot of different data points would suggest the worst is over, and we'll build off of this base. I think you're spot on. Europe is just not there yet in as broad and as clear a way as we see it here in the U.S., but I don't want to suggest that Europe is in a bad place. I think it's just, it just feels, if you will, it feels like it's behind a bit what we're seeing in the U.S. right now. And again I think a real contrast is everything kicking in, in our types of businesses at least, right now in China and in India.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just the last question, Larry, on the dental equipment side, again maybe I'm weighting this a little bit incorrectly, but certainly dental equipment being down 20% plus, I think, would seem worse than the industry. Can you just &#x2013; we have an easier fourth quarter comparison. I think last year dental equipment was down low double digits. How do you expect that business to perform, and am I correct or incorrect saying that at least in that piece of the business, it feels like you're underperforming the industry a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Rick, I think we have made no bones about the fact that KaVo is short of its full potential. I've said that externally, I've said that internally, but I also want to reiterate my confidence for us to achieve that full potential in the business. I think sequentially as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we would anticipate much better performance at the top, certainly on the bottom as well. We have dedicated a fair bit of restructuring monies that we have spent this year to adjusting the cost structure, particularly in Europe and elsewhere around the world.</p>
          <p>But again I think this is also a good growth market over the long term. We're in a bit of an air pocket, if you will, right now. I think others see that as dentists postponed upgrading operatories, upgrading their practices, but I think that will pass. I really do. And as the market recovers and we improve, we should be undue beneficiaries of that. That's the objective, that's what we and the team have agreed to. But again, work to do, and we're not there today, but we'll be working hard to be there in the not too distant future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I know. It's a high class problem. I just have one quick question, and again I just want to come back to Tektronix a little bit. Can you give us a sense of the book-to-bill, where you're at now, where you've been tracking through the year, just to get a sense of when the comps get easier next year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the book-to-bill through the second quarter was running below one. We were over &#x2013; tech instruments and tech communications were both over one and combined were like 1.1, so obviously an encouraging sign there. That will be a slight benefit in Q4, but I think as that book-to-bill grows, it should help going into 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the typical lag in kind of when you see an order and when you make a delivery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's all over the map. When they were a public company, they would talk about two to three quarters. When the book-to-bill would flip one way or the other it would be two to three quarters before you would really see that play out in shipments.</p>
