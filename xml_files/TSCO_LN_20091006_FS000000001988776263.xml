          <p>Welcome, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. We'll follow the usual running order, with Laurie covering the financial results followed by Terry with an update on strategy and then we'll have plenty of time to take your questions.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the numbers, we've delivered further good growth in sales and profits even in these extraordinary times. Importantly, as there seems to be some early signs of recovery in the markets around the world, we are seeing some stabilization in consumer spending.</p>
          <p>I believe Tesco will emerge from this downturn even stronger. And this is because we've been working even harder for customers, we've kept a tight grip on costs and importantly cash.</p>
          <p>We've also pushed on and stuck to our strategy and continuing to invest for our long-term future. Because of this we've maintained good organic growth with a strong new space program and last year's acquisitions of Tesco Personal Finance and Homever in Korea have also given us good momentum.</p>
          <p>TPF is making good progress and our new partnership with Fortis is an important strategic step in developing our insurance business. As you know, our plan is to grow TPF to a full-service retail bank and so I'm pleased to announce that as of today it will called Tesco Bank.</p>
          <p>Turning to our other major acquisition, Homever in Korea, the stores we bought in September last year are proving very popular with customers, following their conversion to our Homeplus format, and we continue to see strong sales uplifts. In fact, although the business was loss making when we acquired it, I am delighted to tell you that it is now profitable and performing ahead of plan.</p>
          <p>Our work on community and environment is progressing well and we've passed some very important milestones in the first half. We achieved our target of diverting 100% of waste from landfill almost a year ahead of schedule. We have announced that in just a few weeks time we will open our first zero-carbon store in Ramsey, Cambridgeshire. We've also recently opened our first green store in China, and in the U.S. Fresh &amp; Easy has been awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design gold standard. And I'm also pleased that we secured the coveted Carbon Trust Standard for environmental achievements as a result of our substantial investment in green initiatives.</p>
          <p>In a month that's seen an unprecedented number of nature disasters, we've been one of the first U.K. businesses to make a substantial donation to support vital relief work in the Asia-Pacific region through our emergency partnership with the British Red Cross.</p>
          <p>On trade, in the last few months have also seen some important developments for our loyalty scheme Clubcard. In the U.K. we've made our biggest investment in loyalty since we launched Clubcard in 1995 and recently we've launched schemes in Poland, Thailand and Slovakia. Clubcard will also have a bigger part to play as we continue to develop our retail services offer.</p>
          <p>The Tesco team has again worked incredibly hard over the last few months and I'd like to thank all of them for their efforts in delivering an Every Little Helps shopping trip to millions of customers every week.</p>
          <p>I'm also pleased that our growth and investment in creating many thousands of jobs across our markets &#x2013; over 6,500 for the U.K. business alone, including 2,500 people recruited through the government's local employment partnerships.</p>
          <p>Thank you from me and I'll now hand you over to Laurie.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you, David. I'm going to start with the main financial headlines for the Group. We've performed well in a challenging macroenvironment. We've developed robust trading numbers with the double-digit ex-petrol growth and strong market share gains.</p>
          <p>Our Step Change program has helped us fund significant new investment for customers. We've maintained a strong, organic opening program, whilst improving our focus on capital discipline. Last year's acquisitions are already delivering benefits and will continue to give us momentum over the longer term.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger. We're on track with our plans to reduce net debt by &#xA3;1 billion this year, with a further reduction next year. Our lean business and excellent market positions mean we are well placed to prosper in a global recovery.</p>
          <p>I'll now go through the detail of the Group performance. Total Group sales for the half year ended the 29th of August, 2009 were 30.4 billion, up 8.3%. There is of course substantial petrol deflation within these numbers and Group sales ex-petrol were up 11.4%. Group trading profit was 14% to 1.6 billion. Acquisitions helped for this &#x2013; a very strong performance against a background of a recession in all of our markets.</p>
          <p>Group underlying profit before tax was 1.6 billion, up 8.6%. Growth has been impacted by the increase in interest charged related to the funding of the two acquisitions in the second half of last year. These costs will begin to reduce going forward as debt reduces.</p>
          <p>Group property profits have risen as planned. They've increased by 48% to &#xA3;235 million. As you know, property development is a core strength of our business. Through the process of assembling prime sites, getting planning permissions then building out and trading stores, Tesco creates significant value in property assets. Through our sale and lease back program, we release some of the value and recycle it back into new developments.</p>
          <p>This not only gives us a strong backbone to our balance sheet &#x2013; and I sometimes feel this point is not always well understood, it also means that we're able to deliver a sustainable stream of property profits and enhanced dividend for our shareholders. Even during the low point in the wider property cycle, we deliver very competitive yields.</p>
          <p>Group pre-tax profit was up 1.5%. The lower growth rate is due to the non-cash IAS movements, principally the Tesco Bank amortization of intangibles and an impairment of our goodwill in Japan, which I'll come back to in a moment.</p>
          <p>Underlying diluted earnings per share were up 9.1% to 14.48 pence. The PBT growth is disproportionably affected by non-cash IAS movements and for this reason we use the underlying diluted EPS to guide our dividend policy. I'm therefore pleased to announce an interim dividend of 3.89 pence, up 9%.</p>
          <p>I'll now talk to the results of the individual businesses starting with the U.K. Our U.K. business has delivered a very good and profitable performance. The total sales in the U.K., ex-petrol, ex-VAT, was 6.4%: 2.8% for net new stores and 3.7% like-for-like.</p>
          <p>As we lap last year's hikes in commodity prices, the unhelpful (7.41) effects of inflation have been moderating, providing better conditions for building volume growth and customer loyalty, with more to come as we trade over the discounted brand launch of last year.</p>
          <p>Data from both TNS and IGD suggest that our like-for-like sales performance is now converged with our U.K. competitors.</p>
          <p>U.K. trading profit was 1.2 billion, up 7.4% and U.K. margins rose by 20 basis points to 6%. Helped by a fall in petrol participation, we continue to invest more for customers, particularly in loyalty, and this is funded by our Step Change program, which is on track to deliver a planned saving of 550 million by the year end.</p>
          <p>In Asia sales were &#x20A4;4.4 billion, up 38% at actual exchange rates and by 27% at constant exchange rates. Trading profit in Asia rose by 21% up to &#x20A4;175 million. The Korean acquisition, building on our good track record with recent acquisitions in Poland and Malaysia, has been a success. So far, Homever has been margin dilutive, but as profitability converges with our core Homeplus business and with no repeat of last year's integration costs, the acquisition will deliver strong profit growth in the second half.</p>
          <p>Across the other Asian markets, the performance of Thailand, our second largest, was pleasing with strong growth as recent stores openings mature and as productivity programs begin to yield good results.</p>
          <p>In our last Annual Report we explained that given the challenging retail market conditions in Japan we'd only limited headroom on the carrying value of goodwill. Since the market conditions have now worsened, we felt it was right to impair around half of this, which involved an &#xA3;82 million one-off charge to the income statement.</p>
          <p>In Europe we've delivered a remarkably resilient performance against a background of a deep recession across all of our markets. Sales were &#xA3;4.8 billion, increasing by 1% at both actual and constant rates.</p>
          <p>Performance in Poland and Hungary held up particularly well. In Ireland, in the face of very difficult macroeconomics cross-border trading, we took positive action by reducing prices. We funded this by a complete restructuring of our Irish operations, particularly the way that we buy and source international products. And as a result of this work we've held profits steady on last year and you'll see a 15 million related exceptional charge to the income statement.</p>
          <p>In Czech, Slovakia and Turkey our local management teams have done an excellent work to cope with the tough recession and a resulting sharp fall in like-for-like sales. Across our market, squaring the circle, a tough environment for sales, the need to get prices down for customers and yet still deliver the bottom line has clearly not been easy. But our businesses have risen to the challenge and that's why our trading profit performance in Europe has been so resilient.</p>
          <p>First half trading profits were &#xA3;191 million. As you'll remember, it was around this time last year that the economic conditions began to deteriorate so rapidly and that will naturally help growth rates in the second half.</p>
          <p>In Fresh &amp; Easy our focus has been on running a lean and flexible model, which will serve as a solid foundation for the business when local economies start to recover. At constant exchange rates trading losses were &#xA3;67 million, a similar run rate to the second half of last year.</p>
          <p>Retailing services profits were 221 million, up 11%. Our services seminar is now scheduled for November and we're looking forward to discussing the opportunities for the business and sharing our growth plans with you.</p>
          <p>In Tesco Bank our initial focus is on re-platforming our system and infrastructure. As you know, we announced an agreement with Fortis last month which will help us build the operational platform and accelerate our technical expertise in insurance. Tesco Bank will be responsible for all commercial decision making and whilst benefiting from a very efficient claims handling function. We've also now selected the core technology platforms for our banking products.</p>
          <p>Obviously the retail banking sector has been difficult. The Tesco Bank profits were stable at &#xA3;115 million after a &#xA3;15 million of integration costs.</p>
          <p>Bad debts have been rising, but as I said at the preliminaries, we've provided prudently for this to the acquisition, and more importantly, our high quality book means our bad debt performance remains significantly better than the industry average.</p>
          <p>We've maintained the Tesco Bank balance sheet in net surplus with a stable savings balance and a strong Tier 1 ratio of over 12%. We've provided a first half income statement and a balance sheet in your packs.</p>
          <p>Profit from joint ventures and associates was 22 million, principally from our joint ventures in property and dunnhumby. Of course, last year's number of 43 million included Tesco Bank as a joint venture.</p>
          <p>Statutory tax has been charged at an effective rate of 27.5%, which has been inflated by the Japan impairment. Excluding this, our underlying tax rate is 26.7% and we expect the position to be broadly similar for the full year.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn to our balance sheet. Net debt has leveled at 9.5 billion from 9.6 billion in February. And given that most of our cash generation is weighted towards the second half, we're well on track with our plans to reduce it to 8.5 billion by the year end.</p>
          <p>As I outlined in April, the approach to this reduction is threefold. We're managing capital expenditure back to the long-term trend, we're improving working capital particularly around stock levels, and we're also continuing to use property proceeds to pay down debt. Assuming stable sterling, I expect us to be able to deliver a similar net debt reduction next year as well. I'm pleased and I hope you're encouraged by this improvement.</p>
          <p>I decided to review the hedging policy in April recognizing the increasing natural hedging from our broader geographies. We've made several policy adjustments including spreading the maturity of the new hedges over a longer period and hedging a lower proportion of our balance sheet. Despite significant volatility in currency through the half, the impact of hedging to net debt has been contained at less than &#xA3;100 million, and that's non-cash.</p>
          <p>Property proceeds in the half totaled 0.8 billion, with store yields of 5.2%. Just after half year we completed an additional transaction of another 0.5 billion at a similar yield which means our plans for property proceeds for the year as a whole are well on track. Our freehold property mix remained strong, well above 70% and in line with our long-term objectives.</p>
          <p>Net finance costs have increased to &#xA3;205 million, which includes the net return on our pension assets and liabilities in addition to the impacts of IAS 32 and 39. The underlying interest charge increased to 232 million from 112 million last year, driven principally by the increase in debt relating to the two acquisitions. The retirement of debt during the second half and beyond will reduce the charge and help our growth going forward.</p>
          <p>Moving onto pensions. Our staff tell us that pension is a key part of the remuneration package and an important driver of loyalty. Now that many other companies have chosen to close their defined benefit schemes, we can be even more competitive in recruiting and retaining the best people.</p>
          <p>As you know, for accounting purposes, IFRS requires we value pension liabilities on a high quality corporate bond yield. And that yield has fell by over 100 basis points in the first half. The IFRS pension deficit has therefore increased to 1.4 billion after tax. Obviously it's not reflective of the change in our obligation and underlines the volatility in this measure. Just five weeks later the IFRS deficit has now fallen back to 1.1 billion after tax. Our actuarial deficit remains small and manageable.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the chart, Group capital expenditure in the half was 1.6 billion reflecting our strategy to continue to invest through the recession. This may seem counterintuitive as it's 0.9 billion less than last year, yet we've opened a market leading level of organic space.</p>
          <p>We've done this through the property teams buying for less and delivering new space which is 20% cheaper to build. We've also developed out some of the considerable capital in progress we have on the balance sheet prior to the recession. We maintain our CapEx guidance at 3.5 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>Our retail operating cash flow was 2.3 billion, 0.7 billion higher than CapEx. We're doing good work in stock reduction, and financially this has driven an improvement in working capital.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, it's also improved our operations. In fact, availability for customers is at an all-time high and it's making life a lot easier for staff.</p>
          <p>Our focus on cash management has been stronger and there will be larger improvements here in the second half.</p>
          <p>In summary, Tesco has shown its pedigree, growing sales and profits well in the most challenging market conditions. Our focus on controlling costs and capital discipline is helping us deliver strong operation cash flows which help to pay down debt. I feel we are very well placed to benefit when the economy recovers and that begins to gather pace.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I'd now like to hand over to Terry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Laurie, and good morning, everyone. So today's first half results demonstrate that Tesco has a strong, efficient and adaptable business model that's delivering a profitable growth even in the deepest recession any of us can remember.</p>
          <p>And it's at times like this when our strategy and our people are tested most. And because they're equal to the test, we're making good progress in all areas of the business. We're focusing on helping customers in this time of economic uncertainty by providing consistent and sustainable value they can trust and we're rewarding their loyalty with further investment in Clubcard, both in the U.K. and internationally.</p>
          <p>Tesco's core strengths, our focus on the customer, the consistency of our strategy, strong local management teams, an efficient business model and a spirit of innovation and knowledge sharing are more important, more important than ever during a recession. They've enabled us to make the necessary adjustments to our business to get prices down for customers, to continue to invest for tomorrow whilst delivering good financial performance today.</p>
          <p>But recessions can present opportunities as well as the obvious challenges. And we're taking these opportunities to grow share in our international markets, to strengthen our reputation and presence in non-food and to take our services business to the next level.</p>
          <p>Last year's acquisitions in Korea and Tesco Bank are performing very well and making a good contribution to sales and profits. But these opportunities and many others around the Group, like our early stage investments in India and China and the U.S., we've many organic sources of future growth and with the right strategy, resources and the right capabilities to make it happen.</p>
          <p>Now I'll begin my usual update with international, where we've achieved solid results despite the global recession and that's affected all of our markets &#x2013; indeed the countries that offer the greatest potential growth in the long term have been some of the hardest hit in the short-term. But the long-term opportunity is still there.</p>
          <p>Our international performance in the first half was encouraging. Sales increased by 17% and most of the sales growth came in Asia, helped by the acquisition of stores in Korea. A good contribution from new space in both Asia and Europe demonstrates the value of a strong store opening program in driving growth through a downturn.</p>
          <p>Profits also grew, which shows the resilience of our international businesses. Strong market positions underpinned this resilience, with more than 90% of our international sales and profits coming from markets in which we have a number one or a number two position; strong statistic I think.</p>
          <p>When growth is harder to come by, relative progress is the key to measure performance. We can't influence the general economic environment, but we can react well to it and move quickly to do the right thing for customers and to stay ahead of competitors. And we've made encouraging market share gains in both Europe and Asia, evidence that our strategy is working and testament to the way we manage locally.</p>
          <p>We're driving much more meaningful benefits from Group economies, both of scale and skill. For example, we now have a Step Change program in every country; Clubcard running in seven countries with local dunnhumby teams presence in those countries; Discount Brands in four countries; and clothing is a company-wide strength, with global sourcing and the introduction of our Florence &amp; Fred ranges into five countries in Europe already, very successfully too, and four countries in Asia later this year. Combining this international best practice with good local decision making has enabled us to perform well through these difficult times.</p>
          <p>I'm encouraged by our performance in Central Europe, given the economic background there. We've delivered strong market share performance, as you can see from these numbers. As others feel the strain, our determination to invest through the downturn to adjust the business correctly is seeing Tesco emerge even stronger.</p>
          <p>The first half saw another good performance in Hungary. Our store opening program has given us the momentum for sustained sales and profit growth in a very difficult market environment.</p>
          <p>Poland continues to grow strongly, with sales and profits up. Smaller formats, including our former Leader Price stores, continue to trade well, demonstrating the benefit of our multi-format strategy. Poland remains an important long-term opportunity. It's one of the largest economies, of course, in the region, but it still has a fragmented and under-developed retail market. I mean, we're the leader there with barely 5% share.</p>
          <p>The Czech Republic and Slovakia remain tough markets, with industrial production in both countries falling by around 20%. We've taken bold action to address the market challenges by lowering costs and prices. For example, in Slovakia where the conversion to the euro resulted in very high prices for a while relative to neighboring countries, we've lowered our prices significantly to reduce the effects of cross-border trading.</p>
          <p>In Turkey, as we outlined at the prelims, we've slowed the pace of expansion this year because of the severity of the recession. Despite this, we continue to grow sales well by around 15% and we remain confident about the long-term potential, which is why we've put in place a strong pipeline of new store space there when things pick up.</p>
          <p>In Ireland, we've transformed our business to address head-on the particular problems facing the Irish economy. By leveraging our U.K. business, Tesco Ireland has been able to improve the range and get cheaper for customers, with 12,500 products being reduced by an average of 22%. Customers are responding enthusiastically, with significant uplifts in volumes offsetting much of the price deflation and resulting in strongly improving like-for-like trend in recent weeks.</p>
          <p>Our businesses in Asia, whilst not unscathed by the economic slowdown, have had a very good start to the year with strong growth in both sales and profits. In our largest business, Homeplus in Korea, the integration of the former Homever stores continues to deliver good results, sales uplifts of 40% and our stores are now profitable, more to come as Laurie said.</p>
          <p>We now have there a sophisticated business in another large developed market with more growth to come. In just 10 years in Korea, we've grown from two stores to become a challenger for market leadership. Our market share has grown by 2% of the whole market in the last year, narrowing the gap with the market leader.</p>
          <p>Our success in Korea is a model for how we can develop large and profitable businesses in Asia. In many ways our business in China today is similar to Korea just a few years ago, except of course the market is so much bigger. We're laying the foundations for long-term growth with further investments in space, infrastructure and management. We've organized our operations into a three region structure to provide an improved local customer focus, of course which is important in a country as large and diverse as China. We're developing a regional supply chain structure to support it and we'll be opening 19 hypermarkets this year, including our first freehold shopping center. We now have more than 20 such freehold schemes in our pipeline and we're further advanced in the process of finding investors to share the capital commitment there.</p>
          <p>Tesco Lotus in Thailand delivered another good performance, growing sales and profits. A strong store opening program continues to drive our growth in a market in which we're clear market leader. The launch of Clubcard in August marks the next stage of the development of our brand in Thailand. Take-up from customers has been very encouraging with three million customers signing up in just the first seven weeks.</p>
          <p>Growth in Malaysia has again been strong with sales and profits growing well with a strong contribution from new space. This has helped us grow market share by 1.5% of the total market over the last year, further extending our market leadership.</p>
          <p>In Japan, as Laurie has said, the retail environment remains very difficult. Our new team there is making further progress in developing the business. We've launched our first 100 own brand lines and will have 500 of those by the end of the year, some of them are shown here. Our Express format which has been developed for Japan continues to perform well with positive like-for-like sales growth.</p>
          <p>Our plans in India are coming together well. A growing local management team is helping our partner Trent to develop its Star Bazaar hypermarket operation; seeing some very significant sales uplifts in the stores. Plans for the wholesale business are also on track. First cash and carry store opens in 2010.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to the U.K., I want to update you on Fresh &amp; Easy in the United States. I was there actually a week ago. I can't report any improvements in the economic environment in that part of the United States, Arizona, Nevada, California, but I'm pleased to say we're making good progress in developing the business and in improving our offer.</p>
          <p>Customers understand the format. They get it. They love it. It's got a wide appeal. They love the fresh food. They appreciate the great value. As with all businesses we've launched, we're making adjustments along the way based on customer feedback. Customers tell us they'd like to find more of their weekly shopping list at Fresh &amp; Easy so we've broadened the range in some key categories like cereal and pet food. We've added some larger pack sizes for families and we've also introduced a range of house brands to help families on a budget through the economic downturn.</p>
          <p>Recognizing the tough economic climate, we've been focusing on building sales steadily, more cautious approach to the new store openings. We are opening new stores, just at a lower rate than we'd intended. And we've reduced marketing spend compared to the first half of last year whilst we were making the range changes and the adjustments.</p>
          <p>Now, although like-for-like sales growth has softened through that period, we know that the underlying business performance has been strong. Our coastal California stores which have been &#x2013; I mean, have been affected by the economic downturn, though less than the other regions, they're achieving good sales growth and are actually already approaching the turnover levels that we're looking for.</p>
          <p>Now, mid-September with the number of stores at 126, with the latest changes to space and range complete, we launched Fresh &amp; Easy's first full marketing campaign with advertising. The advertising focuses on explaining to customers how Fresh &amp; Easy can offer both high quality and low prices. The initial reaction, actually, from customers has been very positive and we're confident that the increased customer awareness and traffic will build on the changes we've made in the stores to support further growth.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I'm pleased with the performance in international. Our businesses have made the necessary adjustments to meet the needs of customers who are feeling the strain, and they've done so profitably. We're continuing to invest, six million square feet of new space opening at international this year which means we'll be well placed as the economic recovery comes.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the U.K. Well, it hasn't been easy, but we've delivered some solid results for the first half of the year. We've grown sales and profit, we've maintained good margins. Our like-for-like performance has converged with our competitors and we're seeing volumes growing faster than our competitors.</p>
          <p>As always, we've stayed focused on the customer and delivering a great shopping trip. We're maintaining our strong price position, we're offering customers more affordable alternatives such as the Discount Brand and market value ranges launched this time last year. Now, that encouraged customers to trade down, it introduced disinflation into our business. But this is keeping customers shopping with us and has reversed the trend against the limited range discounters which you'll have seen in market share information.</p>
          <p>We've made improvements in availability with new developments in ordering systems, some good work on replenishment and stock control resulting in some of our highest availability scores ever. We're doing a lot on ranging and presentation, particularly in fresh foods, as well as improved technical standards and additional staff training, more accurate ordering too. We're making big changes in the way we merchandize some key categories, starting with produce. As a result, customer perception of produce quality as a whole has improved significantly.</p>
          <p>Building on these improvements, our increased investments in Clubcard, first with Double Up and now with Double Points is giving customers even greater rewards for their loyalty. Now, although we expect the benefit of the Clubcard relaunch to grow steadily over time, we're already seeing some very encouraging results. We're signing up the Clubcard holders at a much faster rate; I think we've signed up a million new customers since the launch. Customer data shows that Clubcard is growing in importance as a reason for shopping with us and the strongest responses come from those customers who were previously less committed to Tesco.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we're making good progress in the U.K. Our strategy is sustainable for the long term because our low prices and other investments, like Clubcard, are funded by structural productivity improvements. Because Clubcard is unique to Tesco it enables us to encourage and reward loyal behavior.</p>
          <p>Our non-food business too has been very resilient. I believe it's emerging from the downturn even stronger. As some competitors will have felt the strain, more customers will have been encouraged to try our non-food ranges, either in store or online or indeed actually the combination of store and online is a great strength of the business.</p>
          <p>In the first half non-food delivered positive like-for-like sales and overall sales growth of 5%. A number of our hardline categories had double-digit like-for-like growth including electricals with our own brand, Technika, now the fifth best selling television brand in the U.K. Home categories which have been particularly hard hit with the slowdown in the housing market are now growing again.</p>
          <p>Our clothing business continues to develop well, and in the first half grew sales by 7%, helped by a strong back-to-school campaign. The launch of our online clothing range last week is in direct response to customer requests. Clothing is the most searched for term on the entire Tesco website. With the 2,500 lines online as well as Cherokee and Florence &amp; Fred, we'll have some new Tesco product including more fashion and higher value products. The online site will make clothing much more accessible for those customers who at the moment don't live near one of our larger stores.</p>
          <p>As you know, we're putting more resources behind our successful retailing services business with the aim of taking them to &#xA3;1 billion in profit. Tesco Bank continues to perform well in a difficult retail banking market. We've grown our customer base in credit cards, loans and savings and we've expanded the number of ATMs and travel bureaus in our stores. As Laurie mentioned, the strategic priority this year is to build our infrastructure and capability. After that, of course, we plan to accelerate the growth of the business by expanding its product range and in-store presence in a market with considerable long-term potential for Tesco and Tesco customers.</p>
          <p>Our online business, including tesco.com grocery and Tesco Direct have had another period of growth with sales up 11% on the first half &#x2013; that's 11% on a big number of course in Tesco, and profits up 20%. It's an impressive growth rate for what is now a substantial business.</p>
          <p>Our grocery delivery business continues to develop with sales up by 9% within that figure driven by increases in both customer orders and basket size. We've been improving service levels. Internationally, our dotcom operations in Korea and Ireland are both growing well.</p>
          <p>Tesco Direct also saw a good start to the year. We now have 240 in-store Direct desks; allows customers to collect their online orders from their local stores. Sales growth for Direct was strong in the first half, growing by almost 30%, with particularly strong performance from audio/visual toys and games.</p>
          <p>Our telecoms businesses are doing well, with total customer numbers and profits growing. The rollout of our in-store Phone Shops continues with 59 now open &#x2013; most of those open this year actually. We're on track on to have 100 by the year end. The Phone Shops are transforming our ability to sell products that require assisted sale like contract mobile phones.</p>
          <p>Tesco Mobile grew its customer base by 10% in a declining pre-pay market, with customers responding well to its offer of simple, good value tariffs. And you may have seen our recent TV advert. If you haven't, look here now. Steve is bringing me back to my old marketing days.</p>
          <p>[Video Presentation]</p>
          <p>It's an old marketing trick: liven up a presentation with an advert. But actually that product is doing fantastically well.</p>
          <p>Right. Well, we'll talk about more about the growth opportunity and development in each of these services businesses at the retailing services seminar which happens in November.</p>
          <p>We continue to advance our work on community and the environment. In the U.K. we've reduced CO2 emissions from existing stores and distribution centers by 6%. We're on track to deliver our global target for the year of 5.5% for the Group. Last month we took the important step of introducing carbon footprint labels on our milk range which, as you know, is a very high volume area. And by the end of this year we'll have developed the carbon footprint for 500 products.</p>
          <p>With Community Champions in more than a hundred stores and five distribution centers across the U.K., we're doing more than ever to forge close relationships with local communities and support local charities. And we've now got Champions also in six other countries outside the U.K.</p>
          <p>So in summary, Tesco is about sustainable long-term growth and even in recession this remains our focus. Our business is resilient and adaptable and we're delivering solid growth even in difficult times. We're well placed in the regions that will be the growth story of this generation with a rapidly developing business in China and a new venture in India. Our climate change initiatives are preparing as well for the lower carbon world post-Copenhagen.</p>
          <p>The progress we're making right across the Group and the investment we're continuing to make will ensure that we'll be even stronger coming out of the downturn and we're well positioned for sustainable growth in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>If we now open up for questions, if you put your hands up, I'll choose somebody and we'll try and get around everyone. And just say where you're from and by that time the microphone should have got to you. So we always start with Dorgan (40.08), tradition. Where is he? There he is.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Philip Dorgan of Ambient (40.07). Just a quick question. When you launched Discount Brands a year ago, did you think that over the year you would underperform the industry and what would have happened do you think if you hadn't? I mean, I suppose the implication is discounts would have grown but would your competitors have grown much faster as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, it's done what we wanted it to do. The big &#x2013; I was actually saying to Dave McCarthy before I came in &#x2013; the big strategic threat at that time was the prospect of rapid and long-term growth of the limited range discounter sector, which the U.K. stands out by its small share in our market. And it was getting a lot of publicity, people felt they needed to shop differently and they were being invited, I suppose, by the media at large to do that in a limited range discounter. So that was quite a threat.</p>
          <p>So we launched that range because we, as you know, basically it was like a limited range discounter in Tesco and the point was you don't have to shop elsewhere, it's here for you. We knew we ran the risk of trading down &#x2013; encouraging trading down, we knew we ran the risk of relative disinflation, but that was a price worth paying. And I think subsequent events have proven that to be correct, that remarkably still in recession we've stemmed the growth of the limited range discounters.</p>
          <p>Now, also, customers liked us doing it. And so they certainly enjoyed the lower prices, but they also remembered we'd done it. And gradually through the year volumes have improved, trades improved; that plus some other things we've done means that we were then converging through the year on our major competitors who didn't do that and had a higher inflation rate, higher average selling price. And then obviously, as you say, coming through the anniversary, just ahead of it, we've now fully converged and gone past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the evidence of a convergence is really just the last few weeks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last couple of months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last couple of months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you think the underperformance is now at an end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the plan. And obviously we've also made the investment in double Clubcard points too, so that too gives us a good momentum going into the autumn.</p>
          <p>And I think there are other features as well. I think I said too that I felt that Tesco was most affected by the erosion in loyalty from the recession combined with the big spike in food prices, both of which unsettled people and said, I've go to shop differently to make ends meet. And because Tesco has the most loyal customers, both functionally and emotionally, we were perhaps going to be the net loser of that.</p>
          <p>Now we're coming out of that period now. People feel that their finances are in better control, they're more open to a proposition that encourages loyal one-stop shopping. So I think that this is a better climate for Tesco.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello. Andrew Kasoulis from Credit Suisse. Two if I may. One on the U.K. promotion environment. There's been lots of launches and promotions just recently and I know Asda are doing some particularly aggressive price competition on produce, so could you just say something on the U.K. promotion environment and how it's changed, particularly ahead of Christmas?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on international, you mentioned Step Change today I think for the first time in international. Will you be giving us a cost saving figure for Step Change and how could Step Change in international contribute going forward, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Laurie, do you want to start with the Step Change international?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you're actually seeing is the maturing of our international business. As Terry mentioned, with 90% of sales profits coming from markets where we're number one or number two, it actually gives us the scale to launch a Step Change program and really get the benefits from it. So we will build significantly and, of course, as our international builds to a similar size if not bigger than the U.K. in the foreseeable future, you'll see a similar amount to come out of our international businesses.</p>
          <p>The real opportunity on Step Change for international is in the supply chain. Our supply chains are good, but they're immature. We still buy a lot of our products direct from suppliers and they don't come through a central distribution system. We're getting scale already through non-food within Europe and to a certain extent Asia, but food, we've only really just started buying for Europe and we don't buy across the region for Asia at the moment.</p>
          <p>So on the buying side and on the retail operations side, I think going forward &#x2013; it will be over a period of time, of course, but these are good opportunities for Tesco as this business grows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On promotions, a word on promotions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, one of the features of this recession has been this remarkable rise in the amounts of sales on promotion. And, as you say, Asda have gone from virtually being traditionally an EDLP to the most promotional of businesses. I'm not sure that's good for Asda, for the industry, or for the consumer, because it encourages people to have to shop around in order to get value.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we've had to increase our promotional content as well. But I don't think you'll see further increases in the rate of promotions. I think it's reached and passed its peak. It's something that you can do for a short period of time, but it can't be sustained. It may have been in part fueled by manufacturers. They clearly did very well during the inflation with the price increases they forced through. They got a nice pot of money which they've then been feeding out in dribs and drabs to people on promotions. Now that gets used up.</p>
          <p>That's why we progressively have invested more in things that encourage loyalty. Curiously, the discounter range, because it's consistent price, because it's about changing your shopping bills, encourages loyalty and it has done. And more obviously, the investments in Clubcard does that. So you've got to play on the promotional pitch. But in terms of where you choose strategically to direct your investments, it's important, to my view, to direct it into building loyal behavior.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just ask one. <mark type="inaudible" /> (47.24) mentioned your outlook for inflation. You mention in the statement you expect it to flatten out, I think you say. What about into next year and beyond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the rate of change in inflation is more about last year. You saw a big spike in inflation in 2008, up to about 7% in our business in the summer of last year. And if you remember, RPI would have been measured higher than that for food, because they tend to over-record it. I can't remember &#x2013; it was maybe nine or 10% or something. Much of that was short-term commodity spikes in commodity items, a lot of it financial speculation in truth, some of it backed by genuine crop reasons. So that was always going to come out and what you're seeing now is us lapping those peaks. And we've gone through it. Actually, inflation is about zero, so our like-for-like is volume.</p>
          <p>I don't think it will &#x2013; looking at the shape of the trend line last year, I don't think it will go into deflation. I think it will stay at zero or slightly positive. There was a spike again, around about February, March time. It probably bumped back down to zero again, and then after that it will go on and stay zero to gently positive. I actually do believe that food prices will be firmer in the next decade than they were in the last decade because there are, despite the commodity comments, the speculation comments, there are some more long-range issues that will, in terms of population growth and change in dietary demand in Asia, that will underpin food prices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Question from over on the left, in the front here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tom Gadsby from SocGen. I've got a couple, please. First is on Double Points, I think there's a figure round of about 200 million cost, is that still roughly what it's going to cost you in the year, is that net of supplier support? And where's that likely to go, in the future are we going to stick with that?</p>
          <p>And did you say double-digit like-for-like in electricals and what period was that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the funding at double Clubcard points is built into our plans. There is a bit of recycling of money that was earmarked for other promotional activity that has been seen to be not as effective as we would normally get. And the rest has come from tightening our productivity program. It's already in the 550 million, so it's pretty much wholly (50.16) funded. And as you say, the 200 million number is about right in terms of what we'll feel it will cost.</p>
          <p>Of course, that is aside to what volume uplift we think we'll get from it, so that's with no volume uplift, that's the cost that would drop to the bottom line and we're already seeing very encouraging signs. A million more customers already signed up for Clubcard. And at a time where customers' budgets will be tightened, which is pre-Christmas, they're going to get double the amount of Clubcard points landing on their doormat and potentially more. So we see a good positive to come to the sales line as well.</p>
          <p>And what was your other question, sorry?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly it's been in &#x2013; for most of this year we've seen double-digit electrical performance. Obviously, we've got a big benefit from our online business, which is a key driver of the electrical category. Nearly 30% of our electrical sales are now online. So you're seeing Direct grow at 30% plus. That's a key driver, not just store sales. Terry mentioned obviously the Technika brand, which has done particularly well and has been well suited to the current trading environment, but to be, I think, number five in terms of a television brand in the U.K., a private label television brand, is some achievement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, morning, Clive Black from Shore Capital. Two or three questions. Firstly, could you tell us what capital has been employed in America to-date? Secondly, your Asian margins, was there anything beyond the integration costs that took those down in the half? And thirdly, you mentioned your stock reduction program internationally, Laurie, what potential's in that, what's involved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So capital employed USA, Asia margins, back to an Asia margins stock reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll have to come back to you on the total capital invested in the U.S. In terms of Asia margins, as you rightly state, we've got the integration costs within Korea. Here we've got a business that's growing in China, but we're investing a lot in capital into China, so it's slightly margin dilutive. And we've mentioned also the Japan business. I don't know whether you're taking the margin at the PBT level or the underlying, but obviously you've got the impairment of the Japan goodwill. And in terms of working -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> capital (52.59) itself not dilute margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The acquisition itself, because it was not profitable when we acquired the business, so it's coming strongly through to profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then stock reduction, we'll take it more broadly at working capital, there should be, circa couple hundred million coming through on working capital improvements for international for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Back to the middle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John Kershaw, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Two questions. First of all, just back on the U.K., in terms of, Terry, I think you said that actually you'd do stronger volumes and then to Dorgie's (53.52) question you said that you &#x2013; the plan is to get into like-for-like parity, do you think you can do that, withholding your like-for-like broadly with where they are, currently around the 3% level?</p>
          <p>Secondly, as an extension to that, there has been increased promotional intensity and you've moved more to a loyalty stance. Can you still fully fund that response to the promotional increase with that investment in loyalty and hold forecasts?</p>
          <p>And just finally, on net debt, one for Laurie. Help us understand the 8.5 billion, because you've already raised 1.5 billion of disposal proceeds year-to-date, working capital, you get a couple of hundred million from international, I suspect a good chunk from the U.K., so could you actually significantly overshoot on the downside the 8.5 billion, or are there other factors we need to take into account?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the net debt one first. So, in terms of proceeds from property sales we're about 1.1 billion to-date &#x2013; and actually it was only about 750 million for the half-year, so you're slightly overshooting in terms of what you think has flowed through on property proceeds. Working capital, we've really only got 25% of the benefits so far through and the second half of the year gives us the biggest drive. But remember, the first half of the year, 70% of our dividends get paid cash-wise in the first half, so that's quite heavy. And the biggest proportion of our cash from operations, driven by Christmas and trading, is in the second half.</p>
          <p>So, unless there's any major movement in currencies, then the statutory debt should come down to about 8.5 billion. It would probably be worth looking at the interest-bearing debt as well ,which runs at about 0.5 billion higher than the statutory debt, because as it says in the name, it's the thing that drives the finance charge and that, I'm very confident, is going to come down by &#xA3;1 billion year-on-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, my point was actually it could come down quite a bit more if you've got north of a billion, you've got working capital benefits. Are you being prudent, or is it something else for the bank (56.08)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not processed (56.08) yet, no. No, I live in hope, but I think it will be good if we can bring it down by &#xA3;1 billion year-on-year. We've got a big chunk of capital still to spend in the second half. I think we spent 45% of our capital so far. We've got 25% of our space, we've got another 55% of capital to come, so that will be something that drains it the other way.</p>

          <p>I think the point is, the good news carries on into the following year, because the thing about capital, it's not set blocks. It's obviously a line that &#x2013; it doesn't just stay fixed in a financial year in the reporting period. So I think the good work that Laurie has led will continue to benefit us into the following year, which is why we're able to be confident about that year too.</p>
          <p>So back to &#x2013; on like-for-like, we're actually already at parity with the majors on a value basis. So that's why obviously I can be confident about that. And, who knows the future? But as I say, with the other things that we have in place, I'd be confident that we can continue with that sort of performance.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget as well, on top of like-for-like, that we've got a good net new store program in the U.K. which is a strength of Tesco, to cross all formats. And that means that, combined with parity at like-for-like, better net new store average, it means that in value terms, let alone volume terms &#x2013; in value terms, not only are we growing market share in the total market &#x2013; which, by the way, we've always done, right the way through, but we're growing market share in the narrower definition of multiples and against the majors. We obviously see the IGD on a weekly basis. You'll see TNS, Nielsen, I think you see on a monthly basis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So on a proportionate rather than a value term, you think you can hold it around 3%, and the corollary was just the investment that the others are making in promotional intensity, whereas you're putting it into loyalty, you think you can compensate the balance and still hold the profitability?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yes. Well, I actually think that the direction we're going in &#x2013; it's not all or nothing, but the direction we're going in is the better direction, it's the more sustainable direction and actually, as we slowly come out of recession, it's likely to be the more effective investment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Chris Hogbin from Bernstein. A couple of questions on international, if I can. Is the current economic environment throwing up acquisition opportunities, would you look at those, or is your commitment to reducing net debt a greater constraint on the Group?</p>
          <p>And then, with the less well-performing businesses, are there conditions under which you would think about exiting Japan? And when do you expect to start accelerating the growth of stores in the U.S. and hence when do you think the stores &#x2013; sorry, the U.S. operations can get to breakeven?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that if you look at Tesco, the strategy is clearly laid out. We've got huge markets to address in which we already have number one or number two positions. This is a wonderful, unique opportunity in our industry, in the world, let alone in the U.K. We're strong in Korea. We've got a great chance in China. We're leading in South East &#x2013; South East Asia alone is 500 million people. You've got the block of China and you've got Korea at the top. India, we've made a great start into. So, in that part of the world, if Asia becomes 60% of the world's GDP, not 40, we're very, very well placed.</p>
          <p>We've got a good strong position in total Europe, with the 60 or so million people in the east combined with our business in the west, which, as Laurie said, we're able to do a lot of Group sourcing buying on &#x2013; it depends how you define where Turkey lies, but in itself, in its own right, 80 million people, young people, good long-term growth. And then we've opened up with a unique format in the United States, which is still a quarter of the world's GDP. And if you're unique there and you're successful and you communicate it, you can have great long-term growth.</p>
          <p>So Tesco has laid out its strategy. You've got to add to that the potential for non-food and importantly, services through the long term. So there is no shortage of growth from our existing strategy.</p>
          <p>There will be opportunities to buy businesses which strengthen positions that we've already developed. But I don't think you'll see us embarking on a new strategic direction through an acquisition, if I can make that distinction. So in line, in strategy, yes, but not a new strategy through an acquisition.</p>
          <p>Getting out of countries, I think it's not controversial for Tesco: we left France, we left Taiwan. I think that every business has to stand on its own two feet and we've got to be satisfied that we're going to get to a winning or a strongly profitable position. Japan is an extended trial. It's not high risk, it's not soaking up huge amounts of resources or capital, but as such, you've got to go fairly steadily. You can't sort of blast your way through all the problems.</p>
          <p>These are important things. You do have to give things time. You don't want to go into a country and then get out in a few years. You do want to make sure that you understand the market, the culture, the supply chain formats and see if you can work out a way of being successful.</p>
          <p>The kind of brute force approach won't work with retailing around the world. There just isn't enough central competitive advantage. We don't have patents. So you really &#x2013; it's more like working like a safecracker. You've really got to go in and carefully feel your way through the market, through the business and see how you can make money. So you've got to give that time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're growing now. We're opening about a store a week. We'll accelerate the growth when we can see solid signs of economic recovery. I don't know if you've been over in that part of the world, but Inland Empire of California and Arizona and Nevada were absolutely the epicenter of the subprime housing bust, so these were places with growing populations, growing urban structures, big housing developments and they've gone sharply into reverse where you're seeing depopulation. So in that situation you've just got to sit tight really and wait to see &#x2013; feel for a recovery. It's less bad right on the coast in the more established areas &#x2013;  although they are heavily effected, it's been tough for them too &#x2013; you haven't had the same level of depopulation, so it's easer to build out your network.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last couple of questions. Another one on the left.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Bruce Hubbard, Odey Asset Management. You made a comment earlier about in some areas you'll be cycling up against weak comps. Could you say if there are countries where you're beginning to cycle up against the much weaker trends of last year, where you're not confident of that having traction in ongoing growth rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, it's not an exact science to say that just because you were up against low figures you'll have high figures. It doesn't quite work like that or I would never have left the co-op all those years ago. But I think, broadly speaking, when the change is so extreme and when you sort of check around and make sure it's not you, it really is the market. And also if you then make sure you adjust to the new reality quicker than the other people then you should start to get traction. And we are beginning to see that. We've seen it strongly bite in Ireland. We're seeing it happen in Asia. Overall, we're not seeing it happen in Central Europe. But that's a slightly misleading picture because actually what's happened is the countries are getting better, save for Hungary which when it had its 5% increase in VAT set that back into reverse.</p>
          <p>So overall it looks pretty static, but actually underneath that Czech, Slovakia, Turkey are getting better, Poland was always strong. So I don't think there'll be an exact timing; it won't be when you cross a calendar date. But broadly speaking directionally you'll see like-for-like performance improve as you come through the anniversary.</p>
          <p>And there's another factor going on. Some of those countries had extreme spikes of inflation and are now seeing more pronounced deflation than in the U.K. But we'll track out of that as well. So actually one of the things that's holding back the like-for-like recovery is that deflation. But actually they come out of that deflation towards the back end of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question, if we can. Just down in the front here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. James Amstead (1.06.41) from Barclays Capital. Two questions for Laurie if that's okay. First on the net debt, you said that next year we should expect to see a similar decline that we're going to see this year. And I guess to be able to say that you must have a fairly fixed idea of what's going to happen with both CapEx and property disposals next year. So if you could talk on that briefly.</p>
          <p>Then secondly, in Ireland, this 50 million restructuring charge you've taken, can you just talk a little bit about why that is kind of classified as an exceptional, because -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, to my mind that looks less than exceptional than the costs you're incurring in Korea with Homever. And can you also just say what we should expect there in the second half of the year in terms of exceptionals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all on net debt, what we're going to do next year, well, it's kind of more of the same. I don't see a dissimilar number on capital, maybe marginally up. And a similar level of property proceeds. There won't be as much of an improvement in working capital because we're taking quite a big improvement this year. So those are going to be the key drivers of bringing net debt down next year.</p>
          <p>And on the Republic of Ireland, I mean, we have done quite a fundamental change. As this pointed out in Terry's presentation, there are 12,500 new products. We closed every shop for more than two days, every shop in the country. We've completely restructured the buying team, so a large proportion now of the buying is done out of the U.K. It's obviously completely reorientated the supply chain. In fact, the distribution infrastructure is now run directly out of the U.K. and runs using the scale of Northern Ireland and mainland U.K.</p>
          <p>So in terms of is it exceptional for the Republic of Ireland, obviously a charge of that nature was a significant proportion of the Republic's profitability and is a complete game changing shape for that business.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of Homever in Korea was large, but not exceptional by nature in terms of the overall profitability of Korea. There may be a little bit more of an exceptional in the second half for the Republic. I don't think it's going to be as large as what we took in the first half, but there may be some more to come through, mainly on further integration costs.</p>
