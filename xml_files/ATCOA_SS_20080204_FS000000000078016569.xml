        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have the honor to open this presentation with Atlas Copco for today, and leave over the speech to the Moderator and the Chief Financial Officer of Atlas Copco, Hans Ola Meyer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Frederick and let me continue on that welcome. Same words from me; welcome to this conference and report on our fourth quarter results. We will do as we normally do. We will combine presentation here in Stockholm with a telecom &#x2013; telephone conference. I hope it's already started. In a few minutes Gunnar Brock, our CEO will take us through his comments on the report and then we will have a question-and-answer session. And as usual, we think that we will ready in about one hour from now.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, please Gunnar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans Ola, and good afternoon, everyone. And I will try to lead you through the PowerPoint presentation and I'll try to, if I can see the small figures here, refer to the pages, so those who are not here can follow the presentation. So, let me take 15 to 20 minutes maximum and then we will have the time for the questions.</p>
          <p>So jumping quickly over to the slide about highlights, and I think that as a summary of what has happened over the last quarter. If you look at the different business areas, you could really say that it has accelerated. It goes for CMT, IT and CT Compressor Technique. Not so surprising in a way, but we also have a clear sense that we are growing a little bit better than the market. And therefore, to sort out what is underlying market demand and what is perhaps moving forward our positions may not be all that easy. But I will come back to that.</p>
          <p>It's also rewarding to see that the growth has been taking place in all regions, not only one, also North America. Equally rewarding, I think, is that both capital equipment and aftermarket is growing. Capital equipment, we've gotten used to rather high double-digit figures, it has continued, and it augurs well for the future aftermarket business. But also the aftermarket has grown about 17% for compressor; 33% for CMT, if you exclude the consumables then even a little bit higher and Industrial Technique about 21%. So capital equipment growing well, but also aftermarket following suite.</p>
          <p>You have seen the profit figures. You have also seen our proposed dividends. I will not dwell more on that. So moving to the next figure, I think, 33% total growth in orders is satisfying for us. But price volume organically, it's up 20%. Revenues still lagging a little bit, but I'll come back to it later. We are sort of recuperating a little bit of the lost capacity we've had over the last year and a half. As the investments in production capacity both in CT, Compressor Technique and Construction and Mining Technique is catching up, so we should not at least blame that in the future if we don't follow with the revenues.</p>
          <p>Profit up 36% to a record figure 19.2. If you want to have a run rate, you should then adjust for currency, which is about 1%, a little bit more. If you then also adjust for the acquisitions, it's always the matter of taking a step back before you move ahead, when you acquire companies and you normally acquire companies where you have a dilution to start with. So if I take Dynapac, ABAC, Greenfield, if we compensate or adjust for that you would have seen an EBIT on the run rate of about 21%. The profit, profit before tax, after financial items as you see, we have recorded a write-down of right to notes, but I think you're all familiar with that.</p>
          <p>So, let me then move over to the next slide but also saying that cash flow has been rather good. I will comment a bit more on that also later. But given the strong growth, I think we are happy with the cash flow. But I'll comment a bit more on that.</p>
          <p>Moving then over to the first map, world map, there you can see the different distribution according to the global picture, and in many cases you can see an acceleration. If I take Asia, it looks of course, like a deceleration, but we did have last year quite some large gas and process orders in the October months, which we haven't seen this year, so that is one reason.</p>
          <p>The same goes, if you go down to Latin America. If I move to the next slide, number seven, you will see that it's a bit lower in the last quarter but that was due to very large mining orders in Chile in the last quarter last year. But the underlying growth is still very strong. Brazil is doing excellently and we see a, what I believe, a continuation and a sustainable, barring anything else, but when it comes to the Brazilian economy, it looks surprisingly strong.</p>
          <p>North America has accelerated. North America is Canada, US and Mexico, very good orders in Mexico and Canada, and good orders in US. We have said over the last, I guess almost a year and a half, a slightly weaker motor vehicle industry in North America, still not that buoyant, but actually a little bit better than over the last quarters, but still trailing a bit.</p>
          <p>The other industries, the general industry and we have a good reflection of general industry climate, if I say so, because both Compressor Technique and general industry division in Industrial Technique, the tools business, sort of direct themselves to the same environment and there we have seen some good figures as well.</p>
          <p>Moving over then to the next, which is Africa/Middle East. I think that is the slide eight, if I can read correctly here. Good growth in Europe, good for all business areas, a little bit weaker in some of the construction markets. Portugal, Spain has been very buoyant for many years, nothing major, the general business, the MVI business, we have seen some very good figures. And when I say some very good figures, I may not always be able to separate market growth from share take or extended scope of supply. But it looks still remarkably strong.</p>
          <p>Russia, growth in the quarter actually 83% for the quarter and &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; for the year-to-date, and for the quarter 120. So, Russia is extremely strong. But also UK, Germany, Spain showing very strong figures.</p>
          <p>Moving then over to Asia, as I said, last year we had some very good orders in Korea and China for gas and process type of project orders that you don't get like a continuous flow. So, they can sort of upset the balance, but barring that China is doing very well, Korea is doing very well, India exceedingly well, up 41%.</p>
          <p>So the only market I would say in Asia that is not doing well is Japan. Partly, because I guess our position is still strong to be an outsider in Japan but the market is not doing that brilliantly. And I think from our point of view, we see some rather flat, and even declining development.</p>
          <p>And then finally, Australia, of course, driven by very strong mining business but also the other ones are doing not badly at all.</p>
          <p>Coming then to slide 10, you can see the &#x2013; perhaps true for when we say accelerated growth, it's hard to look like &#x2013; looking at the graph you may have to be a fortune teller, but still as I said earlier, if we look at the figures it has accelerated over the year and also year-on-year rather good figures.</p>
          <p>Trying to condense this into some kind of an analysis of what is organic growth, price volume and what is growth through acquisitions you see here over the period. I am now on slide 11. You will see that our, call it ambition or drive to try to have about two-thirds organic growth and about one-third from acquisitions, holds reasonably true over time, not a given year. But over time, it is about that kind of participation from the two groups.</p>
          <p>Then looking a little bit more at the figures. Remarkable that we still don't seem to catch up on the currency. I think every quarter, we say, we may have a neutral currency. But for the year, it was 4%. For the year, it was close to SEK 900 million negatively, I think 870 or so, and for the quarter about SEK 220 million. So, it continues still to be quite a bad currency headwind.</p>
          <p>Then if you look at the price, which I think is rewarding given that we, as many of the other similar companies, have had to face quite some raw material price increases over the year. But we've been able to compensate that through price increases and various efficiency measures in production.</p>
          <p>Moving then over to the business areas, the individual business areas. You can now see on slide 14, the split up between the Compressor, Construction Mining and Industrial Technique. I think the only point I would like to make is that if you look at the run rate, if I call it, then in Compressor Technique and compare that to the same period last year, we would have a substantial improvement and actually should add about 2 percentage points. So, 21 would be about 23% if you allow for currency and the integration related to ABAC and Greenfield, so call it a run rate. If you do the same for CMT, you would arrive at around 20%. And for Industrial Technique, the figure would be in the area of 23 points something, two-three.</p>
          <p>I talked about Compressor Technique earlier. We've seen good growth in all markets and basically among all our customer groups, a little bit weaker in North America on the rental business but that seems to pick up a bit again. So, I think over the geographical territory and customer segment, it's been remarkably strong in most cases.</p>
          <p>Equipment, good growth. Aftermarket, as I said earlier about 17%. Equipment growth is about 20, so very strong. And from January this year, we have tried to focus &#x2013; we are doing similar in Industrial Technique but here we have focused with a division on its own for the aftermarket business to give them the right focus.</p>
          <p>And this the &#x2013; and now we're on slide, I think 16, you can see the trend over time, a slight upward inclination; however, no trees grow to heaven, I think we are happy if we can continue to deliver good volumes in that area.</p>
          <p>Moving over to CMT, slide 17. Yes, of course, we all read about it, we all hear about the strong mining boom around the globe and it is basically to be seen everywhere. No geographical area is really excluded. But also, good growth from the construction side. Infrastructure, I would say very strong in Latin America, strong in Europe, very strong in Asia, a little bit weaker in US relating to the housing development. Dynapac, for instance, where they're seeing, particularly for pavers, relatively much going to residential area. So there we see a &#x2013; in keeping with what we have said, a weaker picture, but for the rest, still very strong.</p>
          <p>And the organic order growth is keeping up at very high levels. We had also good business in the Middle East for construction related equipment, so a good distribution around the globe.</p>
          <p>Profit up 47%, 17.2% including the Dynapac and close to 20 for the ongoing business. Dynapac is still an issue when it comes to delivery and costs of some of our factories. The order intake is very good, very encouraging, which to me is the main important thing that the brand and the strategy of trying to move the Atlas Copco resources behind, but we still have a way to go.</p>
          <p>The last quarter is always very, very low, so was it with the previous owners so with us. But given the issues of inefficiencies, we haven't got supplies to German factories, et cetera; we are still a little behind what we would have liked to be. But I'm not concerned about that. I think that, as you will see the 2008 move on, you will see gradually a change.</p>
          <p>I don't comment much on the next, which is slide 18. I may jump to 19 directly and you see then the summary of Industrial Technique. And here you can see, and you may remember from the previous charts how we see volume growth coming back. The motor vehicle industry on a global basis is up considerably. Still it's a bit anemic in the US, but for the rest, it's doing extremely well. And then the separation of our business into a general industry division is proving extremely rewarding and so is the vehicle service business, where we direct ourselves to major fleet owners and repair shops.</p>
          <p>We have also acquired a small Japanese company called KTS, which will be an excellent complement to the Fuji acquisition we did some years ago, because we struggle today to meet demand. We have not really capacity neither for components nor for assembly in the Fuji plant. So this KTS, which is similar in many aspects, although the primary market is the vehicle service, will be filling that void. So, we should have a balance there in 6 to 12 months I hope.</p>
          <p>Profit margin, 22.2 then given currency and given the restructuring costs where we are moving assembly of air tools from England to a new factory in Hungary. If we allowed for that, you would have seen about 23.5%.</p>
          <p>And then you have the diagram of the history, and here you can see to the right that the volume looks like it's coming back a little bit again.</p>
          <p>So then, if we more over to the financials, I will not say much on that. I have commented on the currency, both for the quarter and for the year. So, I don't think I need to do that and the rest, I think you have seen. So, we will move on to the great innovation, which is the profit bridge, some of you have asked for that. And I think by summarizing it all, I think the flow through of the organic growth is pretty okay, and that buy and large for the different divisions, it flows through to about 40%. On the other side, on the acquisitions there, we have acquisitions &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; one-time items and the rest lumped together and there of course, you always have a lower figure.</p>
          <p>If you, on the next slide 24, look at it from a business area point of view, you see a remarkably similar, the flow through is for the three business areas. Although they are different in many aspects, they also show a great deal of similarities. On the Industrial Technique, negative flow through on the &#x2013; it has to do with one-time items and acquisitions, but particularly one-time items.</p>
          <p>Then moving on further to the balance sheet, I don't think there is so much to say about that. We have, of course, seen some changes in the anatomy of the company, where of course, a lot of cash has disappeared. But it may be interesting to look at the cash flow later on. If we look at the capital structure on the net debt to EBITDA, you'll see the progression of improvement that we have been talking about and of course, this is to some extent underlying the proposal from the Board about the dividend and proposed share buyback program.</p>
          <p>Then, I think, it is slide 27. You see a split up of the different cash flow items, 926 million for the quarter compared to 474, which is 95% up. And if you look at the cash flow from operating activities before the investments, you see 1,828, which is about 40% up. Pretty good &#x2013; I'm not happy in way, but I'm happy in another way. I'm not happy because I think it could have been a little bit better because we are very keen on measuring the cash flow as an indication of efficiency. But luckily on the working capital increase it's not much raw material or components, it's basically finished goods that's waiting to be invoiced. So from that point of view, it is perhaps not as bad as it looks like.</p>
          <p>Then moving on to the proposed dividend, as you see, we proposed that the company should distribute SEK 3 per share to the shareholders and you can also see that that represents about 26% increase compared to last year. And then we also proposed to have a share buyback &#x2013; buyback share program, sorry.</p>
          <p>So, let me then finish by trying to give the year in summary. I think we have seen good growth across the globe, across the different sectors. Order intake has grown 25%. We have seen a strong volume, price development; profit at record levels.</p>
          <p>And trying to summarize, I think that when you do that, and when you look back, although this is history and we are already into February of 2008, I think, one could say that we started the year 2007 at a rather high level in terms of margins and profit levels. And yes, we have had benign good market development. There is no question about that. We have been riding like most on a way. On the other hand, I think, we have also improved our market positions substantially, so it's not only the benign environment.</p>
          <p>We have had quite some headwinds. We have had currency to the tune of close to 900 million against us. We have had raw material price increases. We have had integration of acquired companies. We have had our own capacity constraints in supply, particularly in Compressor and CMT. And we have had suppliers who haven't been able to deliver. So, if you look at the prose and the cons, I think we can look back at 2007 with a reasonable confidence that the company did well. But that's history. We are now into the earlier parts of February and we are looking forward to your questions, which I guess, will deal more about the future then but the history. But we are happy to answer even questions about the history.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Joakim H&#xF6;glund from Kauphting Bank. I have a question &#x2013; two questions. The first one is, if you look at the incremental margins, looks as if even better figures than in the third quarter. And I was wondering, if you look at the income and cost pressure and the prices in the order book how you would see these figures developing through 2008? If these levels are sustainable or if you see any change? The second question is regarding the Compressor Technique division in North America. It's really a strong growth, although we have heard growth maybe a bit softer there. Is this due to you taking market shares or could you please talk a little bit more about the growth there and your possibility to take market shares to through 2008? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sustainability of the margins given raw material cost increases et cetera. It's always very hard to predict, particularly if things will change dramatically. I don't think they will. I think we have a reasonable hand on raw material cost picture on the market pricing. So, I think that there is nothing really that should be changing the picture a lot. We have very little engineering activities, which means we take an order today for delivery in 12 months time or 18 months time, where you have a lot of difficulties and foresee the costs that you will record as you finish the product. So, I think it should look reasonably stable from that point of view.</p>
          <p>Compressor Technique US, yes, I think we have seen some very good figures over the last three, four years around 35% growth per annum since 2003, I think. Yes, we are taking market share. As we've said before, we have gone from number three, four to the largest compressor manufacture today in US. We have been behind in US in launching a second brand. We have a multi-brand strategy, as you may know, where some very good growth in Europe is coming from other brands than the Atlas Copco like Ceccato, Worthington Creyssensac, or some of the other brands. We have today a multi-brand meaning even three brands in China. We have an entry made on a premium segment level in China. But in US, we haven't had that, and we are just about &#x2013; we started during the late autumn to fill the pipeline with a new brand, which is an existing brand, but it's a second brand, it's Chicago Pneumatic.</p>
          <p>We have been, of course, looking at acquiring a second brand, but it hasn't been possible. We are pretty, at least now happy. We will have to see in a year's time when things span out, but we are happy that we have chosen this way because it's a good brand, it's an old strong brand in US and there has been some very good reception from the distributors.</p>
          <p>Now, there has been you may have seen in the vehicle service industry, where we are not that strong, but some other compressor manufactures have suffered a bit in the vehicle service industry, and we can see that in our tools business that some of that segment have been a bit softer. We have also acquired distributors over the last three, fours years that has helped us to move the volume, and given chances to do that we will continue. But that's not always that easy and it's not entirely in our hands to decide that. So, I think the opportunities are there for sure. It's the world's largest industrial market for compressors, and there's still much to be done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Johan Eliason from Cheuvreux. Just a short question regarding the buyback program, assuming it's approved by the AGM, have you set the timeline for the buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not a timeline, I think, that the buyback is there in order to give us the opportunity to have a capital structure that is efficient. It is also an issue about some hedging on the A-shares for option program. But it's also has to be seen about what happens in terms of acquisition opportunities, and as you all know, they are not coming like that. So, therefore, the extent and the timing will have to sort of be looked at over the years. But it's in general, a reasonably steady flow, I guess, is, to prefer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So assuming no major acquisitions you will deliver on the buybacks, that's the conclusions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you did draw that conclusion, and I think that is perhaps not totally wrong. It's, of course, clear that given the trend of improvement of credit rate ratio, sort of capital ratios that we have seen, the Board expresses that there is an ability to start, given what we see today. So there has to be a change for the program not to be executed, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have then the first question from the telephone conference please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our first question is from Nick Paton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. The first question actually was related to the B-shares, and I just wondered whether or not you would be pursuing the same strategies you had previously, which is that you would seek to reduce the discount on the B-shares, not to the detriment of the A-shares and presumably buy &#x2013; buying back whichever of the two shares is cheaper?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, we did express it like that way last time, and I think it is natural that one tries to buy perhaps the share that cost the least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second question is just quickly on Dynapac, I don't know, if you want to dwell on this too much. But what exactly is the problem there still? Is it just that it was a little a weak in terms of the seasonality, or do we still have these problems with the two production sites in Germany? And if it's the latter, when do you think those will be fixed by?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it has nothing to do with the sales and market interest. The brand name is very strong. The adding to the Atlas Copco customer centers, the sort of repositioning of distributors is going very well. So the problem is entirely linked to the output and the efficiency in our factories, primarily as we've said in Germany. And when we talked about this as late as the last quarter review and at the Capital Markets Day, I think that, yes, we maybe perhaps a quarter behind what we would have liked to be. We have seen not that long ago problems to get certain move towards, et cetera. But this is internal issues that we will deal with and the good thing is that the strategy seems to be working very well in terms of the market demand and the interest and our actual orders received.</p>

          <p>Okay. Would you be able to share with us the timeframe for getting Dynapac up to the margin of the reminder of the Group &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; of the division?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well. I may regret that I said that some six, eight months ago, because since then the Group's margin have improved even further. So, I'm chasing our own shadow a little bit. But what we have said is that we did not see at the time of acquisition, the reason why we couldn't get that up to 15%, which at that time was not far from the Group average. And I don't see any reason to change that. We are a little bit behind. At that time, we said two to three years, it may be &#x2013; perhaps two and a half, three years &#x2013; it may be &#x2013; I think, in some cases you are surprised how quickly you solve the issues. In this case, I think, we have perhaps a little bit another quarter or so --</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. I've got three questions, just two technical ones. Firstly on the buyback, it was the fashion in Sweden a couple years ago to do mandatory redemptions, and there seems to have been a shift towards buybacks of late. Is there a difference in the tax situation and why did you choose to go down the buyback route and not, say, another mandatory redemption?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you just let us know, if you have any further rental assets for sale that could drive gains in the coming quarters?</p>
          <p>And then my third question really relates to the bigger industrial outlook, and in particular, whether you have seen any incidents of construction or other large projects seeing slippage or delay or cancellation. In particular, those customers of yours that are heavily reliant on capital, and we know that the availability of capital is becoming harder to get hands on in the project environment at the moment. Have you seen anything there? I know there was a 3 billion casino canceled two weeks ago in the US. I know we've had couple of dry freight carriers canceled last week. Have you seen anything on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fred, you deal with the buyback.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can comment, James, on the first one. No. It's not the fashion thing, I think, in our case at least. When it comes to the two redemptions that we have done, they have both been linked in time with two structural changes, one, where we sold the electric tools business and last year when we sold rental service. So you should see that these were specific events that in our mind made the mandatory redemption a very good tool to show that we now have a new balance sheet, and that's it. When it comes to this situation, it's more a reflection of the strength or the strengthening of the balance sheet on a continuing basis. And hence, we believe that the mandate that allow you to be a little bit more flexible in terms of adjusting the balance sheet through a buyback program is a better, better tool. So this has nothing to do with tax differences in this case.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the rental assets, yes, we do still have something like 11% of shareholding in ROC, which, of course, is the consequence of the sale. It's not a strategic investment. So that will not remain with us over time. The last question on slippages in major projects or even cancellation of orders given to us; no, we have not seen that. I cannot say that there has been activities of that nature that we have seen.</p>

          <p>So we go back to the people here in Stockholm. We would now take two questions over here. Having one in the center here, and then we prepare for another one later on. Go ahead, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From Nodia Markets . Could I ask you a question about the aftermarket? You mentioned, Gunnar, that it's grown quite well, trying to catch up with the strong growth you have seen for new equipment. And you also mentioned in your report that you have reorganized the Compressor business, assigning a separate business area to all the aftermarket activities. Shall we see that as a sign that you are, sort of, trying to play a bit of catch-up here to see an expansion of the aftermarket business from the nice growth you experienced in new equipment? And can you tell us anything about where you are in terms of its share of the business today, and where you would like it to be, say, in a few years' time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good questions, but very difficult to answer. But let me at least say that there is always a risk that you are in a very high equipment sales that your organization is focusing on that and giving a little bit less attention to the aftermarket, which is very different in nature. And of course, if you have them inside the same division, in the same P&amp;L, this blurring of the interest becomes an issue, right. So regardless of whether we want to catch up or not, I think, it is a good way of focusing and separating to let the equipment divisions really live on their own and survive on their own and the aftermarket, which also can organize in a more efficient way in that respect.</p>
          <p>Yeah, catching up, I think, there is always more you can do. And of course, with equipment growth we have had, if you take compressor if I remember correctly 2002-2003 about 33% of the total turnover was aftermarket, today it is 25, 26, which is very good in a way because it means that the equipment population is growing at the same time we have grown double-digit every year in the aftermarket.</p>
          <p>So, there is much more to do. And of course, the population is getting bigger and assuming that we are not really sort of doing as well on the existing, there is a growing population out there. I &#x2013; we try, but it's very hard to say how much of the total population is being addressed by our teams. It's very hard. It's more than 50%, I would say, if you take Compressor Technique. If you take the larger CMT installations, particularly when you have mining clients, it's easier to locate and see. If you take Industrial Technique, yes, when you look at the large auto manufacturers, it's not that difficult, but when you look at the general industry, it's very difficult. So I think, the only thing I can say is that there is plenty of room to grow the aftermarket. It's not a problem of the volume of business to be done. It's more our inability to develop it in that case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we have second question, if we have one. Yes. Please, Mats.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mats Liss, Swedbank. Just two questions here. Well, given the strong order intake, are you concerned at all that capacity constraints will be &#x2013; well, more &#x2013; lot of problem here in 2008? And secondly about risks that customers putting multiple orders just to secure delivery, if you see any risks regarding that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Capacity constraints '08 should be fewer than '07, because a lot of the investments undertaken in '05-'06 is now starting to kick-in. That goes for rock drills. It goes for Compressor area, and it goes for the efficiency in rock tools, so yeah, if the acceleration equipment takes on even more, then we may be having capacity constraints. But that should be an happy situation. So no, I think, we will cope better this year. I think so.</p>
          <p>The other question was related to, if we have seen multiple or double orders. No. I mean, if we take the Compressor Technique excluding gas and process, normally order sizes are not that large and lead times are short. So there, there is little of that issue of, let's say, ordering and canceling or &#x2013; and we have been able &#x2013; and we are getting better delivery times, so shorter, which means the incentive or interest to try to order on speculation would be much less.</p>
          <p>Gas and process, we have large orders there, separation, liquid natural gas, et cetera. There we have seen no cancellation of large projects. Middle East, Europe, China, India, Russia, we have not seen any cancellations to my mind, that I am aware of. So that looks pretty okay. The mining equipment that our mining clients are booking and ordering, we deliver. We haven't, to my mind, got any demands to delay deliveries; on the contrary, we're still pushed. So we can not see those signs.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Just taking in mind that the organic growth has stayed pretty consistent through the quarters, and you highlight a few areas particularly, say North America and related construction, and &#x2013; but even European construction as being a bit weaker. Can you talk about the segments, some large segments, which were a bit stronger, or accelerated in growth into the end of the year, please, and your view on that and those segments in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we mentioned in the report some, but perhaps it's better to turn it around, and say, we have told you where we have seen it has been a bit softer. It doesn't mean that it's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where you think, little bit stronger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, I was trying to say that the other side of the coin, where it's not softer there it's stronger, but that's of course a bit of a large statement. The &#x2013; but, you would take again Compressor Technique or the Industrial Technique, general industry, they deliver to all kinds of industries, all kinds of applications. It's really a cross section of manufacturing industry in a way. So, it's hard to say and pinpoint, but we have seen good growth, and as I said, in the Middle East in construction related, in oil and gas related. We have seen good growth, tremendous growth in Russia, basically across the spectrum. We have seen similar good growth in the whole of Asia, barring as I said Japan. So it's not air separation, liquid natural gas, compressed CNG, compressed natural gas for compressors, which is a business we entered into two years ago. We treated a bit before, but we acquired two small companies, and this business will be SEK 1 billion business this year from nothing two years ago. So pretty good in most cases. Similar growth figures in general industry, even a little bit higher in Industrial Technique general industry, even a little bit higher growth than in Compressor Technique, but that's, I think, because we are really catching up in the tools business to the general industry, but good growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a like question is, you highlighted above over 40% of group orders as emerging market-related, if you look at the growth trends on a percentage basis, are you basically seeing the effect of say continued high growth, higher than average growth driving this weighting up, or are you seeing accelerating growth in these segments as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, if you take orders received 2007, we had about 44% coming from what I would call emerging markets. Now not everybody would have the same definition. But that's basically excluding: Western Europe, North America, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, those type of markets. So, 44% of our growth coming from the other. To me it's very encouraging, because these are the markets where investments will have to take place to drive the industrial capacity. This is where the people are living. This is also getting more domestic generated growth, if you look at China, look at India or Russia, less dependent on what may happen in US. Not standing free for any stretch of imagination, but if you to those 44% also add that many of our clients in Western world actually order equipment from us to produce for that part of the world for the other emerging market. So, it is a strong picture. US today is about 13% of our business, one-three, it was 40 plus some years ago as you may recall, but after rental and electric tools, mill work electric tools has been sold, it's been of course much lower. However, we are growing nicely in US as well, and of course, this is not either/or we are going very well in Western Europe as well. So it's not either/or at all, but China today is 9 plus percent of our business, and very strong growth in India, Brazil, Russia, Eastern Europe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I was just wondering if you could update us a little more on the capacity constraint situation at CMT, because &#x2013; sorry, CT, were I think you have been having some problems with actually supplying acquisitions with screw compressors, and how far you've got on that, and how long it's going to take from now on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's getting better. I can't say exactly how long it will take, because it depends on the type, the mix, et cetera. What we are doing in European factory versus Chinese, et cetera. But it's getting better clearly so, but perhaps towards mid-year we may be starting to be able to swap those as we wanted to have done a bit earlier. But I can not say exactly when. It's &#x2013; the capacity when it comes to making air rents is very much an issue of mix, and therefore I &#x2013; and of course, we try to where we have a constraint, we try to be smart and make those elements that we think are the best for the time being, regardless of &#x2013; and then it is not replacing ABAC elements, that may not be the top of the priority.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you also just confirm that Dynapac, where I think to my mind the result was very disappointing for the quarter, and are you actually taking any one-off costs there at the moment, or is this &#x2013; the sort of true underlying level that you have got to turnaround?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not that much of taking one-off costs, because then we would have done that. It's more a matter of getting the routines, getting the bills of material, getting the suppliers, those kind of issues sorted out. It's not at this stage a major issue of that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps you can add also on that, that we have gotten many questions about the level of profitability in line with your question, and what we see is of course that the seasonality that we have also talked about is very pronounced in this business, and the profitability of the third and fourth quarter is dramatically lower than the first and the second, which has been the case also in the previous years. We don't know if the way they run the &#x2013; they have run the business in the past have emphasized that discrepancy, but it's what we see still today. So in spite of the very low profitability level in this fourth quarter, it was not so far behind last year's and same period.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We turn back to &#x2013; here in Stockholm, one question more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Anders Roslund, &#xD6;hman Equities. I have two questions, one regarding the order intake in Compressor Technique. You have seen that sequentially order intake has been relatively flat during 2007, however, that is a historical seasonal pattern that it starts off relatively stronger, then it's more flattish. Is it still the same sort of seasonality with a stronger beginning and a little bit weaker, or how should we interpret the direction in the Compress Technique? And then, the second question is simply taxes, CapEx and financial net, if you just give us a little guidance here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the sequential development and seasonality, there is a little bit but not that much. But it's also of course a matter of today. Our gas and process business is twice the size that it was not long ago, and out of the total it's more than 10%, some years ago it was about five. There you have much more irregular order pattern. So that does affect. I think, another area where you do have irregularities, if I call it that, that's in the portable air side, where you have a lot of rental companies that are your clients and the ordering pattern of rental companies is not always consistent. And we have seen a lack of orders for some time of the US rental companies for instance, because of the housing related slowdown. So I think, it is hard to say that this is like a Swiss clock, when it comes to seasonality, et cetera. But you see, I think, a steady good development anyhow, and it's not a dramatic increase. But I think, the -- and then you have the rental business, specialty rental, which also may &#x2013; and that we have been of course running separately before together with rental services, now this is standing on its own. I am not sure we have seen exactly how, it's developing well, but whether that will follow similar seasonal patterns, I think it's &#x2013; I can't tell you really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some cleaning up guidance questions is that how you've raised it. Well, on the tax rate, if we start there, I think there is a little bit of movement between the quarters, but I would then choose to say that somewhere 28 to 29% is still probably a reasonable expectation level at least, but there will be some variations also going forward, I am sure. When it comes to the financial net, in this quarter we have seen a very undramatic interest net, which following the capital restructuring plan that we carried out in the second quarter, a good estimate is somewhere around 250 million of net interest costs per quarter. What is more difficult always to predict is some of the financial exchange differences that happen, and on top of that we have a few financial derivatives that is put in place to hedge part of the capital structure that we have internally and there you are forced to do some fair value adjustments, which is very difficult to predict. These two aspects both were negative in the fourth quarter. Hence, their financial net in the fourth quarter, I think for those of you that made some predictions came out a little bit more negative than you had expected. We had also a specific issue, where for old option or the existing option programs from previous years, we do have some total return swap agreements to hedge those option plans. And when the share price goes down as it did at the end of the year, you will have a financial impact of your unrealized, again, fair value adjustment on that as well. So, all that together hit Q4 a little bit more than it should. So, looking forward, as we can't predict those items, we can only look at the interest cost base. And I would still say that considering the growth that we have, the interest rate environment, the assumption of something like 250 per quarter should be a reasonable expectation going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, the CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the CapEx we have on tangible investments, we ended up on the year at about 2.3 billion on a gross level. And we had about 1.6, 1.7 billion of net CapEx on tangible assets. And I think, we are still in a slight increasing trend. We have announced a number of and approved a number of investments that Gunnar has alluded to in terms of catching up on capacity and so on. So it might well continue to increase for a while, but I &#x2013; we are not foreseeing huge increases on either of those measurements. So, that's probably the guidance I can give you right now.</p>
          <p>Did we have one more question here in the room. Otherwise &#x2013; I don't see any hand. I think, we take two final questions from the telephone conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am sorry for this, but I am going to have to go back to the capacity increases and the supply components, and would you say that you felt that the situation would improve in terms of components in 2008, but would you say that the situation now is good, that it's under control or is it still a problem for you?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You were a bit cut-off, but let me try to guess what you said. Yes. We are improving our own ability to manufacture some of the key components. So there we will have a better situation, and be able to reduce the lead-time. I believe that our outside suppliers will also be better, but I may be wrong there. But I would expect that they have looked similarly on their situation as we have and geared up. And &#x2013; but at the same time, as I say that, we have had surprises pretty late as well or lately that has sort of annoyed us quite a bit. So &#x2013; and for a piece of equipment, you only need one critical component to be lacking, and you are stuck, so it should be easier also from the outsiders, I would expect that.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, everybody. I am just clearly coming back to ABAC, if I look at your profit bridge for Compressor Technique, it seems that the EBIT contribution from your acquisitions this quarter was much better than it was in Q3. Can you just describe how quickly margins are improving there, and whether the current level of profitability is sustainable? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Whether the current level of profitability of CT as a whole, was that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of the acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the ABAC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, it should improve, and it is improving. But as every quarter goes, it's harder and harder to unscramble the eggs, because you buy something which is totally standalone and then the purpose of buying it is not to have it standalone. The purpose of buying it is to integrate on the production, sourcing side, on the sale side, without the multi-brand activity. So what we have said before is we bought a company slightly less than 10% EBIT margin and &#x2013; or a bit more, and we are going to, at least, to get that close to the average of Compressor. But as I said, in the end, it's very hard to say and unscramble the eggs and therefore you will &#x2013; we will not be able to be too precise to tell you. I think, you have gradually to look at the overall CT margin. And our excuses, if you like, of saying that it's dragging down the business will get weaker and weaker. So I think, that's the way you have to look upon it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can add perhaps a little bit that in our analysis, it's not so much ABAC that is much better in Q4 than in Q3, there is a gradual improvement. But we also have a few smaller acquisitions that we commented in the Q3 that really is at breakeven at the time, and there we have seen an improvement. So I would say that the level of contribution from acquisitions in the fourth quarter is much more, let's say a good indication of where we think it should be right now. It should improve from there, as Gunnar said, but Q3 was really a little bit more of a temporary weakness, I would say.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's clear. Thanks.</p>

          <p>With that, I think that &#x2013; I know that there might be some questions hanging on, on the telephone conference, but I do welcome those of you that haven't had the chance to put the question to contact us directly at the company, and we will do our best to answer your questions there.</p>
          <p>Without &#x2013; with that, I think, we thank everybody here and on the telephone conference for participating today, and hope to see and hear you back, if not before, in April after the first quarter. Thank you very much.</p>
