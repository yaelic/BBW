          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on this call to review our Fourth Quarter 2007 performance. I am here with Jeff Kindler, Chairman and CEO; Frank D'Amelio, Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our senior management.</p>
          <p>The financial charts that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our homepage at www.pfizer.com in the Investor Presentations tab by clicking on the link Quarterly Corporate Performance &#x2013; Fourth Quarter 2007.</p>
          <p>We will end our conference call at 1 o'clock sharp and as we would like you to &#x2013; as we would like to hear from as many of you; and in this time, we would appreciate if you would limit yourself to just one per person. Time permitting we will come back to you for any follow-ups.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.</p>
          <p>Also, the discussions during this conference call will include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliations of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 23rd, 2008.</p>
          <p>These reports are available on our website at www.pfizer.com in the "Investors &#x2013; SEC Filings" section.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to turn this over to Jeff Kindler. Jeff?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Amal. Good afternoon and welcome everyone, thank you very much for joining us today. Frank will review the numbers for the quarter and the year in a few moments, but I would like to just make a few opening remarks.</p>
          <p>When I took this position, it was clear that fundamental change was imperative at Pfizer, the tough decisions had to be made and that we had to act with a sense of urgency. We faced an environment where our traditional business model had come under attack; we saw a company facing significant losses of exclusivity, weighed down by layers of bureaucracy, slow to make decisions and in many cases at odds with regulators, payers, and policy makers.</p>
          <p>Our success in the decade ahead, we needed to get our housing order and we needed to get moving, we knew that quick fixes were simply not the answer, we set out to create a company that has the advantages of global scale but also the agility, speed, and decisiveness of a small enterprise.</p>
          <p>One year ago, we announced the set of immediate priorities to rebuild the foundation of our business and improve Pfizer's performance; these set the stage for the sweeping changes that Pfizer needs to make in order to succeed in the changing industry. Today, while we still have a lot of work to do, we are in a much stronger position to meet our challenges and capitalize on our opportunities than we were one year ago.</p>
          <p>We achieved both revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in 2007, despite loosing U.S. market exclusivity for NORVASC and Zoloft while making important structural and operating changes to enhance our future performance. We did this with solid product performance across abroad and diverse portfolio, cost reductions and the benefits of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>By the end of last year, we had in place our new leadership team, and I'm particularly pleased with the group that we've assembled. It has in my view a good balance between leaders with strong and extensive experience in our industry and people from other industries who bring fresh ideas and perspectives. Each member of our team fully appreciates what we need to do and is fully aligned behind our plans to achieve success.</p>
          <p>Before turning it over to Frank, I'd like to briefly highlight, how we are making progress against our priorities and outline the next phase of our plan, which we will cover in much more detail at our March 5th, Analyst Meeting.</p>
          <p>Our five priorities last January were: first, maximize revenues in both the short and the long-term; second, establish a lower and more flexible cost base; third, create smaller, more focused and accountable business units; fourth, build more collaborative relationships to deliver greater value for patients, physicians, and customers; and fifth, make Pfizer a great place to work.</p>
          <p>On our first priority, we are maximizing revenues from both our new products as well as our current inline portfolio. Three new products are noteworthy. LYRICA, an innovative treatment for diabetic nerve pain and postherpetic neuralgia and now the first medicine to ever win FDA approval for the management of fibromyalgia.</p>
          <p>SUTENT, a breakthrough way to fight too tough to treat cancers and a drug with the potential to treat other devastating cancers, including breast cancer.</p>
          <p>And CHANTIX, which has now been tried by more than 5 million smokers and is growing rapidly worldwide.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, LIPITOR continues to hold its own, generating sales only slightly less than last year despite an unprecedented commercial and competitive attack. Even now, after 10 years, new data still comes in showing why it remains the industry leader and we have a host of other innovative products doing well like CELEBREX, Geodon and ZYVOX. And our Animal Health business continues to deliver outstanding performance.</p>
          <p>In terms of future revenues, in 2007, we accelerated a new compound for generalized anxiety disorder into Phase III and moved three high-value oncology indications: Melanoma, breast and lung cancer into Phase III. We're also moving forward aggressively on the largest Phase II portfolio in Pfizer's history. And to supplement our efforts internally, we've revamped our business development group to capitalize on external opportunities like our Apixaban collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p>
          <p>We entered into 14 deals last year. These include our acquisitions of BioRexis with its diabetes candidates and novel peptide technology platform; Coley Pharmaceutical Group with its vaccine adjuvant technology, and a new class of drug candidates and CovX which will substantially enhance our biotherapeutics capabilities. We also entered into an important collaboration with Adolor to develop two novel compounds for the treatment of pain, a therapeutic area in which we already have a strong and leading position.</p>
          <p>To deliver on our second priority, establishing a smaller more flexible cost base, we took some tough actions last year, including a 10% reduction in our global work force and 20% in the U.S. sales force. We said we would do everything possible to minimize disruptions to our business and we did.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting that even with all of the changes this year our U.S. sales force was once again ranked the best in the industry by physicians for the 13th year in a row. And our terrific sales people around the world are earning similar recognitions.</p>
          <p>To enhance R&amp;D efficiency and productivity, we closed two U.S. R&amp;D sites and announced the closure of three international sites; we streamlined our therapeutic area structure and cut the layers of management in PGRD between myself and the bench scientists from 13 to eight.</p>
          <p>In manufacturing, we exited six sites in 2007 and plan to exit 12 more and we achieved significant production cost reductions on key products. These actions were painful but they were necessary. We significantly cut costs in 2007 and we are on track to achieve absolute reductions of our total adjusted costs next year between 1.5 and $2 billion on a constant currency basis compared to 2006.</p>
          <p>To create smaller and more accountable business units, our third priority, we created five separate business units in the U.S. for our patent-protected portfolio. The new U.S. business units already have lots of success stories demonstrating their new agility and speed. We also recently established a new separate unit, focused solely on optimizing the performance of our established products, products that are near or past their loss of exclusivity. This new unit is led by a skilled executive with substantial pharmaceutical experience around the world including in markets where these established products are very successful.</p>
          <p>In R&amp;D, we put each therapeutic area in a single location, allowing colleagues to have a clear line of sight to a smaller, more focused enterprise. We have new leadership in several of these therapeutic areas and we're well on our way to ensuring greater focus, accountability, and entrepreneurship in each of these R&amp;D units. We also created a separate Biotherapeutics and Bioinnovation Center, led by a world-class scientist to discover, license, and acquire more new candidates for the pipeline.</p>
          <p>We also have good progress to report on our fourth priority, building more meaningful collaborations with other individuals and organizations with whom we can partner to add value. We have signed over 1,000 new scientific alliances this past year. These include major deals such as Icogen, which provides a novel opportunity in pain, Tacere Therapeutics which offers an RNAi approach to the treatment of Hepatitis C, and Taisho Pharmaceuticals, which presents opportunities in the schizophrenia area. We also entered into a unique collaboration with The Scripps Research Institute that is already bearing fruit, and we created The Pfizer Incubator to work with academic, biotech, and venture communities on innovative ways to answer some tough questions.</p>
          <p>We have also significantly improved our relationships with key trade and managed care customers. We have improved our formulary positions for some of our key products giving us the opportunity to provide our products to millions of patients. We are also actively exploring collaborations with best-in-class companies in a number of areas where we can work together to create value, including improving patient outcomes and achieving joint clinical support.</p>
          <p>Finally, our fifth priority, making Pfizer a great place to work. We have significantly streamlined the organization, reducing layers and increasing spans of control. The move towards smaller units will empower thousands of colleagues. Among many other important changes, we brought in a world-class talent development leader from Microsoft. Most importantly, from my perspective, we have urged our colleagues to be as candid and open as possible and I am very encouraged by the way they have responded. They are telling us quite clearly what is working and what is not working. We are listening to that and we are moving quickly to respond to their views at every level.</p>
          <p>Overall, while we have lots more to do, we are making steady progress in establishing Pfizer as a company where open communications, empowerment, focus and accountability are the norm, with a performance-based culture that recognizes and rewards outstanding contributions from Pfizer colleagues. We will continue to execute against these five priorities in every part of Pfizer.</p>
          <p>Our objective, of course, is to position the company to deliver strong total shareholder return and at our March 5th Analyst Meeting, we'll talk in detail about longer-term strategies to invest in our future, create value with our Science and Technology and deliver innovative healthcare. But today, I will simply list in broad terms the areas where we are concentrating.</p>
          <p>We intend, first, to refocus and optimize the patent protected portfolio. Second, find new opportunities for established products. Third, accelerate our growth in emerging markets. Fourth, invest in complementary businesses. And fifth, establish and sustain an unwavering commitment to innovation and a culture of continuous improvement. Well, I have much more to say about all of this on March 5th, including outlining key milestones by which you can track our progress</p>
          <p>A final comment before I turn this over to Frank. Much has changed at Pfizer, much will change. The urgent challenges we face present great opportunities. They have galvanized us to react fast, rebuild our foundation and renew our determination. I am pleased with our progress but all of us at Pfizer know that we have more work ahead to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders and build the value of our business for the long-term. Frank?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jeff. Good day everyone. Now to the results. The charts I will be reviewing today are included in our webcast and will help facilitate the discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2007 results.</p>
          <p>With that, let me get to our financials.</p>
          <p>Today we reported revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 of 13.1 billion, a 4% increase compared with the year-ago quarter despite NORVASC's loss of U.S. exclusivity which contributed to a 666 million decrease in NORVASC revenues. Fourth quarter revenue was positively impacted by foreign exchange, which increased revenues by approximately 610 million or 5%, and a strong performance of many new and in-line products.</p>
          <p>Reported net income of 2.9 billion for the fourth quarter decreased 70%, and reported diluted EPS of $0.42 decreased 68% compared with the year ago quarter. These declines are primarily due to the one-time after-tax gain of 7.9 billion or about $1.08 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to the sale of the Consumer Healthcare business which was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange, lower acquisition related IPR&amp;D charges and other items.</p>
          <p>Adjusted income of 3.6 billion for the fourth quarter increased 17% and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.52 increased 21% compared with the year ago quarter. These increases were primarily the result of the favorable impact of foreign exchange as well as our cost reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>Now to the full year. Full year 2007 revenues increased 1% to 48.6 billion compared with 2006, despite the loss of U.S. exclusivity in both NORVASC and Zoloft, which decreased by approximately 1.9 and 1.6 billion respectively. Full year revenues were again positively impacted by foreign exchange of approximately 1.5 billion, which increased revenues by about 3% and the strong performance of many new and in-line products.</p>
          <p>Full year 2007 reported net income of 8.3 billion declined 57% compared with 2006 and full year reported diluted EPS of $1.20 declined 55% year-over-year. The year-over-year comparison was negatively impacted by the one-time after-tax gain of 7.9 billion or $1.08 per diluted share related to the sale of the Consumer Healthcare business.  The after-tax charges of 2.1 billion we recorded in the third quarter of 2007 primarily related to the write-off of assets and other costs associated with our decision to exit Exubera and higher after-tax charges of 2.7 billion associated with our cost-reduction initiatives which increased from 1.4 billion in 2006.</p>
          <p>Full year adjusted income increased 2% to 15.3 million and adjusted diluted EPS increased 7% to $2.20 compared with 2006. Full year adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS were favorably impacted by foreign exchange and our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. In addition, adjusted diluted EPS was also favorably impacted by our share purchase program.</p>
          <p>Let me point out several significant items that are included in our reported results for the fourth quarter. More detailed disclosures will be provided in our Form 10-K filing at the SEC. In the fourth quarter, we incurred 213 million in restructuring charges as compared with 495 million in the prior-year quarter. These charges are primarily associated with employee costs and asset impairments.</p>
          <p>In addition, we incurred 525 million of implementation costs compared with 241 million in the prior-year quarter. These costs are primarily related to sites we exited or are in the process of exiting. These amounts are reported in costs of sales, R&amp;D, and SI&amp;A expenses and are detailed more fully in the supplemental information accompanying the release.</p>
          <p>Throughout the year, specific cost-reduction initiatives spanned essentially all divisions, functions, markets, and sites across Pfizer. Broad categories of activity included sales force reductions, manufacturing research site exits and outsourcing. We reduced our U.S. sales force by about 20% and had implemented similar reductions in many other markets. We have exited six manufacturing plants and two R&amp;D sites in 2007. Furthermore, we are in the process of exiting an additional 12 manufacturing plants and four R&amp;D sites.</p>
          <p>To date, all transitions are proceeding according to plan.  In addition, research programs and development projects have been transferred and stabilized in their new location with minimal disruption. Moreover, a wide array of outsourcing opportunities are in various stages of implementation; manufacturing, logistics, finance, facilities, legal, and IT are among the functions contributing the financial and operational benefits of this strategy.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to provide more details regarding our adjusted income components. Adjusted revenues for the quarter was 13 billion, an increase of 3% versus the prior year quarter, despite NORVASC loss of U.S. exclusivity in March 2007, which contributed to a 666 million decrease in NORVASC revenues.</p>
          <p>Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 17.4% in the fourth quarter, compared with 16.6% in the year-ago quarter.  The increase is primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.  In fact, cost of sales as a percentage of revenues actually improved modestly excluding the effect of foreign exchange. And to a lesser extent, unfavorable geographic and business mix which more than offset savings from ongoing cost-reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>Adjusted SI&amp;A expenses were 4.5 billion for the quarter, an increase of 1% compared with the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>Adjusted R&amp;D expenses were 2.2 billion, a decrease of 9% compared with the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>Adjusted SI&amp;A and R&amp;D expenses as well as adjusted cost of sales were favorably impacted by savings from our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. However, this was offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately 480 million from foreign exchange on total cost.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate on adjusted income for the quarter was 18.2%, which decreased due to changes in our geographic income mix.</p>
          <p>I would also like to highlight the performance of selective products during the fourth quarter. First, LIPITOR worldwide revenues increased 3% to 4 billion, compared with the year-ago quarter. The favorable impact of foreign exchange was approximately 150 million, which increased revenues by about 4%. Revenues in the U.S. declined 4%, due to continued intense competition in payer pressure while revenues from international markets increased 13%, of which 11% was due to foreign exchange and the remainder due to operating growth.</p>
          <p>As you can see, most key in-line products grew in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year quarter with the exception of ZYRTEC. Given the U.S. patent expirations, December of 2007, and pending launch of over-the-counter ZYRTEC, you will see selling the product this month. Full-year 2007 revenues for ZYRTEC were $1.5 billion. In addition, I want to point out that we will also lose U.S. patent protection for CAMPTOSAR in February 2008. Full-year 2007 revenues for CAMPTOSAR, 969 million, of which 539 million was from the U.S.</p>
          <p>Key new products including CHANTIX, LYRICA, and SUTENT continue to deliver strong growth during the quarter. CHANTIX, our prescription treatment to aid smoking cessation, achieved revenues of 280 million, an increase of 311% compared with the year-ago quarter. Last week, we updated the label for CHANTIX to include an additional warning for patients. The potential impact of this action has been considered in our guidance for 2008.</p>
          <p>LYRICA, our medicine for the management of neuropathic pain and more recently fibromyalgia, delivered revenues of 564 million, an increase of 60% compared with the year-ago quarter. Finally, SUTENT, our product for advanced kidney cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors posted revenues of 182 million, an increase of 75% compared with the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>As expected, revenues from Zoloft and NORVASC, which lost U.S. exclusivity in August of '06 and March of '07 respectively, continued to decline during the fourth quarter. Compared with the year-ago quarter, NORVASC revenues decreased 51% to 650 million and Zoloft revenues decreased 20% to134 million.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the chart, we exceeded our 2007 top line and bottom line expectations regarding our '07 financial guidance, which we previously announced on last quarter's conference call. We posted 48.4 billion of adjusted revenues, meeting our previous expectations and achieved reported diluted EPS with $1.20 and adjusted diluted EPS of 2.20, both exceeding the previous expected ranges.</p>
          <p>Our 2007, adjusted SI&amp;A expenses decreased by 560 million from '06 levels on a constant currency basis, slightly lower than our previous expectation of approximately 600. Total adjusted SI&amp;A expenses of 15.2 billion, or essentially add our guidance of approximately $15.1 billion. In addition, we recorded adjusted R&amp;D expenses of 7.5 billion consistent with our guidance.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate on adjusted income was 21%, slightly better than our expectations. And we expect to generate cash flows from operations at or above our guidance of 12 to 13 billion.  Also, our LIPITOR revenues declined 2% for the year, better than our previous guidance of 3 to 5% decline in comparison to 2006.</p>
          <p>That said, our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 15.9% for the year versus guidance of 15.5%. As I previously mentioned, this variance was due to the unfavorable geographic and business mix and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange which more than offset savings from our ongoing cost reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>Looking to 2008, our full-year guidance is as follows; we expect annual revenues in the range of 47 to 49 billion, reflecting an increase of 500 million to both the bottom and top ends of our previous range; a reduction of adjusted total cost from 2006 level of at least 1.5 to $2 billion on a constant currency basis; adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue of 14.5 to 15.5% resulting from the full-year benefit in 2008 of manufacturing Cydaxis in 2007 and ongoing cost savings efforts.</p>
          <p>We also expect adjusted R&amp;D in the range of 7.3 to 7.6 billion; adjusted SI&amp;A in the range of 14.4 to 14.9 billion; reported diluted EPS in the range of $1.78 to $1.93, reflecting a $0.03 increase to the bottom end of our previous range; adjusted diluted EPS in the range of 2.35 to 2.45, reflecting a $0.04 increase to the bottom end of our previous range; and effective tax rate, 22 to 22.5% on adjusted income; cash flows from operations of 17 to 18 billion, which is $1 billion less than our previous guidance due primarily to the estimated timing of tax payments.</p>
          <p>As always, results may vary from quarter to quarter based on the seasonality of revenues and spending and the timing of the loss of U.S. exclusivity, and patent expirations of certain products, among other things. First-quarter 2008 revenues may not be comparable to the first-quarter 2007 revenues as a result of the loss of U.S. exclusivity of NORVASC, CAMPTOSAR and ZYRTEC, which we will cease selling this month following the anticipated launch of an over-the-counter ZYRTEC. Collectively, these products contributed U.S. revenues of about 1.1 billion in the first-quarter of '07 and 2.7 billion in the full-year 2007. It is important to note that we have considered these factors in our full-year 2008 guidance.</p>
          <p>Going forward, our focus remains on building total shareholder value by achieving our financial goals, maintaining spending discipline, prudently allocating our capital and improving our cost structure.</p>
          <p>So to summarize the key takeaways; we exceeded our '07 revenue and EPS guidance provided last quarter. Regarding 2008 guidance, we increased the top and bottom ends of our previous revenue guidance range by 500 million and increased the bottom end of our adjusted diluted EPS range by $0.04 and our reported diluted EPS by $0.03.</p>
          <p>Our new products, especially LYRICA, CHANTIX, and SUTENT continue to deliver strong growth and partially offset decreasing revenues from products that have lost exclusivity. Revenue from these three new products increased to 3.3 billion in 2007 from 1.5 billion in 2006.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are continuing to execute on our plan to reduce costs and we expect to continue to realize savings in these initiatives in 2008.</p>

          <p>Tim, I think a Tier 2 access in &#x2013; I don't have the '06 numbers, '07 was above 65% on Tier 2 access and we expect to maintain or slightly improve that in '08. In regard to enhanced, it's really too early to tell the impact vis-&#xE0;-vis is the formerly position is in place we're in Tier 2 so it is too early to tell.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for taking the questions. Just on the first quarter revenues, traditionally when you take your annual price increase you do traditionally allow wholesalers an opportunity to buy in for a period of time, can you &#x2013; at the old 2007 pricing level, can you confirm how that might have an impact on revenues going into the first quarter if it will at all?</p>
          <p>And then a question on gross margins, I believe ZYRTEC being a partner product from UCB is below your current gross margin, can you also confirm if CAMPTOSAR is also below your current gross margin?</p>
          <p>And then just finally on foreign exchange, you disclosed a 5% benefit, can you comment on what the contribution of price and volume was in the quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay John, thanks for following the request to stick to one question at a time. We'll start with the first question regarding first quarter revenue impact of &#x2013; on LIPITOR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the way, and let me take a shot at this. I think the way I'll answer that is by saying, if you look at our weeks on hand for &#x2013; at the end of the year, there were basically two and a half weeks, which were down from the year-ago quarter. If you look at our third quarter weeks on hand, that was also down on a year-over-year basis. So, in terms of what we are doing relative to our distributors, inventory levels were actually were down, kind of point one. In terms of CAMPTOSAR and the gross margin on CAMPTOSAR relative to our overall gross margin, obviously many of our products have higher gross margins relative to our overall gross margins, of which CAMPTOSAR is one of those.</p>
          <p>And then, in terms of the last question on FX, I think the way I'll answer that is just what we had included in the release, which was if you look at the positive impact of FX for the year, it was about 600 million &#x2013; 610 million for the year on the top line, so about $1.5 billion on the top line for the full year. So 600 million in Q1, $1.5 billion for the full year, obviously with that having a benefit on the bottom line as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Dave, it's Frank and I can clearly do that. For the fourth quarter, give or take, it was about 200 million and for the year, it was about 600 million and that's when you basically factor in the positive impact on the top line and I'll call it the increase it causes in cost of sales SI&amp;A and R&amp;D and then when all is said and done, the flow through of all that to the bottom line including other income. So, all is said and done, about 200 million for the quarter, about 600 million for the full year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. What we did is for '08 guidance. We basically used current exchange rates, so January exchange rates. So, we are not making any assumptions about what's going to happen to exchange on a going-forward basis. We basically used the January exchange rates. The only place where we didn't do that was in the total adjusted cost number where we said 1.5 to 2 billion reduction from 2006 spending levels at constant exchange rates. So, that's the one subtlety where we didn't do it. Other than that, it's all at January current exchange rates.</p>

          <p>Great, thank you. Just a quick question relative to what's happening with VYTORIN following ENHANCE, I know it's probably too early to tell regarding Pfizer's potential benefit from this data. But maybe just from a sector level when we see a surrogate like LDL kind of seemingly dismissed in the markets in the face of just one conflicting data point. I guess first of all, are you surprised by that and second how do you view that in the context of your investment you are making in more kind of prophylactic types of therapies? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Chris I &#x2013; I don't think that LDL was dismissed as a surrogate; it was how you lower LDL with the issue. And clearly there is a wealth of evidence that lowering LDL with statins gives positive outcome, LIPITOR has 10 landmark trials on that issue. So I think the role that LDL plays is firmly established and will continue to be so. Sorry, what was the second part of your question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess it was a general question of maybe as we are looking outside of even the Statin market, when we look at these more prophylactic type of therapies, are you looking at maybe having to run more outcome studies even to get drugs approved than in the past? It seems like it's pretty difficult environment right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just wanted to go back to the gross margin question. Frank, obviously the gross margin was hurt this quarter by foreign currency, even though revenues were highly benefited from foreign currency as well as strength of other products. Can you tell us what the gross margin in the fourth quarter and the full year 2007 would have been without the foreign currency effect, so that we can sort of look at 2008 on an apples-to-apples basis, if that's fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So let me just &#x2013; let me run the numbers, Jami and then I'll go down a layer and I'll answer the question, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at &#x2013; you are welcome. If you look at Q4 gross margin, if I'm going to flip it to cost of sales, just because it's easier for me. If you look at the cost of sales Q4 '06 to Q4 '07, they went from 16.6% to 17.4%. If you were to strip out FX the 16.6% would have actually declined modestly, so it literally declined modestly. If you look at the full year, gross margins went from 14.9% to 15.9%, roughly half of that increase was due to FX. So think about it as fairly evenly distributed between FX and then unfavorable geographic and business mix. So the 14.9 to 15.9 roughly half of that was FX.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the midpoint guidance for 2008 roughly assumes flat gross margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you look at the midpoint, it's 15%, right, so, and what I said was 14.9 to 15.9, with roughly half of that due to FX, so that would bring you closer to I'll call it 15.5, right. And then what's really happening there is, why 15.5 or 15.9 on an adjusted basis versus the range of 14.5 to 15.5. So let me &#x2013; if I may let me spend a minute or two on that. So there's really several things going on there. One is, we exited six manufacturing facilities in 2007, we will get the benefit, the full-year benefit of that in 2008. We've also announced 12 manufacturing facility exits that are in process, we will get some benefit from that in 2008.</p>
          <p>In terms of other things we are doing to reduce cost we are basically expecting to lower our sourcing cost so think about kind of, our material sourcing cost by establishing strategic partnerships with some lower cost vendors. We've many projects underway, they're not all cooked, there are various stages of implementation but on many of those we'll get benefit in 2008. And then we have multiple projects going on in many of the divisions in the company with manufacturing, logistics, facilities, IT. We will generate savings in 2008 some of which will accrue to the cost of sales line item. So it's based on all of that where we obviously incorporate all that into our guidance for '08 which gets you into that 14 to 15.5 range even though the number was 15.9% in 2007.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, so in Canada there are two proceedings with two different generics that are ongoing at this point. First, we're awaiting an appellate decision on the case with Ranbaxy with respect to the enantiomer patents, that has been argued, its been fully briefed and we're awaiting that decision. We received a favorable decision against Ranbaxy on our crystalline form patent, which holds them off the market most likely through 2008. So that's Ranbaxy. Apotex, we are taking an appeal on a recent unfavorable ruling on the enantiomer patent. We also have crystalline form trials against Apotex, too early to determine outcomes of those cases. With respect internationally in Europe almost in every market the basic patent expires after the enantiomer patent and that expires in 2011. And so thus far, we've been successful in holding on to that date of expiry. In Spain, there are some cases on appeal that we're awaiting outcomes on that could have an impact in that market, just too early to tell.</p>

          <p>Thank you Allen and, Roopesh, let me just add to that, that the potential outcomes in Canada are reflected in the guidance for '08 that we provided today. With regard to your question about price and volume, I'll let Frank have a crack at that.</p>

          <p>Roopesh, let me take a shot at this in terms of how we &#x2013; what we provide relative to this. I think at an overall level, across the total company, price had a favorable impact, volume had an unfavorable impact, both of which were in the low single-digits for the full year, kind of low single- digits on price, call it low-to-mid-single digits on volume.</p>

          <p>I'm well, thank you kindly. Good afternoon, gentlemen. My question is about the $5 billion addition to the share repurchase authorization that compares with 10 billion that you accomplished in '07 and a five year average prior to that of 7 billion. I'm curious to know whether you're just taking it less at a time now, or whether this is more of a husbanding of cash for future corporate activity, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Harlan, Frank will take that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so a couple of comments on this one. First, in '07, we bought $10 billion of our shares. You need to remember, we had cash in '07 from the sale of the Consumer Healthcare business in 2006, so we had a lot of cash, much of which we used in 2007 to do share buybacks.  In terms of going forward, Harlan, our focus has been, continues to be on delivering total shareholder return.  If you look at the share purchase program, it's a new program, it's open ended, so there is no timeframe for completion relative to the $5 billion.  We will be opportunistic relative to how we deploy capital, including share buybacks.</p>
          <p>The other thing to remember is when we look at total shareholder return, another major element of that is the dividend. We increased our dividend in 2008 by 10%, we had said it would be moderated versus prior increases but 10% versus 21% and 26% in '07 and '06, respectively, so a very large increase. That absolute number, by the way, on the dividend now is give or take $8.5 billion.  So lots of capital being deployed in the area of total shareholder return.</p>
          <p>And then finally to your point, there is lots of opportunities for us to deploy capital beyond dividends and beyond share buybacks whether it be with internal investments or external investments and we are factoring all of that in to how we deploy our capital.  But hopefully, we are demonstrating no change in terms of our focus on delivering total shareholder return.</p>

But could you give us a little bit more detail on the percentage of the target market that either has a pre-existing psych illness or may exhibit some of the Neuropsychiatric symptoms that are mentioned in the label? And as you look at your patient use over the last 12 months, how does that differ from the percentage of the target market if you will?

          <p>Catherine, I will have to get back to you, I don't have the split of the target marketplace between those conditions.  I would like to say that the important thing about this label change is it does allow a dialogue between patient and physician and that medium-term; long-term is very good for the product. The physicians are &#x2013; research has shown in the last two months, given the fact that in fact most of this information or all of it was already updated in our label in November, physicians continue to see a very strong benefit for the use of CHANTIX.  So, we will continue to promote CHANTIX to both physicians and patients and believe this label change in that context is manageable.</p>

First, I want to mention that we have been in dialogue with the European regulators on the label as well and we expect shortly to have a communication in which a similar label in Europe is adapted to the one we have here in the United States.</p>
          <p>I just thought I'd just add my perspective to this for a second if I could. This is a really a very unusual situation from my book &#x2013; point of view.  The benefits of this drug are really quite extraordinary for individual patients and for public health when you consider the hundreds of thousands of people that die every year from smoking related illnesses and there are many, many patients that have and will obtain the benefit of this drug, but as Ian says, there is also a great value in enhancing patient physician communications about potential side effects of this or any other drug.  So, I think this is a really powerful opportunity to make a big difference in public health and from everything we can tell the physicians understand these tremendous benefits and are well prepared to have these good dialogues with their patients and in the long run, I think this is going to be a terrific drug, not just for Pfizer but frankly for public health.  Can I have the next question please?</p>

          <p>Thank you. Can you provide additional perspective on your December 21st release relative to the additional data with regard to dalbavancin and the issue of non-inferiority trial designs? What is the FDA asking and what do you need to do to get dalbavancin approved? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Just briefly Steve, there is nothing new to disclose from the December 21st.  We will provide additional data to the FDA, we are working with the agency to respond to the requirement and it's simply too early to say if we will need additional trials or in fact timing of the approval.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a little more follow up on CHANTIX and the size of the patient opportunity and what you have learned since the launch on this product. First in the U.S., you mentioned that 5 million patients had tried it, do you have any sense, Ian, on what is the real addressable market of people who might consider trying pharmacotherapy in the U.S. and the number of people who might be returning to it?</p>
          <p>And then also just over in Europe, a place where we don't have a lot of visibility, though do see a lot of news around inability to smoke in certain public places emerging around the &#x2013; around Europe.  Any news there on reimbursement and how the product is being adopted in Europe?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jim. Go ahead Ian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in the U.S., we're probably talking about something like 50 million smokers as a potential target.  We could segment them into four segments, probably two of them are more immediately leverageable or incentivated to look for treatments.  That's about 25 million patients that we think are seekers of treatments or alternatives, the other 25 million are probably more of a medium to longer-term market development opportunity.  Vis-&#xE0;-vis Europe, you are correct, it's &#x2013; there is a less of a culture of smoking ban, it's beginning to get traction in Europe, the UK has it, Ireland has it, I believe Spain is moving towards that, as is France, Sweden and as those bans come in place it creates a lot more sort of a propitious marketplace for us.  So the product is doing well where we have reimbursements, Sweden, the UK, and reimbursement is beginning to get traction alongside the smoking bans, but I would look at international markets as a medium term development opportunity for CHANTIX.  In Asia --</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I was &#x2013; I was about to say, let's not forget Asia. That's a huge opportunity for us as well.  Okay, thank you.  Next question please.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  I was wondering why you cut the cash flow target by $1 billion, I know you mentioned timing of payments but what payments and how has the timing changed?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As long as you are not from the IRS, Frank will answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so Mike, let me make a couple of points on this and second point I make I will answer the question specifically, but just one thing in terms of if you look at the rhythm of the numbers, in terms of the cash flow we are generating from operations, for 2007 we had guidance out there of 12 to 13 billion and we said we would be at or above that guidance range, but call it close to that range.  For 2008, the previous guidance was 18 to 19 billion, we lowered it to 17 to 18 billion, but higher than what we had done in 2007.  It's really driven by some assumptions we had made relative to estimated payments, relative to tax, you know, in terms of when we would make those payments, the size of those payments and quite frankly our estimates in terms of the guidance we just updated, first the estimates that were made previously changed and those changes, relative to the timing of those payments, is what had us change our guidance and take it down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Just a quick question.  I was hoping that you could give us a little bit of context in the current economic environment.  Co-pays have been going up.  There is more branded drugs on Tier 3 and I am just wondering what we have seen historically the last time we went through a recession, what happened to IMS prescription trends and do you have an overall view into your business that characterizes the impact of an economic environment and Tier 3 access?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good question you know, obviously, our data shows that as Tier 3 &#x2013; or even if they are on Tier 2 and co-pays increase it is not positive for scripts or scripts being filled.  So that would indicate that we would see a more difficult environment, but on the other hand, you have the  supposite impacts of Part D and government programs, and so I think right now it is well balanced in that context. So I don't see a material impact in '08 for those trends.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. It is my impression that LIPITOR is a very low tax product, and so I was wondering if you could confirm that the tax rate on LIPITOR profits are below the corporate average, and if so, how should we think about its impact on the tax rate of the company when LIPITOR goes generic early in the next decade. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Dave, I &#x2013; we don't really provide that information regarding each individual product. Different products have different tax rates in different parts of the world and they aggregate into the corporate tax rate that we articulate and that's constantly monitored and an event that we look at, and we look for opportunities to deal with it and report our aggregate tax rate. Next question, please.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Again on ENHANCE, you said a couple of times that it's simply too early to assess the impact of the study. But can you, or have you already changed your marketing tactics in response to this data; are your reps out talking about ENHANCE and perhaps drawing parallels to the REVERSAL study, or are you engaging in any other tactic using this data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the short answer is, our reps are out there promoting the advantages of LIPITOR and the data that supports it, and we feel very strongly that that is the best way to position LIPITOR and they are out there doing that even as we speak. Did you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, Steve it's consistent with the way we have always positioned LIPITOR that we have safety across the dose range, that we have LVL potency across the -- lowering across the range and we have landmark trials. So this just sort of confirms and validates our positioning for LIPITOR in the marketplace.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the follow up. Can you just comment on performance-based contract rebates, I think there were about 390 million in third quarter '07; can you disclose what they were in the fourth quarter and what percent of the rebates might be attributed to LIPITOR? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So John, its Frank; I think the way I will answer this is, overall rebates for the year, so total consolidated Pfizer, were essentially flat, in fact slightly down on a year-over-year basis &#x2013; I think I would say, point one. Point two, in terms of LIPITOR, overall rebates were up; they are actually up year-over-year, call it by about 2% is the way I would think about it. So overall, essentially flat; relative to LIPITOR, up about 2% of revenue.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the absolute number in the quarter, 2% or so &#x2013; call it a couple of 100 million; approximately 200 million I think.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>In fact, let me just if I may. John, overall for the company total year, that is essentially flat, think about it in the kind of the mid single-digit range, about mid single-digits.</p>
