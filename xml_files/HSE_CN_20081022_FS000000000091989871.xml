          <p>Hello. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome to the Husky Energy Third Quarter 2008 Conference Call and webcast. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there'll be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Patrick Aherne, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brock. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased that you could join us today to discuss our 2008 third quarter. With me in the room are Mr. John Lau, President and Chief Executive Officer; Alister Cowan, Chief Financial Officer; Rob Peabody, Chief Operating Officer, Operations and Refining; and Terrance Kutryk, Vice President of Midstream &amp; Refined Products.</p>
          <p>In today's call, John will discuss the financial results and give an overview of the operational highlights. Terrance Kutryk will give an update on Midstream and Downstream divisions, John will then conclude, and we'll open up the call for questions, starting with analysts and then followed by the media.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of the various risk factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and on our website.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to John.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick and good afternoon to everyone. I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter of 2008, Husky achieved another clean result for the quarter, and we maintained strong financial performance.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter of 2008, sales and operating revenue was up by 77% to 7.7 billion, compared with 4.4 billion in the same quarter of 2007. Cash flow from operations increased 42% to 2 billion, or $2.36 per share. Earnings were 1.27 billion or $1.50 per share in the third quarter, up 65% from 769 million, or $0.91 per share in the same quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>For the first nine months, sales and operating revenue was 20 billion, up 86% compared with 10.8 billion in the same period of 2007. Cash flow from operations increased 41% to 5.6 billion or $6.63 per share. Earnings were 3.5 billion or $4.15 per share, up 65% from 2.1 billion or $2.52 per share in the first nine months of 2007.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, Husky's production averaged 356,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting a reduction of 4% in production from the third quarter of 2007. Total crude oil and natural gas liquids produced was 256,000 barrels of oil per day in the quarter, while natural gas production averaged 598 million cubic feet per day. The decrease in production volumes was in line with our guidance of a reduction of 5 to 7% for the year, as we reported in the second quarter of 2008. And the effective delay of the eighth production well at White Rose, due to severe ice conditions earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was 1.7 billion, down from 2.8 billion at the end of 2007. This tax was offset by cash and cash equivalents of 966 million, resulting in net debt of 753 million.</p>
          <p>Husky currently has unused committed credit facilities of 1.5 billion. Husky's long-term debt average term to maturity is 13.5 years with the mix maturity in 2012. Effective cash flow fell to 0.2 times compared with 0.5 times at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>Husky's strong financial performance in terms of net earnings and cash flow enables the company to fund its current capital programs, reduce debt and accumulate cash to take advantage of further investment opportunity.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter, Husky's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. Husky is well positioned to perform in this volatile financial and commodity markets, as a result of its focus on financial discipline with respect to cost and project execution over the years.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, Husky acquired a 50% working interest in a joint venture in the United States that covers approximately 844,000 net acres in the Columbia River Basin, in the states of Washington and Oregon. This is another move by Husky to develop a diversified portfolio of resource plays in North America. The Columbia River Basin is one of the major untouched onshore basins in North America possessing significant upside gas potential.</p>
          <p>At the Sunrise Oil Sands Project, work continued in the third quarter on development, planning, area infrastructure and site preparation.</p>
          <p>At the McMullen property, located in the west central region of the Athabasca oil sands, Husky has progressed planning for its primary and thermal development. In October, Husky began drilling wells in the primary production estimated areas and commenced with drilling of stratigraphic wells to delineate the reservoir for thermal recovery.</p>
          <p>Offshore in the East Coast of Canada, the eighth production well in the White Rose field commenced production late in the quarter. The North Amethyst satellite tie-back development remains on schedule for a late 2009 or early 2010 startup.</p>
          <p>Husky has acquired two exploration blocks for the Labrador Shelf, adding to its existing leasehold inventory offshore Labrador. This is a Gazprom region, in which Husky holds an interest in discoveries of approximately 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources as reported by Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board.</p>
          <p>Internationally, the West Hercules deep water drilling rig currently undergoing commissioning in South Korea is expected to arrive in the Liwan field in the South China Sea in November of 2008. An initial program involves the drilling of four delineation wells and two exploration wells. Front-end engineering and design work for the Liwan development is being tendered and design work is expected to commence in 2009.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, the Madura BD field development plan was approved by the government of Indonesia. Husky is expecting the Production Sharing Contract, the PSC extension, to be approved by the Indonesian authorities by the year end.</p>
          <p>Husky has secured a jack up rig to drill two exploration wells on the East Bawean II PSC in 2009. On October 17, 2008 Husky received noticed that it had been awarded by the government of Indonesia a 100% working interest in another exploration block in the East Java Sea. The North Sambawa II Block is approximately 5,000 square kilometers and is located approximately 450 kilometers east of the Madura Strait PSC.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Terrance Kutryk to give an update on the Midstream and Downstream divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Our Downstream and Midstream divisions were buffeted by volatile market conditions in the third quarter. Despite the narrow crack spreads in the early part of the quarter, refining margins have improved and this will become evident as inventory valuations stabilize.</p>
          <p>It should also be noted that on a year-to-date basis, our infrastructure-related businesses have surpassed last year's performance. Upgrader earnings for the third quarter were $62 million, similar to last year. Higher volumes in 2008 were offset by a unit margin that was 16% lower than in the third quarter of 2007 due to a lower upgrading differential.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure and marketing earnings for the third quarter of 2008 were 38 million compared to 64 million in the third quarter of 2007. Lower brokering margins on crude and natural gas and lower gas storage spreads were responsible for the reduction.</p>
          <p>The pipeline and infrastructure business was steady and partially offset marketing declines.</p>
          <p>Our Canadian refined products division contributed 25 million of net earnings in the third quarter, down from the same period in 2007. The Prince George refinery's throughput was down 27% due to planned maintenance.</p>
          <p>Higher asphalt sales volumes in the third quarter of 2008 were more than offset by a decrease in product margins compared to the third quarter of 2007. However, as mentioned earlier, margins are expected to improve as lower cost feedstocks are processed and sold.</p>
          <p>Refining crack spreads at the beginning of the quarter were low, primarily driven by weak gasoline cracks that were partially offset by firmer distillate spreads. Gulf Coast refinery disruptions associated with Hurricanes Gustav, Hanna and Ike widened spread later in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. downstream segment, third quarter earnings were a loss of $34 million from our 100% interest in the Lima Refinery and our 50% interest in the Toledo Refinery. Higher cost inventory at the beginning of the quarter negatively impacted earnings. Lima's operating performance was positive, with high on-stream reliability during the quarter.</p>
          <p>At the Lima refinery, Husky completed the conceptual stage evaluation of the optimal reconfiguration to increase capacity and enable it to process heavier feedstocks. Strong demand for materials and craft labor is easing, which is a favorable trend for the continuation of this project.</p>
          <p>Toledo had limited ability to capitalize on the wider sweet-sour differentials as throughput and its ability to process heavy crudes was impacted by turnaround activities.</p>
          <p>Our partners continued progress on the Continuous Catalyst Regeneration Reformer Project. The project's objectives are to effectively and safely improve profitability while reducing the operating risk, meet future product requirements and reduce the environmental footprint of the refinery.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the call back to John for his concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Terrance. The year 2008 demonstrates Husky's strategy and success in the volatile commodity market environment. We are continuing to execute our four strategies: investment in Canada, oil sands, offshore Canada East Coast, and in Southeast Asia. With strong cash flow and earnings and cash on hand, Husky is well positioned to consider investment opportunities. Back to you, Patrick.</p>

          <p>Our first question today comes from Carrie Tait of the National Post.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. There's been lots of talk about pulling back investment in the oil sands. You did talk about continued investment. Will we see that in assets such as your oil sands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is John here, Carrie. Oil sand developments are very special projects. In view of the high cost and also labor shortage most of the small projects were facing a lot of challenges. And I'm quite sure major developers with a deep pocket will continue to focus on oil sands development because it will be a 14-year production life and minimized so as to limit a lot of funding and development cost. So at this stage it depends on the market fluctuation, but I am quite sure majors will have the confidence to continue this cycle. Okay?</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Brenda Bouw of Canadian Press.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Brenda.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to ask you if you could comment maybe on the price of oil today. And sort of if you expected it and what your expectations are going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know quite well, we cannot speculate on the market especially, we are manufacturers. And I think that market volatility all hinges on supply and demand and more important is that the financial crisis. You have to look at whether U.S. is in recession or out of recession and how the global market will look like under this type of liquidity situation. So I think that price will reflect by itself. Some companies do estimate much higher but we have pretty conservative estimate to be much lower figure.</p>
          <p>The current pricing, in fact we're looking at it, but you should not look at spot. You should look at the annual average price. That is why it's important for a company to look at annual average rather than look at spot price, whether today it's 72 or even $70 would be high or low. We have to look at the annual average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what is your estimate? If you're conservative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can't really give you an estimate, but I tell you we're comfortably safe. We use a threshold between 75 to about $100 is the fluctuation. But it may be lower temporarily, but I think it's very difficult to predict. If I know I will do something else rather than &#x2013; I would do a lot more things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Robert Plexman of CIBC World Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Robert. Congratulations. This might be the last time you call us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right, John, that's right. So one more or a couple more questions for you, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't leave without asking a couple more questions. The focus used to be on production growth. And now in this environment, we've got to concentrate more on the balance sheet. So I've got a couple of balance sheet oriented questions for you. The debt ratio is low. The balance sheet is strong. Is keeping the debt ratio at around 11% still &#x2013; is that an ongoing priority for you as you look ahead?</p>
          <p>And sort of a part B to that question is, is there much pressure on CapEx as we go into 2009? I mean you have a whole suite of projects. The big ones, they're sort of longer term in nature. So I know you won't be announcing the '09 CapEx program for a while. But can you give us some idea? Is there much pressure for you to increase spending next year over this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, the first one is the production growth. If you recall five years ago, I've always emphasized Husky is one of the few companies, we are not driven by production. So we look at a cycle and we want to make sure we make a good return for a shareholder. So production growth is important, but it is not prime. So our Husky position is looking at much longer term than year-over-year production growth. Our annual compound annual growth rate of let's say, five years, we are aiming at 5 to 8% compound annual growth rate.</p>
          <p>Regarding the CapEx, CapEx is really one of the crucial indicators for a company's ability to grow in the future. Husky, I'm proud to say, we have very stringent discipline. What we're looking at is, we like to live within ourselves. Look at the net cash flow or the free cash flow from our operations. And we earmark that to be able to supply, to finance all the non-discretionary CapEx. Anything better than the market price, we will be start the other non-discretional projects. So Husky has no pressure due to liquidity or anything to <mark type="inaudible" /> our capital power. Our profile, if we announce in this coming few couple of months, you will see we are quite well met with our expectations on the future growth.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet area, we have strengthened on the debt to cash flow ratio. I want Alister to give a deep insight about how Husky control our effective cash flow ratio, and also an effective capital utilization ratio. Alister?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Robert, you'll be aware that Husky's historically had a very conservative and prudent approach to maintaining our financial strength and our flexibility. Thus, the importance of that is certainly evident to deal with the volatility and liquidity issues in the financial markets. So we will continue to focus on that, we will use our cash generation to fund our capital program and also enhance the strength by, where possible, minimizing our debt and being able to take advantage of any investment opportunities that may arise.</p>
