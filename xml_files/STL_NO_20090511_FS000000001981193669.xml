          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this StatoilHydro First Quarter 2009 Earnings Presentation. It takes place from the Presentation Center, The Brewery in London. And my name is Lars S&#xF8;rensen; I'm the Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>This morning, just before 9:00 AM, we published our results and the presentation pack will be used for this presentation this afternoon. It can be downloaded from our website at statoilhydro.com.</p>
          <p>Today's event is followed by -- first the presentation and then the Q&amp;A as usual, and questions can be asked via the Internet, which gives me good moment to say welcome to our webcast audience on the Internet.</p>
          <p>You can already, now, press the submit question button on your screen and your question will be presented to my PC here in London and I will ask the questions on your behalf. As you know, safety is of paramount concern to us and I just need to spend a minute on the emergency procedures here at The Brewery in London.</p>
          <p>There are two emergency exits here. The one where you came in here, we'll also be using them in an emergency. You follow the signs downstairs and outside in the road. This emergency exit will lead you through a big room and out into the road on the other side. There are no fire drills planned for today, so if the alarm goes off, it is real.</p>
          <p>So today's presentation will be performed by StatoilHydro's Chief Financial Officer Mr. Eldar Saetre. And with no further ado, I'll just give the word to Eldar Saetre.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Lars. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us at this first quarter presentation. So my first key and very important message today is that the operational performance for StatoilHydro in this first quarter has been very good, like it was in the fourth quarter. And although the financial results, obviously, have been significantly impacted by the lower oil price, we have at the same time strengthened the production capacity for the company quite significantly. And this is related both to improved regularities, drilling operations, also improvements. We have added new fields to our portfolio coming on stream and we have continued with a strong success rate on exploration.</p>
          <p>So as you know, the current financial and economic crisis has had a significant impact on the oil and gas prices in recent months. And despite some recent signals lately, positive signals, indicating a slowdown in the negative trends for the global economy, we are preparing ourselves for a quite slow recovery, and I would say, with many ups and downs during this journey. And consequently we believe also the oil prices could stay relatively low for quite some time and with some significant temporary setbacks compared to the levels that we see today.</p>
          <p>So accepting this rather fundamental uncertainty it is therefore very key, very important for us to take this into account in all our business activities and into our planning. And in this context, we also recognize that safe and efficient operations are crucial to our value creation, in particular, in times, in kind of times that we are experiencing currently.</p>
          <p>We continue to mature projects and turn them into production. The Alve and Yttergryta on the Norwegian Continental Shelf have come into production this quarter. In addition, the Tahiti project in Gulf of Mexico started production last week. We delivered a plan for development of the Caesar Tonga field in Gulf of Mexico. And also, last week, the Norwegian government approved, at least decided to submit a PDO to the Norwegian Parliament for final approval of the Goliath development in the northern parts of Norway.</p>
          <p>As mentioned, we have delivered a high success rate on exploration. And so far this year, we have drilled 31 wells, and 16 of these have been discoveries. And there are also a substantial number of wells which hasn't been concluded yet.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have changed the company structure from 1st of January this year. And consequently, we have to switch to US dollar as the so-called functional currency for three companies in the Group. That also includes the parent company, StatoilHydro ASA. And I will cover the accounting effects from these changes later on in my presentation. And then I will comment on the financial results.</p>
          <p>Our net reported net operating income was NOK35.5 billion this quarter. And this is a decrease of approximately 30% compared to last year. Income from operations in the first quarter was of course affected by a more than 50% reduction in the liquids prices measured in US dollar. And due to the significant depreciation of the Norwegian kroner versus US dollar on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the average price reductions in Norwegian kroner for the liquids price was around 40%. This was partly offset by a 23% increase in gas prices, average gas prices, compared to last year, again, in Norwegian kroner.</p>
          <p>In addition, lifted volumes of oil and gas combined increased by 7% quarter-to-quarter, and the results from both our gas trading and arbitrage business and our oil trading business have also been very good this quarter.</p>
          <p>Then to the net income, which was reduced from 16 billion to 4 billion this quarter. Negative financial items of 3.9 contributed obviously to this, compared to a positive same number, 3.9, in the same quarter last year. The income tax rate, which is calculated from the accounts, from the income before taxes in the accounts, was 87% compared to a tax rate of 71% in the first quarter last year. And I would revert to both of these issues, the financials and the tax rate later in my presentation and then I will offer a few comments to the oil and gas production.</p>
          <p>Our equity production grew by 26,000 barrels per day from first quarter last year to 2,074,000 barrels per day this quarter. This actually is the highest quarterly production ever for the Group, both on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and outside of Norway.</p>
          <p>Entitlement production of liquids was largely unchanged compared to last year at 1,104 million barrels per day and gas volumes increased by approximately 4%.</p>
          <p>The production guidance that we have given you for 2009 excludes impacts from production quotas imposed by OPEC. And so far this year, these impacts have been approximately 13,000 barrels per day for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So, we maintain our production guidance for 2009 at an average daily equity production of 1,950 million barrels per day. However, there are some uncertainties, which I would like to mention related to the gas markets in the short-term. The gas demand in Europe has already slowed down considerably, which is impacting the volumes sold on long-term take-or-pay contracts.</p>
          <p>Now this is a typical seasonal pattern for the second and for the third quarter of the -- but we expect the slowdown in offtake to be somewhat more distinct this summer due to the current recession.</p>
          <p>Also, the liquid gas markets seems to be more challenging in the short-term leading to a downward pressure on gas prices in Europe, and although we are very confident about the role of gas and the potential for gas growth in the longer-term, we will definitely at anytime seek to maximize value over any kind of volume targets.</p>
          <p>And as you know, our oil and gas export systems and gas fields are flexible and excellently located toward the gas markets, which gives us a very good starting position in terms of operating value even in this environment.</p>
          <p>So, to conclude, this has been a good quarter with solid operational performance and high gas offtake. There are some uncertainties, as mentioned, related to the gas markets, but we are on track to meet our 2009 production guidance.</p>
          <p>Then I will comment briefly on the adjusted earrings for each of the business areas. In general, the operational trading activities in all parts of our business has been very good this quarter, and this has provided good support also through the adjusted earnings, which is at NOK36 billion this quarter, which is 30% down compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Before I comment on each of the business areas, I would like to summarize the adjustments that we have made to arrive at the underlying earnings of 36 billion as you can see. And the largest component here is coming from net impairments of NOK2.4 billion, and it's mainly related to Gulf of Mexico assets.</p>
          <p>Derivatives, adds up to a negative 0.1 billion, which consists of minus 1.1 from the Norwegian -- E&amp;P Norway portfolio, and a positive effect of 0.8 related to the gas business and NOK0.2 billion to the oil trading activities.</p>
          <p>The net overlift represents NOK0.6 billion, and then there are various other effects adding up to a positive 1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>And then I should just mention that you will find more details on these specifics -- on these adjustments, both in the MD&amp;A and also in the supplementary presentation that we are providing you with.</p>
          <p>And to each of the business areas, few comments. E&amp;P Norway reach an adjusted earnings of almost 30 billion, which is 30% down compared to last year, and the main driver is obviously the lower oil price. While the internal transfer price from -- for gas from E&amp;P Norway to natural gas business segment increased by 23%.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas production combined is up 1%, while lifted volumes is up 6%, and this represents an overlift in the quarter of 46,000 barrels per day for E&amp;P Norway. The cost development in E&amp;P Norway has been good overall, but we do expect somewhat higher costs related to repairs and a high maintenance activity during this summer.</p>
          <p>International E&amp;P had an adjusted earning of 0.3 billion this quarter and that's compared to 6.1 billion in the same quarter last year. And the main reason for this decline is the lower liquids price of 43% in Norwegian kroner.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have seen cost increases and that is mainly coming from the depreciation of the Norwegian Kroner versus US dollar of actually 30% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So that has impacted the Norwegian kroner accounts negatively.</p>
          <p>Exploration activities is still maintained at a high level with NOK2.7 billion in total in the quarter and 1.7 has been allocated to the Profit &amp; Loss statement.</p>
          <p>Natural Gas showed an increase in their adjusted earnings from 3 billion to 5 billion this quarter. Processing and transport, that part of the business, increased from 1.4 to 2 billion, mainly related to higher volumes and also slightly higher tariff revenues.</p>
          <p>While the marketing and trading part of the business increased their earnings by 1.4 to NOK3 billion and this is mainly due to strong performance within its trading arbitrage activities that we are doing, but also a 4% growth in volumes in this part of the business.</p>
          <p>Finally, manufacturing and marketing had also a positive development in the quarter from 0.2 last year, same quarter, to 1.6 billion this quarter. This improvement comes from our oil sales trading and supply business, and is entirely related to our crude oil trading activities. And then I will explain the changes that we have made in the functional currencies before I go into the financial items in more detail.</p>
          <p>As we reported at the fourth quarter presentation and also in the annual report for 2008, StatoilHydro changed the company structure, the legal structure from 1st of January.</p>
          <p>Following the merger, StatoilHydro and their ownership to all, or at least all licenses for both Statoil and Hydro ownership were split into different companies. That was not sustainable. So we have to align that and had to change the legal structure into a more rational setup.</p>
          <p>So as a result of this cleanup and this changed process, the parent company StatoilHydro ASA and two subsidiaries now became companies with a business -- their underlying business predominantly in US dollar.</p>
          <p>And according to IFRS, the functional currency -- the functional accounting currency of each of these individual companies in the Group has to reflect their underlying business-related activity.</p>
          <p>And as a consequence, we have to change the functional currency for all of these three companies, but the reporting currency at the Group level that remains Norwegian kroner.</p>
          <p>Again, according to IFRS, income tax in the P&amp;L, in the profit and loss statement, reported statement, must be calculated based on the relevant payable tax currency. For StatoilHydro ASA the parent company, where the whole financing of the Group, external financing also takes place, the tax currency that we pay taxes in is still Norwegian kroner. And this means that the adjustments we have introduced in functional currency represents no change to the nominal tax rate or the nominal tax calculation and the payment -- or the way taxes are presented in the profit and loss statements.</p>
          <p>So that means that the taxes of NOK27.6 billion that you can see in the accounts, they would have been exactly the same if we hadn't done this change, because Norwegian kroner, there is no change in the tax currency as such, exactly the same.</p>
          <p>However, the relevant basis for the tax calculation &#x2013; calculating, in fact, tax cost is no longer fully reflected in the accounts and specifically in the net financial items. So the companies changing functional currency will no longer have currency exchange effects, which is deriving from US dollar denominated monitory assets or liabilities.</p>
          <p>And conversely, monitory assets and liabilities, which is denominated now in other currency than US dollar may now generate this type of currency fluctuations in the net financial items.</p>
          <p>So according to our announcement last week, approximately NOK10 billion of positive currency impact, which would have been there in the previous case is no longer there, but still a basis for the cash tax calculation, which is mainly derived from the strengthening of the Norwegian kroner versus US dollar in relation to our long-term funding of the Group. This is now included in the basis for the tax calculation, but not included in the net financial items as reported.</p>
          <p>In other words, if we hadn't changed the functional currency, the impact -- this impact of NOK10 billion would have been recorded in the net financial items with no additional tax to it, because the tax is already there.</p>
          <p>And this would have led to a reduction in the calculated tax rate based on the reported income before tax from 87% that you can find now to approximately 66, 67%, if this amount had been included.</p>
          <p>So, to conclude, this change will decrease the volatility of the net financial items. However, it's important to understand that we do not pay either more or less taxes as a result of this change.</p>
          <p>The nominal tax calculation is exactly -- isn't affected, exactly the same as it was before. And this comment also goes for the financial items. There are no cash impact on the financial items. So the only change is actually in the accounting presentation of these numbers.</p>
          <p>So that leaves me with the presentation of the net financial items. So, as already mentioned, these are negative loss of 3.9 billion this quarter compared to same amount positive in the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>And as mentioned, and as a result of this change, the US dollar monetary assets and liabilities, including the long-term debt for the Group that used to impact this currency component does not impact this anymore.</p>
          <p>We see less volatility and we see this already in this quarter, where the net currency effects amounts to a loss of 1.5 billion that you can see here. This item would have been plus 8.5 billion, a difference of 10 billion, without the changes in the functional currency. And the one point billion remaining that you can see here of currency loss is now only related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies than US dollar.</p>
          <p>Our liquidity swaps that we are doing will still have the same accounting impact as before. They're in here. But they will now be derived from the Norwegian kroner receivable part of the swap and not from the US dollar liability side of the swap. The impact will be the same, because they've changed currency</p>
          <p>Other factors explaining this 1.9 billion negative currency effect is mainly related to internal monetary assets and liabilities with no cash impact for the Group. Then, interests and other financial expenses that you can see here, were 2.9 billion in the first quarter, and this is mainly related -- 2 billion of this is related to unrealized derivative loss from our long-term interest rate swaps where we are swapping into floating interest rates.</p>
          <p>Then to conclude my presentation, our guiding for 2009 and 2012 remains the same. We expect to deliver 1,950,000 barrels per day, our equity production this year. And then I've already reminded you of the typical seasonal pattern for the gas business over the next two quarters, and some additional uncertainties that I also mentioned.</p>
          <p>I should also mention that we are planning an extensive maintenance activity also this summer with an impact of around 80,000 barrels per day for the second quarter, for the whole portfolio, but this is mainly the Norwegian part of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our CapEx and exploration guidance is unchanged for 2009. And we also expect to see our unit production cost for 2009 in the higher end of the range of 33 to NOK36 that we have indicated for the period up until 2012.</p>
          <p>So this concludes my presentation. Then I should also mention that the next event that we will be hosting is the Investor and Analysts site visit that we will do at the Snoehvit LNG facility in the Northern parts of Norway on the 15th and 16th of June. And we hope to see as many of you as possible taking part in that event. And if you have any questions we have IR staff, Investor Relations staff who are ready to answer any questions you might have on that event.</p>
          <p>So, by that I conclude my presentation, and leave the word to Lars for Q&amp;As.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much. As usual, we can take questions from both the floor here in London and the Internet. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Apart from Eldar who is still standing there, we have K&#xE5;re Thomsen who is the Head of Corporate Accounting with us to answer questions. And with that I think we just start with the first question and HSBC is there.  Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm Paul Spedding from HSBC. Is there anything that prevents you from putting a normalized net income figure in, such that you neutralize some of the quite substantial tax effects that are coming through the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, what we have done this quarter is actually to provide you with a number for the financials and the impact on the financials from this significant component that will be a part of the tax calculation and not included in the statement. So I think we will have to find one way or another to provide that kind of information. And then you might yourself normalize for it as I indicated in this --. There are other sort of complexities in going further into the financials and normalizing for that. But at least for this component I think it's -- we fully recognized the complexity of seeing it from your side. And it's in our interest also to find a way of providing you with the relevant information, so that you can -- you can see this, the nature of this impact. So we will find a way and we'll come back to you on the practical sort of way of doing that going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just take a question from the Internet and then Iain afterwards. It's from Anne Gj&#xF8;en at Handelsbanken in Norway. Has StatoilHydro considered or is it possible to report in US dollars with all subsidiaries in the same currency as functional currency and also tax and dividend payments in US dollars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. First of all, as I said in my presentation, when it comes to which functional currencies you actually are using that is depending on the underlying operations, what kind of activities that's exactly involved. So we cannot decide on that, then we would have to change the legal structure once more or move the business to put it that way. Obviously, we -- the issue of reporting in US dollar, that is something which we have discussed from time to time. But we still have -- that wouldn't -- in the short version, that wouldn't have resolved this issue, because that has to do with tax on the basis for tax calculation. So the only way to resolve this issue is actually to be allowed to pay taxes in the functional currency, and that's still an issue which we have discussed it with the tax authorities on a couple of occasions, but still sort of the -- this is the situation that we have to relate to a Norwegian kroner tax calculation, tax payment and take that into the accounts. And this currency impact would not have been included -- it's missing in the parent company and we wouldn't be -- and sort of there is no way of taking that into the Group reporting as long as it's missing there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Iain Reid. It's not working <mark type="inaudible" /> switched off the microphone <mark type="inaudible" />. Just get the other one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yes, Iain Reid from Macquarie. Two things, Eldar. Firstly, unlike most of your peers, you haven't made very much about cost cutting so far this year, certainly not in the &#x2013; in what you reported today. Do you want to say something about your internal targets for this? And what you are seeing in terms of the key parts of the operating and development costs, in particular the kind of the high-end part of the contracting cost, particularly things like deepwater rigs et cetera? And the second thing is, I noticed a couple of weeks ago there was quite a lot of upset about Shah Deniz in terms of what looked like a fairly significant delay to first production of Phase II. Can you say what's going on there? There has been various comments about the difficulty with them getting transportation agreed with the Turks et cetera. Is it all that or is there other issues going on? And where do you see the volumes actually likely to end up now? Are they going to come to Western Europe or are they going to go north into the Russian system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first on the cost side, I can assure that there is extensive cost cutting going on in the company. We guided on an exploration cost of 2.7 billion, which is significantly down compared to the previous year. The 13.5 billion of CapEx is down. Then we also underline that there is limited flexibility in the short term on the CapEx side. On the operational cost, the targets that we have presented to you, they include a significant portion of cost cutting. And on &#x2013; in addition to that, we also launched a 1.5 billion program on top of the merger synergies that we have communicated earlier. And then I should also mention that we are in the process of actually completing the merger synergies where the cost component is a significant part of that. So I will say there is, in all parts of our business, an extensive cost cutting going on.</p>
          <p>When it comes to what we are doing, this has a lot do with external costs, which is the biggest cost component coming into our cost base. And we are addressing this, I will say quite aggressively in terms of development costs, rig costs. We have &#x2013; we are renegotiating contracts whenever that is possible. We are delaying tenders, contract processes that is sort of in the process. We have started to &#x2013; on a new start and to make sure that the bids are really reflecting the current environment. We have dialogue with all our suppliers. Prime contracts are being addressed aggressively. So I would say we use all kind of, sort of tools at our hand to make sure that the cost base which goes into our CapEx and exploration is actually coming into this base and talking this through with all our suppliers. So we see some signs of this actually happening now in various ways depending on which kind of supplies you are talking about.</p>
          <p>To the Shah Deniz I will say the &#x2013; I will not comment on any delays. I will say the timing of this is very much related to the sort of the extent that we are able to resolve the issues on export and the transit issues. So, and in terms of where this gas might be heading, I think my only comment is that we are &#x2013; the most important thing for us is actually to get the highest possible value out of this gas and that leaves sort of many options into this &#x2013; into the opportunities. So beyond this I have no further specific comment as to timing and what we believe is realistic now. It's, say the most sort of x factor in this is really the export solutions that &#x2013; so we can achieve and the timing of when they are sort of resolved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just take a couple of questions from the Internet and then James afterwards. So there are a number of questions on tax actually and Geoffroy Stern from Cheuvreux and Jason Kenney from ING and Gordon Gray from Collins Stewart and Nitin Sharma from Cazenove, all have their questions on tax. So we start with the first one. Could you please give us guidance for the reported tax rate in 2009, if oil price was to average $50 a barrel and assuming stable US dollar, Norwegian kroner versus first quarter '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the tax rate -- the big sort of component that we have talked about this quarter, if you take away that factor, we are still talking about the tax rates in the range of 70% for the Group as a whole. It will depend on a lot of factors. Oil prices is one of them. The allocation of revenues between the international part and the Norwegian Continental Shelf results for earnings from trading activities, both from the oil and gas side. So it's a lot of components going into this. But a typical sort of tax rate, excluding these kind of currency impacts would be in the range of 70%. But as I said, we will see significant volatility in the way it's reported on the net income before tax going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as a follow-up question on that from Nitin Sharma at Cazenove, can you explain the very high tax rate of above 90% in the NG segment, Natural Gas segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it is still not 90%, but it's a high tax rate, so maybe you, K&#xE5;re, would comment on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; tax rate, according to my memory it's approximately 80%, and that's -- the main part of the taxed income is from the Norwegian Continental Shelf. So that takes it up to the marginal tax of 78% and then you get some adjustments, which makes it -- for this quarter, 80%.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, there are also some adjustments from previous quarters, which takes us a little bit higher than it typically would be.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, James Hubbard from Morgan Stanley, just two questions. International, of higher production and obviously substantially lower pricing environment, the result was much lower than Q1 last year. But was there anything holding that result back, is there some issues in there that we should think about forecasting that number going forward? Or was it purely just a pricing effect that drove the figure down to a clean figure of 300 million EBIT. And then secondly, Gulf of Mexico impairments, could you say which assets these impairments are related to and whether it was purely because of the low US gas price or is there a reservoir/geologic issue going on here that's causing another impairment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I would say in terms of the international, it's really two components, which is explaining all of this. It has to do with the -- with oil price and the cost increase, which is related to currency. If you adjusted for this, you would get in -- on the cost side actually to approximately the same level as you saw in the same quarter last year. So, it kind of be explained actually by these two &#x2013; obviously a lot of components, but these are really the two components explaining it.</p>
          <p>When it comes the impairments, it's -- I think we have the situation that once you -- you start to impair an asset, you are in the elevator to put it that way. And simply you have to accept what markets and other kind of evaluations where they take you. So I'm -- unfortunately I'm not in a position to sort of be specific as to which asset -- I don't think that would be good for the assets or for the -- from a commercial aspect. But what I can say is that it is -- it's a combination. It's mainly assets, which is categorized as exploration assets yet. It's a combination of oil price -- prices and also geological reserve issues related to this. But what I can't say this is -- we have developed a quite significant portfolio in Gulf of Mexico. And what happens here is that we do not write up to a higher level where that was sort of the historic cost for any assets. So you get into the elevator, but the maximum is still sort of the historic cost in the accounts. And if you were allowed to sort of put the real value and market value on these assets and the portfolios into our accounts, I think you would have seen a significant higher value than what sort of -- can be sort of interpreted from the way the accounts is presented.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can I ask a question on gas pricing? What percentage of your volumes are sold on spot versus contracts in the summer months versus in the winter months in a normal year for weather, and how did that differ in the first quarter of this year and therefore how did that effect your realizations overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, we tend to say approximately 90% of our portfolio is long-term contracts, and approximately 10% &#x2013; it might vary, is short-term. And then, as I indicated, in this situation, in my presentation that there are downward pressure on volumes -- on prices in the current environment, and that might have an impact on sort of the short-term part, on the liquid part of the volumes. So typically, I would say it's value driven and I would not be sort of prepared to give any percentages, because then I would sort of go a little bit too far in relation to our actually being an active trader in the market. But typical average, year-round talking about that kind of sort of 10% in that range and it would be value driven sort of what kind of volumes that we are sort of taking into the liquid part of the market at anytime, whether it's winter or summer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say &#x2013; sorry -- 10% is value driven, so that 10% of your gas sale is by value not by volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the long-term contracts it's really take or pay contracts, so the customer decides which volumes they want to take. There are limitations, within those limitations the customer decides. So the customer is obviously -- if the customer takes lower volumes, there will be more volumes available for us to sell into the short-term market. But that goes into the same type of considerations that I've just talked about in terms of, sort of being value driven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the 90:10 you'd be taking a mid-point of your take or pay volume number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's &#x2013; yeah, in that range. So typically, now you're in the 90 plus, minus take &#x2013; percentage that is taken and that has been sort of range that you typically have seen. But it could vary.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have to admit that didn't &#x2013; what is &#x2013; the only thing which is not included in the accounts, there are minor things which could be included in the tax calculations and not in the account. But the main component here is the currency impact coming from these US dollar subsidiaries. So it's the currency, which is now into the tax calculation, and beyond that there are no major issues that I can recall which is big.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There is UBS again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jon Rigby from UBS. A couple of things. I do have question on tax, I am afraid. The first one was on gas. As I understand it the way your contracts are structured and there is clearly -- your buyers have flexibility around an annual contract quantity. And presumably given it was a cold wind from Gazprom offtake -- Gazprom supply was down, you're pretty high up in your sort of pro rated ACQ for the year. So what is the downside risk do you think, as you model a recession through Europe on you contract gas for the rest of the year, don't need to be precise, but some kind of percentage would be quite useful? Second is on this whole FX and tax issue. If it's -- on a consolidation adjustment essentially, can't you do with that through reserves as opposed to profit and loss account? And if it is a timing difference, can't you deal with that through deferred tax since it can come back forward and therefore get the profit and loss and the tax related to that profit and loss more inline on an ongoing basis? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe K&#xE5;re will reflect on the last one. When it comes to the gas business, I think as I said we have &#x2013; offtake has been quite high, which is typically are in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the year and had been so also in this quarter. And typically, the customers will take lower volumes in the second quarter and the third quarter this year like in any year for seasonal temperature reasons and so on. I think the flexibility and the downside to this, obviously gas prices in the long-term contracts they will be adjusted according to the oil -- the oil prices three to six months ahead of that. So, the customers, I guess, they will behave accordingly. There are some sort of transparency in terms of what the prices will be in the long-term contracts going forward. So they will behave sort of according to some of their needs and the expected developments in the gas prices according to these contracts. So again, that leaves sort of flexibility in our treading activities and I don't think I can sort of add any further comments to that except for that we will focus on value and obviously also look into the future and see what kind of gas prices the market is offering for the future and whether it make sense sort of due to the time arbitrage in this context. But to the extent sort of that is actually going to happen I have no further comments except that we do see this pressure that sort of creates, at least that kind of reflections and business judgment that we have to do in this environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second part of the question is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have certainly evaluated all possible alternatives to that treatment which we have landed on, the treatment, which we have landed on is what we view the correct treatment according to the IFRS accounting principles. I think to understand it you might just say that the parent company is a US dollar based company. The US dollar based company have a liability to pay taxes in Norwegian kroner. US dollar has weakened against Norwegian kroner, therefore the US dollar company have to pay more U.S. dollar for the same Norwegian kroner tax amount, and it comes as a tax cost in the U.S. dollar-based company. That's from the U.S. dollar company's perspective, that's where you get the discrepancy. And to such effects, sometimes it's allowed to take it through the comprehensive income that means it doesn't go through the P&amp;L, but straight to the equity, this is not possible here. It's a cost for the U.S. dollar company and they have, as I said, they need more U.S. dollar to pay that liability in Norwegian kroners. And then when you consolidate the Group then I think the questions you raise is reasonable, but the answer is no, we can't do it. We have to look at it from the parent company, at the single company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have a couple of questions from the Internet on natural gas result. First is from Oswald Clint from Sanford Bernstein. Can we assume from the strong natural gas trading result that were unique opportunities during the first quarter, perhaps related to the Ukraine, which the company was able to benefit from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The trading results, as we call it, might give us sort of -- made the wrong association because this is not speculative paper-based trading at all. It's really based on physical positions. It's based on arbitrage, moving volumes between sort of, in different geographies. There are also some bets on the price cuts. We took some fixed price position a couple of years ago. They are now being realized so it's not derivatives anymore. It's realization of those.</p>
          <p>So that's the main components which goes into this. I would say in &#x2013; I said we have a flexible infrastructure, flexible gas business, also flexible fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, mainly the Troll and the Veslefrikk fields in Norway, and that's give us an opportunity to, sort of &#x2013; to create these kind of values, but to give any kind of guidance as to sort of, whether this was an extreme opportunity or not. I am not prepared to do that.</p>
          <p>But what I can say basically, what -- the profits that we have made in this quarter and we also made good profits in the previous quarter that is not due to the Ukraine situation. There is nothing to do with that at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's a question, a little bit related to this from Jason Kenney at ING. I note that the high gas sales realization of NOK2.54 per standard cubic meter. The realized price is down only 15% from fourth quarter '08 and it's up from third quarter '08. What's the expectation for the second quarter and what's the average lag to the gas price contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the average lag is three to six months and it varies from contracts to contract. Then included in this &#x2013; this is an average gas price &#x2013; so included in this, we also have the resource of the trading activities that we are &#x2013; that I just talked about. They're also included in this average gas price of 2.54.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then the &#x2013; another question on gas from Hootan Yazhari at Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. To what degree are you seeing impacts from lower gas demand in Europe? Does this pose a risk to your 1.95 million barrels a day production guidance for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that is a component that I talked about in connection with the production guidance. We say we are still on track to meet our production target. But it is &#x2013; it is an additional risk to the target. We will always give priority to values before the target. And to the extent we do that, with a negative impact on volumes, that could &#x2013; that increases the risk in relation to the target as such. But just to repeat, we are on track. As you see today, we are on track to meet this. But there is uncertainty, which is bigger than we typically see due to the downward pressure that I just mentioned on the gas business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then we move to a question on CapEx from Aymeric de Villaret at Societe Generale in Paris. CapEx guidance for 2009 is at $13.5 billion. Can you tell us at which exchange rate this guidance is made?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, first, that this guidance is based on the assumption and the fact that most of our CapEx is actually coming from U.S. dollar. As for the exploration cost and the guidance that we gave on exploration, I would say on exploration even more, almost 100% of the cost base is actually coming from U.S. dollar. So what kind of exchange rate we're using doesn't matter anyway. And I would say it's such a big component regarding the CapEx guidance as well, that we haven't sort of put a lot of emphasis to normalize or make any sort of complex mechanics on the exchange rate assumption as such. It's based on a reasonable assumption in the range of six to NOK 7 per U.S. dollar, in that ratio. And I think we should be able to sort of hold on to the guidance at whatever currency rate we see in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then he's got two follow-up questions here, does it include any acquisitions? So I think I can answer no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Thank you. And then the last question is, can it be lower due to cost cuttings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; there is always &#x2013; I mean, there is a lot of projects in our portfolio and that could all &#x2013; there will &#x2013; there are cost developments, ups and downs from all of these projects. And obviously there are uncertainties also as to the impact of potential cost reductions in the portfolio as such, although we don't see a lot of that kind of impact coming in this year. So, I will say it could be higher. It could be lower, but not a major &#x2013; I wouldn't expect a major sort of risk associated with that number to put it that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then there are a couple of questions on DD&amp;A and impairments. The first one is from Oswald Clint from Bernstein. When can we expect impairments associated with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets to stop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, once you have been &#x2013; you are come into the elevator, we can't stop it in a way. So &#x2013; then you are exposed to this kind of volatility. And then there is sort of value enhancements in this portfolio, which is quite significant, which is not recorded in the account as such. So, obviously I cannot give a time as to when this will stop. It will probably never stop, but sort of we will see some volatility on the assets that we have sort of started to do the impairments on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think you actually answered the next question as well. But we'll take it anyway. Are these impairment related to shallow waters or deep-water assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have no shallow waters. That was divested last year. So it's all deep-water assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then there is a question from Rahim Karim at Barclays Capital. Can you please provide some color around the evolution in DD&amp;A charge in the upstream, in particular in the international business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have seen a development compared to the previous first quarter last year. We have seen an increase in the DD&amp;A. That is mainly &#x2013; there's a couple of components. The biggest one, I've already mentioned, which is actually the currency, that almost explains the whole increase. Then there's also additional volume, so that increases the DD&amp;A.</p>
          <p>And also we have a couple of fields like the Agbami for instance where sort of there is sort of initially very low reserves being booked. And then you have to depreciate the whole asset base based on the very low reserve volumes. So that sort of has an impact. Compared to the previous, the fourth quarter, we see approximately one plus down on the DD&amp;A and that is also currency, mainly. And also the fact that we're also adding risk reserves to the basis for the deprecations, as we actually drill wells, going forward. So that has happened in the first quarter. So I think that is the main comments to the international.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And there's a question about DD&amp;A from Gudmund Isfeldt from DnB NOR in Oslo. Could you please give &#x2013; could you please provide us with some flavor on the depreciation level in the E&amp;P international going forward in absolute terms and in dollar per barrel terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, we should be prepared &#x2013; in fact that there is a lot of new fields coming on stream with not the full bookings of the resource base initially, that will lead to sort of &#x2013; will tend to keep up the certain level of depreciations, going forward. Eventually, resource will be booked, and that will take it down again. But sort of &#x2013; as there are more coming in and this is a growth part of our portfolio, I think that tends to bring &#x2013; sort of keep the depreciations at a certain level.</p>
          <p>But to be honest, I haven't prepared any sort of firm direction of guidance on DD&amp;A. But that is the &#x2013; I think that's the main component. And then obviously, currency, which is a big component, as most of this is U.S. dollar. So how this is translated into Norwegian kroner is obviously also an important component. And finally also production volumes, but that tends to increase going forward in accordance with our guidance for 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's a question from John, here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Just a follow-up. On the cash flow statement and balance sheet, I was a little surprised by the rise in net debt, and it appears to be a fairly big pull on your cash and working capital this quarter, which given the conditions seems a bit curious. So I was just wanting to know, whether there's anything notable in working capital movements this quarter, which is unusual for the quarter and that we should be aware of. Also, I particularly note the change in current financial derivative instruments, which is I think NOK 12 billion. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when it comes to the debt position, I could say that we have raised some debt in &#x2013; during the first quarter. In March we raised approximately US$4 billion in the European market in new debt. Now, lots of that has sort of &#x2013; is still cash by the first quarter. So it's &#x2013; so there hasn't been a significant movement in the net debt position. When it comes to working capital, K&#xE5;re I don't know if you are prepared to give any reply to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're pointing at derivatives and there is some 11 point &#x2013; 11 billion change there and that's the unrealized part of it. So, it's not the non-cash part of it and that, of course, varies. It's not the derivatives as such, also consists of realized and unrealized and this is the unrealized part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As opposed to the non-cash component?</p>

          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe one thing we should state is that there was actually 12 billion that is in short-term investments, which means that all deposits, for example &#x2013; cash deposits that are tied more than three months are classified as a short-term investment as well. And investments in bonds and certificates and so on, which are actually liquid assets, but they are classified as short-term investments.</p>

          <p>Just a very quick question back to this tax issue. In future presentations, are you going to include on &#x2013; perhaps near the slide that gives away other one-off adjustments.

          <p>Yes, obviously, we will have to find one way or another of both communicated when we get to the actual numbers, but also to guide you ahead of that, because there is no way you can see those.

          <p>And there's a short question on tax again from Neill Morton at MF Global. In the cash flow statement taxes paid are normally very low in the first quarter, can you please explain why this was not the case in the first quarter this year? Is it an early payment or is it a late payment from a prior period? And it's basically because we've changed the tax payment structure that was changed from August last year and we now pay taxes every second months, whereas earlier we paid taxes twice a year.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have a couple of questions on OpEx from Teodor Sveen Nilsen at Argo Securities and from Neill Morton as well. The OpEx per barrel in the E&amp;P Norway division declined significantly this quarter. What are the major drivers for this decline and how do you expect the OpEx per barrel on the NCS to develop over the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think when it comes to the OpEx, as reported there are certain items, which is included in there like the gas injection costs and also some reversal of repay &#x2013; some of the partners on the Norwegian Continental Shelf in the fourth quarter last year actually paid back some of the costs, the restructuring costs, related to the merger. So there are some special items, which we adjust for when we report the total corporate NOK 34.1 per barrel production cost. So I think if you adjust for this, it's still a good development, but it's actually an increase. So we have seen an increase compared to the previous quarter. And that can mainly be explained by sort of the activity level and also the fact that there is sort of still a cost inflation component getting into the numbers on the operational side. We haven't been able to sort of take the cost curve down because it takes time to sort of renegotiate contracts and get lower cost base into the operating cost. But as I said, high activity level and high maintenance activities, that's something we should expect also this summer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a short question from John Olaisen from Carnegie in Oslo. What do you see as your most important high-impact exploration wells this summer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, say in the &#x2013; on the Norwegian Continental Shelf we are drilling around 30 to 35 wells this year. We have our high activity level so far. We have done quite a lot of discoveries, so we mention maybe the most significant one is the Asterix discoveries in the Norwegian Sea so far. We will drill more wells and some of these are &#x2013; depends on how you define high impact, but at least they are more than sort of a small potential. So I would say, in particular in the Central Graben area in the North Sea we have a couple of interesting wells and also in the Voring Basin in the Norwegian Sea, there is also a couple of interesting wells being drilled for this summer and during the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John Olaisen has got another question on production. The net entitlement in percent of the equity production was at its highest level since 2007. What's the main reason for that, and how should we expect this ratio to develop going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the PSA effects that we saw this quarter at around 140,000 barrels per day is more or less exactly in line with the guidance that we gave at the Capital Markets Day. So assuming US$50 per barrel oil price this is the kind of level that we should expect to see for this year. So it's exactly as guided. It's slightly lower compared to what it has been. That has to do with the level of the oil prices, it has also to do with the fact that some new field is coming in with cost recovery initially and also that some of the old fields is actually moving into decline phase. So the equity is getting done. So the difference between equity entitlement is getting smaller. So &#x2013; and then there's a big portfolio, so there is large sort of various types of contracts into this. And &#x2013; but these are the main components. I would just repeat the guidance that we gave at the Capital Markets Day, and I think that is still a valid guidance going into 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Iain has a question here, from the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Eldar, in manufacturing and marketing, you said I think that most of the increase we saw from last year was in trading, so can we take it that the increase which we saw there was due to the first quarter Contango effect and it's not likely to reoccur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; you're right. This has a lot to do with the Contango effects that we have been able to benefit from. We have sort of possibilities to keep physical volumes out there in the sea and in various locations. And we have benefited from that. So this is physical Contango play, and we've made sort of values from that. So I would say, in another environment we could see different types of results. But I think historically we have seen some volatility on the oil trading results, so this &#x2013; I would say, this quarter tends to be maybe on the higher side at least compared to what you typically have seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, one follow-up. Over the last few quarters you talked about the NGL market in particular being rather weak relative to Brent and it depressed your average realized liquids price. Has there been some recovery in that in terms of the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, relatively speaking there has been some recovery. So the impacts, relatively speaking is &#x2013; the impact is there. But it's &#x2013; and it's still sort of close to 50% of the NCS volumes, of the liquids volume, is related to NGL. So the NGL price is an important part of the average liquid price for us. But relatively speaking, at this kind of oil price levels there isn't such a spread that it was at higher levels &#x2013; down to the NGL prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a question from Hootan Yazhari at Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, which I think we partly have answered, but we'll just take it one more time. Your debt and cash levels increased sharply in the first quarter of '09. That was John's question as well. Why have you raised debt, given the strong balance sheet? Is it indicative of further acquisitions in the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just mentioned that we actually on the 1st of April, we had paid a lot of taxes as well, so we payed taxes six times a year, and in the second quarter we actually paid taxes, two terms of taxes and we paid one in the first quarter. And then we're also getting into a significant dividend payment in the second quarter. So I think you have to take these into account also, if &#x2013; when you look sort of specifically at the cash position as it was by the end of the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We're moving to U.S. and U.S. gas prices, we've got a couple of questions on the Marcellus Shale gas from Oswald Clint and from Hootan Yazhari. The first question is since operational regularity is instrumental to meeting your production forecast, can you talk about progress at the Marcellus Shale assets and what sort of flow rates per well are you seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in terms of sort of the activities and so on, I think we are involved now in around 25 wells, partly horizontal and partly vertical wells. There are some 10, 11 drill rigs which is now operating in this environment and we expect that to increase to around 20 rigs by the &#x2013; by the end of this year. And that is actually slightly higher than we expected at the time we did the acquisition. When it comes to sort of the performance of the wells, each well is very individual, so I could just give sort of an average type of statement that they are at least performing at least as good as we expected at the time we made the acquisition. So hope you're pleased with that comment. Directionally it's positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's more follow-up question from Hootan on that. Has the development of the Marcellus acquisition from Chesapeake been delayed and at what U.S. gas price do you see these assets being profitable now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all we &#x2013; I mentioned about the activity level and we already should be at least in terms of the activity. When it comes to the oil price, there are many ways of measuring that, but obviously we see gas price &#x2013; excuse me. We see an environment now, which is &#x2013; still makes sense for us to sort of do the drilling activities. It's cheaper than it used to be and remember the location of these assets is also very attractive compared to the marsh side and the markets. So we still find it &#x2013; now justify to do continue with the drilling activities. It's still at a very low level and for us it's important to actually to drill wells and increase the capacity as we expect gas prices to increase going forward. And we want to be able to benefit from that situation.</p>

          <p>Couple of questions from the Internet again. Helge Andr&#xE9; Martinsen from Nordea Markets in Oslo. Do you see any negative effect of the OPEC production cuts, do you see them increasing from the level seen in the first quarter '09?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mentioned 13,000 barrels per day, which is the average impact in the first quarter production and based on what we have heard and noted so far, we expect this impact to increase somewhat going forward. But to be more specific about that I think that is &#x2013; I've got sort of sufficient relevant information to do that, but the direction again is an increase compared to the current level.</p>

          <p>I think the &#x2013; it's &#x2013; there is a component of that included in the numbers, but it's not a very significant component. It's included in the &#x2013; so I haven't got an exact number, but it's not a very significant component of the resource earnings from the oil trading business. But I haven't got the exact numbers on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, and also the conversion to U.S. dollar as a functional currency reduced that effect, which we have seen previously, so that the trading is now functional currency, U.S. dollar trading in the parent company. So it's just commerce or storage in other than the parent company, which have a currency impact. So that's very much reduced. I think it's in the level of a couple of hundred million.</p>
