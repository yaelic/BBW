        <plist>
          <p>Great, Trevor. Good morning, everybody. Thanks.</p>
          <p>This year we outlined two important catalysts for GE, double digit earnings growth for industrial and a dividend from GE Capital pending Fed review.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter our industrial businesses achieved a 10% earnings growth and GE Capital is exceeding our expectations, so we really had a good quarter. Externally global markets are improving but volatility remains. Infrastructure demand is generally healthy and the U.S. is better. We're watching Europe with caution. We had the strongest industrial growth performance since the crisis, 20% orders growth, 11% organic revenue growth, and 16% expansion in growth markets. GE Capital grew by 27% excluding the impact of the Garanti gain.</p>
          <p>Real estate turned positive in the quarter, which is a positive sign for the year. And we ended the quarter with lots of cash and strong cash flow. Our Tier 1 common ratio was 10.4%, a very healthy level, and we remain on track to hit our margin targets for the year. So everything we saw in the first quarter supports double-digit earnings growth.</p>
          <p>Orders were robust off a very high base. Orders growth was broad-based. Equipment was up 29%, service was up 11%, emerging markets grew by 24%, and organic orders growth was up 14%. We're benefiting from several macro themes: global infrastructure investment, healthcare access, gas conversion, and favorable transportation and energy markets.</p>
          <p>Over the last two years we redeployed capital from NBC to oil and gas. This is paying off with a 64% growth in oil and gas orders.</p>
          <p>Orders pricing was positive, which is a great sign for the future. This is the highest first quarter orders in history. It feels like we're outpacing the market and gaining share. And backlog ended at $201 billion, another record.</p>
          <p>As I said, organic revenue growth was up 11% in the quarter, very strong. We had four of five businesses and six of nine growth regions with 10% plus organic growth. China grew by 18%, on track with our expectations. Service growth was 11%, which is up 8% organically.</p>
          <p>And we're doing well in the marketplace. Aviation is winning a lot of campaigns. The GEnx is doing very well. The LEAP-X with applications on the A320neo, 737 Max and C919 is also doing great. The Qantas win is big for our Aviation business.</p>
          <p>We're launching 71 new products in healthcare versus 50 last year. Our energy product line is strong, supporting 39% orders growth. We're launching new products in our acquisitions, which on balance are outperforming their plans. Appliances is beginning to launch its Mission 1 products in 2Q with a new water heater and refrigerator. Our investments in growth are really paying off.</p>
          <p>We have always expected margins to ramp during the year. Healthcare and transportation have already begun to turn.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2012, with had the negative impact of energy backlog pricing, acquisitions and wind volume that moved from the second quarter to the first quarter. However, we see improvements in value gap acquisitions and easing R&amp;D spending as the year progresses, and we will continue to drive productivity and restructuring programs, particularly in Europe.</p>
          <p>Over the past five years, we have seen as much as a 200 basis point margin improvement from the first quarter to the total year, so we see 50 basis points improvement as an important commitment for 2012 and 2013.</p>
          <p>Cash and liquidity remain very strong. Our CFOA grew by 22% in the quarter behind improved earnings and working capital performance. We end the quarter with $84 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We're managing the CFOA growth despite having stronger equipment shipments, and we expect CFOA to be strong for the year.</p>
          <p>Last thing on GE Capital, GE Capital had a very good quarter. Our balance sheet is strong. We have a 10.4% Tier 1 common ratio, up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter 2011; and our non-earnings are down $300 million.</p>
          <p>Our liquidity is safe and sound. Our commercial paper coverage is 2.5 times, and we have $76 billion of cash on the GE Capital balance sheet.</p>
          <p>We're on track for our ENI [Ending Net Investment] goals. We should hit our $425 billion ENI target for 2012. We're reducing red assets like the Irish mortgages, and commercial real estate profitability in the quarter is really quite significant.</p>
          <p>Finally, we're able to originate profitable new business. We feel great about expanding our net interest margins. We're originating new business in excess of a 3% return on investment, and our ongoing net income growing by 27% is a good sign. The business is executing well.</p>
          <p>Now over to Keith for an update on financials.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff.</p>
          <p>I'm going to start with the first quarter summary. As you can see, we had continuing operations revenues of $35.2 billion, and that was reported down 8%.</p>
          <p>This is the last quarter we're going to have to compare to the impact from NBCU. So last year in the first quarter, we owned NBC for one month and we had that revenue, and we had the $3.6 billion pre-tax gain from the sale. So if you adjust for NBC in the first quarter of last year, that would give you a 4% growth on the $35 billion of revenue.</p>
          <p>Industrial sales of $23.7 billion are up 7%. I think a better reflection of our growth is down on the right side of the chart. Without any impact from NBCU, you can see the industrial segment revenues were up 14%.</p>
          <p>GE Capital revenues of $11.4 billion were down 12%. If you look at Q1 last year, we had the Garanti bank sale that was recorded in GE Capital. If you exclude the impact of Garanti last year, GE Capital revenues were down about 7%, in line with the overall asset shrinkage.</p>
          <p>Operating earnings of $3.6 billion were up 1%. Operating earnings per share of $0.34 cents were up 3%. And continuing earnings per share includes the impact of the non-operating pension. And net earnings per share includes the impact of discontinued operations, reflecting the $0.02 charge this year, which I'll cover on the next page.</p>
          <p>Cash of $2.1 billion for the quarter was very strong, as Jeff covered.</p>
          <p>On taxes, the consolidated rate for the first quarter was 16%. That was down slightly from 2011 excluding the impact of the high taxed NBCU gain.</p>
          <p>If you look at the pieces, the GE rate of 23% was one point higher than last year excluding the NBCU impact, and we're forecasting a continuation of that low-20s rate for the rest of the year for GE Industrial.</p>
          <p>The GE Capital rate of 9% is lower than the mid-teens rate that we previously forecast. As the quarter unfolded, we identified additional international tax planning benefits, and they're going to impact the GE Capital rate for the year. So right now our forecast is about a 10% rate for the full year for GECC.</p>
          <p>On the right side are the segment results. Industrial revenues were up 14%, Industrial segment profit was up 10% driven by double-digit growth in transportation and energy and healthcare. GE Capital earnings were reported at flat, however they were up significantly excluding the impact of last year's Garanti gain and I'll show you how that affects GE Capital later at the GE Capital page. So we'll go through each of the segments in more detail in a few &#x2013; page here.</p>
          <p>Before I get to the business results, though, here's the summary of other items from the first quarter. First, we realized a $0.01 after tax gain from the formation of an aviation JV which we recorded that gain at corporate. We completed the JV formation with AVIC for future avionic products, and that resulted in $0.01 after tax. We also had $0.01 after tax of restructuring and other charges in the quarter. The charges primarily related to continued cost structure improvements in energy, healthcare, GE Capital. We also had one-time costs related to the acquisitions and other non-repeat items.</p>
          <p>On the bottom of the page, we entered into an LOI to sell our Irish consumer mortgage assets and the operating platform in Ireland, and as a result of that LOI we recognized a charge this quarter. This is consistent with our strategy of reducing the red assets in the portfolio, and although the final terms have not been negotiated and certainly not announced, we did recognize a loss in discontinued operations of $188 million after tax. And this allows us to exit the most challenged mortgage book that we have, and that's going to be positive as we go forward.</p>
          <p>And then one last item on this page, we thought just to try and clarify the reported results year-over-year, on the top right on the normalized earnings box, it shows you a walk of how we looked at normalized operating EPS adjusting for the gains and the one-time charges last year and this year. So if you look last year, our reported operating EPS was $0.33, but that included $0.01 net benefit from the combination of the NBCU gain, which was partially offset by $0.03 of restructuring. Plus we had $0.03 from the Garanti sale gain last year that was reported in GE Capital. So if you look at last year's first quarter normalized it was $0.29, and this year reported $0.34 with no net impact from the other items. So the normalized operating earnings performance is much stronger than the reported variance.</p>
          <p>I'll go to the businesses, and start with Energy. Overall results were strong. We had revenue growth of 18%. We had double-digit profit growth. And I'll start with the details of the Energy business. We continue to see strong orders growth, as Jeff showed you. Orders of $7.7 billion were up 21%. Equipment orders of $4.1 billion were up 29%. That was driven some by the acquisitions plus 12 points from organic growth. Renewable orders of $1.5 billion were up 59%. We had orders for 696 wind turbines versus 327 in the first quarter last year. Thermal orders of $700 million were down 7%. We had orders for 23 gas turbines versus 27 in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>And overall, energy orders pricing was a positive two-tenths. Equipment orders pricing was down two-tenths, and that was driven by Thermal, which was negative 1%, Wind was negative 1.5% offset by positive equipment pricing and Energy management. And if you look at the combined Thermal, and Power Gen services orders the price impact there was also positive seven-tenths. So orders pricing is definitely abating and it turned in total for the Energy business.</p>
          <p>Service orders of $3.6 billion were up 13%. And revenues in the quarter of $8 billion were up 13%. That was driven by strong volume plus we had about five points of that growth from acquisition, so good organic growth. Equipment revenues of $4.5 billion were up 16%. We had a strong renewables quarter. Revenues of $1.5 billion were up 30%. We shipped 611 wind turbines versus 366 last year. And that was about 200 more than we planned in the quarter. Thermal revenue of $1.8 billion was up 2% as we shipped 35 gas turbines versus 32 last year, and Aero revenue of $560 million was up 68% and Service revenues of $3.5 billion were up 10%. Segment profit of $1.2 billion was up 6%. That was driven by the higher volumes plus some benefit from the acquisitions partially offset by lower pricing from the wind and thermal backlog deliveries.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas, they just continue to experience tremendous growth. Orders of $4.4 billion were up 47%. Even after adjusting for the acquisitions, orders were up 28% organically. Equipment orders of $2.3 billion were up 64%, driven by strong subsea orders in Australia and Angola, and Service orders of $2 billion were up 31% driven by Drilling and Surface Services. The orders price index for oil and gas was up 1%. Revenue of $3.4 billion was up 34%, and that was driven by strong equipment revenues, $1.6 billion was up 26% or 16% organically, and Service revenues of $1.8 billion were up 41% or 20% organically.</p>
          <p>Segment profit of $400 million was up 31% driven by the acquisitions and the core growth. The acquisitions continue to deliver results ahead of our pro formas and the organic segment profit of Oil and Gas was up 12% driven by the strong volume partially offset by higher variable costs on some of their output, so a pretty good quarter over equal in Energy, great to have to them at double digits.</p>
          <p>Next we'll go to Aviation. Aviation team delivered another solid quarter in the first quarter. We took the JV gain out of the segment, so the reported results exclude the gain that was reported in corporate. Orders of $5.6 billion were up 8%. Commercial engine orders of $1.6 billion were up 36% driven by strong orders for GE90, CFM56 and CF6 engines. Military equipment orders of $500 million. They were down 20% driven by a few lower engines but also lower development from the JSF termination. Service orders of $3 billion were up 6%. Commercial services were down 3% driven by lower spare parts. Our first quarter average daily order rate was $23 million which was down 10% as we saw some softness driven by Europe.</p>
          <p>Total orders price index for the business was up 2.1%. Revenue of $4.9 billion was up 12% driven by strong equipment volume. We shipped 583 commercial engines versus 503 last year, up 16% and service revenues were up 3%. Segment profit of $862 million was up 2% as the benefits of that higher volume and positive price were partially offset by higher R&amp;D investments and the impact of higher equipment versus services mix.</p>
          <p>On the right side, transportation had another great quarter. Orders of $1.6 billion were up 67%. Equipment orders of $1 billion were up 131% driven by North American and international locomotive orders. We also saw strong mining vehicle equipment orders. Service orders were up 13% and orders pricing was up 1%. Revenue of $1.3 billion was up 41% driven by the strong volume. We shipped 159 locomotives versus 70 in the first quarter last year and our mining equipment revenue was also up 40% in the quarter. Service revenues of $550 million were up 7% driven by the higher long-term service agreement and parts volume and segment profit of $232 million was up 48% driven by the higher volume and positive pricing.</p>
          <p>Next is Healthcare. Healthcare had a strong first quarter. Good orders &#x2013; orders of $4.4 billion were up 6%. I'll give you some details on the equipment orders, $2.4 billion. They were up 12%. It was driven by strong growth across the board. The U.S. was up 15% on equipment, Latin America was up 33%, China was up 31%, Eastern Europe and the Middle East were up 22%, Asia Pacific was up 11% and Europe was the one soft spot, down 6%. Service orders at $2 billion were flat and total orders price was down 1.4%. Revenue in the quarter of $4.3 billion was up 5% driven by the growth markets which were up 17% in volume. And revenue in the U.S. was up 3% and in Europe it was down 4%. Segment profit of $585 million was up 10% driven by volume and productivity, partially offset by the pricing.</p>
          <p>And on the right side, Home and Business Solutions had another tough quarter but the level of decline has slowed significantly. Revenues of $2.1 billion were up 5% driven by strong pricing. The domestic appliance market was down 10% in units and we gained core share. We also saw volume pressure from lighting in Europe &#x2013; European markets were soft. Overall segment profit of $66 million was down 11% as the benefits of the higher pricing in appliances and lighting were more than offset by inflation and by our investments in the new product programs. We started shipping the hot water heater and will be shipping the bottom mount refrigerator starting in the second quarter so they're making great progress on all their mission one investments.</p>
          <p>And next is GE Capital. Mike Neal and the team delivered another very positive quarter. Revenue of $11.4 billion was reported down 12% however as I said if you exclude the Garanti impact revenue was down 7%. Reported net income was flat but as you can see excluding Garanti it was up 27%. So overall it was another very strong quarter. We ended the quarter with $436 billion of ending investment, already below our original $440 billion target and we're on the way to the $425 billion for the year and our net interest margin was 4.8%, up 38 basis points. There are more details on GE Capital and margins and asset quality in the supplemental deck that we posted this morning.</p>
          <p>If you look over at the right side, you can see the asset quality metrics continue to be good. Delinquencies fell in the mortgage business. They fell in U.S. retail. They were up slightly in real estate and CLL. A big highlight for the team was the commercial real estate delivering positive earnings. This is the first time in over three years and I'll cover real estate in a minute. And we saw good volume at good margins and our other asset quality metrics remain strong.</p>
          <p>So if you go by business, I'll start with consumer. Our consumer results were much better than the reported variance shows. We're comparing here to no repeat of the first quarter 2011 Garanti income. On a normalized basis the first quarter 2012 consumer results were up around 4%. That includes really strong performance in U.S. The U.S. retail business had a great quarter with net income of $641 million, up 18% driven by lower losses and higher margins. Our portfolio is in good shape. U.S. retail delinquency of 4.4% was down 54 basis points from the fourth quarter and it's at the lowest level in nine years which is the only reporting period that we have on this current basis, so just a great asset quality and performance in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Europe had net income of $122 million down year-over-year from Garanti. Our U.K. home lending business earned $57 million in the quarter and we exited our Greek bonds in the quarter. We took a $21 million after tax loss. We have no remaining Greek bond exposure.</p>
          <p>Real estate had positive earnings of $56 million in the quarter; this is a great improvement, as you know, up $414 million from the first quarter of 2011, up $210 million from the fourth quarter of 2011. In the quarter, we had $25 million of after tax credit costs and $30 million of after tax marks and impairments. During the quarter we also sold 103 properties worth about $500 million for a $56 million after tax gain.</p>
          <p>We continue to see strong global liquidity. It's helped improve valuations, and while we're pleased with these results, there will be a European portfolio valuation review in the second quarter, but overall the real estate team has started the year ahead of our expectations, off to a great start.</p>
          <p>Commercial Lending and Leasing business delivered strong results while assets were down 4% and net income of $685 million was up 24% driven by lower credit costs, lower marks and impairments and core income growth. America is the big driver; net income of $542 million was up 18%. Europe net income of $59 million was down 35%, mainly driven by lower assets year-over-year as well as higher provisions in Italy.</p>
          <p>GECAS had a good quarter earnings of $318 million were up 4% driven by higher core margin, partially offset by lower gains. We sold 22 aircraft in the quarter for a gain of $21 million and portfolio quality remains strong. We ended the quarter with one aircraft on the ground out of our portfolio of over 1,500 aircraft.</p>
          <p>Energy Financial Services earnings of $71 million were down 37%. That's driven by $45 million of lower gains. Last year's Q1 results included $50 million from our Caithness wind farm sale. So GE Capital is off to a strong start for 2012.</p>
          <p>And let me turn it back to Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, Keith. Thanks.</p>
          <p>Just to reflect on the 2012 operating framework, we really have no change to the 2012-operating framework. We still see solid double-digit growth in both Industrial and GE Capital. If anything, progress in commercial Real Estate, Energy, and Healthcare make us even more confident. We will continue to restructure to lower our costs. Our CFOA and revenues were better than expectations in the first quarter. The year is progressing the way we thought in December, and again we're confident in our operating framework for the year.</p>
          <p>To summarize, I'd just make several points. Our markets continue to be attractive. Investments have accelerated our organic growth and lead to a strong competitive position. Margin improvements will accelerate through the year. Healthcare and Transportation margin growth has begun. I'm encouraged by the orders pricing trend, and again margins are important for the GE team. The GE Capital is very strong. The turn of commercial real estate is important and makes us feel positive about the balance of 2012. Our cash flow was solid. Our plan is to resume the GE Capital dividend subject to Fed review. And our capital allocation will be balanced and investor-friendly.</p>
          <p>We don't take the environment for granted. We continue to be vigilant in risk management in a volatile world, and we have strong liquidity and we're prepared for a variety of different outcomes. And finally I think we're very well positioned again for double-digit earnings growth in both Industrial and GE Capital.</p>
          <p>So with that, Trevor, let me turn it back over to you and let's take some questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Keith. Chanelle <mark type="ph" />, why don't we turn it over to our questions and we'll go through them.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, Jeff, just to start off, if you could give us a little bit of a sense on how you expect the margin ramp through the year. And I know it may be hard to quantify it exactly, but starting off in a little bit of a hole in Energy Infrastructure to get your 50 bps for the year. How do you kind of see the rest of the year playing out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Scott, I'd first say that the first quarter is typically the low quarter. We have seen expansion over the last five years anywhere from 80 to 200 basis points on the total year. I think what you're going to see in the rest of the year is a positive value gap. You're going to see reduction in R&amp;D spending as a percentage of the total, improved acquisition performance in the run rate, and I would say the impact of restructuring and productivity programs. So I would see as the year goes on Healthcare, Transportation solidly growing margin rates through the year; Aviation, we're expecting Aviation to be up 50 basis points on the year; again, we had some unusually high R&amp;D in Q1.</p>
          <p>And then on Energy, I always break down Energy in the subcomponents. I think service margins will be up. I think oil and gas has a good shot to have positive operating profit leverage on the year. I think equipment margins will be down. And I think in the &#x2013; our gas turbine equipment margins will be down based on what's on the backlog. And I'd say wind is just a wild card given how much volume could actually take place in 2012 just based on the strength of the market.</p>
          <p>So what I would say, Scott, is our costs are on plan, our pricing performance is on plan. We have got lots of activities going to increase margins as the year goes on. And that's kind of how I'd &#x2013; what I don't always control is the amount of revenue that any one individual product is having, but we have tried to build in a little bit of a buffer for negative mix, and that's kind of how I handicap the year. So I would say Aviation up, Transportation up, Healthcare up, Energy can swing anywhere from up slightly to down slightly, and that's kind of the &#x2013; that's kind of the plan for the year. But the execution, the underlying execution, is happening about the way we thought, and the orders pricing and the pricing on new commitments I think bodes well for the rest of 2012 and 2013. So that's the &#x2013; that's the way I would triangulate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And, Jeff, as a follow up, your old business Healthcare, I was &#x2013; I think there was a lot of concerns in the quarter that Europe could really fall apart. And it didn't really. I mean, you're only down 4%. What &#x2013; how do you look at or how do you think about that business for the rest of the year particularly in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, I think it's a great question. I think Europe is &#x2013; we had planned on &#x2013; we had planned on a tough year in Europe in Healthcare, and it's kind of coming in to be about what we had thought. I'd say the U.S. activity is a little bit better than we had thought. And then there is places we don't talk a lot about like Japan where the healthcare market is very strong both on a relative basis compared to last year and also in total. So I saw probably &#x2013; we probably saw higher orders activity in Q1 than we expected, and I would say in general, not just in healthcare in Europe, but in general it's kind of hanging in there per our expectations.</p>

          <p>Scott, one interesting point about Europe for Healthcare is that Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K., and the Nordic had pretty good orders performance, and southern Europe is in a lot tougher shape.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry if you already answered this, but the down &#x2013; I guess on the gas turbine order side, first of all I think you said it was down from last year. But also the price there was only down a percent, I think is what you said. How do we think about that trajectory on both those dynamic &#x2013; on both those data points throughout the course of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all on the volume side, we have said that we expect to deliver about 137 gas turbines this year, so that will be up. There's no change to that outlook. We're seeing some good discussions globally for equipment volume, and so I think from a volume perspective we have a pretty good outlook and consistent with our framework.</p>
          <p>From our pricing, this is really encouraging. I would say if you look at thermal, last year it was down 6% in first quarter, 10% in the second quarter, 7.5%, 12.5% in the fourth quarter. So to go to 1.1% down and to be positive including the service business, I think that shows that we have been saying that the discussions around commitments on gas turbines have been healthy, that pricing was stabilizing, and so it's the start of a turn for us, and I'm reasonably encouraged by it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's nothing unusual? You think you can get to &#x2013; if it's down 1 today and the environment is still getting better, you think you can get to positive at some point this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have said I think down in the analyst meeting, we talked about by the end of the year showing this thing go positive, and we're hoping that that can be what happens with us. We've got pretty good discussions going on commercially with customers. There's still an overhang of supply versus demand. But globally there's order activity. We're going to have a good volume growth this year, and this first quarter is indicative of where pricing is in the commitment world and where it's going, we think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think commitments are positive, Steve. That's usually a pretty good indication. And my hunch by this is going to bode well or should bode well for 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about just the gas turbine margins. So I don't see any change to that. And to Keith's point earlier, I think we see a lot of activity on gas turbine demand, let's say, in a lot of different parts of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then just on the GE Capital front, you guys talked about &#x2013; I don't know if that was a change in language, talking about return of capital throughout 2012 as opposed to by the end of 2012. Is there a potential for maybe some more measured return of capital but through several time periods throughout the course of the year? Is that a purposeful change in language, or how do we read that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there is any purposeful change there. Our intent is to have a dividend as a percent of GE Capital's earnings that we pay to the parent. And we are &#x2013; our overall objective is to return excess capital above the capital levels required by the regulatory standards and all the stress tests back to the parent as well. So there's no real change on that. We're working constructively with the regulator. We've got a ton of activity going on with them, and they're working very professionally with us, and so our objective is unchanged, and as soon as we get news, we'll give it to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a little more color on price in gas turbines, if we could. Are all those price &#x2013; order price numbers you're giving year-over-year changes?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>They are. They're not sequential. And then I'm also just wondering, Keith, as you noted, things clearly look like they're getting better, but you're seven, eight, nine quarters of negative price. Has your sales price caught up &#x2013; sales price and revenue caught up with your order price? Can you give us some color on what gas turbine pricing and deliveries was in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We're working through that backlog. Overall sales price in the quarter for the whole company was 0.6 positive on the industrial side. For energy infrastructure it was 0.4 negative. For thermal, it was down 2.5. For renewables, it was down 4. So we are eating through that backlog that we have got, but overall for the company, including the strength in aviation, the strength in transportation, the strength in oil and gas, pretty good on pricing overall. But we're going to work our way through that backlog this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say the other piece of that, Jeff, is the value gap is positive in the quarter, which is a little bit better than plan. So we're seeing a little bit of break on commodity pricing, which is good, and that's I think bodes well for margins in the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on wind, those 200 units in Q1, is that additional units relative to what you expected for the year, or is that just some shift between the quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Q2, we &#x2013; we saw tremendous orders in wind. I think we're going to have a very good year in wind this year. The U.S. market is very robust, as you know. The production tax credits end by the end of the year, and we're taking a really good share in the marketplace, and we're going to have a terrific performance. So they had some additional units versus what we thought in the first quarter, but so far it's from the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Jeff, wind could run hot for the year, I think. It's just we've got a good product. Our market shares are high and there's a ton of activity there right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just first question on GE Capital, just looking I guess at the reserve ratios on page 9 of the supplemental, can you just give a little color about how you were thinking about &#x2013; I guess they've come down to 1.99 sequentially from last quarter to 2.1, so just the steady trend down, the improvement in the environment, how you're thinking about that on the provisioning and reserve basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we continue to see stabilization across on the financing receivables side and with loss provisions and write-offs, stabilization across almost all the portfolios of GE Capital. So I would expect you're going to continue to see a little bit of a decline as we work our way through the write-offs for existing provided losses. But the new provisions that we're laying on today are representative of pretty good run rate, I would say, a very healthy run rate based on a good backdrop. The main change that we have seen is the decline in the marks and the write-offs in the equity book in real estate specifically. So the run rates for new provisions for financing receivables are pretty good rates, and at historically low levels I would say, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we're pretty close to what you expect for a run rate reserve ratio?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the provision for losses, we're going to continue to have the write-offs on prior provided losses that will probably be a little higher than new provisions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on that real estate point you mentioned, I guess you said $0.5 billion for 56 transactions, or I think it was sorry $56 million? Right? Did I hear that correctly for profit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. We had a gain. We sold about $500 million, a little over a hundred properties, $500 million of fair market value for a $56 million after-tax gain.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. So I think you guys covered the whole energy pricing pretty well. Just let me &#x2013; on the aviation side, I know you mentioned you've got higher R&amp;D driving it, but can you provide a little color on that margin degradation? Was it all that? To what extent is pricing a factor there? Are you seeing any degradation in pricing spares, things like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Pricing was pretty good. Overall the margins were down in the quarter of 170 basis points in aviation, positive value gap was a full point. We had positive price, and then we had negative mix basically. We had a lot more equipment revenue than services revenue as we continue to deliver a lot of commercial activity. And then we had about $50 million from higher R&amp;D investment, and as Jeff said, that's going to abate through the year. We're kind of at the run rate, and if you compare to last year, we already had reached that run rate in the second half in aviation. So that won't be a drag going forward that you saw in the first quarter. But pricing continues to be very strong in both spares and equipment in aviation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And that mix, you anticipate continuing to be negative for the rest of the year but no worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're going to ship a lot of equipment. We've got a big backlog and Boeing, and Airbus have increased their run rates, and we've got a good share position. So we're going to ship lot of equipment. But what we'd like to see through the year, as Jeff said, is the spares to grow a little bit as a percent of the total as we go through the year. Spares, as we said, the orders were down a little bit. The shipments were down about 2% in the quarter, and our expectation is that those will grow relative to last year as we go through the year. So that should get a little better as we go through the year for aviation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And given your mix of orders that you're talking about on that, does that mean &#x2013; when I look at that backlog not changing from 2011 year-end to first quarter on that second or third slide, should we expect sort of a stable backlog, or do you expect that to start coming up now a little bit more strongly in the following quarters on equipment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll have to see. I don't really have a forecast of orders versus deliveries on the total &#x2013; I don't really forecast the backlog. We've got good, good global growth. We've got good equipment growth that we've had. As you know, the aviation orders can be a little lumpy. But we've got a tremendous backlog. We're in great shape here. I don't think that's going to be an issue for us as we go through the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I guess on energy, the equipment side, I guess, has been fairly well discussed. In terms of the aftermarket and service in energy, the growth rate on service orders was about the same year-on-year as it was in Q4. If you look at the U.S. market, the electricity produced by gas-powered equipment is up year on year, even though overall electricity demand is down. So I guess are you seeing any kind of effect from that in terms of driving aftermarket business for gas turbines in the U.S., or is it going to be something like nuclear in Japan where there are a lot of hopes that that would spur a nuclear service boom which for some reason, even though there was a nuclear accident, that never actually happened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a pretty good activity in gas turbines in Japan. Look, I think it's all good. When you look at the power plants that are running in the U.S. and the proportion of the power that is being generated from gas and how that's increased, that's a good news item for us. A lot of the outages for these customers are scheduled a year or more in advance, so that's in place. But the fact that these gas turbines are running and they're running more and they're being dispatched at the rates that they're being dispatched is all good, I think it's going to be positive into 2013 and 2014 and beyond. We're not seeing a short-term pickup right now in PGS from that because most of the stuff as we said is scheduled, but this is all good news.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But your service order growth rates in energy theoretically should accelerate from the 6 or 7 recent run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think over time you're going to get the benefit of the dispatching that we're seeing, absolutely, but, again, these are long cycle assets and I think you're going to see that over time. I don't think you're going to see that as an April, May, pickup just because they're dispatching the way they are. I think they're going to run these, they're going to burn a lot of metal parts, and it's going to be good long-term for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And just a follow-up on aviation, some discussion around the mix of OE and service. I guess it was my understanding that GEnx shipments in Q1 were fairly light, and so does that not mean that you have a very steep sequential ramp of GEnx shipments through the year and that's going to weigh on your aviation margins even in subsequent quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if you look at the total year, we're in decent shape. We had a pretty good run rate of GEnx's in the second quarter. In the second quarter we are going to ramp up. We shipped 13 units in the first quarter of 2012. That was about flat to last year. For the second quarter we're going to be up to 25 to 30 units and last year in the second quarter we had four. But when you get to the second half, if we're shipping 25 to 30 units in the third and fourth quarter, that's about the run rate we had last year. So that's why I think that's going to be helpful as you look at the aviation margin impact going into the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>GEnx continues to come down the learning curve, and like Keith said, we had $50 million more in R&amp;D in Q1 versus last year and that normalizes as well. So I'd say aviation is &#x2013; there's always puts and takes with any one of our businesses, but it's about where we thought we'd be.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the sale of the Irish business, what does that tell us about the risk appetite of buyers in the financial world? I can't imagine it was a particularly easy business to sell. Does this raise probability of seeing some further exits on some of these redline assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll see. I think for us, it was just sort of when you do have a chance to take a look at a portfolio that had the dynamics this one had and you get a buyer and we came to the point where you got, we think, a good economic return for shareholders, we'll pursue it. There's not a lot of other parts of the portfolio that are like that. But as you say, as liquidity has come back into the market, this is a particularly challenging one and it was a unique buyer I would say, but there are signs of improved liquidity across a lot of our asset classes, and you see the valuation improvements that we see in real estate. We will pursue opportunities as the bid and the ask gaps close here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what were the operating losses for that business? I'm sure it wasn't $0.02 a quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last year we lost about $150 million after tax.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>

          <p>Yeah, we expected it to improve some this year, but we'll see.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then switching to industrial, again going back to the gas market in the U.S., do you have a sense on where the utilization rates for your turbines are right now, because there's been a 5 point mix shift year-over-year in gas production. And do you think &#x2013; I mean, obviously the service benefit is clear down the road. But with the high utilization, does that spur orders quicker than maybe we might have thought in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean, Nigel, orders for new units?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think just macro, the good news is almost everywhere in the world, people are moving to gas. So the macro is &#x2013; the macro scene is very good. Our products are being use at a higher level. That should bode well for services, not just this year but next. And, again, I think &#x2013; when does the next U.S. heavy equipment order start? You know, it's still hard to tell. But just given growth in electricity and reserve rates and stuff &#x2013; reserve margins and stuff like that, but it will come, and it's going to be gas.</p>

          <p>All roads lead to gas, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's the bottom line I would give you. I would say China; the penetration of gas in China is growing. The penetration of gas in Japan is growing. The penetration of gas everywhere else in the world is growing. So and that we have relatively high market share there, we think every aspect I could give you is encouraging for the long-term. I just &#x2013; I can't predict if it's going to be second quarter or third quarter. But it's coming.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one point on the thermal business that's helpful, we have diversified the business so much today that the thermal contribution from a profit perspective is less than 10% of the total profit on the energy infrastructure business. So the upside is in the front of us here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one more. We have seen Mitsubishi selling a couple of J Series turbines, and I think Siemens has got an H Series last month. What is your strategy with your H-frame turbine? It seems that you talk a lot about the efficiency turbine, but the H Series seems to &#x2013; you know, you don't seem to talk much about that. But what sort of demand do you see out there for your H-frame?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to have a big block in the next few years, and we'll be able to cover all of those areas I think.</p>
          <p>A lot of our customers like the flex. We still think that's a good place to own. But we'll also have a big block.</p>

          <p>I guess listening to all the comment on GE Capital and the lower tax rate, I guess I'm wondering why the operating framework for GE Capital hasn't moved up here. What's holding you back, or what are you still concerned about there, relative to the very strong 1Q and the lower delinquency trends and all the other trends you see out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we have to see how the year plays out. It's a pretty good quarter. I think you're right. We've got some positives. I think tax is a positive. I think commercial real estate is off to a good start. It's a positive.</p>
          <p>I think if you look, we're cautious on Europe. I think so far so good. But we're cautious on it. I think low natural gas prices, we're cautious on that in the energy financial services portfolio.</p>
          <p>But overall, these guys are off to a good start and the outlook and the marketplace is pretty good.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; there's nothing in the first quarter that makes us discouraged about how GE Capital should perform this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Keith, for the good and welfare, any items you want to call out with regards to comps or any other items in the second quarter that we all just ought to be refreshed on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's nothing on 2012 that I'm aware of. I think one thing I mentioned, we're going to have more GEnx shipments, but we mentioned that. That's in aviation. I think if you look at last year's other items page, we'll have to see how we compare to some of those things. There were small gains in aviation that don't repeat and a gain in corporate.</p>
          <p>But there's nothing significant in 2012 that I'm aware of right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I appreciate we're not going to get things nailed down here from you on Fed timing, but I'm wondering if you can explain, it has taken longer than initially expected. That was the &#x2013; the decks were cleared on that point last quarter.</p>
          <p>Since last quarter, has the process proceeded at a similar pace as what you had seen before? Has it been slower? Has it been faster? Any color there at all for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, I'd say it's proceeded at a similar pace. I can tell you that both the GE Capital team and the team from the Fed are working incredibly hard. You have to appreciate how much work the Fed has to go through here to try and learn a business as global and as diverse as GE Capital in the timeframe that they really just started.</p>
          <p>And I think they're working incredibly hard and incredibly professionally, and we are too. And I think the process proceeded in the second &#x2013; in the first quarter the same way it was going at the end of the year, and we continue to make progress together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then maybe just lastly, Jeff, on bolt-on acquisitions, been a little quiet here of late. Can you update us on what's in the pipeline and potential for some smaller bolt-ons here through the course of 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, we may do some smaller bolt-ons, but we get &#x2013; we got a lot on our plate. I really want to get all the energy acquisitions nailed. You know, I just don't want to do a big deal this year. I just &#x2013; again, we never say never, but I just don't want to do a big deal this year.</p>
          <p>I really &#x2013; you know, we've got 11% organic growth, 20% orders growth. We've got &#x2013; we've got game right now. And I think our focus is on good execution and delivering big backlogs. And that's really the focus of the leadership team.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the 11% industrial organic growth, it does fare pretty well against guidance. Would you expect that's a high watermark for the year or maybe just offer some color on how you see backlog flowing through during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My hunch is that we don't have any plans to continue at that rate for the year. I think Chris we said 5% to 10% in the December meeting. I think we're going to be safely in that range.</p>
          <p>You know, again, we just see pretty good &#x2013; big backlogs, big orders, and we're in some pretty good places right now. So I think that's &#x2013; but 11% is high.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then on the second quarter review of European CRE portfolio review, do you have a taste you could offer on the outcomes you might be anticipating? It's in the context of overall valuation improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have to see. We've continued to mark our equity book where we have values that put the cash flows at less than our current book value. So I think we've got a pretty good mark on it today, but you'll have to see how the assumptions play out.</p>
          <p>Overall, we feel pretty good about real estate. I think we're going to be cautious. We'll look. We've got about $8 billion of equity in real estate in Europe so we have to go through the valuation review, take it incredibly seriously. But I think overall, you feel good about the dynamics globally.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Deane.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Deane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, on the Moody's recent recalibration of their methodology for rating finance companies, have you seen any change in your funding costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't really. We've tracked it obviously from the day we were put on notice and the day the action was taken. Our spreads continue to trade relative to banks who are higher rated and banks who are lower rated than us right in line. And over the last ten days, the first couple days, we saw an increase in spreads in line sort of with the market, and then the last ten days, we have seen a compression of the spreads back again.</p>
          <p>I mean, overall, as you know, all the actions that we have taken in GE Capital to strengthen liquidity, lower the short-term funding risk, raised the capital, improve the risk profile of the portfolio &#x2013; I think those have been pretty well recognized by the market.</p>
          <p>And the fact that the Moody's methodology just as a fundamental change in how they feel about FinCos &#x2013; and ultimately they're going to do the same about banks, as you've read a lot about recently &#x2013; I think the market is looking at what is the core business and the underlying strength of the cash flows and the protection for the bondholders of the business.</p>
          <p>And so I think the actions we have taken in GE Capital have been recognized by the market and have helped us to perform through a period where we were downgraded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and we agree. When we looked at how the bonds initially acted at the time of the announcement was &#x2013; it was very minor. It was like maybe between 5 and 10 basis points, and then that seems to have tightened some subsequently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's fair to say that was a non-event.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We agree.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then over on the resumption of the dividend from Capital to the parent, one of the scenarios we were talking about in December was the idea that you could be in the position to make that dividend retroactive going back to January. Is that still a possibility? Or how are you looking at that today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, our objective is to have a dividend of a percentage of GE Capital's earnings that's equivalent to what we pay to our investors on the overall company stock, and it would be for the year. And the timing of the reviews and everything that we have shouldn't change that. But again, we're going to have to wait until we get feedback and information from the Fed on that.</p>
          <p>Our objective hasn't changed. Our objective was to pay a 45% dividend on GE Capital's earnings for the entire year and to return excess capital above the regulatory standards, including the stress cases. And it's something that over several years we feel really good about the excess capital we have in financial services.</p>
          <p>But again, we've got to work through this exercise. And we're doing it constructively and professionally. And as you saw, the results in GE Capital in the first quarter continued to strengthen. So we have to see how that all goes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's the expectation on the stress test? And talk a bit about the preparation that you're going through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do our own stress cases a couple times a year, and we're not publicizing those results. But you can expect that an enterprise like GE Capital would go through exercises similar to what you saw other large financial institutions go through, but we do it in our own way with the Fed sort of uniquely, as opposed to being part and lumped together with the banks.</p>
          <p>So we're doing a lot of work. We have stress cases. We have portfolio reviews. We have reserve reviews. We have all the things that you'd expect a financial institution to have. And just we're doing it one on one with the Fed, and it won't be disclosed.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Shannon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Shannon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'm trying to figure out if we should be expecting ENI to go lower at GE Capital. I mean, the problem with real estate getting so good now is you had real estate turn positive in the quarter. You've got the GE Capital tax rate going down 5 points with industrial staying about where it was. And you had Capital like 50% of earnings.</p>
          <p>I'm trying to figure out how we get &#x2013; it doesn't seem like anything is getting worse at Capital. Everything is getting better. So how do we get that percentage down if we're not sort of doing I guess some larger asset exits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I would always say that the GE Capital's percentage of earnings in the first quarter are always high. And we haven't changed our long-term outlook on where we want the split to be.</p>
          <p>And then I &#x2013; you know, again, we continue to execute on a plan that would get us lower than where we finished the first quarter in ENI. And we see opportunities to do that by exiting red assets. And we still have opportunities there. And that's what I would expect.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, look, our net interest margin is growing. Our returns on new business &#x2013; our ROI on new business was higher in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter. So there's lots of other elements in the business that are good, even as we shrink ENI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a good point. It's one other point on ENI. When you look at the total year, we are continuing to shrink, so that is one of the things that does reduce earning assets and earnings.</p>
          <p>And on tax, I don't think it's a straight 5 points. I think it's a couple of points in the range of what we had as mid-teens to around 10. And there's a lot of uncertainty of that, as you know when you get to the end of the year. So that obviously is another item that could move as you go into the end of 2012 and into 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, I understand the point on the seasonality with some industrial stuff stronger later in the year. But in terms of the ENI, does 425 still feel like the right number, or &#x2013; sorry, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shannon, again, I think that's kind of &#x2013; again, these are big numbers. They're always hard to predict to a single point. My preference and the way we're trying to run the place is to get to 425 by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the capital allocation, can you just fill out, I guess, this investor-friendly comment a little bit, in terms of when you do &#x2013; or assuming you do and when you do get the dividend back from Capital, I mean, is buyback still sort of the priority use? How should we &#x2013; maybe just frame some thoughts around how you think about ramping that, once you get the green light.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, this is something that we'll go through with the board when that takes place. But I would say we love growing the dividend in line with earnings. We think that's great. We do &#x2013; we might do a few small bolt-on acquisitions in businesses we're already in. And if we get &#x2013; if we get the opportunity, we'd still like to do buyback. So I think there will be some mixture, but we certainly &#x2013; we certainly think buybacks are attractive to our investors, and that's what it means to be investor friendly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So sort of balanced &#x2013; buyback, acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I hate to predict anything. But I think we believe that buybacks are investor friendly. But I always go back to dividends, small bolt-on acquisitions, and buybacks. We'll pull all three levers, I think, as we have surplus cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Jason Feldman. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First, Jeff, I think you mentioned earlier when discussing orders that you thought you were gaining share in certain markets and were feeling pretty good about that. Can you elaborate on where you see the most substantial market share gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We never know those numbers kind of ahead of time, so each industry has its own cadence. It's just &#x2013; it's a high level versus what anybody would predict for the industries we're in. So I think we need to kind of see NEMA data and other stuff as we go through the close of the quarter and get a chance to look at some of our competitors' results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, can you give us an update on the 737 Max program and the engine development and how it's going there? I think there have been some concerns about how that was going, given the size constraints on the 737. Whether you'd be able to have an engine that was competitive enough with the A320neo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we like where we are. We see some additional fuel-burn opportunities that we want to execute on. I just was reviewing the program a couple weeks ago out in Cincinnati. I think we have been able to take a lot of technology off the GEnx and put it into LEAP.</p>
          <p>And I'd say if you sat back and said you've got the 737 Max, you've got the C919, and our share of the A320neo is probably greater than 50%, we like how the engine is positioned. And so we feel pretty good about both the technology and the commercial process on that particular &#x2013; on the narrow body space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of <mark type="ph" /> Brian Lambert, Lambert &amp; Company (1:00:00).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. Talk about energy and healthcare. First on energy, great news on the pricing. It almost defies logic, not in terms of direction and what we're looking for, being bullish on your stock, but just how quickly.</p>
          <p>How much of this is customers &#x2013; and talk a little bit by region, going, hey, we do need this capacity. We may have to back off a little bit to get a deal signed. And how much of this, if any, is your teams being a little bit more selective and saying there's just some business that maybe we let somebody else win? And I have a brief question on healthcare.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I don't think &#x2013; we're trying to compete globally everywhere, Brian. And we're &#x2013; we've got good strong competitors, especially in that thermal space, and we've got a great product in the Flex 50, we've got a great product in our heavy duty gas turbine product line, and so we're &#x2013; I don't think anybody is backing off anywhere. I think we're competing globally. I think one of the things that you may see relative to the historic trend is you ended up with some higher-priced capacity that's had price erosion over the last 12 to 18 months, and now we're getting to kind of a market clearing price level. So it's not so much either walking away or supply and demand that has tightened dramatically. I think you've really just had the pricing get to a level where it's probably more realistic for the main competitors in the marketplace based on the demand we see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope that helps a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does. It sounds a little bit like the new normal. Then on the healthcare side, certainly some decent performance there, especially with all the noise that's going on. Have you observed &#x2013; or your team there observed any kind of a change in texture as the healthcare reform is going to the Supreme Court arguments? Anything you guys saw blip-wise up or down in terms of marginal propensity to buy the quarter or your conversations now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really none. Again, I think the U.S. seems to have normalized. My hunch is the market is probably single digit, low single digit up. That would be my expectation. And, Brian, we really didn't see any change after the Supreme Court or anything like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very strong orders on the equipment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Orders on equipment were really strong in the U.S., as we said, up 15. And that says that there's good technology, and customers have capital, and they need to continue to improve their capability. And so I think overall it was a very encouraging quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that plus 15 was a fairly steady plus 15?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Sorry, I don't know if the question was answered, but I just wanted to get a little more info on this utilities continue to come out and talk about the high utilization of their plants from a gas perspective. How does that translate over the next 12 to 18 months from a services perspective? Because it's kind of unclear to me, you know, there's a lot of moving parts with which plants are being used, the starts and stops, whether that's more profitable for your services business. Maybe you can just give a little bit of color on how that actually impacts the services business at energy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say, Steve, is if you look &#x2013; if you look over, let's say, 18 months and as this performance continues, this should be good for our energy Power Gen services business. Because again, they run them higher, they're going to consume more parts, things like that. Now, this all gets balanced between who has got shutdowns, when are the shutdowns, where are they on a CSA. There's a whole bunch of &#x2013; there's like ten other Xs that are in that equation. But the macro point is positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's why &#x2013; I don't think we're trying to be vague. It's just hard to call a quarter. But the macro trend is good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it something that can add instead of it growing 5% just on install base, could it add a couple percentage points to that growth rate? I mean, is it something that meaningful, or is it all kind of blend in and kind of support the kind of mid-single digit services growth rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what it could do is over time add to the growth rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, again, I do believe that, so I just think it's just hard to &#x2013; it's hard to predict exactly when.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's certainly not going to hurt the growth rate?</p>
