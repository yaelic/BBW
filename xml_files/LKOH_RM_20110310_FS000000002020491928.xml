        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, dear ladies and gentlemen. I'm very happy to greet you at this traditional meeting. I will try to give you a very full detailed information about our project and our operation in the year 2010 as well as our vision, general view of our vision for the year 2011. If you look at the slide number one, you will see that mostly is &#x2013; these are main indicators of our economical operations.</p>
          <p>The year 2010, it was for us &#x2013; it was a very successful year and the company was able to withstand all of those applications that it took up on itself in the beginning of the year, in regards of investment project. As well as obtaining, the new flow, financial flow as well as accomplishment of an &#x2013; of a group of projects obtained. And as our speaker has noticed Andrei, Mr. Fedun will give you a more detailed information about these indicators.</p>
          <p>I will concentrate on those events that took place within the company and I will tell you about them in a great detail. A very important project in the year 2010 and we entered a practical state of realization in Western Africa and we are &#x2013; finalized all the legal aspects of this project with our partners.</p>
          <p>And we basically entered a phase of bringing this project alive and it will continue in the year 2011 and I'll give you more details about our plan for 2011. And basically in 2010, we have started a practical realization of this project, a point &#x2013; residential point for our employees, our subcontractors have been built on those oil fields. And the unique catalytic cracking project has been installed in the beginning of the year 2011, has allowed to produce an additional 1 million of tons of catalytic cracking. And it has allowed us to increase our production of Euro-5 by almost 0.5 million tons and there is <mark type="inaudible" /> competitor's market and our product is &#x2013; seized respect. And by the way by <mark type="inaudible" /> or by 10%, it's installed compared to our colleagues from Gazprom Oil and other companies. And also, their utilization of this product has been conducted very actively in Russian market.</p>
          <p>We also created a corporate research center. Four <mark type="inaudible" /> institutes have been &#x2013; and they have been united and they became of a comprehensive united center. And the principle of operation of this center is to work with our colleagues. We have started ConocoPhillips engineering center Axon Neuron entity is a big reorganization of research and scientific resources.</p>
          <p>From the institutes that are under this united system that will optimize our cost expenditures as well as concentrate our decisions as well as adopting innovations of new oil fields that have been used by the company today. You know that today in Russia, there is a lot of talk about innovations.</p>
          <p>In 2003 we created <mark type="inaudible" /> innovative company and on the basis of that company, we started to adopt a lot of innovative technologies specially exploitation of oil fields, building new hard to recover oil field, and also we &#x2013; we've been united the latest active best deal by the oil &#x2013; heavy oil as well as the tight oil reservoirs. And they are at the stage of scientific and development. It's not only innovations &#x2013; the aspect of engineering, but also exploited new oil fields. And a very &#x2013; another important goal for the year 2010 is completion of the project with the ConocoPhillips and it sold the shares to protect the value of our action, our shares.</p>
          <p>And today our strong belief as the company Lukoil is strong with the investment program and that &#x2013; and if we compare that reduced by shares for $53, the latest stage was $56. Today, the value of our shares shows that investment in shares of our company has been done in a smart way and they have been justified &#x2013; truly justified.</p>
          <p>Going to the year 2011, I would like to talk about directions of the company in terms of its strategic development. Well, first of all of course in October, beginning of November, we will prepare the presentation of our deep analysis for the development of our company for the next 10 years, the package of our project, real projects, real time investments. They have been approved by our &#x2013; back up by our financial authorities.</p>
          <p>In the next, we will show how in the next 10 years, the management of the company and big investors will develop assets of the company Lukoil and the margins of those and that development. I hope that this strategy that has been developed by big group of our specialists. And we will be able to present it to you along with you and you will have critical remarks, comments available complete development of these projects and programs.</p>
          <p>We are active participants of the formation of tax legislation in Russian Federation. As the Chairman of the Committee of Power Committee of our union of industrial specialists and also public organization, I'm a member of trade manufacturing chamber. I'm also a member of committee of power generation in Russian Federation. And also, I have an opportunity to bring the problems and our concerns, that way our investors to convey this information to the first person, governments or representatives of our country.</p>
          <p>There is also law that restricts the access to strategic projects and other projects and our international partners and of course, the &#x2013; investor attractiveness, because of this has been impacted because of that. And so, we're hoping that these concerns or these problems will be corrected in &#x2013; very soon. And the laws that support oil production industry are being made. also the law that freeze some export custom duties. And also the law have been &#x2013; that Northern regions, where we have a lot of huge assets and also, they were at the stage of taking the law where small oil fields, from 7 barrels to 35 barrels to 40 barrels reserves that they will be exempt from a law of taxation from export duties.</p>
          <p>And also today, the law has been activated that viscose &#x2013; viscosity oil and also their oil &#x2013; field. And today, the government is starting to take, to activate those laws that will start to develop hard to recover oil fields. That take a lot of &#x2013; require a lot of innovation. Those assets that we have in our hands are not very significant. Also, we've put a lot of effort especially in the year 2011. We plan on conducting a lot of events and programs that will allow to oil production in our &#x2013; in the Western field. And also the presentation later on &#x2013; in the course of our presentation, we'll talk about this in a greater detail.</p>
          <p>And also the company has made an agreement &#x2013; has signed an agreement &#x2013; to the well in Western Africa. It will allow us to develop and research the well in Western Africa in May. In May, we will begin the first clearing of the well. And we hope that this event will allow all of us to see this unique potential of those resource, of hydrocarbon, that are in Western Africa. And also, we have entered the stage of actual validation of those projects.</p>
          <p>And the year 2011 will be the year when we will develop over this project and that's so, as I have told you, we have developed this residential unit point for where the population would be over 1000 people, and also we're talking about safe city in terms of oil and also, and the all kinds of governmental management been sustained.</p>
          <p>And today the roads are being built and also, standard procedures are being completed, and also the outer oil line and we're hoping that in the first six months of this year in 2012, we'll be able to launch the first production of oil in this unique &#x2013; new unique oil field and it will reach 1.8 million tons of oil. And of course we're continuing building the oil refineries on the territory of Russian Federation. There is a unique installation of &#x2013; the license of ConocoPhillips, which is one of the most innovative and advanced companies.</p>
          <p>And also the aluminum industry &#x2013; box, the product for aluminum industry and the needs of our partners, metal industry, the completion of the construction and complex installation of slowdown <mark type="inaudible" />. And it gives us a really good cost growth in terms of oil, oil refinery and we demonstrated record indicators. Also we're completing the construction of the program of privatization of generating capacity that are located within Russia.</p>
          <p>I would like to say that we are producing 600 megawatts of the most advanced. It's the region of future Olympic Games, where the future Olympic Games will take place. Their stable power generation in the city of Astrakhan, the one that's today is of deficit, the first six months of this year, it will start to work and by 30 &#x2013; they consume 30% less gas than traditional, and also they're ecologically efficient.</p>
          <p>And now, going to more detailed explanation of these questions for 2011, I would like to note, to bring attention to this slide and today, a new corridor of price, price corridor is being formed. It's not just about speculative tendencies. It also has to do with the fact that oil reserves today, the ones that have been implemented or the future ones, they take, they require new invitations and rather serious investments.</p>
          <p>It has to do with deepwater wells. It also has to do with those units that have already been built. Everything takes new innovations, investment decisions. And if we look at the slide, you will see that it shows this full corridor that will allow us to provide a stable delivery of hydrocarbons for a long time.</p>
          <p>Two days ago I held speech in Houston and all of us, the leaders of the companies, we came to the same conclusion that we are responsible for providing to human race that power generation that it needs in the next decade. And our investments in those research developments, they have to provide stable provision for human race, provision of this, delivery of these products. And today the competitors is being pushed back because of our efforts that we put into make &#x2013; deciding resolving those important problems and decisions, innovative and financial potential.</p>
          <p>On this slide the main object are shown that we plan to concentrate our attention on this year gas field, first one the first two quarters of this year, we have already the volume of production has already been taken to &#x2013; and every months this number will grow as retail do well and it will grow continually.</p>
          <p>In this year until September 2011 we'll complete all the procedures that have to do with the completion of this project and also the elevation of this project will allow us in 2015 to launch this unique oil field and everything all the technological including export problems have been resolved specially of the oil production in the Caspian because we have brought with our company Lukarco and all the documents have been signed and the quality and the acceptance of all the volume of oil production in Northern Caspian.</p>
          <p>And the system, K2K will allow us to achieve receive an additional profit from this oil production. In the Republic of Komi of we have done a good experimental industrial operation and today the well is located on this unique it's called <mark type="inaudible" /> unique or heavy oil fields. And after our good experimental and research and project operations the first well has given us oil. The amount of oil was almost five times the value. And this is a unique operation.</p>
          <p>And today a lot of people come into my presentation, my statement that I am &#x2013; we're interested in project that we're interested in shell and shell gas, not so much shell gas, but also shell technologies. If we look at slide number four, we see that it, it deals with Abajen structured with also in &#x2013; technology would be vacant system.</p>
          <p>There is a tight oil field. And this shows you Shell technologies will allow us to conduct more successful development. And in the ten years this technological evolution has taken place in this tight hydrocarbons and oil.</p>
          <p>And so this &#x2013; the number the volume is closed of. And the rough estimation would be about 70 billion barrels and so that is why this scientific unique &#x2013; a scientific research development are required and also of course we have conducted exploratory works operation in essential part of our Saudi Arabia. And our &#x2013; and also that the country of Iraq and we opened it's not a light well it's condensed and the condensed belongs to an Investor and there is oil field also gas fields and we believe that along with our partners we will be able to make this project economically efficient, effective.</p>
          <p>And also as I told you we're starting to implement new technology. I would like to bring your attention around indicator. It is the recovery, oil recovery rate. Our company in these previous years has mostly dealt with obtaining, obtaining assets that were already there. You know that.</p>
          <p>You know my story and my career. I was the first Chairman and Minister of oil of USSR, who is responsible for oil, for all oil production in the USSR and of course I knew which assets were the most perspective and the best one. And also the volume, the growth of the volume of production demonstrates just that. And also all this years we've been using our chain to obtain those in Russia &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> and also find liquid hydrocarbon and also all these years we've dedicated ourselves to the realizations of this chain.</p>
          <p>Depending on load activation of this that will limit our access although I am sure that we will be alone with other companies to push the participation of our company Lukoil forward because aside from Lukoil on that shale, no other national company has any experience there.</p>
          <p>And so we dedicate our efforts to development of sea oil fields. And, of course we're spending our scientific potential as well to pay a more detailed attention and to implement all the advanced technologies to increase the oil recovery rate as well as growth.</p>
          <p>And with &#x2013; that is why, when today, we're talking about the oil recovery growth, recovery rate, it's a real ability that our company has today. It's a new fact &#x2013; it's about new practices. Today, the diameters of our wells has been decreased significantly. More, a more simplified system of power operations and also the construction of the wells on those oil fields that we already know that will lead &#x2013; that might lead to the decrease of the efforts.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows very clearly our abilities to increase the oil recovery rate. About three billion barrels which is our reserves, we don't consider it big, the cost expenditures. We will need to sustain this volume of oil production. This is a next slide, and the volume of additional production might lead to the in long-term picture by 700 million barrels.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows our plan to decrease expenditures for we would &#x2013; the amount we spend on development or exploration of new oil fields and also there is a financial centers <mark type="inaudible" />. We having an ability to work with them closely to incorporate methods. It's not a development, its an implementation center that will allow to adapt new technologies to the conditions of Russian Federation through our offices <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>They will be directed to increase the oil recovery base, effective development of mechanisms that will allow to effect the decrease of cost and expenditure that are being spent when developing new oil fields. And also I have already mentioned that we have been working on this project. And this slide shows that tax time decreased, tax table allow us to develop small and medium and oil fields more effectively and also not in innovation is that the proportion between export, custom duties on crude oil and export oil products will be decreased.</p>
          <p>All oil products will be increased and the first one will decrease. Heavy oil life, oil products, it will be one comprehensive scale. Where company, are rather ready because this rather good investments will allow us to balance this for the fact that there will be, the <mark type="inaudible" /> will be more balanced out.</p>
          <p>I know that modernization of our refineries is being continued and our up-gradations in the next years will be dedicated to developing these new oil products. And if you look you will see that &#x2013; we are seeing an additional profit because we are in the process of modernization of a development. And also the return we see in the first term what we see in western market. And the table shows &#x2013; and the slide shows that western city will not only become stabilized, but also we're hoping about &#x2013; for new oil fields.</p>
          <p>The tendency also whatever help that it will be into growth. And also we're increasing the implementation of innovation, innovative innovation, especially the horizontal wells, the value &#x2013; the value of the volume of drilling. They have already surpassed the stage of being experimental to become an effective a horizontal &#x2013; speaking of horizontal wells. And also the decreasing of the number of platforms and the stem of a horizontal well would be a 7 kilometers. If the depth is 3,000 meters, as we would understand, that this length of the stem is pretty unique.</p>
          <p>First Kechimovskoye oil field, it's one of our oil fields in Western Siberia. We will see that this first project have been implemented, the ones we're developing today. The recovery rate is simple and it has positioned itself well as the company who sees its opportunities to see those technologies, who can be bring to life.</p>
          <p>Next slides, I will not pay your intention in a greater detail. What are the problems in bringing to life our projects in the West? But all of this problems, of course, they are there, but they all are solvable. I will be meeting with Iraq &#x2013; with the Government of Iraq. One question was so scientists expedited procedure that will allow us to breakthrough a lot of impediments and errors, that impediments that might slowdown by a month or month and a half of the decisions that need to be made. And we've made and we will try to make those decisions as the so called tenders, decisions, implementation of technological decisions, I know in an expedited manner.</p>
          <p>And I am hoping that it will be delegated to the Southern Oil Company in Iraq and it will be solved more in an easier way. I know this problem, they present an impediment but they will not. I don't see them impeding our work in Iraq &#x2013; Western Iraq. The regions that are the most promising I would like to talk about them, are both gas and hydrocarbon and oil. Our partners have given us &#x2013; to make our positions rather stronger in Western Africa. We know the history of the formation of hydrocarbon production.</p>
          <p>Our company, Yukon has also been known as <mark type="inaudible" /> because nobody had believed that northern Caspian will be successful. There hadn't been drilled even one well and we have discovered those hydrocarbon fields. And we're hoping that it will give us pretty effective and positive results. We think that power generation and faster today it's the most effective channel of elevation of natural gas.</p>
          <p>A week ago, I with Mr. Miller I signed a five-year contract of gas sale. It's the only company of independent sellers that has long-term contract with Gasco. The formula has been that and still this indexation in of gas development and on the territory of Russia. The contract has been signed and our old contract is being ended will expire in 2011, and so we've made a sale for our self on production of natural gas, mostly to take all of the gas on the north to regions, and those fields that will be implemented in the next five years and the realization &#x2013; full realization of all the Caspian region of Iraq country.</p>
          <p>And we think that this contract will allow us to do it in a stable way, northern Gazprom to carborundum sales liability and so the realization of gas through power generation, it's the most effective canal channel, channel of obtaining a price on honest and price for gas. As I've already mentioned, this year we are producing almost 600 megawatt, next year 200 megawatts, the next two years 160 megawatts, and then gas transportational system that has to do with northern fields of our company.</p>
          <p>And to conclude my presentation, I've already commented on these recoveries and I made a detailed comparison with what our colleagues in other states have, and they are already concerned with these problems back in 1970 now into '80s. This new technologies have been checked pretty well, and so we will go the way the path that has been covered by our colleagues of 20 years, 30 years old.</p>
          <p>And to conclude my presentation, because I'm taking up so much of your time, I would like to say, of course I would like to bring your attention to the slides, main conclusions that I would like to give more detail.</p>
          <p>In Northern Siberia, new technologists that will allow us to optimize our project especially in traditional oil region. It reserves that today because of the rate recovery both up to 3 billion that will be involved in this development, that's not counting those reserves. And strategically, the segment of geological developed exploratory segment is a very important aspect, and we work on those projects and we are certain that they will be successful. And we hope that the company will be &#x2013; its economy politic &#x2013; economical politic policy will be successful in our investment program and we do not plan on changing it.</p>
          <p>Given the opportunity of that, it's been demonstrated by today's market. So this, all of this projects will be based on the price that are based on the budget of the company. And that will obtain an additional profit and the additional dividend. Thank you very much for your time.</p>

          <p>Please change the presentation. At the beginning I would provide should thank of this organizers of this program to meet us. They are our long-term defoliants from longer the Sachs &#x2013; Goldman Sachs and they help us to organize this, we are very grateful for the support they gave us.</p>
          <p>Of course I grateful to all of us here and in this &#x2013; such rain day you find the time to listen to Fedun developed presentation. Mr. President all the way today discussed about goals like was the best solved by company in 2010. And it will be solved in 2011, a new strategic of company. My goal is to tell about the goal we complimented last year. And as the beginning, we are in the U.S. &#x2013; you know America we should determine statements periodically and bet all these statements and proposals are made are connected too and we will see how evolution will be made.</p>
          <p>You no doubt, we saw &#x2013; have already saw our conclusions and reports of what we published. As these are our best indicators, our history of company and in fact they became more optimistic than we expected at by the end of last year. We showed the profit more than $9 billion and net profit per share per share was $10.95 per share. This is the best indicator in industrials and it's already go right at &#x2013; of competitors in Russia.</p>
          <p>And we have to &#x2013; have book at net income per bottle of oil and the company occupies the second place and indicator, by indicators we're a leader in Russian Federation. That's no doubt tells that company managed in correct direction and we should give maximum of profit to our shareholders. Mr. Alekperov have already stopped and told about achievements that have been taken place in this year. And it is in fact more and inputting to that. I would like to note they recorded &#x2013; it's very big for Russia, the shares from Russian market.</p>
          <p>As far as the ConocoPhillips made decision, to make the Conoco decision was very difficult for us because a 20% of our shares would be collapsing the market. And it would be 40% of the defloat, it's giant the figure, that would significantly impact of category of company, but we are grateful to management of our company to Digit partner, ConocoPhillips <mark type="inaudible" /> after they have the discussions we found solution, more shares obvious we've bought back, most shares of this company very successfully.</p>
          <p>Impaired cost was &#x2013; and per share is $70 per share and it's quite optimistic. Traditional question how the company is going to own these shares? So I would like to assume that these shares must not be a return to market. Unfortunately, there's no procedures that can be &#x2013; make guarantee <mark type="inaudible" /> from default but we will keep at least financial shares like financial reserves and that will avoid dangerousity in future for company.</p>
          <p>Our competition is very significant. We should use deals to avoid any problem in the financial market. And there is the definite the assumption that this partners will not allow to sell the shares in market. So, we managed to keep, maintain that level of liquidity and this high level of liquidity at least share market of what they look well ahead before crisis, and the general volume is $9 billion. And we're into the lopping curve companies, for developed companies this is very high indicator.</p>
          <p>If we have a look microeconomical and microeconomical activities of last year of company, there is no doubt it was very been efficient than 2010. We see that prices production &#x2013; per sale production that company provides in oil products, it's averaging 28% high and it's very high the growth attempt and this is 22% of growth the rate and this is of course creates better beneficial situation for business of company and for sales.</p>
          <p>Of course corresponding to this, according to specific character of legislature production in the growth, there was taken some taxes from the government. Let's pay attention, the gross export tariffs increased by 58% and while in spite of this condition and in spite of such heavy tax rates and growth of tariffs and monopoly like Russian railroad, Transneft increased it by 20% and company managed to show very strong results.</p>
          <p>Basically, operational result &#x2013; operating results of company are as a whole. If we had a book growth of hydrocarbon production, it has increase and exceeded 2,000,090,000 barrels per day. In addition, significant growth, oil production increased by 24%. This growth is correspondent of finding new fields &#x2013; oil field in Middle Asia and taking the limitation on gas. And we continue decreasing decreasing of oil and company works at issues to stabilize production of the oil in our region Western Siberia.</p>
          <p>A new goal is to put strategies as far we think that &#x2013; to have potential 3 billion barrel and -as drilled and we have not drilled all wells yet. This is a potential that gave company the belief that in &#x2013; on close of three years, we can stabilize production of oil in Western Siberia and we will explore more in new sea oil fields. We will create more beliefs and confidence. Traditionally, Russian Federation differs by &#x2013; has big refinery merchant. Pay attention, in 2010, it was at 16 million to 20 million barrels per day. This high level is provided by specific of &#x2013; the tax of a Russian tax law of Russian Federation, and within this specific nature, the company focused on sale of oil products. And that provides the advantage and compare with other oil company of Russian Federation.</p>
          <p>Although beginning 2012, we should understand that, margin of Russian Federation will be decreased as far the governments thoughts equal balance to make balance to all product and &#x2013; which will get those companies who has the more deeper processing. And we are leader in this field, and we expect that in nearest year, several years, there will be several progress that will enable us refuse from the production of the heavy distillators and export, and they are not economical financial and on the export, highly demanding ones like high distillators that will give the company the big benefit and additional income.</p>
          <p>In addition, we develop two processing in Russian Federation by 4% and this time we slightly stopped development of most directions and drilling that are under condition of that law European margin did not gave us high profit.</p>
          <p>We carefully studied situation in European market and refineries that faced with big problems and we think including this, there is small the plants. 20 plants will be closed in Europe and the gradual recovering will be started processing of March. And they just &#x2013; some companies have made decision to get 11% of drilling and they can be more profit, by the profit and they can increase the cash flow.</p>
          <p>Essential financial results, they are in slide and they are posting internet in portal and I hope you web page you saw that, you see that all results are positive and the sales by a 30% has been increased almost and 8% to 7% profit has been &#x2013; and 12% has been increased <mark type="inaudible" /> of the company.</p>
          <p>As has been taken, how we sold &#x2013; how we sales did. You see the last year, we sold $70 billion oil product and it's not accident as far by specifically of tax activities of Russian Federation, export of oil production is more profitable for activities of company.</p>
          <p>In addition, this goal educate is refused from export of heavy distillation and export is a distillation and we will deal also new tax legislation of Russian Federation we should take into consideration. If we have to look at operating expenses, they are in principally below of inflation and enhancing kind of ruble that is taking place in Russian Federation.</p>
          <p>On third slide, as I noted, enhancing ruble has been &#x2013; by 12%. Of course this enhances negatively impacts all statistics. But bearing in mind that average inflation are at the 10% is inflation in Russian, so you can see there growth of lifting is only by 16% and operative expenses by production is 17% is very moderate and this is the best in &#x2013; one of the best in Russian industry.</p>
          <p>As a fact, the main goal of company is control expenses and we think it's not enough for &#x2013; to tax successes, growth petrol-chemistry is significant. It's connected to that we after three years of reconstruction we'll launch capacity of chemistry in <mark type="inaudible" /> in Western Ukraine. That significantly impact our expenses and your chemical complex in New York would generate additional cash flow additional income in our company.</p>
          <p>If we have as a whole, how our operating expenses are in scheme, we will see that in 2010 lifting of cost achieved level eight 2008 year, crisis year, that is connected to enhancing overall goal, but itself if we although eliminate inflation, if we say about inflation, inflation is 18%, so growth by 16% compare with 2009 and 0% compared to the 2010, in reality inflation changes are lifting cost was decreased 18% &#x2013; has been decreased about 18%, I think this is very good achievement from our engineers, by our engineers and engineer technologies.</p>
          <p>Moreover we think that company has significant technical the potential to decrease lifting cost and he is connected with innovation of technology development of innovative technology, what we have, what the company has is developed by technological revolution, first of all is built on wells and if this is from hydro reserves and that gives unique dividends that, as role are taking place on wells. At the present moment, if the company comports in entire service or experience it works to drill wells like each well should be correspondent unique nature.</p>
          <p>We should work under extenuative technology to build high level wells. Of course &#x2013; natural that use, natural technique what a natural technique &#x2013; economical technologies and also company not all the increase percent called production of <mark type="inaudible" /> also control productions and the refining of the hydrocarbons and oil.</p>
          <p>Administrative transportation expenses it has been taken place within inflation. If we see our transportation expenses are defined first of all, by two monopolies of Russia Transneft and Russian Railroad. At the same time specific nature of <mark type="inaudible" /> decreasing by 8%, cost of production by oil and this is cost by big shipment operation &#x2013; ship operation and especially in developing countries.</p>
          <p>As a whole, we think that we have opportunity to decrease administrative cost, although this expenses although by decreasing corporate expenses our company is leader in Russian federation.</p>
          <p>If we have a look, reconciliation our net income reconciliation we will you will see the essential influence on the amount is growth. Growth of volume of sale &#x2013; selling, on the other hand growth increase of tax first of all tax of exports or natural resources from other countries, at the same time we had insignificant $2000 non financial operation it was because of closing of non profit wells and some closing of some geological exploration projects.</p>
          <p>2010 showed very high amount of cash flow free cash on 2010 free cash flow of company exceeded $69 billion and it almost achieved $8 and the big reserve what the company has as far under in conditions of prices recession and unexpected the oil price in 2010, company very careful took into consideration their programs, it's programs. This conservative scenario managed to decrease economize some means and paying out all high dividends. And we are increasing every year. We also significantly buy back share $3 billion and $6 billion. This is the most biggest volume of buy back shares in Russian industry. So Mr. Alekperov said that company <mark type="inaudible" /> is intended &#x2013; to take the &#x2013; to make profits with shareholders and amount of dividend that our policies increase each year. This is basic position of board of director and management of our company.</p>
          <p>The basic capital expenses, CapEx breakdown company, are focused on <mark type="inaudible" /> exportation of the sale. They basically called what has the program is to have to pressurize more profit sectors and to decrease 80% of the capital expenditures. We think that we completed basic investment in sector of chemical, chemistry and oil production. And it time says in this sector we'll be stable in nearest 10 decades.</p>
          <p>The basic direction of our business will be focused on production, refinery earning of a sector, sector refining as displayed by Russian Federation. And we are &#x2013; they directed that basic investment should be spent in refining sector, that gives us more cash flow for our company. Also as a complexion I would like to note that the company will as before make more focus on expenses, decreasing of expenses. Of course acute <mark type="inaudible" /> has been passed but we have serious fundamental dangerous concerns to reveal &#x2013; to appear if there is crisis again.</p>
          <p>So company should have significant reserves and we must focus on economical efficiency and very strong financial discipline. And company does not intend to increase programs and balance of tax and regarding between capital, relation between the capital and tax. And I think this relationship will be stable. And this is steady and steadfast and this process is steady and we should increase dividend and it's our policy. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you.</p>

          <p>I would like to open floor to questions and answers. Q&amp;A and both presentations at the same time and I'll greatly encourage participants of our &#x2013; of this conference to ask maximum questions in this session even if you have plans for Group in for one-on-ones going forward because the &#x2013; this composition of management is going to be only in this session so please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello &#x2013; I have two questions one, just want to clarify on your production you did 2.2 million barrels per day roughly oil equivalent, you said you want to stabilize Western Siberia by 2013 should &#x2013; does that mean we should expect continuous declines in that 1% range and then it will stabilize I mean can you clarify that? And going forward, how should we think about your production, I don't know if you want to give a guidance or a target but maybe you just give us some color on how you think about how much production you can do, let's say in the five year range and where it's going to come from, maybe you can just clarify that a little bit more. That will be my question, and then I have a second question on Iraq, should I ask it now or--?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't we answer to the first question then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In my presentation I've mentioned that this enterprise that we put as a goal for ourselves to stabilize oil production in those oil fields, they will take place until the year 2013. New oil fields in Russia, 2015 launching of new oil field and other projects in the next year. In the following years the prognosis is that the general growth will lead to the volume of productions.</p>
          <p>The detail strategy, the development of every oil field, as I have mentioned, we are being &#x2013; we have been in the process of preparing it &#x2013; the detail information is being prepared as I have mentioned earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The West Qurna field, you are expecting to have about 200,000 barrels per day, but I guess within the next two years and then up to almost 2 million per day. How much of that is you actually, what's your net take on that? And is the regime in Iraq, is that clear like how are you going to sell, how are you know the taxes and all that &#x2013; is that all done or is there still risk on that front, can you talk about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our documents everything is being covered and discussed as with respect to export and the sale of product and also the export potential that will be developed in Western Iraq. And our component, our volume share is 10% and it will of course fluctuate depending of the volume of this production. The investment expenditures will be we're talking about the following years.</p>
          <p>So the crude oil or the documents, all the crude oil have been all formalized finalized as for gas, as for the gas all of the discussions and decisions we already have them. As I have mentioned in my presentation, we do not have any unresolved problems questions in Iraq. The difficulties we're experiencing, they have to do with the operational project programs as to several impairments of bureaucratic nature, but again even that do not impact the development validation of our project.</p>

          <p>Hi, <mark type="inaudible" /> Energy Intelligence Group. I was wondering if you could clarify a little bit on your perspective for the U.S. in North American market in terms of refining and retail products, what are your plans for the future and also in terms of if you're looking more strategic partners in North America as well in line with other Russian companies? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our partners, all of the biggest companies of &#x2013; in Russia, we have alliances with all of them, we have our joint projects. For over 20 years our company has been developing quite dynamically along with colleagues, including our North American companies, as for our development, you know that we've sold the company to <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>The project of the last &#x2013; of the previous years, present years we thought that we preserve the asset LUKOIL in Northern America operating stations under this brand LUKOIL they will be developed, they will develop more effectively.</p>
          <p>As far our partnership that deals with projects of developing the projects in Northern America, we're interested in technologies that are implemented in production of shale gas and shale oil that in recent years have been developed in the states, in the United States very effectively and actively. And normally, it's done with smaller not very big companies and we are interested in looking for partners or joint projects on the territory of North America to work on those technologies, to work them out and after they have been worked out and developed to implement them on equivalent oil fields in Russia.</p>
          <p>I have shown this unique oil field bringing your attention to those slides. In Western Siberia that concerns the huge reserves of oil, unfortunately they are not being used because there is no appropriate technology and our hope is that we will be able to &#x2013; by working with this technological companies that they will be able to implement technologies in a joint manner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one question on taxation and your investment program. The first, do you believe that the 6066 proposal will be implemented this year? And is it necessary for that to be implemented in order to carry out the CapEx to stabilize what there in Siberia i.e. is it economic to do the investment that you need for stabilization under the current tax regime?</p>
          <p>And secondly, beyond 6066 do you expect any other changes in the tax regime this year? And if so what are your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This program gives us an opportunity to those who produce crude oil to have more profit than those who produce oil product, not high quality products. In Russia we have a lot of refineries and factories that produce oil, produce heavy oil. And custom duties they stimulate export of Russian oil and conduction of it into oil product and export of oil products. And this system, it decreases our expenditures and that stimulates the development of new oil field and program that is been active in the field of developing of new oil fields, we think that generally annually every year when the system is being implemented, every year we expect the growth by 300 million to 450 million.</p>
          <p>And we expect that those businessmen who deal with so called grey business, that they will be able to sustain this competitor's value. They will be able to be good competitors in the condition, the market, Russian market becomes more predictable. One of the aspects is the quality of oil and also they are not so fair competitor's value from not so big companies that produce oil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much for your presentation. So yeah, from <mark type="inaudible" /> Barclays Capital. And I have first question; that deals with the presentation of Mr. Yusufovich. The slide number 20, the buyback that's going to development the first question, and the second question I would like to know if you have already signed the contract <mark type="inaudible" /> in Western Qurna and also your price strategies. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what's shown on the slide includes Western Qurna, tender procedures, drilling procedures already been taken place. We have seven candidates that have undergone this tender procedure and this contract in Qurna is divided into two contracts. The first one, to drill exploratory wells we are required to do it according to this contract and to do they complete exploratory research there. And the second one is the contract for wells.</p>
          <p>As soon as everything &#x2013; all the details have been worked out, we will announce the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Follow-up on Iraq. What percentage of your wells in West Qurna are new versus oil-existing wells that you comment out? And can you comment on any production challenges in the area that you expect going forward regarding geology, your preparation, or access to tools and communication to pipelines, any color that you want to offer on that will be appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's 75% of the company of Lukoil and 25% of company <mark type="inaudible" />. So that's the ratio there. Lukoil is the operator of this oil field. We are &#x2013; we have been working on this product since 1996. The first documents have been signed in 1995. We had completed the complex of oil-based research operations in the wells that had been drilled there. Those &#x2013; that oil field had been discovered and developed by Soviet Union geologists, and we have an access to that region and we have all the details.</p>
          <p>Our engineers, geologists they have &#x2013; there are no details there that are not known to them. There are different qualities and types of oil there. And we are talking about the volume of oil of production or prognosis &#x2013; production prognosis that we bring into life and as of today we have a few impairments that by 2017 the export potential of the Republic of Iraq. This question together with our colleagues, we are working on this project because it will not just be a problem of company of Lukoil but also <mark type="inaudible" /> and all the colleagues, our colleagues that work on the South of the Republic they work there. I am certain that we will solve this question including the &#x2013; uniting making creating a comprehensive system united system and though as well as producing this associated gas until as a subcontractor as company is already in the process of expanding this project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Bloomberg News, Uzbekistan question, Uzbekistan oil is there a possibility to sell it in China, any negotiations with Gazprom on that? And the next question is Asia, your development in Asia everything you have to say in that regard, there or other Asian markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Uzbekistan, the resources of Uzbekistan the <mark type="inaudible" /> Republic of Uzbekistan, we are the operators of this project and as of today we are already producing 3 billion of gas and in 2013 the capacity will be more, 2 billion more, and variations of this gas delivery from Central Asia is being worked out with Gazprom through Russian Federation and we are already delivering gas.</p>
          <p>The system of China that delivering the gas from Turkmenia and is building an additional capacity that also takes in account the gas of other countries of Central Asia. Our company is not the same as the policy of Turkmenistan. Those channels are two channels &#x2013; approach those channels &#x2013; with those channels deliver this. If the republic of Uzbekistan will decide to deliver gas to the territory of China and it will be in terms of economics it will make sense, it will be efficient than of course we will follow this policy. And the second question. The stock exchange question you've asked.</p>
          <p>Well we are considering the option of leasing our shares, considering also on this stock exchange. When it will happen? I am not able to tell you just yet. Because it's on the &#x2013; at the stage of analysis with aspects of how effective it will be for our company, what are the market expectations are, so I cannot tell you a full answer. As for Asia now as of today we have long-term relationships with our Chinese colleagues as for delivery of oil, oil products from Russia, also from &#x2013; also we're having conversations about with China and India and also we are talking about, we are working with end customers and buyers. Those companies who refine our oil themselves so we deal with them like China. So the first oil has been received in Iraq and already complications with our contractual relationships with the company.</p>
          <p>We're active in Kazakhstan as you know. We are decreasing our investments there and stable volume of production. So Central Asia is of interest to us, because the projects are being realized, brought to life already, the oil delivery and also gas delivery will be realized based on those relationships that we had established with Gazprom. We feel very comfortable as far as those relationships within senior and junior partners can go as comfortable as they can go. So I think that Central Asia will have more and more of our attention especially the market because as they produce so much such high volume of hydrocarbon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all? Thank you, so much for your attention and I hope we will meet the next year with the same and with more better result of our company. Thank you.</p>
