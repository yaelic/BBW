          <p>Good morning and warm welcome to all investors and analysts. You are listening in to SingTel's Earnings Conference Call for the second quarter and half year ended 30 September 2012. My name is <mark type="ph" /> Sin Yang Fong (00:13) and let me introduce management on the call. Ms. Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO; Mr. Allen Lew, CEO of Group Digital Life; Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, CEO of Group Consumer; Ms. Jeann Low, Group CFO. They are also assisted by other members of the management team from Singapore and Australia.</p>
          <p>Before we start taking questions, I would like to invite Sock Koong to share a couple of highlights from this set of results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, <mark type="ph" /> Yang Fong (00:38) and good morning or good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We announced our results for the quarter ended 30 June 2012 this morning. So let me start off by giving you some quick highlights from the Group's performance.</p>
          <p>I think overall, it's a very resilient performance across the Group. And that is despite the impact of weaker regional currencies. Underlying net profit was stable. We've got strong performances from Singapore and the associates that helped offset higher depreciation and amortization charges, also the impact of our new acquisition such as Amobee and Vividwireless.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in networks and various transformation initiatives. In Singapore, revenue and EBITDA grew 4% and 2% respectively, and that's despite payments that we made to NetLink Trust. In Australia, against negative mobile industry growth, Optus' EBITDA was stable. That reflects increased focus on customer experience and yield management.</p>
          <p>The regional mobile associates continued to deliver strong customer growth and the key regional associates, Telkomsel, AIS and Globe, they all recorded very strong performances. And that helped somewhat to mitigate the weaker results from Airtel and also the effects of the regional currencies depreciation. In constant currency terms, the earnings from the regional mobile associates would have grown 26%.</p>
          <p>Finally I would just report that the Board has approved an interim dividend of S$0.068 a share. And that's consistent with the payout last year. It represents a payout ratio of 62% of underlying net profit.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll hand over to <mark type="ph" /> Yang Fong (2:31).</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for the call. I just had two questions initially. One is on Warid and the other is in terms of mio TV. I'll start off with mio TV. Just wondering, for the recent recontracting of BPL whether you can guide us whether your content costs once the new season starts will be lower going forward? And the second question is on Warid. We noticed that you put it under assets for sale. Just wondering if there's any active interest and negotiations already for the stake and any timelines related to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to your first question on mio TV content costs, unfortunately we can't give you any further guidance because we are bound by a commercial agreement with the content rights owner that prohibits us from talking about the content costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Warid, Jeann, you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Warid, we have the &#x2013; the Board has approved a plan to sell the asset and we have basically reclassified it for accounting purposes. The IFRS requirement is that once you have classified as a asset that you want to sell you then have to treat it accordingly. We are obviously going to engage in discussions and it is premature now to tell you who are the parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Rajesh from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Rajesh from HSBC. Thanks for the call. I also had two questions. Firstly, on Telkomsel, could you please guide us if there is any progress on your discussions with Telkom on their interest in acquiring your 35% stake in Telkomsel? And secondly, in Singapore, just wanted to understand if the recontracting subscribers are going in more for your tiered plans or are the majority changing plans at this stage? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We're actually &#x2013; your first question, which is &#x2013; is it around Telkom's interest in our Telkomsel stake?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. I was just wondering if it's status quo or any kind of progress made on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think both the company and SingTel and the Ministers have basically made statements to the effect that there are no discussions on such a sale transaction. So we cannot &#x2013; we've put that to rest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll get Moon to talk about the tiered &#x2013; the mobile plans in Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the mobile tiered plans that we have introduced in 1 July is gaining momentum and traction. In fact, from 1 July all our customers who are recontracting instead of signing up new smartphone plans are all put onto this tiered plan. So we are seeing a higher pickup of this tiered plan, especially towards the end of the quarter &#x2013; in September, when a lot of the new smartphones were launched, like the Samsung Galaxy Note II as well as the iPhone 5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Anand from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the call. I had three questions. Firstly, on Optus, I wonder if I could have some color on what drives the industry slowdown in Australia, the revised guidance, is it to do just with mobile but also with other segments? So that's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question two, depreciation and amortization. I refer to the release and you're referring to amortization of intangibles arising from acquisitions. The number is up 17% for Singapore. I was wondering if you could let us &#x2013; give us some color on now much of that is depreciation, how much of it is amortization? How should we be thinking about it over the next two, three years?</p>
          <p>Last question is on AssetCo. You obviously indicated to the IDA to reduce your stake to 25% by April 2014. I just wanted your confirmation on whether that still stands or whether there is any change that could happen to that timeline? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll take the Optus question first. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's Paul here. I'll start and then &#x2013; I'm in Singapore today. So Kevin and Murray are joining us in Sydney, but I'll start and they can add some commentary. I think it's important to put the industry slowdown into context as you've suggested.</p>
          <p>If you go back to June 2010, which was just prior to Telstra announcing their intention to reduce profits in order to regain market share and you compare the industry profitability. Then looking at the published results in June, among the three major players, Telstra, Vodafone and Optus, Telstra's EBITDA was about $200 million below where it was in June 2010. Vodafone's was about $200 million below where it was in June 2010 and, as you can see from our results, we're tracking pretty much close to stable. So, the main source of pressure on industry growth we would put down to being first of all the increased price competition and allowances you've seen over the last couple of years. Second of all, the increase in mobile termination rate &#x2013; sorry, the reduction in mobile termination rates, which has been mandated within the industry.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, if you look at our numbers, what you can see is that we actually also have chosen in a market that's gone negative growth to focus more on profitable acquisition, and that's had an impact of reducing the amount of subsidy we make and a consequence to reduction in equipment sales. That's obviously had an impact on the revenue line, although it doesn't really feed through in terms of the EBITDA line.</p>
          <p>And finally, if you have a look at our revenue line, it's also affected by the device repayment plans and the way that we account for those. In fact very significantly, against an industry that's gone negative in terms of growth, we have given you a revised outlook, but it's important to say that although the Optus mobile service revenue numbers are down by about $140 million for the half, that is three major sources of reduction now, the three things I just talked about, equipment, mobile termination rates and device repayment plans. And those have had almost no impact on EBITDA. So we've been able to maintain our profitability.</p>
          <p>Kevin or Murray, is there anything you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe one more comment, which is unquestionably there is a degree of pricing pressure, but I would also say that there's a degree of pricing improvement or stability starting to go into the marketplace as well, which should be encouraging as we move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's something &#x2013; if I may confirm, there's nothing beyond the mobile slowdown in the lower revenue guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take that. To be clear, it's the primary and key driver of our revised guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on your depreciation and amortization, actually we do make that disclosure. If you look at our MD&amp;A, it's on page 34 for the Singapore disclosure and on page 51 for the Australian disclosure. So a large part of the increase at the quarter end was, obviously it is not just Amobee but also some of the other digital life initiatives &#x2013; Digital Life acquisitions that we have made. A significant part of that does relate to Amobee.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I missed that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Anand, I think just to clarify, when we talk about Singapore, just to explain, it's actually Singapore plus all the Digital Life initiatives, although they may not necessarily be based in Singapore. So basically it's Australia, the Associates and Singapore plus everything else is under Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anand, on your last question about NetLink Trust, the last disclosed, and we're still on track with that, is the 25% sell-down of NetLink Trust.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the call. Three questions from me. The first question is with regard to the Warid again. I understand that you have plans to sell Warid. Want to also confirm that you have this cumulated currency translation loss of S$366 million and I suppose, I mean, assuming if you were to sell that, would that mean that you have a one-off hit of that amount in your P&amp;L? So that's question one.</p>
          <p>And question two, just wondering what's the competitive environment like in the Philippines, I understand that your PLDT is actually planning on defending its market share, so I'm just wondering whether if Globe is looking at a similar strategy and do you see competition stabilizing there?</p>
          <p>Third question is on the recent BPL, just wondering what are your thoughts or parameters that we should consider in deciding which content should go on exclusive or non-exclusive basis. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please, Jeann, can you take the Warid one and Hui will answer the Philippines and Allen can talk about BPL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on Warid, the carrying value of Warid investment is S$38 million. There is an equity &#x2013; there is a currency translation of S$366 million that we have flagged.</p>
          <p>Accounting treatment will be such that depending on the sale proceeds, whatever is the balance will be flushed out through the P&amp;L, you basically have to clean out your translation, your currency reserve as well as the book value and take into account your disposal proceeds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Hui here. On the competitive situation in the Philippines, well, since PLDT acquired Digitel, they've been trying to consolidate their position and have been quite aggressive on the above-the-line advertising. But on the postpaid front, Globe has been very successful in garnering a larger share of the postpaid market. And their strategy is more from moving the high-end prepaid onto the postpaid. They find this to be very accretive from a long-term perspective where customers moving to postpaid see that the ARPU has in fact increased by more than three times versus from when they were on the prepaid.</p>
          <p>On the low-end side of the prepaid voice, data and SMS, the situation there is very competitive. PLDT has used their larger base to offer quite aggressive promotion. But Globe is also offering selective promotion targeting some of their more innovative services such as having off-net SMS as well as bundling for data as well as for browsing and for Facebook access. So the situation there is competitive at this moment.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, we expect the situation to improve as the competitors are looking at more from monetizing the data aspect of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Allen. I'm going to answer the question. Just to make sure I've got it right. Basically the question is, how do we decide which content gets carried exclusively versus non-exclusively. I think we need to understand that in Singapore, when content is carried exclusively, it has to be cross-carried to all other operators of pay TV and if it's non-exclusive, then you know you just make your own commercial arrangement and leave it to others to do that.</p>
          <p>So I think obviously when we decide whether to take content exclusive and then cross-carry or to do non-exclusive, a lot of it depends on the commercial arrangement that the different content providers agree with us as a result of working under those two different scenarios.</p>
          <p>So I think in the case of BPL, we had discussions early and we decided that it made more commercial sense for us to carry BPL on a non-exclusive basis. It's also important for everybody to know that content cost is the largest part of our cost structure of pay TV as any other pay TV provider, so we continue to look at this and we continue to make sure that we track that in accordance with our revenue and our ARPU that we get. So I think you look at those two points together, we made that decision to carry BPL on a non-exclusive basis.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Three question here. EBITDA and the profit are showing divergence in both Australia and Singapore, despite stable EBITDA, profits are showing sharp decline. What needs to happen for this trend to change and how far that can be achieved in terms of this divergence? And that's my question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two, again, I think I didn't get the answer on this question on Warid. You have a sharp declining performance, you had de-capitalized the company. So question is what is the value of your stake in Warid now and is there possibility of write-down all of these investments in the future?</p>
          <p>And the last question is, Telkomsel has shown good results so far. I heard about rising competitive intensity in Indonesia. What is your feedback from Telkomsel? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeann, you want to take the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay, I think if you look at the movement from EBITDA to net profit, a couple of points to note. One is, in the case of Australia, the movement really is because of higher depreciation and amortization from Vividwireless, depreciation because of the network investments that we are making. Bear in mind that the investment, cash flow, we have given cash flow guidance. And of course, there is a higher interest expense because of the &#x2013; we look at treasury from a Group perspective and while overall interest expense has come off, you have seen the step up of the interest expense in Australia, so it is really trying to balance the debt mix ratio versus the cash flow ratios that we always talk about in terms of providing a natural hedge against the A$.</p>
          <p>I think in the Singapore &#x2013; from a Singapore P&amp;L movement, when you look at the movement from EBITDA to net profit, one point to note is of course we do have the effect of the amortization of intangibles from the acquisitions that we are making. Hopefully, over time we will see that -</p>
          <p>We have highlighted that there will be start-up losses as well as amortization and, of course, we hope that over time there will be a positive pay-back that would mitigate this amortization effect.</p>
          <p>The other point is that we had sold a investment in Far EasTone in April this year. So on a year-on-year basis, there is the absence of a dividend from Far EasTone to the tune of about S$16 million in the quarter &#x2013; S$14 million in the quarter. So that has accounted for the negative movement from EBITDA to P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>I think if you look at the Group perspective, in terms of the Group, net profit, it is &#x2013; underlying net profit is largely stable.</p>

          <p>Sachin, can I get you to repeat your question on Warid again? You mentioned something about write-down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'm checking on the possibility given that there was de-capitalization of Warid, then the performance has declined sharply, so am I wrong in thinking that there's a high possibility of write-down of those investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, the Warid, I think if you look at Warid, the book value of Warid is S$38 million. There is a currency translation as we have highlighted, which is sitting in our reserve account, S$366 million. And of course, we have flagged it as classified for sale. So I think if and when &#x2013; when the sale process happen, that is where you basically flush out the book balances into the P&amp;L. And of course you have to take into consideration the sale proceeds at that point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I'll pick up the question on Indonesia. So I'm just trying to give a little bit of flavor for Indonesia. You've seen pretty strong results this quarter, 13% revenue growth, 11% lift in EBITDA. Listening to some of the representations made by Telkomsel's management on their calls, they put it down to three big factors, a more stable market in terms of competitive behavior, the fact that data has now a larger percentage of revenues in the industry and in Telkomsel, roughly about 14% of revenue is coming from data as opposed to 9% last year. And finally, it's also about us pulling away from unlimited in terms of a number of our low end plans.</p>
          <p>The reality would be that in a market with nine operators, it is always going to be competitive, but I think we are seeing a trend whereby the top three because of their scale, their size, their investments, are behaving more rationally. There is definitely a focus now on moving towards greater 3G quality and 3G rollout and in that sense, you've seen us accelerate our own rollout this year.</p>
          <p>We've lifted it from 48 cities in terms of 3G coverage last year to over 92 cities currently. We're aiming to get to 100 by year-end. So we're well on track. In fact our estimate is that we have over 50% of the 3G BTSs in the market, and that's based on what we saw our competitors release at the second quarter. And our goal would be this year to continue our aggressive rollout and continue to lead in terms of 3G quality and coverage.</p>
          <p>So I can't guarantee there won't be ongoing price competition in the marketplace, but I do think that we're seeing currently a lot more stability in terms of the competitive environment.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a follow-up on the first question, Sock Koong. My understanding is that depreciation and amortization expenses, these are not short-term movements, they are long-term movements and their rise may bother SingTel for next &#x2013; I don't know whether three to five years. If that's the case, what is the hope for investors in terms of net profit growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think clearly, the investments we are making is to allow us to deliver sustainable growth, the investments in network, in capacity, in LTE, et cetera, are absolutely important for our core business. The acquisitions that we are making in the digital space would allow us to enhance the value proposition to our customers, so it would actually help to strengthen our core business and would also create new revenue streams.</p>
          <p>So I think we are convinced that these are the investments that we need to make to sustain long term growth and profitability. I think we would certainly look at NPAT as a key parameter and we would also track the free cash flow generation from the Group. We also look at returns, total shareholders' returns. So we are focused on basically delivering returns on a sustainable basis. So, for example, if you look at the dividend yield that we are giving and the dividend has just been approved, we've been able to maintain that and it represents 62% of our underlying earnings.</p>
          <p>I'm somewhat curious by your question. Are you suggesting that the company slow-down on its capital investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is, are those new investments why you're convinced? What is the near-term impact of those investments? When I say near term, I mean three to four years impact and that seems to be quite negative in the near-term. So, what is offsetting? How can you offset that negative balance? That's my main question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I think clearly when you make network investments, the improvements in the capacity you put in, it's always somewhat lumpy. So you put in your LTE into investments. You know you would get the pay-back over a period of time. We have already taken steps to make sure that we are able to monetize the growth in mobile data, so the introductions of tiered data plans, reducing data allowances would allow us to benefit from future growth of mobile data. Likewise, in Australia, we have taken steps to reduce data allowances. That would also allow us to improve our performance when you get further growth in mobile data.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the cost structure, there has been various initiatives also on cost management, but basically it's not just cutting costs blindly, but making sure that we are correctly focused on the right things. So, for example, you have seen us. We are taking a very hard look at how we do distributions in Australia, moving the focus towards branded stores. We've also taken steps to restructure our workforce to increase productivity. You've seen some head count reductions both in Australia and in Singapore as we outsourced some operations.</p>
          <p>So, while we continue to invest, we are also very conscious about the need to manage the cost structure of the business and we are also looking at how we can optimize the top line.</p>

          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. Two questions as well. Firstly, obviously you've cut the revenue guidance, but the cash guidance pretty much remains intact and the cash flows in the first half have been pretty strong as well. So I was just wondering, obviously the previous guidance last year was that you will review capital management every three years. I was just wondering does that still stand or there has been a change to that? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And I guess, second question is probably Paul or Kevin. Obviously for Optus, you've talked a fair bit about the cost initiatives you guys are undertaking. Any thoughts on how are you trying to address the revenue declines as well, not just for this year, but beyond that. I guess a very small clarification for Jeann, for the Warid business, is book value the right gauge of the market value in the current environment or the market value could even be higher?

          <p>Kevin, do you want to talk about revenue top line in Australia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Just starting with the main clarification in terms of the shortfall for this quarter, the decline this quarter, obviously the termination rate is a major contributor to that. That's obviously offset by savings in termination cost, and we've also seen reductions in equipment sales, which again are offset by equipment costs, are negligible in terms of profit contribution.</p>
          <p>But the core for us is how we get our outgoing revenues or access revenues moving up again. For the quarter, they were stable. I think it was about 0.9% up on the comparable quarter last year, before the amortization of service credits. But obviously we would like that to move more strongly in the future. I think the key &#x2013; I know that the key to that will ultimately be how we monetize data. So we are focused immediately on steps in the last few months in terms of rebalancing data allowances. We've done that in 3G and pulled those through in 4G. But obviously we see a big opportunity in terms of how we rollout 4G network and start to put in price plans that can generate improved revenues in data.</p>
          <p>On fixed, with the price increases in fixed in the recent &#x2013; just one month ago, we are aware that we are in an environment where costs are going up potentially by CPI, you have to get into a pretty regular rhythm in terms of reviewing pricing and price increases and products like fixed, we will look at on an ongoing basis. And then opportunities, we also have in bundling. We have clear execution opportunities in bundling as we move forward as well. So we are bullish in terms of growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>I think the final one that we're very confident about as well, I'm quite excited about it, is how we can manage our churn levels down. So the network improvements in the last six months in Australia have been significant. Our 3G Plus rollout, our refarming U900 has improved indoor coverage in 3G, up from levels in the low-70%s, up to the levels of 90% in core coverage areas, and we do see that cascading through into churn, probably in future quarters beyond the next two quarters when iPhone first comes out. But we see benefits from that in terms of growth as well.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we see a number of opportunities, but data is probably the key one.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, guys. I just had two questions for you, just maybe for Kevin. Just firstly, just in terms of acquisition of Vivid, can you talk about what your plans are for the business, what your plans of the spectrum that you acquired and how this actually fits into your 4G rollout that you were alluding to before?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just in terms of the Optus postpaid ARPU. Can you talk about the factors driving the 10% decline and when you hope to see these factors come out and that ARPU stabilized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So again, just in terms of network, get it out in the marketplace in 4G with strong network coverage and key metrics is key for us just now. We managed to get out just before iPhone 5 launched, which obviously the LTE capability in iPhone 5 was key. But in the Australian marketplace, 4G will be &#x2013; 4G LTE will be a battleground and there's a clear focus on the main competitor, Telstra, in that area.</p>
          <p>So the Vivid spectrum at 2300 is a very large slot of spectrum that will enable us in due course to launch a service that will have speeds which lead the marketplace, which for us is very important, both from our customer experience standpoint, but also from a brand positioning standpoint up against Telstra.</p>
          <p>We'll announce plans as we go forward in 2013. But obviously we want to get out into the marketplace sooner rather than later, the key <mark type="ph" /> metrics (32:37). So that Vividwireless is a core part of how we differentiate in terms of customer experience and brand kind of 2013 onwards.</p>
          <p>In terms of ARPU, the main contributors to the ARPU shortfall come, as we said before, in terms of termination rates coming down, and also in terms of service credits falling through. We have pulled back on service credits over the last couple of quarters. We do see termination rates, obviously they're mandated to continue to come down. Outgoing ARPU has dropped fractionally and our focus will be trying to stabilize that over the next 12 months or so.</p>
          <p>Any other comments, Murray?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think, as you said, it's sort of three components, termination rate and the service credits from the DRP claim and then the lower ARPU as a result of some of the pricing changes in the marketplace that occurred some 12 months ago, flowing now through the base. But in more recent times, you see more rational pricing in the marketplace, but that will take some time to move through the customer base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only other point I'd make is, if you sit in the business, you have to have a look at how you balance your pricing across both ARPU or access fees and handset pricing. And I think steps we've made on reducing subsidies or improving &#x2013; increasing handset pricing has been a core part of how we move our customer pricing up in the marketplace. We also think the overall market dynamic is quite rational in that respect.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you for the call. I have two questions. First of all, on NCS, the revenues continue to be pretty strong on this front. Could you help us understand to what extent this is projects coming to gestation and therefore reaping the benefits of the investments put in previously? Do we think that this trend will continue into the medium to long term or is this unique to FY 2013? That's one.</p>
          <p>And secondly, with Pixable and some of the other acquisitions, could you help us understand the rationale of buying the company rather than just offering the service to customers as a user?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think in terms of NCS, we have given guidance for the Group Enterprise revenue growth for the &#x2013; it will grow low single digit and NCS is very much a part of it and we have started with the creation of the business unit under Group Enterprise. NCS is very much integrated into it.</p>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; it has benefited from certain government contracts, particularly MOE, which is a multi-year contract. On the IT&amp;E side, you did see dilution in revenue from the fiber rollout. That, I think, is basically because you have hit 95% of the mass rollout so that revenue would automatically fall-off in terms of the completion &#x2013; the milestone completion. I think, in terms of NCS, we continue to benefit from the demand from the government sector and also with cloud computing that we see some positive traction there.</p>

I think when we look at a contract is that delivery of equipment is always upfront and then obviously it is a multi-year services contract. So there was some lumpiness at the start &#x2013; at the onset of the contract, but I think we have also highlighted that a lot of that delivery has already happened in terms of the IT equipment at this point.</p>

          <p>This is Allen. In regards to your question about how do we decide what companies in the digital space to acquire or to make a small investment. We're basically focusing on three major areas where we're seeing that opportunity for us that leverage off the assets that we have and leverage off our understanding of where consumer trends are going in the digital space. So the companies that we spot fit one of these three major opportunities, then we will acquire them.</p>
          <p>There are a host of also other opportunities that we keep an eye on. They may not be from our perspective leading to a major trend but sometimes it makes sense to just keep tabs on how they are developing or they may have an interesting technology which is not prevalent yet but we believe in future it will be prevalent. In those cases, we will make a small investment and we will make that through our corporate VC arm of the company called Innov8.</p>
          <p>So in the case of Pixable, we clearly feel that they are in the area of photo discovery, which is -</p>
          <p>We see that with mobile devices and we see that with photos becoming such an integral part of how people communicate in their social world that Pixable is something that will be a major trend in future. So we've decided that we will acquire it and basically we feel that it will be an anchor company for us as we move towards leading and shaping the future of interactions in the social world.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions. Just, first of all in Optus, just for clarification on the new guidance. Obviously we've now got mid-single digit declines and stable EBITDA. I mean, just looking at the first half results, revenues were down 3.7%, EBITDA was down 1.2%, so are we expecting based on the guidance revenues to accelerate to the downside. If so, is there any reason for that outside than what you flagged? And additionally for EBITDA improvement, is that presumably just because we're going to go through even a lower subsidy environment in the second half? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second thing is, you talked about obviously more stable pricing in terms of data with obviously credits being pulled back. Do you think we need to actually go through another pricing lift for profitability to grow back into that space?</p>
          <p>And lastly, just on the CapEx side, I noticed that CapEx in mobile was obviously down quarter-on-quarter. It's now tracking about 11% for the half. I would have thought we would have started to see a little bit of a ramp up as we've gone through and brought forward some of the 4G expenditure. I'm just trying to get a more clarity in terms of how you see CapEx in mobile expanding over the next half but also into the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Richard, it's Murray here. In relation to your question on guidance, obviously we're not providing guidance with regards to the second half. We do believe, for the full year, the revenue guidance &#x2013; revised revenue guidance is mid-single digit decline, somewhat consistent with the first half performance. So we're not indicating one way or the other in relation to revenues moving adverse or favorable to the first half. We do believe that EBITDA has been stable in the first half and we will continue to hold stability of EBITDA being held flat year-on-year as we're reaffirming the guidance on EBITDA.</p>
          <p>You have seen us actively managing our cost base through optimization of subsidy costs and we will continue to do that in the marketplace, but we've also taken action with regards to other areas of costs such as our workforce restructuring. They'll be some <mark type="ph" /> 500 to 1,000 (41:24) heads lower in the organization as a consequence of that restructuring. And also you've seen us taking action with regards to our distribution, sort of moving away from non-branded distribution but investing in branded distribution and again there'll be acquisition costs and retention cost savings as a consequence of that. So we will continue to proactively manage the cost base to ensure we deliver to the EBITDA guidance that we're reaffirming today.</p>
          <p>On your question on the mobile CapEx, the mobile CapEx we continue to <mark type="ph" /> write-down (41:56) our CapEx investment into mobile consistent with what you saw last year and this year our mobile</p>
          <p>CapEx is running at sort of just over 50% of our overall capital investment. So the differences between quarter one and quarter two are more to do with phasing. You did see us accelerate our investment in 3G, the U900 refarm, and into 4G rollout. Some of that capital investment flowed into quarter one, some of it in quarter two. So the difference, as I indicated, between quarter one and quarter two is more phasing.</p>
          <p>Kevin, do you want to take the <mark type="ph" /> data pricing (42:30)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, just on pricing, I think you're obviously seeing a position where our net customer growth is not offsetting the impact of price in the marketplace. I think that is being recognized across the industry. I think there is a rationality emerging in pricing, so I do expect that rationality &#x2013; I believe that rationality will continue, but I also think that the industry is now very much focused on how you make money from data and 4G, and LTE. It's a very exciting opportunity for us, and I think what you'll see is pricing lift. I think you'll see pricing be restructured in terms of how we all in the marketplace make better returns on our investments in LTE. I think you'll start to see that come through increasingly in the next 12 months.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It suggests that there are scope beyond what we're seeing today for improved yields going forward, and that scope is not just in pricing going up. I think what we are demonstrating just now is that there are opportunities to manage cost in a more focused manner to ensure that yields can improve as you go forward. We're quite confident you will see that from Optus moving forward.</p>

          <p>Maybe, Kevin, just a follow-up, the postpaid ARPU is down 10%. I know there was a question asked before. If you strip out the MTAS impact from the MRO impacts, were postpaid ARPU is still down year-on-year?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, it's Murray again. I'll take that. You've seen our MD&amp;A. Although we're not disclosing separately the impact in postpaid ARPU of MTAS and the service credits, we are in respect of the overall blended ARPU indicating ex the termination rate declines and the service credits, our blended ARPU is down around 2.3%. So, there is some decline in relation to &#x2013; as a consequence of some of the pricing pressures we've seen in the marketplace that are flowing through, predominately into our postpaid customer base at this point in time.</p>
          <p>But as you've seen in more recent times, it's a bit more stable with more rational pricing in the marketplace, but that will take some time to be reflected in the customer base and to be reflected in the ARPUs. So, the decline you're seeing at this point is more a reflection of past pricing practices.</p>

          <p>Hi, I have two questions. First one is on the Amobee, where you have &#x2013; there's some dilution from your EBITDA as a result from start-up losses there, but can you give us some sort of guidance on Amobee where if you think if losses will continue to widen further before things begin to improve or do you think the worst is behind it?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on your allocations for investments in further Digital Life investments. Could you give us some sort of idea how much you have allocated for further investments there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Allen. Regarding your questions on Digital Life, the first one regarding Amobee &#x2013; Amobee is in the mobile advertising space. We have a clear road map and business plan for them. Unfortunately, we don't disclose the details of our companies on a company by company basis, so I can't give you that indication. I think suffice to say right now that we believe that they are in a space which has huge growth potential as people start to move their advertising dollars from mass market on TV, print, et cetera, onto something that's more targeted like mobiles both in developed as well as developing markets.</p>
          <p>So I think all of you will have to watch this space, so to speak, and see how we progress with this company. I think it's in a high growth market and we'll continue to push them to make sure that they get traction there. I think &#x2013; overall, I think for Group Digital Life, we have a very clear strategy of what we want to do, as I mentioned a little bit earlier. We have a very clear focus on three major areas which we think has potential for us, and we will be very targeted in focusing on companies in that area.</p>
          <p>I think, in terms of how much capital we've allocated for that, I think that's a discussion we've had with our Board and we are not prepared at this stage to disclose that. I think in time we will bring through the level of clarity that we want to share with everybody regarding that. It is a very competitive space. So, for the time being, we are keeping our cards close to the chest, so to speak, and we will &#x2013; we have the will and we certainly have the support of our Board to go ahead into this space in a very targeted fashion. I hope that answers your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Roshan from Merrill Lynch. Thanks for the call. Just one question from me. How do you think the substitution impact on Pay-As-You-Roam voice and SMS will play out with the other plans like Bridge DataRoam and what kind of revenue trend as a result will be seen in the near to medium term? The second question is on equipment sales in Singapore, just want to figure out why was it down QoQ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is Moon here. On the roaming pay-as-you-use <mark type="ph" /> sort of (48:25) data substitution, we are seeing a very similar trend as in behaviors of users while they roam, very similar to what they are using locally. So in the local sense, you see that we have created tiered plans &#x2013; data plans so that we actually allow people to migrate from their voice to data usage in a very comfortable manner. So on the roaming aspect now, we are seeing a similar trend, where consumers are actually substituting data usage, substituting voice in place of data, and to facilitate that we are actually providing Bridge DataRoam plan, as you have mentioned, and that has been gaining some traction. So this is currently a transition phase where more and more customers are discovering that they can actually use Bridge DataRoam plans while they roam, so that they can use their data freely, similar to what they behave in the local context when they're at a home market.</p>
          <p>I think the big difference is really about the Pay-As-You-Roam sort of rates in the past, where it's been extremely high and users actually got bill shock once they come back from roaming, they are fearful of using it. So this is actually mitigated by the introduction and promoting of a Bridge DataRoam. So we expect this to actually migrate into Bridge DataRoam plans in the next few quarters as roamers begin to understand how to manage their roaming cost better with Bridge DataRoam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:55), so do you expect kind of &#x2013; the extent of usage on Bridge DataRoam plans that will increase or over time you will actually re-price some of these plans so that the revenue trends as a result, ARPU trends also start benefiting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think there are two things that we are doing. Firstly is actually to encourage more roamers to switch onto data while they roam, and this is done through Bridge DataRoam plans, which is actually a very good, daily, unlimited data usage while they roam. And this will mitigate some of their concerns of bill shock as they roam. And we are seeing more and more people turning this on and we are increasing our efforts to market this service over time. So you see a transition of people, while they cut back on the Pay-As-You-Use data plans while they roam, will be switched into Bridge DataRoam plan.</p>
          <p>So this transition will also have some impact on margins, because the margins in the past for roaming data, Pay-As-You-Use, is actually much higher than the Bridge DataRoam. So that switch is coming through now and I think we'll see more people using Bridge DataRoaming going forward.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Hello. Just following on from Kelvin's question on some of the Digitel acquisitions, Amobee in particular, I think revenue was S$18 million for the quarter. I wondered if you'd give some broad idea firstly on growth rates, anticipated growth rates, and then secondly what would be a breakeven level for Amobee. And the second question, a bit of a strange one, are there any statutory requirements for your major shareholder to reduce their stake below 50%? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think with regard to giving you further color <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:07) on Amobee, I'm afraid I can't do that. I think obviously it's still very much a start-up in an environment which is a fast growing one, so obviously you can make your judgment with regard to our expectations of a company that we own that has a significant presence with a unique product in a fast growing market. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:30)</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, morning. Two questions from me, please, again both on Optus. One, can you help us understand accounting as well as the cash impact of the service credit on both revenues and cost, and what percentage of the postpaid customer base are basically availing of this service and when do you expect steady state here? The second one is on the guidance for Optus in terms of stable EBITDA. Does it take into account the A$20 million restructuring charges to be booked in the December quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rama, do you mind repeating the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second one is on the Optus stable EBITDA guidance. And there is a A$20 million to be booked in the December quarter as far as for the restructuring charges, so I'm just wondering is this already baked into the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Murray here. I'll take those questions. So in respect to the service credits, I think, if I understand the question correctly, you're just asking for the impact on revenue and cost and cash flow. So, firstly from a cash flow point of view, it is no different from any other rate plan and that is that the customer gets a subsidized handset at the outset, so Optus has to fund the cost of the handset at the time of connection of the customer.</p>
          <p>From an accounting perspective &#x2013; sorry, firstly, the rate paying construct is such that it is a separate contract in respect to handset repayment by the customer and a separate service contract. As a consequence of that construct, the accounting implications are that the customer is charged a handset repayment on a monthly basis. And we then, while the customer stays with us, we provide a service credit to them on a monthly basis.</p>
          <p>If the customer was to cancel the contract, we would recover the full amount of outstanding handset repayments. Therefore, you see on a monthly basis the credits flowing through onto the revenue line at the time of customer connections because the handset cost is being deferred into receivable, that handset cost is then essentially amortized over the life of the customer contract.</p>
          <p>In relation to take up on the postpaid base, we don't provide specific details in relation to the overall take-up of those rate plans. They are in the marketplace for commercial reasons. We want to educate the customer in respect to the cost of the handset they are getting and particularly applies to customers who're getting zero-dollar handsets. If the customer is making a contribution to the cost of the handset, they will be on a different type of a rate plan construct.</p>
          <p>So it really depends at the time of the marketplace which handsets we have for those rate plans applying to. At this point in time, it's to the high end rate plans such as iPhone 32-gig and above.</p>
          <p>I think the second question, if I understand it correctly, you note in our MD&amp;A we disclosed that we have done some further workforce restructuring. And as a consequence, there'll be some ex-gratia payments made and they were made in the period of October, and therefore we'll bring them to accounting quarter three. We've indicated that A$30 million will be booked in quarter three.</p>
          <p>The guidance is EBITDA guidance. The ex-gratia payments, as detailed in quarter one, are treated as exceptional items below the EBITDA line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. So, in terms of the &#x2013; again, on the service credits, then how would you &#x2013; how should we think about it in terms of when do you expect steady state <mark type="ph" /> referring (58:07) to this on the revenue line here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't provide guidance on specific revenue items, but I think we have in the last two quarters indicated the impact of service credits on our outgoing service revenue. And as we've been explicit in this quarter's numbers that it's around A$25 million-odd, so you can see that we are giving transparency to the number and it's not material in respect of our overall revenues. So, as I said, the overall, looking forward it will be a consequence of the take-up of those types of rate plans both in the past and in the future. So it's very hard for us to be prescriptive in respect of impact into future quarters of these credits.</p>
