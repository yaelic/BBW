          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call of Deutsche Bank. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Joachim M&#xFC;ller, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of Deutsche Bank, I would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter analyst call from Frankfurt. By now you should have access to all of our publications, which you will find on our website. Anshu Jain, our Co-CEO, would start off this call and provide the highlights of our full-year results. Our CFO, Stefan Krause, will then walk you through our financials in detail.</p>
          <p>As usual, please take notice of the cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements at the end of the presentation.</p>
          <p>And with that, I immediately hand over to Anshu.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joachim, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As you've seen, our revenues in the fourth quarter were resilient despite a difficult environment, &#x20AC;7.9 billion in revenue, up &#x20AC;1 billion on the same quarter in 2011. Most pleasingly, our Basel 2 core Tier 1 ratio now stands at 8%, 80 basis points ahead of the 7.2% target that we set ourselves for the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>However, we do have a pre-tax loss of &#x20AC;2.6 billion in the fourth quarter and a full-year profit of &#x20AC;1.4 billion, which is way below the &#x20AC;5.4 billion that we had in 2011. This reflects a number of decisions that we've taken, especially in the fourth quarter, many of which have been taken to position Deutsche Bank well for the future. Let me walk you through some of those positions.</p>
          <p>The Non-Core Operations Unit has taken a full-year loss of &#x20AC;2.4 billion of that there's &#x20AC;1.1 billion loss in the fourth quarter, but equally has given us a reduction in risk-weighted assets of &#x20AC;29 billion, which in the net is a capital generation of &#x20AC;2.5 billion. So significantly net accretive.</p>
          <p>Litigation impairment charges in our core bank have totaled &#x20AC;1.5 billion and &#x20AC;1 billion respectively, which is &#x20AC;2.5 billion significant. Stefan will provide more details on that in a few minutes. The core bank adjusted profitability has been strong, &#x20AC;6.5 billion in 2012. And this, after absorbing cost to achieve and other costs of &#x20AC;1.4 billion. So you can actually back out in 2012, core bank IBIT of nearly &#x20AC;8 billion.</p>
          <p>Now if you move to slide three, you can see we've galvanized Deutsche Bank around the creation and the achievement of our capital targets. When J&#xFC;rgen and I presented our full-year plan and Project 2015 in September, we reflected the feedback from clients, regulators, employees, analysts and investors, which was clear: Capital has to be our top priority. J&#xFC;rgen and I are very glad and very pleased with the team, which has actually acted across all aspects, pulled every lever in order to be able to achieve us to attain this target.</p>
          <p>Let me point out some very key features around this target. This has allowed us to narrow our gap to peers. We believe that's the fastest Basel III organic capital formation of any major peer in 2012. It's been achieved by reducing our non-core risk-weighted assets by the equivalent of &#x20AC;29 billion; I said that to you a little bit earlier.</p>
          <p>And in our core business, we have a reduction of &#x20AC;51 billion through a combination of measures, better models and processes, and de-risking through asset sales and hedging. Here I do have to acknowledge the fact that benign circumstances, really from July onwards; thanks to some of the actions taken by central banks and really the euro crisis getting through the most acute &#x2013; of phase has definitely been of assistance to us.</p>
          <p>In simple terms, this is the equivalent of raising &#x20AC;8 billion of core Tier 1 capital without dilution. Many of you had given us a feedback of that's what we should have done. We stayed rather mute, and indeed we feel we've been able to achieve the targets we promised you.</p>
          <p>In addition to achieving our targets, I'm also pleased to announce that we are increasing, as you would expect, our targets to 8.5% by March 2013. And needless to say, if we were to hit that, which we're highly confident we will, that will finally put us back in with our peer group.</p>
          <p>On slide four, you can see our second significant promise to you was to deliver &#x20AC;4.5 billion in annual run rate savings off of full-year cost base of &#x20AC;27 billion, back when we spoke to you in September. Pleased to tell you that this program as well is on track. We've delivered savings on a run rate basis of &#x20AC;400 million in 2012. Where is this coming from? It's coming from, really, two sets of &#x2013; two dimensions of cost saving activities.</p>
          <p>In the front office, all our businesses are now enacting the plans that we mentioned to you they would. I would specially single out here the investment bank and the Asset and Wealth Management unit, which are well ahead actually even of some of the targets they had set themselves in terms of front-office head count and other cost reduction.</p>
          <p>On the infrastructure side, there's a series of initiatives under way, amongst which, I would have to say, the IT platform renewal and the footprint rationalization have played a very strong role. In addition to what we've achieved in 2012, for 2013 we already have visibility towards &#x20AC;800 million of cost savings out of the &#x20AC;1.6 billion that we've set ourselves. And in short we are as committed and as confident that we'll achieve this goal as we are of anything else.</p>
          <p>If you move to slide five, you can see that as we move on from capital and costs, very important that our franchise continues to remain strong. Clearly, as we set our bank up for the future, it's vital that we continue to defend and protect and grow our market share. I'm very pleased that we've been able to do that. Again, Stefan will take you through the detail business by business, but let me just give you some highlights.</p>
          <p>Starting with PBC, I'm very proud of our PBC business. They're facing tremendous headwinds that that have increased market share in Germany; have a profitable European business; and are ahead of schedule in delivering synergies from the Postbank integration. Assets and Wealth Management is a strategically crucial business for us. Michele Faissola and his team have the task of merging five businesses into one. It's a considerable task. Significant progress has been made, but we are under no illusions. It will take some time in order for them to be able to turn this business around. I'm confident that it'll emerge as a strong pillar, but a lot still needs to be done.</p>
          <p>GTB's core business had strong market share growth across all areas and a very good return on capital. With our significant charges in 2012, pre-tax profits would have been 12% higher than 2011.</p>
          <p>CB&amp;S has faced the stiffest significant headwinds and significant management transition, but it's strengthening its leadership, doing more with less and a global dominance. It's crucial to do.</p>
          <p>So finally, for me to conclude my opening remarks, business outlook in 2013 is better than we would have felt at this time last year. The eurozone has stabilized. The U.S. economy is growing. We have some major challenges from regulation; the sheer volume of regulatory change; every aspect of our business is being scrutinized; we have significant uncertainties around the implementation of some of these changes; but most of all, we are concerned about the emerging lack of a level playing field out of line with the initial G20 proposed international coordination.</p>
          <p>So to conclude, we feel we've embarked on the most comprehensive reconfiguration of Deutsche Bank in recent times. Our client franchise remains robust. This has enabled us to take deliberate, but tough decisions to position us for the future. We're confident that the strategic direction we've taken is correct. But we have to remind you that we are under no illusion. This journey will take years not months, and we are listening very carefully to feedback from clients and employees, which so far has been very encouraging.</p>
          <p>With that, Stefan, let me hand it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Anshu, and good morning from my side as well. Now that Anshu has provided you with the full-year highlights in context of the Strategy 2015+, I will go ahead and comment on some of the results and key issues in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The results this quarter were clearly impacted by the management actions taken as part of the implementation of the bank's new strategy, which I will walk you through in a moment in a couple of slides that you have in front of you. However, I would like to point out that our proposed dividend remains at &#x20AC;0.75 per share and our capital ratios under Basel 2.5, again, improved substantially. Total adjusted assets came down while liquidity reserves increased again, now also including the contribution from Postbank, as you can see in our overview.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to page nine. As you can see here, for the quarter, the Group reported a pre-tax loss of &#x20AC;2.6 billion of which &#x20AC;1.5 billion is attributable to our core bank and &#x20AC;1.1 billion from our Non-Core Operations Unit. The true underlying earnings are more accurately reflected when excluding the two non-operational and specific items in the quarter, approximately &#x20AC;1.9 billion for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and &#x20AC;1 billion for significant litigation related charges.</p>
          <p>On this basis, as you can see in the chart, for the first quarter we present an adjusted pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;287 million for the Group and &#x20AC;978 million for the core bank. These numbers are not adjusted for additional specific items, which we consider to be outside our normal operations including cost achieved and other restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>On page 10, you'd see that the core bank's reported pre-tax profit for the full year 2012 was &#x20AC;3.8 billion, adjusted for the same and aforementioned major non-operational items. As you can see here on the chart, pre-tax profit of the core bank was &#x20AC;6.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to page 11. The table provides you with an overview of adjusted IBIT by segment as well as the details of further specific items impacting the segments. We do obviously clearly understand that we have quite a lot of one-off issues, and that's why we provided here some further information and transparency on this. On the next slide, I will discuss the most significant items of the impairment of the goodwill and the intangible assets. So let's turn to page 12.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we took impairment charges of &#x20AC;1.9 billion in total, of which &#x20AC;1.6 million related to goodwill and about &#x20AC;300 million related to other intangible assets. The impairments were mainly attributable to businesses acquired prior to 2003 by CB&amp;S, for example, Bankers Trust, and by Asset and Wealth Management, which is current.</p>
          <p>The timing and size of the impairments reflect the bank's implementation of strategic initiative, including the accelerated de-risking of non-core activities; the implementation of the operational excellence program; and the introduction of a new divisional structure, including the creation of a dedicated Non-Core Operations Unit. The impairment also reflects the impact of market conditions on parameters underlying the valuation of the affected business unit.</p>
          <p>Of the &#x20AC;1.9 billion impairment, &#x20AC;1.2 billion were attributable to CB&amp;S and about &#x20AC;400 million to the NCOU, and &#x20AC;200 million to Asset and Wealth Management. Please note that the impairment does not impact the bank's pro forma Basel 3 fully-loaded core Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>Turn to page 13; you'd see the ongoing strength of the franchise, which is reflected by our strong revenue streams both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. I think that solid revenue base allowed us to take decisive actions and continue to execute our strategic vision.</p>
          <p>On page 14, you'd see our provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter, which came down from &#x20AC;555 million to &#x20AC;434 million. As you can see, this is mainly a result of lower credit losses in relation to IAS 39 reclassified assets, which are now part of the NCOU. As you know, the IFRS accounting effect recognizes releases from Postbank allowances taking before consolidation its revenues and not as an offset to credit loss provision. Therefore, the true decline in credit losses was more pronounced declining by &#x20AC;176 million over the quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, full-year 2013, we expect a stable level of credit losses.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to page 15, where we provide you with our usual non-interest expense development, giving all the specific items this quarter. I would like to draw your attention immediately to the next page.</p>
          <p>This table represents how we would like you to look at our cost base. Firstly, from the reported non-interest expenses, we adjust for the impairment of intangibles and the significant litigation items. These are the adjustments we included in our adjusted IBIT calculation. Secondly, we adjust for specific items arising mainly from management decisions such as our costs to achieve for our operational excellence and other items. After these two categories of adjustments, our cost base is roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. Regrettably, the impact of the operational program will not allow us to show progress in the reported cost line for a while as we announced in our strategy announcement in September.</p>
          <p>On page 17, we promised to provide you increased transparency in our compensation cost, and this is how we can show, added on the chart, and this is how we show &#x2013; how we compensate to our people for our performance during the year 2012. As you can see, we've again brought down our variable compensation both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues. It is also worth highlighting that we've reduced the percentage of deferred compensation to 47%.</p>
          <p>One of the recommendations of our external compensation panel was that we need to track more of the balance between aligning costs with the revenue period in which they were incurred and making sure employees are properly incentivized to make long-term value-creating decisions. We think that 47% deferral ratio strikes this balance.</p>
          <p>Of course, it comes at a cost for the 2012 performance. Had we kept our deferral ratio unchanged at 61%, our compensation ratio would have been slightly below the reported 40%. At the same time, we would have mortgaged further the future years.</p>
          <p>On page 18, you'll find details of our compensation cost. Including the deferrals from the variable compensation to be awarded in February 2013, there's a total of &#x20AC;2.8 billion compensation award which by the end of 2012 had not been expensed yet. This accounting treatment reflects the fact that the awards include a future service requirement from employees who would typically lose these awards if they voluntarily leave the company before the vesting. And most of these awards can be clawed back before vesting under specific conditions.</p>
          <p>As we showed you at Investor Day, we'll also provide the amortization schedule for these unvested awards. On the right-hand side, you can see some of the findings from the work of the compensation panel on the chart.</p>
          <p>On page 19, this slide puts our reporting and adjusted pre-tax profit in a quarterly context. Let me say a quick word on our tax rate. We show an income tax benefit at 16%, which is primarily impacted by expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, which include the impairments of goodwill and intangibles.</p>
          <p>So let me now move on to page 20. We finished the quarter with a core Tier 1 ratio of 11.6%, which is approximately 80 basis points higher compared to Q3. The increase in our core Tier 1 ratio is the result of our successful de-risking initiative program, which I will talk about more later on.</p>
          <p>With regard to our Tier 1 ratio, let me put things into perspective. This ratio which only a few years ago was managed to achieve a target of greater 10% and to 8% to 9% before that now stands at 15.3%; and this under the most stringent rules of Basel 2.5.</p>
          <p>Let me review the capital and risk-weighted asset development in the quarter in a bit more detail on the next slide. To start with, the negative impact of our fourth quarter net loss on our core Tier 1 capital and our related ratios was relatively small at 9 basis points; as goodwill and intangibles are already deducted from regulatory capital, so an impairment of these items has no impact.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the other more significant fourth quarter movements are the positive effects of our capital build program which are the most visible here, as you can see on the slide, in two areas. First of all, in core Tier 1 capital where securitization-related capital deductions have come down by about &#x20AC;0.5 billion as we've sold highly capital-consumptive positions.</p>
          <p>And secondly, in risk-weighted assets where we achieved a reduction of &#x20AC;32.5 billion, this reflects primarily the risk-weighted asset reduction efforts in credit risk-weighted assets focused on our Non-Core Operations Unit, as well as the portfolio optimization, model rollout, and operating model improvement in our core businesses.</p>
          <p>But also, &#x20AC;11 billion lower market risk-weighted asset through the strengthening of our internal market risk models and processes over the last three years. This improvement has led to a reduction of our market risk multiplier from 5.5 to 4, which brings us more in line with peers and has been approved by our regulators.</p>
          <p>On page 22, as you can see with a fully-loaded Basel 3 pro forma ratio of 8%, we had clearly outperformed on our 7.2% target for the 1 of January 2013 that we communicated last year. So let me walk you through how we get there from Basel 2.5. Firstly, we see a &#x20AC;75 billion with risk-weighted asset increase in relation to Basel 3 in the phase-in case. This increase is far below what we were before our successful core Tier 1 initiatives. Moving on to the fully-loaded case, when we see an &#x20AC;8 billion risk-weighted asset reduction driven by capital deductions working as risk-weighted asset buffers as well as the 10/15 rule.</p>
          <p>Second, on regulatory capital, we want to show you additional details regarding the phase-in rules. Those rules that would be valid right now if Basel 3 had gone live on January 1. Note that under Basel 2.5, we always put all Tier 1 capital deductions straight against core Tier 1 capital when presenting this ratio. The current draft legislation will not require us to do so in the phase-in period, but allows us to apply capital deductions, first, against additional Tier 1 capital such as hybrids. As a result, under the phase-in approach, our core Tier 1 capital would be higher by &#x20AC;11 billion and the ratio would actually increase by approximately 90 basis points to 12.5%, far above all regulatory requirements.</p>
          <p>Now moving over to Basel 3 fully-loaded and taking all Basel 3 capital deductions, which then have to be put against common equity Tier 1 capital, we would see a &#x20AC;19 billion capital decrease to &#x20AC;32 billion. This &#x20AC;19 billion of deductions relate mainly to a reversal of the &#x20AC;11 billion already mentioned, as well as deferred tax assets, but also to items such as pension funds, DVA and minority interest and others. So the fully-loaded ratio is, therefore, 8% now. And given our excellent progress on de-risking, we've now raised our March 2013 fully-loaded Basel 3 core Tier 1 target ratio to 8.5%.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to page 23. As already mentioned in October, we achieved &#x20AC;25 billion of Basel 3 de-risking in the third quarter. And now I'm pleased to inform you that we've accomplished a further &#x20AC;55 billion in the fourth quarter, which means that we are already at &#x20AC;80 billion of our &#x20AC;90 billion previously communicated Basel 3 capital toolbox measures. So clearly, we can say, very well on track. Therefore, we've to increase our planned de-risking from &#x20AC;90 billion to over &#x20AC;100 billion, all to be achieved by March 2013.</p>
          <p>Now let me take you through how we achieve this in some more detail. Let's go over to page 24. As you can see, we achieved more than 50% of the de-risking for the quarter and about 60% for the second half of 2012 from asset sales and hedging in the Non-Core Unit and core businesses.</p>
          <p>Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we achieved an additional &#x20AC;11 billion risk-weighted asset reduction to a decrease in our VaR multiplier from 5.5 to 4. But remember, this only corrects our previous overcharge and brings us closer in line with peers. Also in the quarter, we've received approval from our regulator, BaFin, for certain credit risk-related models, for example, IRBA model.</p>
          <p>As we showed to you at Investor Day, we have an obligation to roll these models out to comply with BaFin-designed coverage levels of exposure. As a result of these approvals, we exceeded the German minimum regulatory requirement of 92% coverage at year-end. Finally, we achieved &#x20AC;8 billion risk-weighted asset reduction from operating model improvements. Examples include migration of additional derivatives into our approved IMM model or consideration of netting agreements under migration of additional derivatives into &#x2013; netting in legal review, sorry. I jumped a line.</p>
          <p>Page 25. Before I move off the capital topic, let me make a few remarks regarding the publication of the draft FPO rules by the Fed in December 2012. Deutsche Bank is evaluating the potential impact of its proposed rules on the group's business, semi and financial statements. Based on the proposals, the Fed laid out in the draft which is open for comment until the middle of March 2013, Deutsche Bank is thoroughly assessing the measures that may need to be taken with respect to its U.S. subsidiaries. These measures include the creation of an intermediate holding company, IHC, that would consolidate Deutsche Bank's U.S. subsidiaries; a reduction in U.S. GAAP assets over the next 2.5 years to decrease the additional capital requirements; and conversion of existing intergroup liabilities into equity instruments in 2015 to meet the additional capital requirements.</p>
          <p>The effect of these measures and the impact on the P&amp;L in the next 2.5 years has already been taken into account for the 2012 HGB evaluation of Deutsche Bank's investment in U.S. subsidiaries. As of today, we expect an impairment of roughly &#x20AC;2 billion to &#x20AC;2.5 billion for the Deutsche Bank AG stand-alone account under HGB. There is no impact of the impairment on the group's consolidated financial statements under IFRS or the Basel 2.5 or Basel 3 capital ratios. The management board proposes a dividend of &#x20AC;0.75 for 2012 based on this HGB account rules. Please note that we do not envisage any additional investment in U.S. subsidiaries due to these proposed rules.</p>
          <p>Our investment bank's performance, we could see on page 26, was resilient in the fourth quarter and delivered solid results in the context of the normal seasonal slowdown, exacerbated by a very strong third quarter 2012. Full year 2012 CB&amp;S revenue, excluding DVA gains in the fourth quarter, are up 7%, while VaR is significantly down, resulting in a significant uptick in our return-on-VaR ratio which continues to remain market-leading.</p>
          <p>The DVA charges in the fourth quarter were driven by a refinement of the methodology related to the fair value of uncollateralized derivative liabilities. There has been no change in the methodology towards valuation of own debt where it was carried at fair value. We had only three negative trading days in 2012, a testament to the stability of our revenue model.</p>
          <p>CB&amp;S Basel 2.5 risk-weighted assets were down 13% quarter-over-quarter and 20% year-over-year, demonstrating our commitment to resource efficiency. Our cost-saving initiatives delivered material savings in full-year 2012. However, this has been more than offset by adverse FX impact cost to achieve higher litigation-related charges and the goodwill impairment. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and adjusting for the full-year cost to achieve, 2012 IBIT was up 21%. On restructuring, we've made good progress. As at the end of fourth quarter, 1,400 of the announced 1,500 head count reduction in CB&amp;S and related infrastructure functions have been completed.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to sales and trading. Fourth quarter debt, sales and trading revenues were negatively impacted by approximately &#x20AC;200 million impact stemming from changes in the estimation method called CVA and risk-weighted mitigation. Our client franchise remains market-leading and we rank number one in Overall Global Fixed Income by Greenwich Associates for the third year in a row.</p>
          <p>In FX, we saw a record client volume for any fourth quarter. We, therefore, achieved record client volume in each of the fourth quarters of 2012 and for the full year. In rates and flow credit, our revenues were down quarter-on-quarter across most products, reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown exacerbated by an exceptionally strong third quarter.</p>
          <p>In equities, a solid performance in equity derivatives was offset by lower revenues in cash equities and prime finance, resulting in lower revenues quarter-on-quarter. In cash equities, our revenues held up well quarter-on-quarter, down only slightly despite the fourth quarter seasonal decline supported by market share gains in Europe. Full-year revenues were flat with particularly strong performance in North America and market share gains in Europe.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn over to page 29, origination, advisory. For full-year 2012, we are ranked number five with record market share globally and in the U.S. This is a testament to the strength of the franchise and the increasing productivity of the business. In EMEA, we are ranked number one.</p>
          <p>DB was named Bond House of the Year and Equity House of the Year in 2012 by the IFR Magazine. DB is the only European bank to receive both these awards in the same year. The M&amp;A environment continues to be positive and we have a healthy pipeline of deals.</p>
          <p>On page 30, we talk about our Global Transaction Banking business. As you can see, the fourth quarter earnings were adversely impacted by a litigation related charge, as well as turnaround measures of the commercial banking activities in the Netherlands, for example, restructuring charges. These charges of net &#x20AC;0.5 billion led to a pre-tax loss of &#x20AC;259 million. Despite those charges, GTB finished the year with solid performance across major businesses and regions with a seasonal slowdown towards year-end.</p>
          <p>Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, trade finance continued to benefit from high demand for international trade products and financing. Trust and securities services profited from higher business activity in the corporate trust business while revenue and cash management increased on the back of improved cash balances as well as strong transaction volume.</p>
          <p>In terms of income before income taxes, GTB would have had a record year if adjusted for the net charge of about &#x20AC;0.5 billion. Full year 2012 revenues were up year-over-year reflecting strong volume and market share gains on track with our growth plan supporting the ambitious IBIT aspiration for 2015.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to page 31, our asset and wealth management business. And as we mentioned at the Investor Day, the integration of the new asset and wealth management division is, in many ways, like a complex M&amp;A transaction bringing together multiple business lines. Clearly, there is potential to unlock significant value.</p>
          <p>Phase one is now complete which focus on reduction of front-office head count outside of Germany with eliminated 10% of the division's head count for mid-year of around 700 positions. The new management team is in place. And we have launched our new brand identity. We have managed to maintain revenues and grow assets.Net new money in the private bank was &#x20AC;15 billion.</p>
          <p>Our next phase is about further efficiency in Germany and parts of Continental Europe, as well as our focus on the infrastructure particularly our technology and operations platforms. One example would be our recently announced plans for Sal. Oppenheim in Germany to maintain its strong independent brand and business model but leveraging the strengths of Deutsche's middle and back-office platform.</p>
          <p>We had a number of significant one-off items in 2012 that impacted the cost line in particular. We expect given all the change the actions already taken are starting to have a positive impact on our run rate which further efficiencies to come in 2013. We have seen a significant improvement in net inflows in asset management. So the first two weeks of the year, total net inflows from retail institutional clients in active asset management are close to &#x20AC;6 billion.</p>
          <p>We'll now turn on to page 32. The private and business clients business again turned in a very solid quarter delivering a good full year results against low interest rates while implementing several changes to its internal setup.</p>
          <p>Adjusting the reported IBIT of &#x20AC;287 million for cost-to-achieve as well as PPA effects, we get to &#x20AC;582 million of operating IBIT, &#x20AC;24 million higher than the third quarter. The single effects are, as usual, displayed in a separate chart in the appendix. The improvement quarter-over-quarter is mainly due to an uptick in insurance-related brokerage revenue, once again lower credit loss provisions and a higher equity pickup from HuaXia Bank.</p>
          <p>Key reason for the lower reported IBIT in the fourth quarter were high cost-to-achieve of &#x20AC;209 million divided in &#x20AC;190 million relating to Postbank integration and &#x20AC;90 million to the operational excellence program.</p>
          <p>When looking at the full year development of credit loss provisions, let me remind you about the IFRS accounting effect that recognizes releases from Postbank allowances taken before consolidation as revenues and not as an offset to credit loss provisions. Excluding this effect, credit loss provisions would have declined by 12% or &#x20AC;97 million.</p>
          <p>Full year revenue in PBC are down 8% compared to 2011 mainly due to two technical effects: HuaXia Bank one-off gain in 2011 and higher negative regular PPA effects in consumer bank in Germany. The remaining revenue decrease is only 3% mainly due to the low interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>While Postbank related PPA have peaked now in line with our integration plan with the total full year charge of &#x20AC;422 million, we forecast OpEx-related CtA to increase to levels of around &#x20AC;300 million in 2013 from &#x20AC;90 million in 2012.</p>
          <p>While we expect operating performance to further improve in 2013, not at least, thanks for the growing synergies related to powerhouse and initial savings related to OpEx, the reported IBIT will likely be around 2012 levels, mainly to the cost-to-achieve that in total will be significantly above 2012 levels when taking OpEx and powerhouse together.</p>
          <p>This is on page 33 is the first regular reporting of the new Non-Core Operating Unit segment following our analyst call on 13th of December of 2012. To reiterate, one of the main purpose of NCOU is enabling the accelerating de-risking, and I think we've proved that in the quarter.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter 2012, we have reduced Basel 3 risk-weighted asset equivalents by &#x20AC;19 billion. Key components of this reduction were our disposal of our stakes in Actavis and EADS comprising &#x20AC;4.3 billion of risk-weighted asset equivalents; de-risking of &#x20AC;7.4 billion risk-weighted assets equivalent from portfolio previously assigned to CB&amp;S; changes to our VaR multiplier saving about &#x20AC;3 billion; and sales of part of structured credit portfolio and other bonds from Postbank totaling &#x20AC;2 billion. These risk-weighted assets reductions supported the core Tier 1 ratio increase by 39 basis points.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter revenue were impacted by one-off items including CVA changes in estimates to the CVA methodology. Underlying expenses are relatively stable quarter-over-quarter after excluding one-off items and a goodwill impairment of &#x20AC;400 million in this segment.</p>
          <p>Finally, I will focus on some key current topics, as usual. So let's go to the third segment of my presentation. As I mentioned previously, on page 35, we have expensed &#x20AC;1.9 billion for legal matters in 2012. Most of the bank's legal risk is not unique to DB and is experienced by many other banks in our peer group. And the tail of legal liabilities is fairly typical and relates to conduct from many years back.</p>
          <p>Here's some additional context of public legal disclosures. Contingent liabilities, which are the potential outflows in matters where liability is more than remote but less than probable, decreased from approximately &#x20AC;2.5 billion to approximately &#x20AC;2 billion. And it's attributable to the resolution of certain legal matters and the establishment of provisions in others.</p>
          <p>Please remember, the current contingent liabilities do not represent our maximum possible legal losses. The increased quarter-over-quarter in legal provisions is largely attributable to adverse court rulings in litigations and developments in regulatory investigations. Once a provision for the matter is established, it is our best estimate at that time as to the probable outflow. If our estimate for that matter change in the future, the provision will be adjusted.</p>
          <p>The increase in mortgage repurchase demands from approximately &#x20AC;3.3 billion to &#x20AC;4.6 billion, which reflects the original principal balance, is attributable to demands made by RMBS investors. This increased activity has been experienced industry-wide, and we expect to continue to see this trend in the near term. The reserves associated with these demands are treated as contra-revenue in our Non-Core Operations Unit. While we have results in a number of important legal matters and made progress on others, we expect the regulatory litigation environment to continue to be challenging.</p>
          <p>Let me go to page 36 and this slide is an update of the slide I presented you at Investor Day. Our de-risking activities here in the NCOU are well on track. Here we highlight the major accomplishments achieved in the second half of 2012. Looking ahead to 2013, we continue to de-risk with 25% reduction in Basel 3 risk-weighted assets by the 31st of December of 2013. This is mostly front-loaded in the first quarter of 2013 and in line with the estimate we provided to you in December of 2012.</p>
          <p>On page 37, I'll give you some more disclosure on the NCOU, which is NCOU, is not just about de-risking, but it's about deleveraging. In the course of 2012, NCOU assigned assets came down just over a quarter of &#x20AC;35 billion. But as I said before, the key objective is de-risking which result in capital accretion. Although we have realized a loss in the NCOU, the impact on our regulatory capital position was a positive one as displayed by the calculation we provide on this page. For your reference, in the pie chart on the right, we provide you with an update of the asset composition giving the significant decline over the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to page 38. On the funding side, a few words on this. We continue to be in a very strong position. The most stable funding sources now comprise 62% of total funding, the highest share ever. We now include Postbank in the liquidity reserves, which as a result exceeded for the first time then &#x20AC;230 billion. And we continue to issue, as you know, well below our CDS spreads also in the New Year. And we closed our local funding gaps in Italy, Spain and Portugal.</p>
          <p>Eventually, now that the Basel Committee has released its final LCR guidance, I'm now in a position to share with you our latest pro forma LCR ratio, which exceeds 95%. We intend to be above 100% by the end of 2013 at the latest and do not have any intention to weaken liquidity standards going forward in the light of the LCR phase-in provision.</p>
          <p>So this concludes my remarks. Anshu and I are looking forward to all of your questions assuming that hopefully there are a few remaining. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Thanks so much for that update and that's very helpful, particularly on risk-weighted assets. I was wondering if you could give more perspective on proposed federal &#x2013; you mentioned you had &#x2013; may not have any further &#x2013; you're taking the P&amp;L impact into account, but as you think about the breadth of your business and the potential impact on return on equity, could you perhaps give a little bit more color about how you're thinking about the potential impact of proposals? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for us, obviously, the proposals mean that, obviously, we will have to allocate some more capital to the United States at some point in 2015. So this is ahead of us. As you know, we have been looking at our businesses overall on a global basis in terms of their return on capital and much of the de-risking that we have done was focused on areas where we had lower profitability, some of that were also U.S. businesses.</p>
          <p>After the impairment, we took now in our local books, we are prepared and we would be able to do the capital positions. We do think, though, and are concerned with these rules really on an international context of global banks really not very helpful in terms of helping global financial markets to properly work. That's why we are quite confident and hopeful that some revisions to the framework today but that's a broader question.</p>
          <p>In terms of our technical abilities to provide the capital and our need for additional capital at this point, we don't need any further capital at this point. But we have to wait until the final rules come out and then obviously understand what the capitalization requirements are in principle.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And the next question is from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Anshu, Stefan. Three questions. The first one relates to your targets for 2015 first quarter where you clearly want Basel III of 10% plus as outlined in the Investor Day. Now that you're already moving to 8.5%, how do you think about capital movement into 2015? The 10%, is that something that you feel could also be potentially brought forward? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding portfolio optimization. Can you outline a little bit more what is actually portfolio optimization, the &#x20AC;15 billion, what you're doing there?</p>
          <p>And the third question comes back to the holding in the U.S. legal entity. Can you &#x2013; because you mentioned several things that you could do, one of them you mentioned capital injection, but you also talked at inter group liability movements. So, really, can you just say that whatever happens that there will be no share count increase in Deutsche Bank even if there needs to be a capital injection into the U.S. legal entity. Can you rule that out by any chance? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Kian. I'll take your first question and then Stefan will take your next two. Look, as Stefan has said already, it's not just the U.S., but we can actually see, in a number of locations, we could get regional fragmentation potentially, too early to say. Because the reality is that the eventual capital target is a moving piece, we cannot commit right now to exactly what the optimal destination would be.</p>
          <p>We'd certainly give you the rule of thumb. We were looking around 100 basis points of accretion in capital per annum. No reason to believe that that could be any different. Undoubtedly, once we achieve our optimal level of capital, our focus will be on returning as much free cash flow back to investors as we possibly can. That has always been our commitment.</p>
          <p>Exactly what that final target would be would be in part a result of how we achieve the regulatory milestones, in particular, once we see how the global situation stabilizes. There's no doubt about the fact that we are significantly ahead of the capital planning numbers that we had shown you back in September. And this organization remains galvanized around capital. That's the key message, which everyone should get. We said we would put capital at the forefront of all of our medium term activities. It continues to be the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Kian. Good morning as well. As to your portfolio optimization, at the end of the day, we're looking at a combination of asset sales and hedges, yeah. The reductions we are showing are to a large extent related to securitization provisions that, as you know, under the Basel framework of punitive capital requirements.</p>
          <p>And obviously, these numbers do not include any model or process deliveries. They are separate. So this is hedging and sales to be more specific and obviously improvements we can do in terms of optimizing our risk position on this position, and it's mainly targeted at securitizations.</p>
          <p>And you're asking a very difficult question on U.S. regulation. This is not finalized yet and the implications &#x2013; first of all, what we can say from today's perspective, we would not have to really move cash, yeah, in order to provide the capitalization in the United States.</p>
          <p>But, of course, we will not provide capitalization that will not provide future good returns for our U.S. &#x2013; for our investors globally, yeah. If our U.S. business does not provide adequate returns for it, we therefore hope that the capital requirements remain somewhere acceptable in light of the profitability we can achieve.</p>
          <p>In terms of including or excluding any measures, you could have asked us the same question, would you have significantly reduced our U.S. activities, that is, obviously, one option; would you increase capital is the other option. It's just too early for us to tell or include or exclude anything because we have a framework that we can't really say much about at this point in time.</p>
          <p>But these would be the two options. We either have to significantly reduce our U.S. activities. The worst outcome is the one that comes through that. Obviously the international community is hoping that will not be the stance of the U.S. in this case or we would have to think.</p>
          <p>But at this point in time, we have the capital in the Group to supply and that what we had to do is we had to take an impairment in our standalone German accounts. We did make the decision to take this. But we are prepared to move if it's required.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I just follow up on that, Stefan? Just would it be possible to issue debt instruments such as CoCos to maybe inject onto parent to inject capital into the U.S.? Would that be potentially &#x2013; could that be an option?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is certainly one of the options that are in discussion and it's one of the options that could be a solution to some of the topics. But, again, the rules are not final, yeah. Please take my comment that it's really early guesses rather than any really estimates, because the rules are just not final. So it's very difficult to say how it turns out to be.</p>
          <p>What we &#x2013; we very clearly have to, obviously, say that obviously we hope that in the &#x2013; in terms of the international community and keeping financial services market and liquidity and that available, that we do consider that global operating banks need to have free movement of capital and funding to properly function. And that, I think, is hopefully what at the end the outcome will be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Jon Peace from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Could I ask two questions, please? The first one is just looking at your fixed income trading performance and comparing the quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year with the U.S. peer group. It was a little bit softer. And I just wondered if you had any comments around that.</p>
          <p>The second is I wonder if you could give any guidance to the longer term about your growth assets. I know you prefer to present your balance sheet on an adjusted basis but, obviously, Basel III is quite prescriptive and it is a challenging target to meet.</p>
          <p>So beyond the growth asset reductions that come out of the Non-Core Unit, do you have any picture of the broader balance sheets and if you reducing gross assets, what the cost of that could be in terms of profitability? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, if you've been studying Deutsche Bank's performance over the last decade &#x2013; so I'll take your first question, Stefan will take your second one. We have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:25) performance, particularly in the investment bank.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter tends to be a slower quarter for us. We've studied this very closely. Potentially, it has something to do with the geographic mix of our business, which is a little more Europe and Asia tilted to an extent. Yes, we have under performed our U.S. peers, but not by a dramatic margin, and in line with the seasonality submitted in prior years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before I answer your second question, I wanted to add something to Kian's question, why we have difficulty in the setting. If obviously the U.S. rules were to come in the extreme case, what you have to keep in mind, that there will be retribution. We expect retribution from European regulators on that. And that's what makes it difficult to assess what it really means for us in terms of what our capital flexibility will be on a global basis and what we &#x2013; how we could move and how we have to think about allocating capital on a global basis.</p>
          <p>So I think the U.S. side is something we have a little bit more clarity. But in our thoughts for the longer term, think about retribution that will, in our view, certainly occur if the rules start hampering in the international free flow of capital and the international free flow of liquidity. So I need to add that why, at this point, the outcome is quite uncertain for us in making the final statement.</p>
          <p>On our total asset, we only do the adjustment in assets to reflect the U.S. GAAP versus IFRS differences. So you have a better comparability when you compare ourselves against to our peers. But as we said in our strategy, we clearly understand that leverage will become more important hopefully reported, not regulated, guideline in terms of assessing risk on capital.</p>
          <p>And we have said that we will continue as we have to reduce our leverage over time and adjust our balance sheet to compensate. We will not do this at the price of our clients, at the cost of our clients. So obviously we are careful with that. And second, obviously, we'll consider obviously the profitability of our balance sheet when doing so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Stuart Graham from Autonomous Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. I had a few questions, please. First just on impairment, maybe a clarification. Can you just explain in detail the significance of the impairment in German GAAP what that brings you up to do?</p>
          <p>The second question is around the RWA mitigation. I guess at the Investor Day you got the feedback that people were worried about your reliance on internal models and that a key part of the progress in Q4 has been more use of the internal model. So, I guess, maybe you could just give us a feel, as a management team, what comfort you have that you're not going to wake up one day and the goal post had been moved on you in terms of internal model harmonization, and suddenly, you got a capital gap?</p>
          <p>And then the final question for Anshu. I mean, there's clearly been a lot of change in the complex environment since the Investor Day with UBS, Morgan Stanley, Barclays. Maybe if you could give us your perspectives on how you see Deutsche's market franchise now versus how the competitors are shaping up? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take the first two and then Anshu will take the third one. Stuart, on Taunus, I need to give you some more background on it. According to the German accounts, obviously, I have to value my participation in the subsidiary Taunus, and this occurs under the German GAAP. And under German GAAP, that is a very conservative GAAP. The impairment is based on a DTF valuation that's built on a five-year plan and therefore, obviously, it has to reflect the implementation phase in 2015 of the capital measure required.</p>
          <p>So what we did? We looked at the business trend in the United States. We made an adjustment after mitigation and after reducing our balance sheet in the United States on the capital that we will have to provide by 2015. And then the DTF model gave us a valuation and then we compared it to our book value of Taunus in our German account and then we took the respective impairment.</p>
          <p>This will now obviously frees us up. It was a configuration because obviously the concern is we have in out of the German books, we used to measure the dividend and there are dividend blocking rules and those dividend blocking rules we had to obviously consider when making a substantial impairment to our subsidiary in the U.S. but we managed within our German accounts to get it and still allow for a dividend, yeah.</p>
          <p>So that's the background of what happened in the German book. So from that perspective we believe it's something that it's now behind us and we would be prepared to deal with &#x2013; from a German accounting perspective to deal with any further issues and so it's part of our plan now. On the?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the carrying value &#x2013; what's the value terms now in your German GAAP then, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can look up the number. I don't have it now with me, sorry. But I can give it to you, but it's obviously conservative German accounting, not very high remaining.</p>
          <p>So now the &#x2013; on your questions on risk-weighted assets and mitigation on our models, first of all, the majority of the PBC de-risking does not come from model approvals in the second half of 2012. Keep that in mind. 60% comes from NCOU de-risking and portfolio optimization and only 24% from model changes. And the biggest one was the VaR multiplier.</p>
          <p>Now, we look very confident in the future on this topic, but we still have one of the higher VaR multipliers in the industry. The Basel framework requires a 3% about on average VaR multiplier. We are still at 4%, yeah. So that provides us, first of all, a big comfort that despite all the modeling going on and the concerns around it that we can.</p>
          <p>Second, I think we will see these tests coming in terms of our risk-weighted asset comparability. And I can only tell you at this point that we are &#x2013; we feel very comfortable with the results, yeah, if they would prove that these accusations to Deutsche Bank's reliance on modeling, yeah, might not be &#x2013; is true and that maybe some of our other competitors may be much more exposed to this than we are.</p>
          <p>Don't forget the framework in itself, that's a right assumption. The more granular risk you manage, the more exact you're able to model the risk. There is rightfully so an incentive tool that then reflects in less risk-weighted asset strategy. That's the background of it. Don't forget also that it takes a long time and a continuous proof between standardized and our individual models, yeah, to make sure that our modeling of risk corresponds.</p>
          <p>I do understand the concern because of the lack of transparency that exists around this modeling, but we're very confident with the information that will be provided in terms of these comparisons over the next couple of months that we're doing with regulators to provide the market with transparency that we would come out quite well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of your question regarding competitive positioning of our investment banking contracts, I would actually say that there's been a clear validation of what we said to you in September. The main point we made at the time was that with Basel 3 implementation, if you're significantly outside the top 5 where five or six years ago you could still hope to beat your cost of equity, it will be very difficult to sustain a second-tier investment banking franchise, and that's exactly what we're seeing. So we're seeing some very significant consolidation, particularly, in fixed income currencies and commodities which we are confident will continue to accrue to the top handful of funds. Clearly, against that, there will some level playing field questions which will arise as we see the future of regulation play out. But certainly, the first dynamic which we were counting on is in fact giving out much as we said it would.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning from my side as well. It's Jernej here from Goldman. I just wanted to ask you a few questions, and it's going to be boring because they're going to follow some of the topics you've already been questioned on.</p>
          <p>The first question I'd like to ask relates to the Fed proposal. And I have to say so, and maybe it's me, but I'm just confused because I don't understand whether Deutsche Bank believes this is a big deal or whether you think it's not a big deal. Because on the one hand you're telling us we won't have to raise any capital as a consequence of this, it's not going to have a meaningful impact on our operation. And on the other hand you're telling us this is such a big deal that it's going to spark retaliation from European regulators.</p>
          <p>So I would just like from your side an unambiguous statement. Do you believe that the new Fed proposal will have a meaningful impact on your business in the U.S.? And if the answer to that is no, we don't have to transfer any &#x2013; we don't have to raise any capital, we don't have to raise any liquidity. If you can then explain why you think it's going to spark of big global debate as a consequence and how it impacts your business from that perspective?</p>
          <p>The second question I had is, when you ran us through the options of response for Deutsche Bank in the U.S., you listed three, if I understood you correctly. The first one was the IHC, so intermediate holding company. But if I understand this correctly, this will potentially force you to dismantle the structure that Deutsche put in place after the rules were initially changed by the Fed and would result in a significant intragroup capital transfer.</p>
          <p>The second one is the reduction of U.S. assets. But I just wonder how the auditor would look at the value of the DTA you have on your balance sheet in the U.S. from that perspective. I believe from memory, because I don't think this is reported anymore. But the last reported activated DTA figure was around &#x20AC;5.2 billion, if I'm right. So if you start cutting &#x2013; and if I understand this correctly, this is activated. It's part of your equity. So what's the prospect for dollars &#x2013; sorry, what's the prospect of impairment of that number if you start cutting assets?</p>
          <p>And the third one, this is should lead to these conversion of liabilities, which I understand, is the same, is it's actually an intra group transfer of capital. And then, here is the conceptual question. The Fed wants you to have more capital in the U.S. and it wants you to have more liquidity in the U.S. It's also telling &#x2013; or not just you all European banks &#x2013; it's also telling the European banks that they will stress test you on that basis. So it's not the question of meeting the minimum capital and liquidity requirements, it's a question of having a substantial buffer. It's then also telling you, implicitly, or telling the European regulator, there will be no recourse to that capital from your European business. And I was just wondering if that gets implemented, even if you say you are fine with the intra group capital transfer, is BaFin or the ECB, your new supervisor, going to be fine with Deutsche having a disproportionate amount of capital and liquidity in the U.S. And therefore, by definition, a lower amount of capital and liquidity available to your other operations?</p>
          <p>So that's on the Fed, and the other questions are shorter. The first one is on page 50 of your presentation. I would just like you to reconcile a sharp improvement in capitalization on a core Tier 1 ratio basis with a static development of the leverage ratio, as you reported yourself over the past two years. So how is it possible that on the one side we're saying, okay, this is great, we're ahead of target on a fully-phased Basel III core Tier 1. On the other side, your own calculations on leverage tells us actually the leverage hasn't changed.</p>
          <p>And the last question, again this is even shorter, is I'm just looking at your presentation of your Chief Risk Officer from the Investor Day. And on page six, you basically outlined what you expect the average risk weight to be under Basel III, it's around 37%. I was just wondering what that number is now given the expansive mitigation numbers. We get to around 32%, which would make Deutsche Bank now the lowest risk weight investment bank or universal bank in Europe.</p>
          <p>And just finally, very briefly, you said that the market multiplier is now closer to peers. And I was just wondering who you think that peer group when you calculate the market multiplier, who are you closer to? Thank you very much, and apologies for the focus on capital. But I guess it's a sign of times as more than anything else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will start on the capitalization question and try to reconcile for you the big deal and no big deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what we are saying is the following. For us, it's obviously different levels of answering the question. The first question you asked me is it technically difficult for Deutsche Bank now after we've taken this HGB impairment. So we are fine. To technically provide capital to the United States, the answer is no, because we have so much inter company debt in the United States at our subsidiaries that, obviously, with the debt-to-equity swap we can provide for the capital.</p>
          <p>Yes, it's a technical piece of it. And the reason we prepared ourselves to do it is, so in terms of what technically needs to happen. You correctly point out that that's not the point. The point is what repercussions will that have to free capital movement in the world and what do we expect other regulators to react to it, and how will a global financial system work under the &#x2013; under a restrictive and ring-fenced national capital guideline. What will we lose, Anshu, will say something to that effect.</p>
          <p>In terms of the other technical impact like the DTA, we have a much reduced DTA. That's because we have been profitable in the U.S. and we have been using these loss carryforwards. So we have moved this significantly down. So it's not something that concerns us, and as we expect our business plan and our strategy implementation in the U.S., our business is profitable.</p>
          <p>When we talk about reducing some of our activities in the United States, obviously, we will not reduce highly profitable businesses, which of course then would have an impact on our ability of using this loss carryforwards in the future. What we were looking at &#x2013; like you can see in our group results that we have done significant de-risking and reduction, and we will also be able to further reduce our balance sheet without material and significant impact to our P&amp;L, yeah. Think about that some of our &#x2013; the business we provide will then no longer be possible any more, that it's done in terms of not being high-return on asset side business.</p>
          <p>So in terms of our business trend shows the recoverability of this DTA is fine in the United States, yeah, and we can continue to use them up. And obviously, our view is that until the point of 2015 when we have to supply it, that's the point.</p>
          <p>So the point is not to clarify for you, the point is not &#x2013; the technicalities around getting the job done, if this is the final outcome is not what, you said, is a smaller deal. The repercussions now that you allude to is the important thing. We completely would understand here that the BaFin will react to this, yeah. I think they have to. I think that, therefore, obviously what we can't anticipate how will this reaction look like in terms of financing because obviously that's the part where now we'd say, we can't tell you at this point in time how this is exactly going to impact and move the Group.</p>
          <p>Maybe, Anshu, I can ask you to say something before I answer all the other questions, if you want to say something about international.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Stefan. I think the question goes to the heart of an issue, which is not just important to Deutsche Bank but indeed for the entire global financial system. Because if we were to extrapolate what we've seen in this proposal, I think in some ways is counter to what we've been told. It was critical as part of the FSB work, which is the international harmonization of financial standards. And indeed if the U.S. were to move ahead unilaterally, you have to assume it's not just the BaFin, but every major regulator then will move towards the new norm, if indeed this is a new norm of gathering capital and gathering liquidity. This is not just a question for European banks or Deutsche Bank; you should then be asking questions to our U.S. competitors in terms of how efficient their operations will be on a global basis because I can't imagine Asian regulators will happily stand back and not follow the same standards.</p>
          <p>So I think this is going to rapidly escalate into an industry issue and indeed with very significant global GDP and growth consequences because you cannot at that point, assume that global capitalization of banks as they stand today which rely upon the efficient redeployment of balance sheet liquidity and capital as business cycles wax and wane across different countries.</p>
          <p>If you're saying &#x2013; or if this proposal leads to the end of that, that's got systemic consequences for our entire industry. I think what Stefan has pointed out to you is that you can rely upon Deutsche Bank to optimize our operations capital liquidity business model in this change, but I would definitely use this opportunity not as to point out, but this is going to have significant ramifications for the entire system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So now to your other questions, the risk-weighted asset density on the Basel 2.5, it's currently 28%, and you can see it on page 45 of our presentation today. And the ratio under Basel III fully-loaded is about 33%. But also take into account that we're reducing our highly weighted exposures, namely, obviously, the securitization pieces, which do not use much balance sheet, but are highly risk-weighted often at 1,250%. So you need to consider that.</p>
          <p>Second, in terms of reconciling for you why our leverage doesn't move while our risk-weighted assets move. If you consider that, for example, when you look at our cash that has significantly increased, yeah. That carries no risk weights, yeah. But obviously we have parts of the balance sheet with our high cash balance, which right now do cost us in terms of leverage, would be easy to just get rid of our cash; and so, you've got a leverage number. That's how we continue to believe that leverage is the wrong number to look at. For example, if that gets regulated, then we have to get rid of our high liquidity reserve. So in that sense, this is the relationship. You have to look at assets that don't carry high-risk weight assets to solve the dilemma between the two ratios.</p>
          <p>I think we have answered all your questions, right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just &#x2013; maybe just a last one on the market multiplier, is the suggestion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you said &#x2013; we can only estimate &#x2013; our current estimate for our current is 3.5% on average, but the Basel framework includes the 3% guideline. So &#x2013; and obviously we expect if Basel 3 gets implemented that that will be when the standards to be applied at 3%. Okay?</p>

          <p>Next question is from Dirk Hoffmann-Becking from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, and thank you. I'm not going to go on about this U.S. thing. I have just a question on the mortgage repurchase demands. I mean, there's a very sharp rise, about &#x20AC;1.3 billion in demand. You say we should expect something similar going forward. What does something similar mean? Do we talk about a similar ratio per quarter or per year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on compensation cost. Can you give us an indication sort of what kind of awarded compensation ratio you're aiming for in the investment bank and then for the rest of the banks? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very quickly, we have no compensation cost target. I think that would be, at this point, not right. So we are not giving out a target. We want to continue, obviously, to lower it, which obviously is also the intention of much of the regulation. That's clear on the one hand, but on the other hand we also have to stay within the market parameters. So I think to target a ratio here is difficult. So we'll have to assess competitiveness versus, obviously, reduction with &#x2013; on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>On the mortgage repurchase case, there's also some good news in this. Obviously, the improvement of the market in the United States, there's certainly lower losses around it. We do still have some &#x2013; and we expect in the near future the recent trends to continue. Obviously, we'll &#x2013; we expect to get some more. But as we move &#x2013; as time moves by and obviously these losses are lower than anticipated and mitigated. Obviously, we expect also some good news on that over time. So &#x2013; but again, this is something very difficult to predict because this is decisions from people outside of the bank to do. But what's important is so far I think our case-by-case experts &#x2013; or case-by-case solution of the issues has been important.</p>
