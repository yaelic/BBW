        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody thank you for joining us here. One year ago as we entered 2008, Credit Suisse had four priorities. First to sustain our strong capital position, second to continue to reduce our risk positions, third to maintain our client momentum, and fourth to move ahead with the implementation of our strategy. Our overall approach was one of conservatism, strong capital, aggressive risks reduction, and a cautious approach to distressed acquisitions. This approach proved to be beneficial.</p>
          <p>During 2008 as a result of the market disruption, capital strength became the focus for regulators, investors, and clients. Our aim was to continue to be recognized as a bank with an unquestioned capital position. We also wanted to remove any uncertainty about future regulatory capital requirements. Today with a tier 1 ratio of 13.3% we are one of the best capitalized banks in the world. We see capital strength as a key competitive advantage and are pleased to have been able to maintain it at a high level despite a very tough fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We are also pleased that we've been able to do this without significantly diluting our shareholders. We have fewer shares outstanding today than we did in 2006 and without having required any government support. Throughout the crisis our funding and deposit base have been rock solid and we've been a net provider of liquidity to the market. In August, we completed most of our long-term funding needs for 2008. In September, after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, we were a safe haven for the industry. Now, at the beginning of 2009, we come into the year with one of the strongest capital ratios in the industry and with a solid funding base.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our risk positions, one year ago, our objective was to aggressively reduce our risk positions. We entered the crisis with little sub-prime exposure, but as a market leader in Leveraged Finance and commercial mortgages, we had significant positions. We made a decision at the start of the crisis to aggressively reduce our exposure to the affected asset classes and it has served us well. Unlike some of our peers, we did not transfer any of these assets to a banking book, but reduced them dramatically by selling them. As a result, our leverage loan exposures were down 98% compared to the third quarter of '07.</p>
          <p>CMBS is down 75% compared to third quarter of '07 and residential mortgages and sub-prime CDOs where exposure was much smaller to start with are down 69% over the same period. We have reduced our assets in these illiquid categories dramatically over the course of 2008 and started 2009 with much lower exposures. As we announced in early December we accelerated our transitioning of the investment bank to a new capital efficient business model which focuses on client and flow business.</p>
          <p>Overall risk weighted assets in Investment Banking have been reduced by 31% compared to year end 2007, and we plan to reduce them further to $135 billion by the end of 2009. We have aggressively reduced risk and as a result we are well positioned going into 2009. Our third priority was to remain focused on serving our clients, strengthening our franchise and taking advantage of our status as a safe haven in a very disrupted industry. I am pleased with what we have achieved. Private Banking maintained moment with CHF 51 billion of net new assets with inflows over one of the most tumultuous periods in the history of the financial markets.</p>
          <p>In addition, our Corporate and Retail Banking business in Switzerland posted a record result and showed significant client momentum. Despite significant losses in the investment bank, there were many areas where we saw tremendous client momentum. In particular in client businesses such as prime services where we were able to dramatically increase our market share. We are certain that the value of these franchise gains will be significant when markets turn more favorable.</p>
          <p>So, in 2008 our client franchise momentum was dramatically strengthened and we've entered 2009 well positioned with our client base. We have made substantial progress in our strategic initiatives in each division. In Private Banking we have seen the best environment in a generation to grow our business. With many of the largest players in Private Banking disrupted by the crisis, we have exceeded our hiring goals in quantity and in quality attracting the highest quality groups in the industry to our stable platform.</p>
          <p>In Investment Banking we made substantial progress in 2008 towards our goal of a more client centered capital efficient business model. This transformation was accelerated in the fourth quarter and we entered 2009 with a business model that has lower volatility, is more client focused and which will throw off significant capital during 2009.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management we implemented the necessary strategic changes to build a scalable high margin business by focusing on our leading position in alternative investments, our asset allocation business and our Swiss franchise. So, the progress on the strategic front has been encouraging.</p>
          <p>Lastly, our collaboration revenues of CHF 5.2 billion held up well in a very tough environment showing that our integrated business model is a source of stable high margin earnings.</p>
          <p>Compensation is an important issue, important in the way we manage our business but also in the wider social context. It's a difficult topic in this environment but having variable compensation obviously is vital to enable us to respond flexibly in an industry with cyclical revenue patterns and it's also an important lever for us to produce shareholder returns. We've worked hard to try to take a prudent and constructive approach, one which is designed to reflect the performance of individuals and the firm, and at the same time more closely align the interest of employees with those of the shareholders. And one which has intended to position us well going into 2009 with a workforce who feel they are part of a stable platform and where they are incented to work hard for our shareholders, our clients, and the firm.</p>
          <p>Overall variable compensation paid as unrestricted cash and retention payments amounts which are contingent upon future performance of some kind are designed to ensure that the interest of shareholders and employees are aligned. The unrestricted cash element which was around CHF 2 billion was down over 60% from last year. Certain business areas were reduced more than others and the reductions were more for senior personnel than for junior. In fact managing directors throughout the firm did not receive any unrestricted cash payment above their salary. All payments to them were in the form of retention elements. As you know, managing directors and directors in our Investment Bank received awards in the new Path program consisting of illiquid assets that will pay out over time only with the liquidation of those assets. Overall, variable compensation was down 44% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The Chairman and myself CEO of the Investment Bank received no variable compensation and other than three members of ExB who have contractual arrangements, the remaining members of ExB only received retention payments in addition to the salary, so no unrestricted cash. And importantly we'd like to make the point that the value of equity related compensation held by current managing directors declined by over 75% over the last year and clearly the value of that decrease exceeded the variable compensation awarded to them for 2008.</p>
          <p>So, we think this shows how effective long term incentive schemes can be in aligning the interests of employees and shareholders and we think that the decisions that we've made around awarding retention for 2008 are going to support motivation amongst our senior people and keep them engaged in creating value for our shareholders. So, we have tried to strike the right balance in a difficult environment and I think we've taken responsible measures that our consistent with the aim of balancing interests of shareholders and employees.</p>
          <p>I don't need to remind you that the industry faced enormous challenges in 2008. We certainly didn't get everything right by any means. However, we did act swiftly and decisively and I believe we have strengthened the relative position of Credit Suisse. We've also tried to be as transparent as possible providing a high level of disclosure, maintaining consistent accounting standards and communicating quickly whenever a major issue arose. We believe that's been the right approach in these volatile markets and we hope that you've found that helpful.</p>
          <p>Today, I think we are in a position to manage our businesses in a way that will enable us to be less susceptible to negative market trends if they persist in the months to come, but also to prosper when and if we see markets recover. We are encouraged by a strong start to 2009 and we're quarter to date profitable across all divisions. Renato Fassbind is now going to present you the results in more detail. After Renato speaks we're going to have Wilson Ervin take you through a review and the outlook for the risk environment. Paul Calello is then going to give you further insight into the implementation of our client focused capital efficient strategy for the Investment Bank and I'll then finish by speaking about our priorities and the outlook for 2009. So, with that I'll turn it over to Renato.</p>

          <p>Someone stole my glass. Thank you Brady, and good morning to you. I will start my presentation on slide 6, with an overview on the fourth quarter results. We reported a net loss of CHF 6 billion in the quarter driven by widespread market disruption. Private Banking delivered another solid operating performance in the fourth quarter however pre-tax income of CHF 876 million was impacted by provisions for auction rate security settlements and an account close out provision in highly volatile markets. Revenue in Private Banking remained solid and continued strong net client inflows demonstrated the resilience of the business.</p>
          <p>Investment Banking recorded a pre-tax loss of CHF 7.8 billion in the fourth quarter. This reflected write-downs in leverage finance and Structured Products and negative trading revenues in fixed income and equities. Client driven businesses including flow based rate products delivered the solid results.</p>
          <p>Asset Management recorded a pre-tax loss of CHF 670 million, as a result of significant valuation reductions on Private Equity and other investments and on the securities purchased from our money market funds.</p>
          <p>We have maintained our strong capital ratio which remains one of the strongest, if not the strongest in our industry at 13.3% and in line with the 13% guidance we have provided to you at the beginning of December.</p>
          <p>Our strong capital and funding position and the significant cost reductions planned will reinforce the strong position of Credit Suisse as it enters in 2009.</p>
          <p>Can you please take that off in the back please? We are committed to investing in our integrated client focus business model. We have realigned the investment bank by adapting it to the new environment including a significant reduction in risk. Finally, and as Brady has already mentioned, we have had a strong start to 2009 with all our businesses profitable quarter to-date.</p>
          <p>Slide 7, reconciles the fourth quarter results with the pre-announcement of the October and November results, and shows how it was impacted by two non-operating items which we announced also separately in December, mainly from CHF 600 million of after-tax costs from the accelerated implementation of our strategic plan and the CHF 500 million loss from the sale of part of the Global Investors business which included a goodwill charge.</p>
          <p>On the pre-tax basis, the restructuring costs were CHF 833 million and are recorded in the corporate center. The after-tax loss of the sale of part of our Global Investors business was CHF 500 million and is shown in discontinued operations.</p>
          <p>On slide 8, you will see Wealth Management's disclosed pre-tax income of CHF 363 million. The result includes two significant provisions, an additional 97 million provision in respect of auction rate securities, and a charge of CHF 190 million related to an account close out in highly volatile markets.</p>
          <p>The result was affected by a lower asset base and also includes credit provisions of CHF 113 million on loans collateralized by securities relating to deleveraging of numerous client positions in highly volatile equity markets. The business model remains resilient in these challenging markets and despite a lower asset base we continued to achieve strong asset inflows and stable margins, as you will see on the next two slides.</p>
          <p>On slide nine, we show you the revenues on the left and the gross margins on assets under management on the right. The 8% reduction in revenues was in line with a decline in average assets under management. We were successful in maintaining recurring revenue levels in 2008, down only 2% year-on-year and supported by higher net interest income. In terms of gross margin this compensates for the sharp reduction in client activity reflecting adverse markets and more cautious behavior.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Our revenue margin was unchanged at the 115 basis points. In the fourth quarter, the gross margin increased 8 points to 117 basis points as the transactional margin recovered from a particularly low level in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to net new assets on slide 10. On the left hand chart you can see that net client inflows were strong at nearly CHF 14 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, with good contributions from all international regions. However, we did see significant deleveraging as clients sold securities and other assets to meet margin calls on the loans used to fund the purchase of these assets. Unprecedented market dislocation seen during the fourth quarter resulted in loan repayments as clients rebalanced their portfolios. The deleveraging was most pronounced in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>Net new assets were CHF 42 billion in 2008 with a good distribution of inflows across all regions. Despite a 12 billion negative impact of deleveraging in the fourth quarter just mentioned. The deleveraging effect has reduced our headline rolling fourth quarter net new asset growth to 5% at the end of 2008 compared to the 6.2% we reported at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 shows the development of assets under management in 2008. The green bar shows you the strong net new asset development of CHF 42 billion as just explained. The assets under management fell by 23% or nearly CHF 200 billion in 2008, due to the decline in global equity and bond markets and the strengthening of the Swiss franc against most of the currencies. Over 100 billion, or half of this annual reduction, occurred in the fourth quarter alone. A lower asset base level going into this year will impact 2009 revenues.</p>
          <p>Let me continue with Corporate and Retail Banking on slide 12. Pre-tax income in this field increased 28% to CHF 513 million compared to the third quarter of 2008. Although the Swiss economy started to show signs of weakening fundamentals, this result reflects the resilience of our business model in a more challenging environment. The fourth quarter results benefited from CHF 57 million of fair value gains on loan portfolio hedges. In the fourth quarter we actually grew the Swiss loan book by CHF 4 billion, that means we increased the lending to our Swiss customers. Net new assets from Swiss institutional and retail clients were CHF 8.7 billion during 2008.</p>
          <p>With that let me turn to Investment Banking on slide 13. The extreme market disruption and substantial volatility we experienced in the first nine months of 2008 intensified in the fourth quarter and had a reserve impact on our trading results. These elements of market turbulence were especially important factors in negatively impacting our results. First, the negative impact of a severe widening of credit spreads resulting in sharp declines in fair value levels of credit instruments across most markets. Second, an increase in the diversions between cash and synthetic markets, creating some extreme moves in longstanding hedging relationships. Third, extraordinary high levels of market volatility. These factors had substantial impact on the fair value of our trading books.</p>
          <p>Net valuation reductions in our Structured Products and Leveraged Finance businesses were CHF 3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. Although we have now successfully reduced dislocated assets by 88%, as I will show in the next slide, and since the end of the third quarter of 2007, we have achieved solid results in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2008 in client driven businesses, including flow-based products.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 is an update of the risk-weighted assets development we presented in December. This shows the progress we made with our risk reduction plans. As you can see we reduced risk-weighted assets by $72 billion or 31% to 164 billion during 2008 in the Investment Bank. This was better than our $170 billion year end 2008 target we gave you, despite a $16 billion increase in risk-weighted assets during the fourth quarter as a result of methodology changes. Our sustained and consistent approach to risk reduction continued in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, you can see that if you look at our combined dislocated asset balances since the start of the turbulences during 2007, they have been reduced by 88%.</p>
          <p>We apply rigorous standards when we fair value these dislocated assets and have also not transferred any of these assets to an accrual accounted banking book, repeat that we have not transferred any of the assets to an accrual accounted banking book. These dislocated assets now stand at CHF 11.6 billion in total. Wilson, will go through some of the features of our risk reduction in more detail later.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, is the same slide we presented back in December which gives you a sense of what our pre-tax income would have looked like over the last four years for the realigned investment bank we intend to operate from 2009 onwards.</p>
          <p>This is probably a more conservative view of the results than we would have actually achieved given that this was a mechanical exercise of simply stripping out all revenues from the businesses we are exiting. But doesn't assume success of a new capital efficient business that improves revenues relative to assets for the businesses being repositioned.</p>
          <p>A good example here would be our Emerging Markets business. The numbers have been adjusted slightly in early years compared to our original slide we showed you in December, as the final realignment plan has developed but the differences are very small.</p>
          <p>Although we may not earn the absolute level of earnings you see for 2007, the reposition model demonstrates that we should be able to produce higher average margins and returns over the cycle. You will also see significantly less risk capital allocated to Investment Banking. All in all, the repositioned model should produce robust earnings with lower volatility over the cycle.</p>
          <p>As Brady mentioned, Paul will go into much more detail on the results, the realigned model and the pro forma earnings later.</p>
          <p>Let me move to Asset Management on the next slide number 17. At the yearend we announced that we had signed an agreement to sell part of our traditional long-only global investors business in return for up to 24.9% of the enlarged share capital of Aberdeen Asset Management, a UK listed company. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year subject to the customary closing condition including regulatory approvals and of course approval from Aberdeen's shareholders.</p>
          <p>The businesses we are selling are now reported under discontinued operations, so that's the line between the earnings from operating, the pre-tax and then you have the discontinued operations just at the last line before the net income. And the Asset Management results we will present on the next few slides reflect that change and only include the results of the continued businesses. So everything else, even from the historical perspective, is taken out through that line below pre-tax.</p>
          <p>Looking at the fourth quarter performance, the down turn in global markets resulted in unrealized losses on Private Equity and other investments of nearly CHF 600 million and a further CHF 164 million of write downs incurred on the money market lift-out portfolio. Excluding these two items, the ongoing basis would have been marginally profitable. The money market lift-out portfolio has been further reduced by 44% in the fourth quarter resulting from sales, asset maturities, restructurings, and write downs. They now stand at less than CHF 600 million which compares to the much, much bigger amount if you may remember we had in the third quarter in 2007.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, we show you the Asset Management fees split into alternative investment, MACS, and the remaining traditional investment businesses adjusted for the businesses being sold as I mentioned before. This shows fees only and excludes any performance fees, investment results, net interest income, and other revenues and demonstrates that the business going forward will be heavily biased towards the alternatives and MACS businesses. Asset Management fees in the alternatives business were CHF 226 million during the quarter. Despite the market turbulence that has driven asset values lower, they have held up well compared to previous quarters reflecting continued growth of the business. Overall the gross fee margin on assets under management was broadly stable at 33 basis points.</p>
          <p>On slide 19 you can see that our Private Equity and other investments have delivered a solid contribution across the cycle. Placement fees have risen steadily over the past five years and we have experienced healthy gains on our Private Equity portfolio over the cycle. Significant market deterioration in 2008 has impacted Private Equity evaluations across a number of sectors, including real estate, distressed debt, funds -- distressed debt funds, energy, commodities, and Emerging Markets. The size of our own portfolio of Private Equity and other investments stands at CHF 4 billion at the end of 2008, of which 2.6 billion is Private Equity and relates mainly to co-investments facilitating fund raising activities. The Private Equity portfolio remains well diversified in terms of vintage and industry. It is focused on the middle market and excludes highly leveraged large cap exposures, a sector probably most exposed to the recent change in the market environment.</p>
          <p>On slide 20 we show you current levels of assets under management and 2008 net new assets side by side by asset category. In the net new asset column, you can see as I mentioned previously that the alternative investments business which comprises our leading Private Equity and real estate business and our single and multi manager hedge fund strategies saw good asset inflows of CHF 11.4 billion during 2008. We believe that the alternative asset inflows will fuel further revenue growth driven by our best-in-class capabilities in that area.</p>
          <p>Despite experiencing outflows during 2008, the MACS business held up well despite the turbulent markets. The majority of asset outflows in 2008 related to traditional investment strategies and were predominantly in low margin businesses. In the fourth quarter in line with our strategy to focus on higher margins and scalable activities we also decided to close our money market funds. This now concludes the divisional results review and I will continue with the Group's funding and capital position on slide 21.</p>
          <p>On that slide we can see on the left the composition of our assets at the end of the third quarter and there we have reduced the balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Looking at each of the asset categories in turn you can see at the top of the chart that cash balances, including cash due from banks, has almost doubled to CHF 90 billion. All other assets categories have reduced. Reverse repos reduced by 21% reflecting general market conditions across all regions. Trading assets are down 22% in the quarter or 35% compared to the beginning of 2008. Within trading assets, convertible bonds, preferred securities and asset backed securities are all at lower levels. Wilson will provide more detail on the trading risk reduction later.</p>
          <p>The reduction in loans resulted from exchange rate movements mainly during the quarter, and they are underpinned by our strong deposit base which is 117%, as you can see on the slide, of loans outstanding.</p>
          <p>Other assets were lower as brokerage receivables reduced from the exceptionally high balances in the third quarter and many trades didn't settle across the industry for a prolonged period of time following the Lehman bankruptcy.</p>
          <p>We have seen increased market spreads in the last few months. However, our refinancing requirements are relatively small. Our short-term financing requirements have come down by more than a third from a year ago to CHF 100 billion as we have reduced our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Long-term funding maturing in 2009 is around CHF 13 billion and represents a near 1% of total liabilities. As we continue our -- to reduce our balance sheet we may even not need to refinance all of this debt. Any additional funding costs will be more than compensated by our stable and low cost deposit base. We believe that this will continue to be a key competitive advantage especially when compared to institutions that primarily rely on wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>Let me move to our capital position on slide 22. During the quarter, the Basel II Tier 1 ratio improved by nearly 300 basis points to 13.3% making us one of the best capitalized banks globally. We benefited also from a 16% reduction in risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter and we are positioned well to continue building the client franchise.</p>
          <p>We raised 11.2 billion of capital in the fourth quarter, 10 billion of which was raised in October through the issue of 4.5 billion of core Tier 1 capital and 5.5 billion of hybrid Tier 1 capital. And don't forget, our share count today is below the January 2006 levels. As we indicated at the third quarter results, the Board of Directors will be recommending a nominal dividend of $0.10 per share.</p>
          <p>Let me talk a few words about our capacity reduction program. In December, we presented the data on slide 23, setting out how we are adjusting our capacity to align the business with the profitable opportunities we see going forward. The measures include a reduction in head count of 5,300 or 11% for the Bank as a whole. These reductions together with other cost efficiency measures will lower costs by CHF 2 billion on an ongoing run rate basis. At the end of 2008, we have already achieved around half of these head count reductions, which should contribute about 50% of the 2 billion run rate saving expected to be achieved by the middle of 2009 already now, always on an annual basis. Around two-third of the reduction will come in the Investment Bank and the shared services supporting this business.</p>
          <p>Now on the next slide, we will talk about collaboration, an integral part of our integrated bank. Private Banking, Investment Banking and Asset Management are cohesive and complementary businesses serving the same client base. They are manageable as a combined set of businesses and our integrated model brings a number of benefits in the emerging competitive landscape and our clients value our approach.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 24, despite the turbulent market, despite as well the market dislocations, collaboration revenues were CHF 5.2 billion only CHF 700 million lower than 2007, which is a much lesser decline than the overall revenues that declined much more. And as a percentage of overall revenues consequently, collaboration revenues increased dramatically in 2008. In the integrated banking model, we are benefiting from retaining client flows in the Group that would otherwise have to be bought from our competitors. We expect to see steady growth in these revenues over time and collaboration revenues represents one of our key performance indicators that we have now updated for you on our next slide number 25.</p>
          <p>As we have promised, we have updated our three to five year across the cycle KPI targets in the light of the new market environment, and as we typically do when we report about the full year. We have incorporated into these targets, the realignment of the Investment Bank and the more focused higher margin Asset Management business. On that slide, we have highlighted where we have made revisions.</p>
          <p>The four changes for the Group as a whole are as follows. Firstly, the target to generate CHF 10 billion of collaboration revenue by 2010, as it originally was, has been pushed out to 2012 recognizing the market turbulence we have seen this year. Secondly, the annual return on equity is now targeted to be above 18%, reflecting the higher level of shareholders' equity we'll operate with going forward. As you may remember, it was 20% before. Thirdly, we have replaced the earnings per share target with a target of achieving lower earnings volatility versus our peer group, reflecting the capital efficient model we will be operating in the Investment Bank. And finally, we think that the minimum tier 1 ratio target of 12.5% reflects the market environment and our objective of maintaining our strong counterparty status in these stressed times.</p>
          <p>Finally, on slide 26, we have set out the divisional three to five year KPI targets and again we have indicated where there have been updates. Wealth Management and Corporate and Retail Banking KPIs remain unchanged. However, in Investment Banking, we have lowered the pre-tax income margin to 25% reflecting lower utilization of capital, but also the lower absolute levels of income we expect the business to generate. Over the cycle, we expect the earnings volatility to be lower. In Asset Management, we have increased the pre-tax income margin reflecting a change of mix towards the higher margin alternatives and asset allocation businesses going forward.</p>
          <p>This slide concludes my presentation and with that I welcome Wilson to the stage. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks Renato and good morning. Today, I'd like to talk about three things. First, the market backdrop and how it affected some of our positions and profitability in Q4. Second, what we have done to reduce risk and adjust our exposures to a level that is more appropriate given current market uncertainty. And third, an update on our current risks and our risk outlook as we look to 2009.</p>
          <p>As all of you know we've seen extraordinary financial turbulence in the markets after the failure of Lehman Brothers. While, we avoided a number of these issues our fourth quarter result was materially affected by three risk categories. First, credit spreads widened dramatically late in the year, as you can see in the top chart, credit spreads from Emerging Markets and traded leverage loans more than doubled during the quarter. Credit spreads widened in nearly all sectors including corporate bonds, Emerging Markets and asset-backed positions, and in some markets tested multi-decade highs.</p>
          <p>This had an adverse impact on the fair value of our credit positions in both our trading and banking books. Second and perhaps less prominent in the popular press, we've seen some extraordinary moves in hedging relationships. We capture this type of risk under the heading basis risks, which is a category that measures the risk between similar instruments in a given financial category.</p>
          <p>For example, cash corporate bonds and credit defaults swaps in the same name normally trade pretty closely together, but as you can see in the middle chart, this changed in the fourth quarter. Cash bonds dropped by much more than the equivalent CDS hedge as liquidity constraints and forced deleveraging hit cash bonds particularly hard. Many basis risks gapped out to levels we've never seen before. We saw this effect in cash versus CDS spreads and in a number of other basis risk markets across equity and fixed income. At Credit Suisse we use hedges extensively to mitigate outright risks. While these hedges may still work in terms of credit fundamentals, we measure trading positions on a fair value basis, and this drove about 3.3 billion of losses in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Third, market volatility rose to exceptional levels in Q4. We've seen postwar highs in many markets. For example, the S&amp;P index moved by more than 5% on 18 days during 2008, and most of those shocks were in the fourth quarter. The next most volatile year in the last half century was 1987, which saw only four days which swings at this magnitude. At the lower left, we show how volatility in options markets mirrored this trend, as investors sought refuge by buying option protection. The VIX index of equity volatility quadrupled from midyear to the piece in October and November. So, this has been truly an extraordinary period. These categories of risks had substantial impacts on the fair value of our trading books, even after the risk reductions we did earlier in the crisis.</p>
          <p>On the next page, we've tried to estimate the impact of each of these few risk factors on our results in Q4. At the left, we show total IB revenues, which was negative CHF 4.6 billion for the quarter. At the right we estimate the losses from each of the risk categories we described in the previous slide, plus a column for other business activity. In the first risk column we show how the directional widening of spreads impacted both our primary underwriting business, Leveraged Finance and CMBS, as well as our secondary credit trading businesses. Taken together we estimate this impact at about CHF 4.6 billion across both categories.</p>
          <p>Second the disruption of hedging relationships or basis risk affected many strategies that have long positions with significant hedges. Some people call these relative value books, some call them long-short books, and some call them hedge positions, but whatever the name these books were affected by the dramatic disruptions of the fourth quarter. We estimate that basis risk widening cost us approximately 3.3 billion of fair value losses in Q4. And while hedges helped us weather the storms in Q4, they were not perfect and we did see some slippage between the longs and the shorts.</p>
          <p>Finally the sharp spike in volatility affected our structured equity and interest rate derivative books, as these books became much harder to hedge under conditions of extreme volatility. Our estimate of losses from this sector totals approximately 1.9 billion. At the far right you can see that other customer and market making areas produced positive revenues during the quarter, but not enough to offset the headwinds from these three risk categories.</p>
          <p>In a few minutes Paul will talk about the strategic response to this event at a business level. In the next few pages I will talk about the risk response to these losses and how we've been adapting our risk profile.</p>
          <p>But how are we responding to this situation? Quite simply we've been cutting our trading and underwriting exposures dramatically and reducing our sensitivity to market scenarios. We've done this consistently through the crisis and we expanded our efforts in the fourth quarter. These reductions will reduce our ability to participate in the possible market rebound, but our primary objective is to reduce our P&amp;L volatility and move to a much steadier business model.</p>
          <p>At the top of this slide, we show you how we've cut our underwriting exposures as Renato mentioned earlier. Credit Suisse moved early in reducing risk in 2007 and this has proved to be the right strategy. We've now largely eliminated Leveraged Finance underwriting exposures which now total less than CHF 1 billion. Our commercial mortgage positions were reduced by another 30% in Q4 and now stand at CHF 8.8 billion, and I'll talk more about that portfolio in a later slide.</p>
          <p>We also reduced our RMBS and subprime trading positions as you can see at the bottom of the page. Our net subprime position was down slightly, but more importantly we made good progress in simplifying this book during Q4. The gross position size was cut by 50% during the quarter. Higher quality RMBS positions were also affected by the turbulence this quarter and we saw significant fair value losses in that sector. Our exposure to those instruments dropped by 32% to CHF 3.2 billion.</p>
          <p>On the next page we talk about how we responded in our other trading areas. We discussed in an earlier slide how the recent market shocks were expensive for any books with directional credit spread risk or basis risk. And in this slide we give you some detail on how we've reduced our risk exposure to those two risk types. In the top chart we show you how we've cut some of the key trading books that had directional credit spread exposures. Here we show you the trend in net market exposure for three key books, traded loans, preferred securities, and Emerging Markets bonds. This shows you how our net market value exposure for these books is down between 60 and 75% versus the size a year ago, and about half versus the end of Q3.</p>
          <p>These are trends for specific books but we see a similar trend if we look at broader measures of credit trading risk. For example we run a global credit scenario across our trading portfolios on a global basis and this figure is down by 75% as well. In the bottom half of the page, we show some examples of how we cut our exposure to basis risk. In these books, the net directional risk is mostly hedged, so the key risk issue is how much exposure you have to the basis or difference between your gross long position and your hedge.</p>
          <p>The bottom chart shows you gross position sizes for three key risk books, convertible bonds which we typically run on a hedged basis, subprime CDOs and equity relative value trading. Here we've cut our position between 60 and 90% versus year ago level and significantly versus Q3.</p>
          <p>This page addresses two of the three categories we mentioned earlier in the presentation. We have also reduced our exposures to the third category of risk, the risk of our structured derivative books. For example, we cut our exposure to a shock equity scenario downturn event by more than 70% during Q4. Other risk measures for this category also show reduced exposures.</p>
          <p>On the next page, we show you how some of the specific risk cuts have translated into reductions as shown by broader risk measures. Our broadest measure of trading risk is value-at-risk or VaR. In Q4, we brought this down by an average of 21% versus Q3, and by 53% versus Q4 2007. As risk reductions were taking place through Q4, our VaR at the end of December was significantly less than the average for the quarter which we show at the far right.</p>
          <p>On a consistent methodology basis, the underlying VaR at year-end was down 64%, versus the quarter average a year ago. Position risk ERC is our broadest overall risk measure. It includes not only trading risk but other types of risk like underwriting and credit. Position risk at Credit Suisse dropped in Q4 from 11.9 billion to CHF 9.8 billion driven by a 23% reduction in the Investment Bank. For all of 2008, we cut position risk ERC in our Investment Bank by one-third.</p>
          <p>So, we've reduced our risk significantly when you look at both specific measures and overall measures. We've been among the most aggressive banks in this regard for many quarters and we expanded our efforts in Q4. We've made good progress and are continuing to make some further reductions.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to do in the next session is talk about risks on a forward-looking basis and try and address some of the key risk areas that people have been asking about. In particular, people have been asking about how lending books are positioned from a risk standpoint given the serious challenges that we've all seen in the recent economic data. So, in this section, I'll talk first about our loan books in the Private Bank, which is our largest accrual style book, then I'll talk to our corporate lending and Emerging Markets loan portfolios in the Investment Bank, and lastly, I will update you on our CMBS book.</p>
          <p>On this slide, we give you an overview of the loan portfolio in our Private Banking division. This loan portfolio is largely focused on Switzerland and is accounted for an accrual basis. Our PB credit book is largely a funded portfolio. Unfunded irrevocable commitments are only about 5% of exposures, so we focus here on the funded loan portfolio on our balance sheet. 85% of this portfolio is collateralized by financial instruments such as securities or by real estate. Together with the quality of the borrower, the high rate of collateralization gives us a highly rated portfolio which is 92% investment grade.</p>
          <p>In the top chart we show you a portfolio ratings breakdown on a transaction by transaction basis as measured by our independent CRM team. Within the Private Bank loans in the Wealth Management area amount about CHF 72 billion. Just under half is Lombard or security backed positions and the remainder is backed by mortgages with good haircuts. We did experience just over CHF 100 million of losses in the Lombard sector in the fourth quarter, but I think that shows how resilient this book is and how it can withstand considerable stress and collateral values during a highly turbulent time. The corporate and retail lending areas in Switzerland contain loans of CHF 104 billion. This is split roughly half to commercial mortgage and corporate lending and about half to retail lending. This retail sector is primarily residential mortgages which comprises over 90% of that category.</p>
          <p>It's important to understand that the Swiss market is a very different real estate market from some of the markets that have gotten into trouble lately and have been so much in the press. I would like to spend a minute on that. This difference can be seen graphically in the lower right which shows you the relative price history for residential real estate in both Switzerland and one of the US markets that's under stress. We picked Los Angeles as an example, not because it's the most common comparison with Switzerland, but because it's a major market that help illustrates some of the issues that have been in the press lately. The moods for the US residential market as a whole are somewhat more muted, but LA is representative of the real estate markets in the US Sun Belt, across both the South and the West Coast.</p>
          <p>As you can see here the price of residential real estate in LA more than doubled during the first six years of this decade, and is now giving back some of those gains. The fast increase in subsequent downturn has caused problems for higher loan to value loans, which were originated in the middle of that decade during the peak of the bubble. In contrast, Swiss real estate values have been much more consistent with small fairly consistent annual gains that average about 3% per annum. We haven't seen a big boom bust cycle in Switzerland, and that's important if you're a creditor. Part of this was perhaps driven by differences in mortgage practices between the two regions.</p>
          <p>Switzerland was not affected by aggressive mortgage lending structures that became prevalent in some other markets. For example, all our Swiss residential borrowers are subject to strict income checks and have to put up real equity in their purchases. The average loan to value is about 65% in the residential portfolio in Switzerland. Swiss mortgage lending has a good loss history and standards remains conservative. So it should not be painted with the same brush as other markets and we feel good about the quality of this book.</p>
          <p>Lastly there has been a focus in consumer lending portfolios as a risk category especially in the US and the UK. Credit Suisse does not do direct consumer lending in these markets or other markets outside Switzerland. We do have some consumer portfolios in BANK-now, and Swisscard which total about CHF 4 billion. But those are performing relatively well and are a fairly small portion of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn next to our lending activities in the Investment Bank. Most of our loans there are housed in two areas, our developed market corporate portfolio and our Emerging Markets book.</p>
          <p>Let's turn first to the corporate loan book at the top. In the corporate book I'll be speaking to total exposures including both loans and unfunded commitments for completeness. The chart at the right shows loans of 18 billion and unfunded commitments of 47 billion. Our exposures are 80% investment grade and our positions are well diversified across industries and names. As you can see on the chart we have significant hedges that we use to protect the value of this book on both the portfolio and name specific basis. These hedges total some 23 billion.</p>
          <p>The loans and hedges in this book are mostly accounted for on a fair value basis. As market spreads widened during 2008 we marked down our loans and commitments by CHF 3 billion. This was partly offset by fair value gains on our hedges which totaled about CHF 2.2 billion, offsetting roughly 75% of the markdowns.</p>
          <p>At the bottom part of the page we show our loan exposure to Emerging Markets. Our gross loan exposure here is CHF 23 billion and there are few unfunded commitments. We have 17 billion of name specific hedges, so our net exposure to Emerging Markets lending is only about CHF 6 billion.</p>
          <p>These net exposures are well diversified across the major regions and across counterparties. So this gives you a picture of our two largest books in the Investment Bank. The remaining loan books are mostly positions backed by pools or collateral with haircuts.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, our credit exposure in the Investment Bank is generally highly rated and the risks are significantly reduced by hedging. We've taken significant fair value markdowns through P&amp;L already. And although we're concerned about the potential for a tough credit cycle given recent economic developments, we feel that these features provide significant protections for these books.</p>
          <p>I spoke briefly about the reductions in the CMBS portfolio before and I now want to give you some more details here using a format we've used in prior quarters. As mentioned, our exposures have been cut by further 31% and now stand at just under CHF 9 billion.</p>
          <p>The top chart shows you the geographical diversification today which &#x2013; of which 65% is in developed Europe with the largest regions being Germany and the Benelux. The bottom chart shows you that the product mix remains diversified, with office property making up about half of our exposure. Development loans, which are the toughest loans to manage in a down cycle, amount to only 3% of this book.</p>
          <p>Although credit fundamentals for commercial properties have become more stressed, the large majority of our positions are performing and remain current. All our positions are fair valued and there have been no reclassifications through accrual books. The average price has been marked down at 74% of face value, although there is a wide variation by product and by market.</p>
          <p>Our positions were structured with good loan to value support. On an origination basis, we had an average LTV of 70%. We've also done a calculation that updates this loan to value on a basis that updates both the property value and the loan value to current market levels. We would estimate that our current market adjustable loan-to-value is about 82%. This means that our valuations can still withstand a further drop in property values and come back whole from a recovery perspective.</p>
          <p>So while this sector is clearly undergoing some stress, we've reduced it significantly and we created significant protections for potential credit events because of existing fair value markdowns that have already been taken through the income statement.</p>
          <p>Before concluding, I would like to touch briefly on a few other areas of risk that have been prominent recently, which I've set out on this slide. First, our gross exposure to money lift outs -- money market lift outs has been reduced in Q4, through sales, write-down and repayments. It's now down to 600 million and is carried at an average price of less than 45% of face value. Second, we hold about 400 million worth of auction rate securities on our books. This portfolio is relatively small compared with most of the settlement banks and we hold this portfolio at an average price of less than 60% of face value. Third, we do not sponsor any SIVs. Fourth, we do not rely on monolines to hedge our subprime positions in RBMS or CDOs, we do have some trading in other positions that are wrapped monoclines, but we have CDS and other forms of protection against this exposure, and the gross sizes are moderate. Finally, as I mentioned before we have no direct unsecured loans to consumers outside Switzerland, and as you've seen our Swiss portfolio is conservatively underwritten.</p>
          <p>Today, I have tried to explain at a summary level how some of the recent market events have affected the Investment Banking results in the fourth quarter and how Credit Suisse has responded. Moves in the financial market were severe and although we avoided some issues and mitigated others, we were hit by three market shocks in Q4 that were material.</p>
          <p>Credit Suisse has responded to this event by consistently and aggressively reducing risk. We are among the most aggressive in selling down our underwriting exposure early in this crisis, and have made very good progress there. Our Leveraged Financed exposures in particular are now down to less than CHF 1 billion.</p>
          <p>We've also taken steps to cut trading risk in VaR and extended these efforts to address the issues we faced in the markets in Q4. Along with most observers, we expect the real economy will go through a period of significant stress. While we are hopeful that the substantial government actions being considered will mitigate that outcome, we need to be prepared for tough scenarios as well as optimistic ones. Our credit book in Switzerland is performing well. While Switzerland is not immune from global events, it is doing better than many economies. Our Swiss lending book is well-diversified, well-collateralized, and conservatively underwritten.</p>
          <p>Our Investment Banking books have a good credit profile and significant protections from existing fair value discounts, loan-to-value ratios, and an extensive hedging program. We believe that we have made very good progress in reducing our risk exposures and responding aggressively to this crisis. I think a lower risk profile is the right position to take in a period of great uncertainty and I think it's also the right way to support the business strategy of Credit Suisse.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll hand it over to Paul who will talk to realignment of the Investment Bank and our business strategy there going forward. Paul?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We heard Renato give you an overview of the fourth quarter and Wilson's presentation gives you an idea of the risk trends that help explain our results in light of exactly what's happening in the market. I'm going to touch on the performance of the Investment Bank in the fourth quarter, but the focus of my presentation will really be on our progress in implementing the Bank's client focused and capital efficient strategy, details of that strategy more than we gave you in December, and the financial implications of this model overall.</p>
          <p>So if we turn to slide 43, in the upper left hand corner here, you can see some of the market conditions, which Wilson aptly described, and namely the sharp increases that we saw in credit spreads, the breakdown in hedging relationships, and the historically high levels of volatilities and correlations. These conditions unfortunately reflected poorly on our overall results in the fourth quarter. And I personally, and the management team of the Investment Bank, consider them unacceptable.</p>
          <p>However, the conditions in this quarter and over the past year have validated the acceleration of the Investment Bank strategy, which we talked about in December. Under our new business model, the full year pro forma results for our ongoing businesses would have produced revenues of approximately CHF 13.2 billion, which would have made us profitable on that basis. And I'll go through our pro forma analysis in detail later in this presentation.</p>
          <p>We've made good progress in accelerating and adapting our strategy to the current market environment, and with a single minded focus of bringing our risk down. For the year, we reduced RWA by 31% and VaR by 53%. We expect to achieve cost savings in the Investment Bank of 1.3 billion in 2009. And we've already made very significant progress in aligning our resources, capital, head count and technology with our new business focus areas.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 44, Wilson showed you a slide similar to this, but explaining these results of the fourth quarter along the basis of the risk themes, credit spread widening, basis risk and the volatility. This slide shows our fourth quarter organized by business and categories that reflect our strategic outlook. The bar that you see on the far left shows the CHF 4.6 billion total loss in the quarter. And moving from left to right we show results for our key businesses, those businesses we look to reposition and businesses we're exiting and our fair value gains in the far right.</p>
          <p>This first segment representing 3.6 billion of gains in the quarter represents the businesses that are very much central to our strategy. They meet the strategic criteria that we've set out, namely that they are very client focused, they are less volatile, less complex, more liquid, business which have -- Credit Suisse has demonstrated a strategic advantage.</p>
          <p>It's important to emphasize that the strategy that we outline here and the pro formas that we'll show you, are not based upon just businesses -- taking out the businesses that lost money. In fact you can see in the next bar, to your right, the CHF 3 billion of losses in the quarter as businesses that we are very much committed to, but we need to reposition.</p>
          <p>Although conditions were challenging in these areas in the fourth quarter, they are important to the franchise. And they've been very important to the franchise overall. Businesses like Emerging Markets and US Leveraged Finance where we have excellent client franchises and we're confident that we can reposition the business to run with a much lower risk profile.</p>
          <p>In the next bar over, which represents the 7.1 billion of losses in the quarter, we show business that we look to exit. We feel these businesses are fundamentally disadvantaged in the changed environment, or ones which we don't feel we have particular competitive advantages. These are businesses that tend to have lower returns that are more volatile, or businesses that are more complex or less liquid. And lastly again, you see the fair value, it's self-explanatory.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to expand on the discussion we begin in December about accelerating our business plan. We look to a number of things when we made the decision to accelerate our strategy, namely what our clients need from us, how the Investment Bank can best serve in the integrated bank, areas where we feel we had a real competitive advantage, and reflecting how we see the marketplace evolving.</p>
          <p>Positive trends for Credit Suisse include a client preference for strong counter-parties, increased demand for flow and exchange based products, a positive outlook for many of our core franchises and fewer competitors offer us better pricing. Many of these are unique competitive advantages for Credit Suisse. All of this, however, is set against the backdrop of weak macroeconomic environment, serious concerns about credit quality, government intervention creating market uncertainties and a more conservative marketplace with much lower demand for some of our complex products. And so we've adapted out strategy to be more capital efficient and client focused with lower volatility and less risk, operating within the context of the integrated bank.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 47, the successful execution of our strategy is constructed of three main pillars. First risk reduction, second the realignment of our business portfolio, and third the continued streamlining of our expense base.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 48, earlier I said that reducing risk exposure was the prerequisite for executing our strategy. Here is a slide that you've seen in previous quarters, it shows the substantial reduction of exposure in these dislocated fixed income assets. We've brought these exposures down through sales, expirations, cancellations and write downs, as part of our partner asset facility offering through which we transferred some of these illiquid assets to our employees as part of their compensation, as you are aware. It's important to stress, and we do here three times along the bottom as Renato also did, is that we have not reclassified any positions to accrual or whole books.</p>
          <p>What you see on these charts is real trend reduction of our credit exposure over the last several quarters. Our risk reduction has not been limited to the dislocated fixed income assets. We've reduce risk positions across almost all our asset classes. For example the chart on the upper left shows the reduction in our convertibles book. We've reduced our positions by 70% in the fourth quarter. And the chart in the lower left which shows equity trading strategies, we committed that we would sell down our equity and principle trading book as well as our risk arbitrage positions and now that is nearly complete.</p>
          <p>The aggregate impact of all of these risk reduction measures is significant as I think Wilson described. Risk weighted assets down 31% on the year well below the internal targets that we set in December. And we continue to make progress in the early part of this year.</p>
          <p>The next pillar is our focus on the Investment Bank's business mix and operating model as part of the integrated bank. We've reviewed our businesses as I noted emphasizing those that are most important to our clients and important to the integrated bank, those with lower volatility and risk, those more liquid and less complex and those where we feel we have a competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>On the next page, you'll see we have grouped our specific businesses and the various strategic approaches that we are taking on slide 51. Here we show our core franchise building around our client focused and cost and capital efficient strategy, also cost efficient.</p>
          <p>The darkest shaded column farthest to the left shows our key client businesses where we have built the strong market position. These are businesses where we have broad relationships, where we have seen the increase in business activity in market share due to our positions through the crisis.</p>
          <p>In the lighter shaded center column are businesses that we believe can in fact meet our criteria if they're repositioned with a lower risk model. And the lightest column farthest to your right are businesses we regard as strategically challenged, and we will exit. We're exiting these businesses because we don't feel they can be repositioned to fit our criteria. They're either too capital or balance sheet intensive, they're too volatile or complex, or they're ones which we have no particular competitive advantage. This is how we are aligning our business and resources as we implement the Investment Banking strategy.</p>
          <p>On slide 52, we show an example of how we are also reallocating resources as we execute this business plan. It shows that although we have reduced capital overall, our ongoing client businesses have maintained the same basic level of capital. The significant reductions are in the areas that we are repositioning or exiting. This particular graphic illustrates our capital allocation, but this also holds true for other resources such as head count and IT expenditures.</p>
          <p>The next two slides give you much more detail on how we're realigning the equities and fixed income departments. We thought it would be most illustrative to show you these businesses on a pro forma model for 2008. We try to show a pure pro forma model choosing the businesses -- not just choosing the businesses that fit the strategy. So again, not just taking out the ones that lost money over the last few quarters, but in fact ones that fit our strategic criteria.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we did not adjust the pro forma for the risk profile of any of the ongoing businesses. Although, looking forward we will manage many of these repositioned businesses on a much lower risk profile.</p>
          <p>So, we'll turn here to the slide on equities and we show the businesses that are in line with our new model. Again farthest to left the key client businesses shown in darker shading are some of the most important franchises we have, cash equities, prime services and our electronic trading. Our investments here have helped us become a top tier player and we are growing these businesses to press our strategic advantage.</p>
          <p>And the middle bar is where we are adapting our business model and repositioning them to run on a lower risk profile. Equity trading strategies and convertibles are two good examples. I showed you earlier where we brought the risk exposure down in both of these business areas, very significantly. For example in converts we believe we can run this business on less of a back book basis and more client facilitation and much lower risk profile. Similarly, we have shifted out of more volatile equity trading strategies as we turn our focus on more liquid and quantitative strategies, which have in fact demonstrated consistent and strong performance with relatively low volatility.</p>
          <p>Finally, farthest to the right are businesses that we're exiting. These are complex equity trading strategies, highly structured derivatives, businesses that have just proven too volatile or capital intensive to fit our new model going forward.</p>
          <p>Turning to fixed income, we think the pro forma for the changed business like the ones you just saw for equities illustrates the impact of our plan. The darkest bar on the left represents some of our most important client facing businesses. It includes rates and FX one of the few areas that actually has probably benefited from the market turmoil and will benefit looking forward given all the government intervention. These businesses are important both to our clients and meet our criteria, but they're also extraordinary important in the services we provide to the integrated bank. The middle column again are those businesses we need to reposition to accommodate a lower risk profile. Renato mentioned Emerging Markets, also US Leveraged Finance are two good examples. Historically these are leading franchises for us but ones that need repositioning to be able to adapt to a more disciplined risk approach.</p>
          <p>In the lightest column farthest to the right you can see the significant impact of losses in the business we're exiting. We've talked a lot about these areas most affected by the crisis. We don't feel these are viable in a lower risk capital model. These slides indicate how critical it is to execute on our strategy and to be decisive about our positioning.</p>
          <p>With the next slide I want to focus on the integrated bank, one of our greatest advantages within Credit Suisse is the opportunity on cross bank collaboration, and you can see here the resilience of our collaboration efforts over the cycle with both the Private Bank and with Asset Management. Collaboration opportunities include cross selling introductions with both Private Bank and Asset Management, and of course our activities with solution partners which is a joint venture between the Private Bank and Investment Bank to provide solutions to our clients across both platforms.</p>
          <p>We expect the Investment Bank to continue to generate about half of Credit Suisse's collaboration revenue which you saw earlier targeted for CHF 10 billion in 2012. The final pillar of our strategic implementation is streamlining expenses. These are the recurring benefits we realized as a result of the disciplined expense management that we've practiced now over several years.</p>
          <p>Slide 57 shows our progress toward the head count targets that we set out for 2009. These head count reductions have already been announced in December and are directly related to the implementation of our new business strategy. We continue to maintain one of the lowest headcounts of any major Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>We also focused on reducing non-comp expenses. The chart on the right from McLagan survey shows our trend in non-comp expense per head compared with our peers. As you can see here we were slightly above industry average in 2005, but over the last four years we've consistently reduced that spend and our position now is well below the benchmark. We continue to focus on expense reduction and the current market conditions do provide us further opportunities to make strong progress.</p>
          <p>We expect a combination of head count reductions, business realignment, and non-comp expense cuts to reduce our operating expenses by CHF 1.3 billion, or more than 10% of the operating expenses for 2009. Obviously, cost reduction remains a key priority for the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>Last, we come to the financial implications of our strategic model. And on the next slide, I'll revisit the pro forma analysis which we shared with you in December, now reflecting full year results.</p>
          <p>Slide 60 shows the aggregate of all the pro forma P&amp;Ls related to our client facing capital efficient strategy. On the far left, you see our key client businesses, important franchises that generated nearly 18 billion over 2008. These include rates, cash equities, prime services, all areas where we feel we have a good competitive position. To the right of that, the impact of the businesses where we are repositioning our business models and they show a 4.5 billion loss on the year. These represent an important opportunity for us and are important businesses for our clients. They've had challenging years and we're repositioning them to a lower risk, profitable businesses which will provide strong impact on our results going forward.</p>
          <p>Combined, these two segments produced the net revenues of CHF 13.2 billion for the pro forma Investment Bank. Offsetting this are the operating expenses of CHF 11.1 billion and as I mentioned we have clear focus on cost reduction and continuing to drive down these expenses. So overall with this model we are forecasting -- we forecast the CHF 2.1 billion of profits in 2008, in one of the more challenging trading environments in history again on this pro forma model.</p>
          <p>And if we turn to slide 61, this shows the same pro forma analysis through the cycle. It's similar to what we showed you in December, again updated for the full year. It demonstrates overall the resilience of our business model through the cycle, and I believe supports our ability to produce consistent profitability with lower risk and volatility and significantly less capital usage.</p>
          <p>To sum up, our focus particularly during the turmoil of the last year has been to adapt, to accelerate and implement the strategy that leverages our strengths, one that is sustainable and contributes strongly to the integrated bank. Our strategy creates an Investment Bank that focuses on the products that meet our clients' needs, that develops key relationships across our client base, that leverages the strengths of the integrated bank, one that plays to Credit Suisse's strength as a stable counterparty, one that is profitable through the cycle and will generate capital for the bank overall.</p>
          <p>Our client focused capital efficient model is one in which I believe in, one which our management team is committed to successfully executing, and one which we are convinced represents the best strategy for quality solutions to our clients and a strong contribution to Credit Suisse and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And I'll hand it back to Brady.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul. What is the opportunity for Credit Suisse? Our strategy is clear. We remain committed to the integrated model which we believe enables us to most effectively deliver best in class service to our clients, while realizing enhanced operating efficiencies. The acceleration of our strategic plan announced in December will deliver a further substantial reduction of our risk and cost base, and our new business model will free up substantial amounts of capital through continued de-risking and our operating businesses will be capital generative. This acceleration of our strategy and our strong capital base positions Credit Suisse well to address the challenges and to capture the opportunities in the new competitive landscape.</p>
          <p>Paul explained to you how we're repositioning the business in Investment Banking. In essence, we believe that this business model is well suited for the environment over the next three to five years, and that it will allow us to serve our clients well, produce more consistent earnings and free up capital.</p>
          <p>In Private Banking, we will continue to judiciously invest in growth both globally and in our Swiss businesses. In the fourth quarter in Private Banking, we continued to make progress with our international growth strategy and strengthened our team of relationship managers. We see significant potential to gain market share in Switzerland in both Wealth Management and Corporate and Retail Banking and are increasingly benefiting from our strength and stability among our client base.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, we've streamlined our business portfolio by closing our money market funds and by agreeing to sell the majority of our traditional funds business to Aberdeen Asset Management. Aberdeen is one of the UK's leading asset managers and we will receive a stake of up to 24.9% in Aberdeen. We are now in a position to focus our resources on alternative investments, asset allocation, and the Swiss businesses, which are scalable, high margin areas which we can generate excellent returns for our clients. The new organization also provides further potential to reduce costs.</p>
          <p>Our ambition is to become the leading alternative investment manager globally by leveraging existing strengths, for example in Private Equity, and by closing gaps, for example in single manager hedge funds. We have a long history of exceptional returns in our Private Equity business and a very diversified platform from which we believe we can achieve our goal of leadership in this area and the value creation that goes with it. In Switzerland, we are planning to build on our strong presence in our home market for example through improved institutional coverage.</p>
          <p>And in our asset allocation business we will further leverage distribution through Private Banking and increase our focus and resources in this area. Asset Management will become a much more important contributor to the bottom line and a much bigger part of our market capitalization as we drive this strategy forward. From an overall bank perspective, Renato's spoken about the good progress that we're making on the efficiency initiatives. We're also encouraged by the resilience of the revenues that arise from the collaboration between our businesses.</p>
          <p>We had a strong start to 2009. We're quarter to date profitable across all divisions. Yet this is not a light at the end of the tunnel message. 2008 has taught us that being cautious is the best policy. We aim to position Credit Suisse, so we can remain strong if conditions continue to be difficult, but also to benefit from improving conditions should they materialize. In the medium term we believe we will begin to see the impact of various government measures across the globe during the second half of the year. In the long term we think the prospects for our business are excellent. Continued wealth creation in particular in the developed markets is good and we believe we have the right strategy to take advantage of this.</p>
          <p>In conclusion we believe we have everything we need to perform strongly in 2009. Our capital strength is exceptional, our liquidity is strong and this capital strength has been maintained without any government involvement. Our risk profile has been very significantly reduced. We have an attractive business model and clear strategy. Throughout the crisis we have maintained our client momentum, evidenced by strong performance in Private Banking. In particular our net new assets and in our Corporate and Retail Bank, our client facing Investment Banking businesses and our more focused Asset Management business.</p>
          <p>We have made very good progress in moving our strategy forward in all our businesses. So with all this we believe we are extremely well positioned to capitalize on our relative strength in an industry landscape that has been dramatically disrupted over the last year. This will benefit our shareholders, our clients, our employees and the Swiss financial market.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much for your attention and now we'll be happy to open it up for questions. I don't know, do we, Marc want to do in the room first or, okay. We have microphones, so if you want to raise your hand. We'll start hear and then, first hear and then second here.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Philipp Zieschang from UBS. Three questions please, the first one is while your tier 1 ratio is exceptionally strong at 13.3 your equity tier 1 ratio has dropped sharply to 7.9%. And in the context that I believe the Swiss regulator and the new rules to be effective 2013 use 80% as a minimum. Could you comment how the -- how you actually manage the business, whether equity tier 1 ratio is of importance to you and whether there are any constraints with respect to this one?</p>
          <p>Second one is the reduction of the Investment Bank's balance sheet. Could you comment on how these 30 billion something risk weighted assets reduction planned? What is the associated total asset number and how will the reduction take place? Is it going to be disposals, are these assets, just rolling off or, and potentially also what costs you actually expect for that?</p>
          <p>And finally just slide 60, the pro forma clean in Investment Bank, I was wondering I think there are the three point something billion gain on own debt are included in revenues. If I strip these out, I believe you were even with your clean Investment Bank loss making, so could you just comment whether this is, whether we should include them in -- or why you actually included them in your slide? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Why don't I -- I'll address the first question maybe Paul or Wilson, if you could address the reduction in balance sheet, I could talk a little bit about it and then we can talk about the pro forma P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>With regard to the Tier 1 ratio, as you say we do have a very strong Tier 1 ratio and we feel we have a very high quality equity structure on the balance sheet. So we are -- and we are -- as we've announced, we are in excess of the FINMAs requirements for 2013 in terms of capital. So I don't know exactly what your calculation is with the 7.9 or the 8%. We are in excess of the requirements from the regulator for 2013 in terms of the capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, just to check back, the FINMA, the former EBK is basing whatever ratio they require from us on the Tier 1 capital. So it's nothing -- not necessarily directly related with the equity. Of course there is a translation, for instance the goodwill is not included there, but hybrid is included. So, there is a transitional, so the equity ratio is not something, if I understand it correctly that the FINMA is focusing on. So the ratios they are requesting also by the way for the leverage ratio, is based on the Tier 1 capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> management of the capital you focus on Tier 1 rather than on equity Tier 1?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I strip out from your Tier 1 capital, the non-qualifying minorities which are 1.7 billion I think and then in particular the Tier 1 hybrids which are not loss absorbing, I end up with a ratio coming down from 13.3 --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And obviously the equity investor in these days is focusing on this number very much, so <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you are calling is a core Tier 1 ratio, that's what typically is mentioned which is the tier 1 ratio minus the hybrid. Now, the FINMA has adopted the European model now that allows us to have 35% of total Tier 1 as hybrid. That's basically the number we have roughly right now going forward. And with that, we achieved already the 2013 requirements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as you said, there are a lot of different ways to look at the capital. We think we're very strongly capitalized from virtually any point of view you want to look at it. As you say, I actually think the Tier 1 hybrids are high quality capital, but as you say people can look at it and analyze it as they want. But the other thing that I think is very important is we have a very capital generative business. And if you look at just, if you can get normal markets making profits, and also with our strategy in the Investment Bank which is to continue to reduce the risk-weighted assets there. That's going to free up and generate more capital as well. So, I actually think that this is a very capital generative model, and that's probably the most, in terms of the forward-looking view, that's probably the most important point to make.</p>
          <p>The second question was around the RWA reduction, I &#x2013; do you want to address it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, why don't I address the second part, why don't you do the third. You asked a question about the, I think how the RWA reduction is going to translate into a balance sheet reduction. I don't think we've given a specific forecast on that translation, but the reduction's mostly going to be taking place in terms of trading assets to loan portfolio --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You need to have a microphone, sorry --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your question was regarding how the RWA reductions will translate into balance sheet reductions. While we haven't given the specific forecast for exactly how that will map, the balance sheet reductions will mostly take place in the trading assets. The loan assets tend to be more stable by nature. Those trading assets are generally on a fair value basis. So we don't expect any particular cost with respect to disposal &#x2013; they are all mark-to-market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as I understand -- is it okay with this mic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I understand your question around the pro forma analysis and how we've incorporated the fair value associated in with that. Fair value obviously an important part of our capital management and we have managed around partly fair value, and won't go into our corporate loan book and so on in fair value basis for that. But rather say that, we did and I said earlier try to create a very pure pro forma. So part of that pro forma actually only included some of the fair value in the ongoing businesses as well as the repositioned business and took away some of the benefit of the fair value associated with the businesses that we're exiting. If you wanted to strip that out completely, you could come up with more of a breakeven result in what was probably the most challenging year in Investment Banking history.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the next question was here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Kilian Maier, NZB Neue Z&#xFC;rcher Bank. The first question is on your business update, does your positive business update for January also -- is also valid for net new asset flows in Private Banking and Asset Management?</p>
          <p>The second question would be on relationship manager hiring that in total number of relationship managers has stayed stable in Q4, maybe you could elaborate a little bit why you couldn't hire? At least UBS lost 180 so they must have gone somewhere?</p>
          <p>And the third question would be on tax loss carry-forwards, in the meantime you have quite some tax loss carry-forwards. My question would be to which jurisdictions do they refer to, is it mainly Switzerland related or is it also foreign related and to what extent?</p>
          <p>And the last question would be on your Partner Asset Facility. Can you provide a little bit more detail on that? What has been the valuation date, how big is it, how is it accounted for and maybe also the timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, good questions. Well, maybe I'll answer the first one, Walter if you could take the second one on RM hiring, Renato, the tax loan and maybe Wilson you could take the bit more of a description of the PAF.</p>
          <p>With regard to the business update for January, as we've said it was a strong start to the year not just January, but actually quarter to-date strong start. All the businesses are profitable and we've had throughout this whole &#x2013; throughout really the whole crisis we've had consistent strong client inflows. And I would say that those have continued into January and obviously quarter to-date, obviously we can't project what will happen for the whole quarter, but that's what we're seeing so far. Do you want address the issue on the RM --</p>

          <p>Hiring in fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, well we are flat as you can see, but if you look into the regions you see like we hired 30, now I don't know whether they are from UBS here in Switzerland, and we let 30 go in Asia and that was due to a low performer program, which we are running every year. And then clearly the last quarter is always the one where you hold back a little bit in terms of hiring because of compensation reasons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think we would say we continue to think we see the best opportunities that we have ever seen really to hire very high quality people in this area. We've taken advantage of that, we've hired top teams from competitors all around the world. And frankly there continues to be more consolidation and more activity in the Private Banking part of the world that we think is going to continue to offer good opportunities. Renato, the tax losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, contrary to what you mentioned, the majority of the deferred tax assets and the losses we had of course, we have in the jurisdiction where they happened. So the deferred tax assets on net operating losses are to over 50% in the US, they are to about 25% in the UK and about 5% in Switzerland. It's only a minor amount in Switzerland.</p>

          <p>On the PAF facility, we transferred a pool of illiquid assets as at year end. That pool consisted of CMBS, Leveraged Finance and corporate loans. We did provide some leverage against those assets as is customary in the market. They were transferred as at fair value on that date as at 12/31, and we subject that to a number of internal reviews from independent departments to make sure that was a true fair value. The payout on those assets will be extended and will happen over an eight period.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question? Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi Chris Wheeler from MainFirst Bank. First of all a couple of back questions on the Investment Bank, I think slide 37, you show unfunded lines of 47 billion, I think that's 80% of the total commitments there. Can you talk about the trends in that and what efforts you've been making to reduce those unfunded commitments declines? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second on Paul's 1.3 billion reduction on the nine month run rate, I'm assuming from the slide that's on the non-bonus element of the cost in the first nine months. And if that is the case, would you provide us with what the nine month cost base was without the bonus element, he said laughingly?</p>
          <p>The next question is in- in terms of the Wealth Management business, in terms of net new money you show a fairly small 2 billion net new inflow in Switzerland, but obviously that's net of some pretty hefty leverage or de-leveraging. Can you give us some net gross figure for Switzerland? And also perhaps give us some flavor for where the Americas growth is, because that's pretty strong, and I just wonder how much of that's the US, how much of that's Hedging-Griffo et cetera.</p>
          <p>And finally the loan book in Wealth Management, 72 billion, I think you said 50% was Lombard lending. Can you give us some geographic break-down of that obviously the focus after yesterday is on Asia, but also perhaps on any Russian and other geographic exposures you may be concerned about? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay maybe Wilson if you could take the first question about the &#x2013; I think it was about the commitments on the Investment Banking line, and then Paul you can address the reduction in cost, I don't know, Walter if you could address the issue of a Swiss picture of the deleveraging impact, and then maybe Wilson again on the Wealth Management loan book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure on the unfunded commitments of 47 billion, those have been actually pretty stable, those are largely to investment grade corporates. We have not seen any particular changes in drawdown activity, even through this crisis which some people have predicted. We've seen a little bit but not very much. These are part of our core corporate client base, and they've largely been pretty stable through this crisis. So it's been pretty flat as a trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul do you want to address the issue of the 1.3 reduction and I guess we're probably not going to talk about obviously bonus and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We won't break into the bonus part of it, but good try. It does include some component of bonuses. So it's not exclusively non-comp, the bulk of it is non-comp expense savings. So it's a run rate for our expense base overall, but it does includes some assumption on bonus.</p>

          <p>Well that is &#x2013; that was pro forma for full year 2008, and so, if you look at 2009, we expect our expenses to go down in 2009 by 1.3 billion from that rate.

          <p>Huw van Steenis, Morgan Stanley. Firstly, you had a very large swing in your OCI in the quarter about 4.4 billion. I think historically FX has been quite a large contributor to that. Could you clarify how much of the move was FX, or put the other way, given the dollar has we see now rallied as much as it's fell in Q4, how much of that will reverse in Q1?</p>
          <p>And then secondly in the loan book in the Investment Bank, your impaired loan doubled to 4%, I was wondering if you could give a bit of color of what sort of things they may be, and what underlying trends you're seeing or you expect for 2009? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Obviously, we have started to see some tougher credit conditions after what's been four to five years of really exceptionally good credit performance. So we have seen our non-performers tick up somewhat in the Investment Bank. These are all accounted for on a fair value basis, so that is all reflected through to the P&amp;L.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Other questions in here, or shall we go to the -- there must be a lot of people on the phone I assume. And we can come back here as well, after we take them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Don't worry I'll be quick, so people on the phone can ask. It's Yenig here from Goldman's. I just have three very brief questions, on page 10, just to finish off the debate on this deleveraging. Can you just give us a sense of what the impact of the deleveraging was on Q1, Q2 and Q3, net new money flows? So we can compare with this 13.8 billion figure that you're giving us for Q4. And I think the second question on this is that, is it your sense there's much deleveraging to go, or do you think this is more or less it?</p>
          <p>The second question is on page 37, where you show your large corporate book and you show extensive hedging both of your large corporate and emerging market book. And I was just wondering what is your sense for the counterparty risk on the CDS' that you're making extensive use of here, and do you think there is any counterparty risk at all?</p>
          <p>And finally, just on the business update, I understand that you said that all of the businesses are profitable quarter to-date. I was just wondering when you say all of the businesses are profitable, are you using year-end marks for your investments or are you using up to-date marks? So are you referring to franchise revenues or have you marked everything as of quarter to-date so to speak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we actually -- on the last question, we mark all of our positions on a daily basis. So any results quarter to-date would include any marks up or marks down in the assets as well as any flows and everything else that's happened. So, there is no &#x2013; it's whatever has happened since the end of the year to today, on a fair value basis as they're all fair valued. So it's -- it includes &#x2013; it certainly includes any improvements or any markdowns in any of the asset categories plus all the flows and it's been, I think, as you can imagine right on both of those fronts, obviously many of the markets have rallied, but also there has been good flow business.</p>
          <p>The question of the deleveraging about Q1, 2, 3, and then -- the whether we think we are done with the deleveraging, Walter you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a rough number. I don't have the exact number but the first three quarters in total are about 5 billion positive and in terms of deleveraging, I expect actually that the worst is behind us. In terms of sequences, just if you get a little bit of a feeling how this has happened obviously October was a lot of like additional margin calls, so on and so forth. But the deleveraging has taken place in December where our portfolios got restructured. And that I think is across the Private Banking universe is done, and now it's obviously depending on markets and how it will develop. But the worst is certainly behind us.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to address the issue, Wilson, of the counter-party risk in terms of the hedging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, it's a very good question and it's one we've spent a lot of time on over the last several months, particularly with all the stress in the financial markets. Our counterparties are generally large financial institutions. When you look at our top ten hedge providers, they are all major commercial banks. Importantly all those exposures are collateralized on a daily basis. So in addition to having generally speaking good counterparties, we also move collateral daily to collateralize those positions.</p>
          <p>In addition, in our Emerging Markets books we have some positions that are collateralized by insurance. None of those insurers are monolines, they're all investment grade rated insurance companies and they're well diversified. So we've tried very hard to make sure that not only are they hedged, but these positions are hedged with good quality counterparties, diversified and generally on a collateralized basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think we'd obviously the last six months would give anybody pause talking about hedged risks, since a lot of times those hedges haven't worked. I think in the case of the Emerging Markets book it's very specific name hedge, so there's a lot of very specific matching. So we feel pretty comfortable with that. In the investment-grade book it's a little less just specific name hedging. So there's a little more potential basis risk. As you can see from some of the numbers that I think Wilson mentioned, 3 billion mark up, or 3 billion mark down, 2.2 billion mark up in the fourth quarter. So there is some less than 100% matching hedging there, but we feel in a &#x2013; over a longer period of time, there could be quarter-to-quarter variations, but over a longer period of time we feel like that is good cover and good hedging.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two quick questions. The first was on the FINMA leverage ratio which you haven't disclosed the number, but if I take your asset base and I strip out a little over CHF 100 billion of Swiss loans in the Corporate and Retail Bank, and goodwill and the cash components, I get to an estimated FINMA leverage ratio of about 3.4%, does that sound about right to you?</p>
          <p>And the second question is again on the balance sheet looking at the year end, it's shrunk very, very quickly. You've got a core funding surplus already. The cash balances have built up to CHF 90 billion or cash plus bank balances. And it does look like an extremely liquid balance sheet, and if I look at the cumulative gains on own debt, I think it's about CHF 7 billion now. Normally I'd regard that as a very academic number, which is why it's not included in Tier 1 capital. But it does look like, if there is any bank out there that might be able to monetize and lock that in, it might be you. So, do you have any comments about whether that could be something that could be practical in 2009? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Renato, you want to address the FINMA leverage ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the FINMA leverage ratio as we told you before, this is not something that is widely disclosed, because it's the FINMA that have made the rules. As you know on the &#x2013; our main competitor here in Switzerland has given some indications yesterday on how they have calculated the leverage ratio. You alluded to some assets that are deducted for FINMA purposes. Without going into detail on what that is, and it's of course pretty similar to what our colleagues have here in -- down the road. This is the way that we will calculate going forward. And the only thing I can confirm to you is that we are above the 3% minimum leverage ratio set out by the way for 2013. So, up to 2013 that we are absolutely clear even if we talk so much about that there is no leverage ratio requirement until 2013. But we would exceed the requirements, to date we are above 3%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think with regard to the -- as you say the balance sheet reductions, the funding position that we are in. We do feel, obviously we've -- we believe we've been in very good shape throughout. As you mentioned with reduction in the balance sheet and continuing reductions in the balance sheet. It is something that is factoring into our decisions around how we are funding in other potential decisions that we're making.</p>
          <p>Certainly we have about CHF 12 billion of long-term debt that comes due in 2009. And so if you looked at it, you'd say well that's 12 billion that has to be refinanced in the next year which we would normally say that's a pretty -- that's obviously pretty manageable. Given reductions in balance sheet and what we are doing overall, it may not even be necessary to -- may not be necessary to replace that. On the other hand we may want to displace some more shorter term debt with some longer term, if we get opportunities to raise that.</p>
          <p>The other issue you're raising is would we be actually buying back debt in order to take advantage of our situation? We actually have been buying back some smaller pieces of debt over time. I don't think we've made a decision yet whether or not that's something that we would do more broadly.</p>

          <p>Good morning, just wanted to come back to the negative OCI moves, and in particular on your pensions fund, I think in the past you said that your pension funds are in deficit under US GAAP, but surplus under Swiss GAAP and that's why you didn't have to take the negative hit to your regulatory capital, but you did see it in your accounting capital. Could you just give us an update on that situation and perhaps say how much your pension funds are in surplus or deficit under US GAAP versus under Swiss statutory accounting? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, first of all a question on the risk weighted asset reduction in the Investment Bank. And how much will it cost you to unwind these positions assuming revenue environment as &#x2013; or an environment generally as in 2008?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding provisioning trends, we've seen the pickup in provisions, how do you see that developing into 2009? In terms of Wealth Management, can you give us an idea of how top-line margins should develop considering the deleveraging process that you saw in December and also potentially in the future?</p>
          <p>And lastly, on page 60, just looking at the slide again, I wonder ex on debt gains, how you get to a pre-tax margin of 25, if you can give me a normal environment that you would see for the new business model, in order to see how we could get to a 25% pre-tax margin? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think on the risk weighted asset reduction. I think Wilson actually addressed it a little bit before. I think our general view is that our assets are marked at fair value and so in general, we view particularly in any kind of a -- obviously the fourth quarter was a very extreme environment. The first quarter so far has been a more normal environment. I don't think that we view that continuing to reduce the balance sheet would necessarily have any particular additional cost to it.</p>
          <p>Obviously we need to, there are &#x2013; there continue to be certain asset categories that we've already determined that we want to reduce, we'll continue to do that. And then in general, there are different ways to configure the business, as Paul mentioned repositioning a number of the businesses. And so frankly, we don't see any of that giving rise to any unusual costs, I would say. Sorry your second question was around...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Provisioning trend, yes, so I don't know Wilson do you want to address that again or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as we tried to show on our slides, I think it's important to distinguish between two different loan books. One is our Investment Banking book, well we don't really have that many provisions because the books are more mostly on fair value. So we've taken a discount through our income statement already as we marked those to the current spreads that are in the market, so that those spreads are -- already give us a fair amount of cushion with respect to any future challenges with those assets. As we discussed we do think that the current economic environment could be challenging, but we've already got a fair amount of fair value reserves. They give us in a sense a buffer for potential credit hits on those assets.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Private Bank that is more on an accrual basis, there what we look to is really a good collateralization rate. We've talked about our Lombard losses, which even in a pretty extraordinary period in collateralization markets held up pretty well. We only had about 100 million of hits in that portfolio, which I think shows the resilience of that book. We have good credit protection with respect to residential book in Switzerland, and a good ratings profile for corporate book. We can't say that Switzerland is immune, but we can say that we think our portfolio is pretty good and that our current readings still show a pretty good performance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Wealth Management side in terms of development of gross basis point income, the de-leveraging will most likely have an effect of about three to four basis points, and this will occur in the recurring basis. And obviously the rest is related to markets and right now they are very slow. So I think the first quarter will be slow and then I'll expect a recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the last question, I can take a shot and then Paul can add to it. But, I mean we -- this issue of the 2008 number and the fair value own debt number, what we're trying to do is provide some kind of a framework for you to look at how this new Investment Banking strategy might operate over time. So, for instance the previous years that we showed I don't think there were any material fair value own debt charges in any of those years. There was in '07, so probably some smaller number, but, okay.</p>
          <p>So, if you look at the years before that. So it's really meant more to give a guide for how the business might look. I think our view is -- but also by the way in some respects you might say, first of all you can have a debate about whether fair value own debt is legitimate numbers in there in the first place. We're having a discussion as if, well of course you just take those out. We could have the discussion about the fact that that does offset fair value losses in other parts of the business that we've had.</p>
          <p>But in any case I think our general view is that this gives you some perspective on how we think we can run the Investment Banking business. That we think we can run it with a lot less capital, with good net income and good returns on the business. And so that's really our impact. So, the 25% pre-tax margin, yeah, we think that is doable and we're fairly confident of that, but I don't know, Paul maybe you can...</p>

          <p>Yeah, I think if you turn to slide 61 you can see and you're probably observing, if you look at just the period, the past few years on just that raw pro forma basis, it's just under 20% margin there. Remember you pointed out it includes the fair value in principally in '08, but it, I'll note that it also includes 4.5 billion of losses in repositioned businesses which I mentioned we think we can run lower risk and on a profitable basis. So I think that's probably the swing factor.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question on the phone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Georg Kanders from WestLB. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I have a question of if you could elaborate a little bit more on the losses in December, as we had the biggest market distortion in October and November concerning volatility and basis risk, could you please elaborate a little bit more what happened in December?</p>
          <p>And secondly on the risk provisioning in the Wealth Management unit, has this also happened to a few clients in a specific area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So your first question was just talking a bit more about December conditions in December and what the impact was. Your second question was in terms of -- you said in terms of risk provisioning in Wealth Management, you're asking was just a few clients or broader, is that right? Okay.</p>
          <p>I think Wilson could talk more about it, but I think actually December was a lot of the trends that Wilson spoke about which actually had probably accelerated and into December really. We saw extreme cash and index market decoupling, particularly cash markets there was no liquidity, people weren't buying cash instruments so those tended to be getting marked down. While on the other side index markets were rallying during the month, there continued to be a lot of volatility. I'd say December was sort of a microcosm of what Wilson talked about for the whole quarter, probably even more extreme or more relentless during the month. So that was really December and I think particularly exacerbated by just your normal illiquidity during a December period I think exacerbated all those trends, but I don't know if there's anything to add to that Wilson, or..?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the only thing I would &#x2013; if you look at slide 29 we've tried to give you a sense of some of the key drivers and give you that in a pictorial format. I think Brady highlighted a couple of the key elements. We did see cash markets go into a very illiquid period in December. There was a lot of forced deleveraging so a lot of the trading was not if you will voluntary but forced. And that made two-way markets very illiquid and very gappy.</p>
          <p>You can see some of the spreads in credit -- credit spreads on page 29 as well as the widening of basis risk. So December was a pretty extraordinary time, a very difficult time in the markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the Wealth Management provisioning, Walter do you want to address that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the provisioning was for, I think numerous clients. So it's not like a single position, it was just across the whole portfolio. I think that was your question right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question on the phone?</p>
          <p>Operating: Your next question comes from Jeremy Sigee from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thank you. Just two specific questions please. Firstly, on the charges for ARS, and also for Private Equity losses, do we need to be ready for more of those to come through in the coming quarters? Particularly from private equity, is that likely to be a drip-feed or do you feel that's dealt with?</p>
          <p>And second question, I don't know if you've disclosed, if not could you, your exposures to Russia and to the rest of CEE both in terms of loans and commitments and secondly trading exposures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Jeremy. I think with regard to the ARS, I can -- obviously we can't, it's hard for us to predict where prices will go in the markets. In ARS we have a manageably sized book, certainly compared to what others have and its marked, I think quite -- well it's marked appropriately against the markets, our accountants will tell us. But I think it's marked at $0.58 on the dollar.</p>
          <p>So, our general view is that I would say on the ARS, our hope would be that that is not something that's going to be of any material size going forward, but obviously we can't predict exactly what will happen in the markets, but I don't think that will be -- As for Private Equity, I don't know Rob Shafir you want to address that? Somebody have a microphone, the handheld?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say about our Private Equity exposures is number one, they are very diversified and number two, they are typically in the mid cap range and deploy a lot lower leverage than many of the big cap Private Equity exposures you've seen in the marketplace. So we go through a very rigorous process of marking this portfolio every single quarter and certainly it is subject to market and economic conditions, but I'd say certainly on a relative basis, I think is a much lower risked portfolio than the average Private Equity portfolio you see out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And they're all are performing right, they are not --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is no -- these are all mark-to-markets. There are no realized losses, there are no bankruptcies or anything of that nature in the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with regard to the last question, yeah Wilson why don't you answer it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think your last question was about emerging market exposures such as to Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Specifically Russia and Eastern Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah on slide 37, we give you a breakdown of our loan exposure, which is net about 6 billion to the Emerging Markets. That is split pretty evenly between Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America, obviously bigger countries tend to be a bigger portion of that, but it is diversified within each of those regions.</p>
          <p>We also have some derivative books, which are smaller, but do have some credit exposure in those countries. We have some cash inventory positions, which are also smaller and which have been brought down pretty dramatically in Q4. So I think that should give you a general picture without giving you specific country-by-country numbers, give you a pretty good view of the diversification we have across emerging markets broadly and for any given country in particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think also, I think Jeremy also asked briefly about the trading risks, the trading risks in Emerging Markets have been -- are relatively low now across all the regions actually so I suspect that would also apply to Russia and Eastern Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. We showed you a trend in the Emerging Markets' bond book on one of the pages, and shows you that's down at pretty low levels right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jeremy. Okay. Can we take any other questions here in the auditorium, anybody else wants to ask anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I appreciate your time here today. As we say we do believe that we come into 2009 well positioned, strong capital, good risk reduction, the client franchises performing quite well. We think the way we've repositioned both our Investment Banking and Asset Management businesses is going to be very positive for how we can perform this year, and obviously with a strong start to the year and with profitability in all the businesses that's encouraging to us, but obviously we will all see how the markets and conditions treat us going forward, but thanks very much for your time and your attention, appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
