        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for the first quarter earnings conference call of Grupo Mexico. I am joined in this conference by Rogelio Velez CEO of Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano; Enrique Nava, Chief Financial Officer for Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, Jorge Pulido, Head of Investor Relations and Alberto De La Parra, Gen28eral Counsel. Today, I will start with the main remarks of Grupo Mexico during the first quarter of 2008, and provide a brief update on Asarco's Chapter 11 proceedings. After that I will turn to the developments of financial highlights of the mining division, and we will then transfer the call to Enrique Nava who will discuss the financials highlights of transportation and infrastructure divisions.</p>
          <p>Finally, we will open up the forum for questions and answers. In the first quarter on net consolidated basis, Grupo Mexico had a strong performance, posting double-digit growth both year-over-year, as well quarter-over-quarter. This growth was mainly due on solid coppers part by strong metal prices and an increase in molybdenum production, despite declining volumes in copper as a consequence of the levels opposite Cananea. Our transportation division continued its growth trend in sales and EBITDA, supported by higher volumes and cost containments. Regarding our main method fundamentals and expectations, I can briefly comment that in the first quarter copper market was characterized by strong demand and weak supply response. Even though we have senior riques market, the demand growth for margin economies led by China and India maintained copper demand at a strong pace.</p>
          <p>On the supply side though, the focus for 2008 indicates the copper deficit due to labor unrest and power shortages mainly in Chile and South Africa. At London, we have extremely low copper inventories in the market. We can expect this events to positively affect the short-term copper price. Consequently we have our profit in copper price outlook for the remaining of this year. This quarter on average copper price was $3.54 per pound, an increase of 32% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter. With respect to molybdenum, the average price in this quarter was $33 per pound, an increase of 28% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, our total revenues were 1.7 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. As I mentioned, this increase is mainly attributable to higher metal prices and sales of molybdenum but also to an increase of 7% into revenues of our transportation division. Despite the first quarter volumes remained somewhat flat. In the first quarter, the cost of sales was 675 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year and a decrease of 5% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The main variances were higher fuel, power and labor cost in Southern Copper but also a favorable effect in transportation division that generated cost reductions due to lower fuel consumptions. EBITDA in the first quarter was a little north of one billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year with an EBITDA margin of 59%. EBITDA increased 34% quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>Net income for the first quarter was 453 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year, and 118% quarter-over-quarter. Earnings per share amounted to $0.18 on the dollar for fully diluted share compared to $0.17 in the first quarter '07. On its meeting of April 25th, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of one peso per share. The dividend will be payable in a single installment as of May 9th. Total capital expenditures amounted to 98 million in the first quarter '08 representing a decrease of 16 million on a year-over-year basis. 58 million were spent in the mining division and 40 million in the transportation division. This reduction in CapEx is largely related to the completion of the Ilo's smelter modernization in January 2007. However, higher expenditures were made for the modification and replacement of various tracks and the acquisition of track machinery in the railroad. As of March 31st, the cash position of Grupo Mexico on a consolidated basis was 2.8 billion and then on standalone basis 1.1 million. It is important to mention that Grupo Mexico will remain focused on investing within its two main core businesses, mining and infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn to a brief update on the Asarco Chapter 11 proceedings. As most of you know, Grupo Mexico strongly opposes the proceeding proposed by Asarco's Independent Board to auction the assets. The judge give his preliminary approval to the auction but also allowed the Grupo Mexico submit the bidding offer for the assets or files our reorganization plan. The judge also approved the request of Grupo Mexico to appoint an examiner for the auction process. The examiner will oversee that the process is conducted under transparency and impartiality. April 30th is the date set for the submission of these proposals. After this due date, Asarco will select the winning proposal in order to present a joint organization plan to the judge by the 10th of June this year.</p>
          <p>Grupo Mexico believes that Asarco have this financial capacity to generate sufficient cash flow to guarantee under our reorganization plan full payment to its recognized creditors and to maintain reasonable value for the shareholders. Its cash position reinforces the conclusions of Grupo Mexico in terms of Asarco's value and being the properness of the auction process. Grupo Mexico believes that its organization plans would be accepted within or outside the auction process.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the main developments of Southern Copper. I'll try to keep this brief as some company already had its conference call yesterday. As I mentioned in yesterday's conference call, in the first quarter '08, Cananea started ramping up its operations reaching at the end of the quarter approximately 48% of its total capacity. However on April 11th, the mine access was blocked again. The company has tried unsuccessfully to resolve the current labor disruptions and have lasted for more than nine months and they have obstructed production of Cananea. Hence the Board of Directors have decided to offer all employees a severance payment in accordance with the collected bargain and agreement and a pick of law. This is offered in order to benefit the employees with a fine severance payment that will allow them to choose the labor alternative that is better for each of them.</p>
          <p>The company will start its copper research of Cananea committing through a same operations in the future. For the one's there is a labor stability and legal are trying to produce with efficiency and competitiveness. I repeatedly informed that net copper production was 60 meter around 135,000 tons for 2008. I am sure you will understand that at this point we are unable to provide a revised copper production guidance for the remaining of a year. As the dating which we will receive operations is not currently foreseeable. Southern Copper's total revenue since first quarter '08 reached 1.5 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year. The cost of sales in the first quarter '08 was 525.1 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year; EBITDA in the first quarter amounted to 945 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year. This was equivalent to 63% of net sales by the way. Net income for the first quarter, '08 was 565 million, 2% higher than year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Finally, Southern Copper's 2.1 billion capital expenditure program is underway, and as we've commented before we are prioritizing that Tia Maria reaching project, the expansion of Toquepala and Cuajone mines as well as the expansions of the coppers melting and refining facilities to accommodate this as mine expansions in Peru. We have mentioned this project will increase our copper production by 270,000 tons by 2011. This growth, represents 39% of our current capacity.</p>
          <p>With this, I'll now pass on the call to Enrique Nava, who will discuss the main financial highlights of the railroad and infrastructure division. Enrique?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I will now turn to main remarks of the first quarter 2008 results of the transport division represented by the subsidiary, Infraestructura y Transportes Business Mexico ITM, it's principal subsidiaries are Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, GFM and Ferrocarril Mexicano, Ferromex. The low volume transport during the first quarter 2008 make sure in 8 tons kilometer, more 9.2 billion compared to the almost the same amount flat 2.2 billion unchanged year-over-year. The low volume last event however the mix of traffic and the average travel distance improved.</p>
          <p>First quarter 2008 net sales amounted to 238 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year, despite that the low volume was equal. Because of sales, 149 million in first quarter '08, 2% lover year-over-year. The main reasons for these decline was attributable to one, despite that 6% increase in the price of diesel, Ferromex was able to cut fuel consumption due to improvements in operations and the favorable effect of new locomotives which produce a reduction in the consumption of diesel per ton kilometer resulting in a decrease of $2.2 million in diesel costs.</p>
          <p>Second, Caridad reported a decline of 5.1% or nearly $1 million in first quarter 2008, as the company reduced the utilization of cars owned by third party regular companies. The operating income was 57 million in first quarter '08, an increase of 41 year-over-year with a margin of 24%.</p>
          <p>EBITDA during the first quarter '08 increased to 83 million from 62 million year-over-year, an increase of 35% and was equivalent to 35% margin on net sales. The net income during the first quarter '08 increased to 30.2 million compared with 27 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year. The capital expenditures in the first quarter '08 amounted nearly 40 million compared with 22 million, an increase of 77% year-over-year due mainly for the rehabilitation of the great tracts, enlargement and new sidings and the acquisition of railroad machinery which have increased strength velocity, improved operating safety and produce savings in diesel consumption.</p>
          <p>I will now discuss the results of our subsidiary Ferrosur which currently does not consolidate in ITM. Ferrosur, first quarter '08 revenues totaled 57 million, 2% below year-over-year, affecting negatively the fact that this year Easter fell in March, whereas in 2007 it happened in April. The industrial activities diminished significantly this week in especial in the automotive industry where several assembly plants closed their facilities completely. The operating income grasped 9 million in first quarter '08, nearly 1 million in a lower year-over-year due to lower sales and an increase of 1 million in depreciation due basically to the replacement of part of the fleet of locomotives. EBITDA for first quarter '08 was 15 million, a decrease of 7% year-over-year with an EBITDA margin of 27%. The net income during the first quarter was 1 million, a decrease of 82% year-over-year due to 2 million higher financial costs and a decrease of other revenues by 1 million.</p>
          <p>I will now return the call Daniel Muniz.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And our first question is from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Just a question about the use of cash that the Grupo Mexico currently has on its balance sheet and also if you could touch on the situation with Asarco. My understanding according to your press release is that you are saying you would be in a position to bid on Asarco, no different than any of the other companies which are interested in buying this asset? That's my first question if this is in fact is true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jorge. Thank you for your question. Well, first of all I'll start by saying that our cash position we believe is not excessive when we compare it to our market cap that being the cash position on a standalone basis the Grupo Mexico be 5% of our market cap currently that I mean having said that we're currently analyzing investment opportunities in infrastructure that suppose to growth of mining of Railroad divisions and that improve our business platform from today's shareholder value. And then you got some of these investments are currently at confidential level not now but I am sure if this investment do not accrete to the shortfall this I mean the board will decide and to pay our higher dividend yield. And well actually if you will I will hear -- we have here with us our General Counsel. I think he'll be better to answer the Asarco question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. The question is like well there is a difference on the possibility of Grupo Mexico subsidiaries to be in for the Asarco asset. As you know, the Judge got approved a preliminary this auction process where potential dealers will present a bill offer for the Asarco sale of good and with the winning offer a plan of organization will be prepared. At the same time with Judge approved preliminary approved this process also approve that at the bidding a Grupo Mexico subsidiaries resent a reorganization plan at the form of it. So, this can be compared beside this payment of creditors with the offer supported while if there is no difference within the process meaning that a Grupo of Mexico have the same rights of any other bid above with that being the shareholder of a company instead of offering for the sale or such assets will offer a plant number and organization process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, if I could just clarify that point. Is there a difference then in the potential cash outlay when one recommends a reorganization as opposed to an outright sale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there shouldn't be a difference because at the end I mean the cash to be proposed by the bidders together with the cash of Asarco will be used for dealing development of a reorganization plan, the same thing in case of Grupo, Grupo will be able to offer either by capitalization or by stock of obligations of a company on the reorganization plan either by paying everyone in full or maintaining some of a credits or degrade corresponding fair as approved or provided by the law and rupture allowing in Texas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just -- also you did mention some legalities on your press release about that you would take other options, it sounds that this a sort of plan B or C in the event that perhaps this asset Asarco is ultimately purchased by somebody else, would you be in a position than to pursue legal remedies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is not necessarily to plan B. It's consistent with the position that the company has been follow all the weighted and just proceeding, we believe that within this proceeding it is not necessary to go to the auction of the assets because based on the cash-flows or generation of cash-flows of Asarco flows a possibility of enhancing the maintenance of that cash-flow during the future. It would be possible to obtain the reorganization plan which faces everyone in full so there its no need to go to the auction process. So as part of the, even though we are planning to file a reorganization plan, we are also pursuing all our rights to keep the company and object to this auction proceeding. And we have developed a lot of resources on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Just in terms of Asarco, can you please remind us what the amount of reserves that you have on copper in that asset, that the company has in that asset? And also, give the nameplate capacities for production <mark type="inaudible" /> and concentrate, as well as this number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Oscar. Well, first of all, as you remember we don't have access to management's information. As you know Asarco's currently managed by an independent board of directors, so we haven't got access to that information yet, so I apologize to that and perhaps we'll, I'll directly to the public information available. There are some information in the data room that has being organized by Lehman Brothers for the asset sale though, but it is confidential at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, so, let me rephrase that then. Are you presumably in your process of evaluating the assets and the amount of money that it is worth, have you seen the data already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Our financial advisors have seen that data. Unfortunately, we have a confidentiality agreement, and I am not able to comment here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand that. Okay. So, we'll get to main phase capacity that's fine. Then, turning to the labor issues in Cananea, can you just clarify something for me please? Because the strike going on in Cananea right now is a little bit different than what you guys had in Caridad. Because you know that strike was clearly legal. And so, there was, I think there was a minimum amount of time or a maximum amount of time that the workers had to come to an agreement with you and the contract was resolved. This time it's a little bit different. So, the government has declared the strike legal. What is the process now as you're trying to follow to get to a conclusion with the strike in Cananea?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are right, Oscar. Let me just for a point, it is similar but not quite as same as Caridad, as you just pointed out. Yes, we were notified and we were served with a decision to declare the strike legal, as you just pointed out. Yesterday, we said we hadn't been, yesterday we were. However, having exhausted all the alternatives that we thought available to the company to resolve the situation. The board has decided to offer. I mean the severance, the business, it is very important to mention that this is an offer. It couldn't be or even like to accept or reject this offer. So basically, we are hoping that most of the employees and workers because this involves not only union lines but non-union lines as well. And accept the severance payments we are offering and then we could probably follow the same procedure as we did in Caridad. I don't know if that answers your question, or you want more technical legal answers here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, let's just keep it simple. That clarifies the answer. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from the line of Brody <mark type="inaudible" /> with HSBC. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Perhaps another rhetorical question, I guess the topic for today. Even in the case of Grupo would have to buy one of the assets in auction, the money directly or indirectly would flow to Asarco. I presume that that would put Asarco in a pretty much undisputable position to get out of bankruptcy? That's the first question. The second question, regarding the railroads, what's the average current date of the locomotives and what do you guys expect it to be within the next 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What don't we start Brody, how are you?  We start with the question of Asarco, that Alberto De La Parra will answer and then we can probably have the CEO of Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano that we have here to answer the questions on the railroad issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all Dave , just to clarify that there is no need for Grupo M&#xE9;xico to offer for the goods of the assets of what they actually to present a sponsored reorganization plan, which the purpose of that reorganization plan will be to take us out of the bankruptcy proceeding. They inhibit one full and resolved in old claims, so we have a clean Asarco for the future operations. No? That's very important because Grupo M&#xE9;xico is not going to offer any puts of assets, rather than sponsor a reorganization plan which is a validity committed by <mark type="inaudible" />. And that the sponsorship of a plan goes to with the rules of <mark type="inaudible" /> where some crates could be unpaired by restating them and some others would be bating for us provided by that. And of course, Grupo M&#xE9;xico will have to show this ability of the Asarco in the future in order for that plan to be approved, which we think we are ready to do it.</p>

          <p>Good morning. We received last year, 2007, we received 40 new locomotives, 4,400 horsepowers, and that brought our total to 584 locomotives, with an average age of 20 years. We are not planning to receive any more new locomotives in this year, as we have already received 160 new locomotives over 2006 and 2007. Does that answer your question?</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Just a few comments, few question on the railroad division, is there any guidance on revenues and EBITDA that we could expect from Ferromex and Ferrosur this year? Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I was just wondering if there was any guidance for revenues and EBITDA on Ferromex and Ferrosur for 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well the first -- the first quarter was -- we had an increase of 7.8, talking about Ferrosur in sales volume and we expect that level to pretty much continue over the next, especially over the second quarter. Second quarter is usually the highest quarter, and it's going to be positively affected as compared to a year ago by the Easter week. That last year fell in April and this year fell in March. That was very representative for Ferrosur, which was mostly affected by that case as their main segment, which is grain, was also negatively affected by the prices in maritime. That in turn was a positive effect for Ferromex as most of the grains are being now imported through the northern gateways. Does that answer the question?</p>

          <p>Yes it does. And in terms of operating margins or EBITDA for the year, is there any outlook on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have a very outlook, especially in the case of Ferromex because of the cost advantages that we are obtaining in diesel consumption and locomotive maintenance. As we are operating mostly with our newest locomotives, which are very, very efficient. This is the same phase in part for Ferrosur as Ferrosur purchased from Ferromex 15 new -- 15 locomotives from the newest ones. Those locomotives were only five years old and they are also providing benefits in cost, in diesel consumption especially.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should see stable margins going forward?</p>

          <p>We should be looking at stable margin going forward, yes.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Very basic question here, Cananea, is it shot and when do you actually expect it to come back on line? If so, can you give an idea of timeline for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you for the question. It is shot, it is shot down and we are thinking to block the entrances since April 11th, and the exact date as I commented, is not foreseeable at this moment. As I said, we've offered the severance payment, that this is a right of employees to accept it or reject it at this point. So this in fact was over offered but in the last year -- last week, I am sorry, so basically we have -- we cannot give you guidance on that, in that I am sorry I just won't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But until they actually, I get some different idea whether they'll accept the offer on that or not.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question is again about Cananea. Are you still in control of the facility and the second question is, if you can clarify the latest legal situation of the strike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Well first of all, I mean, I apologize Alfonso, apologize still cannot run as we.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all, that was a strike had been declared as illegal. So the only personnel we currently have is the security in the emergency matters, so that's what we have now in their facility. And when you refer to the legal situation, I am not sure with that you mean was of the strike has been declared legal or not though. But it has been declared legal and well and as any legal strike, it will follow the normal course of dimness in terms of legal situation. I don't know if you want specific answers regarding the more technical legal we have here as you know Alberto De La Parra with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah just to know if you can explain the implications and how you plan to deal, with all the different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sure. As you know I mean have the initial report. The union obtained in part of the document which actually instructed the labor authorities to declare the strike legal. So what the company has done I think, the merits of that strike after what where we saw some of the very beginnings, so we think that it is very unfortunate that this judgment. However, since a lot of time has passed and you should imagine the economics towards that the community has, we have offered to all those people that are not being able to go to work, these severance, and so its going to be their choice, each of them to go to the severance, which is going to be a very good money for them so they can chose a lets say other means of work, other alternatives, labor alternatives. Seems this time we are not able to foresee when the stoppage created by the union will elapse. So, the legal standpoint of these damages that the company the kind of adds on strike and each of the workers have the right to go the severance and look for other labor alternatives if so, which we think that that would be better for them. So we don't detriment their economic situations.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from the line of <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you for taking the question gentlemen and I apologize if some of these have been asked I mean a little bit in the hour of the conference call. But, I was wondering if you have any indication of how many groups are preparing bids for the Asarco assets that are up for sale and I guess, if you just maybe walk me through kind of in simple terms in terms of the flow of the proceeds of what happens, lets say, a group outside of Grupo M&#xE9;xico was to gain control of these assets. I would assume that that money is basically used purely for the reorganization to come out of bankruptcy and I wouldn't imagine that you have any kind of claim to it. But, if you could help me understand then, that'll be great?</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; Enrique Nava:&gt; Well, first of all, we don't have information of -- that's skipped by the investment bank of Asarco on many groups are interested on this process. We don't know that. Although we have been in conversation with some constitutions of the bank so we can develop a reorganization plan for the company. Second on well the idea to give Asarco all assurances needed in order for all claims to be paid in full or reinstated as I said before according to the law some of them could be reinstated and continued with the ongoing obligation as soon as -- as long as Grupo will ensure or demonstrate its ability of a company. And we think that based on achieving copper prices and some financial identities will be able to demonstrate that the company will be able to generate forms to pay any ongoing obligations of those which are &#x2013; might be reinstated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if another group wins the bidding process, I assume that Grupo M&#xE9;xico does not have claim to any other proceed right?</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; Enrique Nava:&gt; Well I mean if all the things go wrong and we are not able to achieve our goals either through the filing of a reorganization plan or some legal means, which we think we have a lot of remedies there because we are soldier of the company, it won't just go wrong and -- assets are paid in high amount, any remaining amount after paying the claims will have to go equity partner, which is Grupo Mexico.</p>
