        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our conference call on the third quarter results and thank you for joining us.  You are already familiar with the first chart of today's presentation which shows the market development in the triad markets and the consequences of the worldwide economic crisis on the demand for motor vehicles.  The actual numbers did not become much friendlier during the most recent quarter, and 2009 will mark a worst year in economic terms for decades.  While it seems that the low points has been reached, in the mean time in most of the industries and most markets.</p>
          <p>Many emerging markets are also doing better than the industrialized countries, above all China and Brazil, but there are also some countries still very much affected by the crisis, for example Russia and Eastern Europe, and it would be far too early to return to normal, although there are some early indicators for recovery from a very low level.</p>
          <p>How did our divisions perform in this difficult market environment?  We saw a sharp decline in the first quarter, but we also clearly noticed that our unit sales have stabilized during the course of the year.  After the seasonally weaker summer months of July and August, Mercedes Benz cars achieved its strongest month of the year in September.  Unit sales gained momentum from the launch of the new E-Class sedan and coupe, and the new E-Class station wagon will support this development.</p>
          <p>Unit sales of Daimler Trucks division have stabilized at a very low level in the third quarter.  First signs of recovery can be recognized in various markets, and the incoming orders for our products make us feel more confident.  Weak markets continue to affect Mercedes-Benz Vans business development as well. With 40,100 vehicles sold in the third quarter, sales were better than the average of the first two quarters of this year.  Especially in Western Europe, Mercedes-Benz Vans managed to stabilize its unit sales and to further strengthen its market position.  Daimler Buses sold 8,400 buses and chassis in Q3, 23% below the high level of the prior year period, and had a further slight increase compared to the second quarter of this year.  While the development of the city bus business continues to be stable, the coach markets remain difficult.</p>
          <p>The economic crisis and the weak vehicle demand are also reflected in the revenue of the third quarter. With &#x20AC;19.3 billion, revenue remained at the level of the prior quarter.  The development of EBIT also shows a gradual improvement over the three quarters of this year.  In Q3 the Daimler Group's EBIT is positive again amounting to &#x20AC;0.5 billion.  Excluding special reporting items, EBIT was &#x20AC;0.4 billion. I will go into detail in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Net profit of the Daimler Group also improved in the course of the year and reached &#x20AC;0.1 billion in the third quarter.  These figures prove that our crisis management has become effective and we are moving in the right direction in an environment where we had absolutely no tailwind from the markets.  We consider this development encouraging, but of course there is still some way to go. Both free cash flow and the net liquidity of our industrial business confirm the positive development.</p>
          <p>More details on these figures are illustrated on the next chart.</p>
          <p>Here you can see the development of our net industrial liquidity since year-end 2008.  Net industrial liquidity continuously rose from 3.1 billion to &#x20AC;6.7 billion at the end of September.  The free cash flow of the industrial business in the third quarter amounted to &#x20AC;2 billion.  The positive EBIT contributed to the further improvement of free cash flow.  Cash flow was also affected by an increase in liabilities due to the higher production volume after the production break in August as well as positive accounts management.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the industrial free cash flow in Q3 was positively impacted by tax related items.  In connection with certain non-automotive lease transactions, the group allocated tax benefits through the Financial Services business in the past years.  These tax benefits could not be finally realized.  Based on the settlement with the IRS, Financial Services has to repay these tax benefits to the industrial business of the group.  This leads to a net increase of industrial free cash flow by &#x20AC;0.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Due to higher payments to suppliers and the seasonal inventory increase at the end of the year, we expect from today's perspective a negative industrial free cash flow in the fourth quarter.  For full year 2008 &#x2013; '09, we anticipate the free cash flow to be positive.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a closer look at the development of our individual divisions.  In the year-over-year comparison, the third quarter EBIT of Mercedes-Benz cars rose from &#x20AC;112 million last year, when the crisis had just started, to &#x20AC;355 million this year.  It has to be considered, however, that last year's result included charges of &#x20AC;449 million from the reassessment of leased vehicles residual values.</p>
          <p>The picture gets more meaningful when we look at the quarterly EBIT development.  Then we can see in the deep dive also a strong improvement from Q1 to Q3 2009.  The drivers of this recovery are the consistent countermeasures on the cost and revenue side initiated during the first half of the year and an improved sales structure.  The measures designed to enhance efficiency and improve the cost position are increasingly showing effects, especially in the areas of production as well as sales and marketing.  In addition, reduced working time and labor cost positively impacted the operating result.</p>
          <p>And very important, the launch of the new E-Class has supplied fresh impetus.  Since March, the E-Class sedan has been launched step by step in the various markets and the E-Class coupe followed in May.  Together with the launch of the new generation S-Class, this had a favorable effect on our model mix, which is illustrated on the next chart.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter of 2009, 28% of Mercedes-Benz cars unit sales were E and S-Class vehicles compared to 17% in the first quarter, and the new E-Class station wagon will follow in November.  The new generation S-Class and especially the S400 HYBRID are very well accepted.  Approximately 20% of S-Class customers order the HYBRID version.</p>
          <p>And while talking about product mix, we should also look at the regional mix.  Our business in China is developing very positively.  China is already our most important S-Class market worldwide.</p>
          <p>At the International Motor Show in Frankfurt in September, we presented various product highlights.  One of these was the new E-Class station wagon for November 2009. It will complement the E-Class family of Mercedes-Benz.  The new E-Class station wagon marks the debut of a number of technical innovations which no other car in this category offers.  The number one attraction at the Frankfurt Motor Show was the new Mercedes-Benz SLS. By a wide margin the SLS was voted the most popular among 27 new product presentations.</p>
          <p>The reinterpretation of the legendary gull-wing model will celebrate its market launch in spring 2010.  A pioneering role is also taken on the B-Class F-CELL, the world's first fuel-cell automobile manufactured under series production conditions.  Production of the B-Class F-CELL has already commenced with a small lot.  The first batch of roughly 200 vehicles will be delivered to customers in Europe and in the United States next year.  Daimler Trucks suffered from the unprecedented market contraction which led to a substantial drop in sales and consequently reported EBIT of minus &#x20AC;127 million in the third quarter.  The huge market decline in the truck business occurred later than in the passenger car business but even stronger.  Business reflected in the earnings development; furthermore, earnings of the last four quarters have been impacted by the repositioning of business operations in Asia and NAFTA.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we booked charges of &#x20AC;13 million for the repositioning of Mitsubishi Fuso, and on the other hand Trucks NAFTA needs less provisions for the achievement of its repositioning target.  A very important fact is that the measures taken to reduce costs and the management of vehicles within our global excellence initiative substantially mitigated the earnings decline.  Our efforts to create highly flexible cost structures over recent years are clearly paying off positively. And it seems that the first signs of recovery can be recognized in the truck business. An obvious upward trend is illustrated if we look at the quarterly development of incoming orders on chart number 10, although the orders are far from being satisfying in the long-term. Especially in parts of Asia and Latin America, but also in the United States and some Western European countries, incoming orders moved upwards during the past month.  The rise in the United States is also partially due to slight pull forward effects regarding from the EPA 010 emission regulation due to become effective on January 1, 2010.</p>
          <p>In order to further strengthen Daimler Trucks' position in the big markets, we have set up projects to establish two joint ventures with Russia's biggest truck producer KamAZ in which we hold a 10% equity interest.  The goal of our joint venture is the import, production and distribution of Fuso trucks in Russia, and the other joint venture is aimed at producing Mercedes-Benz trucks, and distributing trucks and buses of the Mercedes-Benz and Setra brands in Russia.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2007, Daimler started a commercial vehicle initiative called "Shaping Future Transportation" which focused on both environmental aspects and safety.  In September we delivered the 10,000th Mercedes-Benz truck with active brake assistance.  Mercedes-Benz continues to be the only manufacturer offering this emergency braking system.  Daimler Trucks North America is participating in the Clean Cities program in the USA for the production and sale of more than 600 trucks equipped with hybrid and natural gas drive systems.  The program includes the Freightliner business class hybrid electric and natural gas vehicles as well as chassis manufactured by Freightliner Chassis Corporation for hybrid, electric, hydraulic electric and natural gas powered walk-in vans.  A key role on the road to the drive systems of tomorrow is played by hybrid technologies which appear capable of reducing diesel fuel consumption by up to one-third.  With more than 2200 Orion hybrid buses on the roads of North America, more than 500 Freightliner trucks and about 600 light trucks and Fuso buses, Daimler is the world's market leader either for hybrid systems in the commercial vehicle sector.</p>
          <p>The next chart shows the EBIT development of Mercedes-Benz.  Benz, over the past five quarters, in the Van business market volume decreased very sharply during the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result there was a pronounced earnings swing from Q4 2008 to Q1 2009. Counter measures taken to increase efficiency and reduce costs successfully mitigated the negative effects from the sales decrease.  While unit sales declined year-over-year by 45%, EBIT decreased from &#x20AC;212 million in Q3 to just above breakeven in the third quarter of this year.  And in this challenging business environment, Mercedes-Benz Vans was able to further strengthen its market position in the segment of mid-size and large vans in Europe.</p>
          <p>Year over year, our market share grew by 0.6 of a percentage point to 17% in the third quarter.  In line with our passenger cars, the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is now also available with BlueEFFICIENCY technology.  On the one hand, BlueEFFICIENCY stands for an efficiency package. This comprises the newly developed four-cylinder diesel engine and auxiliaries with on-demand control.  In addition, the new six-speed manual transmission designed specifically for vans reduces consumption and exhaust and noise emissions.</p>
          <p>Finally, the BlueEFFICIENCY package also includes the Eco start-stop function, which saves up to 8% of fuel in urban operation.  On the other hand, the BlueEFFICIENCY technology in the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is also available with a weaker drive system, fueled with natural gas. Sharply reduced exhaust gas and noise emissions, appreciably lower life cycle cost, and a large cruising range are some of its advantages.</p>
          <p>Daimler Buses recorded EBITDA of &#x20AC;23 million in the third quarter of 2009 after &#x20AC;92 million in the comparable period of last year.  This decrease was particularly caused by declining demand due to the global market recession and negative exchange rate effects.  The relatively good development in sales of city buses worldwide and the measures that we have initiated to enhance efficiency and reduce costs dampen the burden on EBIT.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of September, we delivered the 25,000th Mercedes-Benz Citaro bus.  This sales volume makes the Citaro the most successful city bus of all time.  Daimler Buses also participates in our Future Shaping Transportation initiative.  As a technology leader, Daimler Buses sets standards in comfort and safety, for example with safety systems like the Active Brake Assist or the Front Collision Guard.  A key role of the road to tomorrow's drive system is played by Hybrid Technologies.  We differentiate ourselves from the competition, for example, with the Mercedes-Benz Citaro FuelCELL-Hybrid bus presented in summer and more than 2,200 hybrid buses on the Orion brands already in use.</p>
          <p>For our Financial Services Division, the lower sales volume of our automotive divisions combined with a disciplined risk attitude result in a declining contract volume.  At the end of the third quarter of 2009, contract volume was &#x20AC;58.7 billion, which was 4.6 billion lower than at year-end 2008. Adjusted for exchange rate effects, the portfolio declined by 7% since December 31, 2008.  The new business of the Financial Services Division decreased in the third quarter by 22% to &#x20AC;6 billion.  Of course, lower contract volume reduces our funding needs.  We continue to review potential to further reduce the contract volume by selling non-automotive portfolio.</p>
          <p>EBIT of Daimler Financial Services amounted to &#x20AC;101 million, a decline of 42% compared to the third quarter of 2008.  The decrease was mainly due to higher cost of risk.  Moreover, burdens on earnings arose from cost of liquidity measures. But if you look at the chart you can see the upward trend also for our Financial Services business.  In the first quarter, we reacted on the weaker credit policy of our customers in light of the crisis, and increased our credit reserve significantly, which led to the substantially negative EBIT in that quarter.</p>
          <p>On the next chart, you can see an overview of the improvement of operating profitability for the Daimler Group and its divisions during the year.  Mercedes-Benz Cars returned to profitability in the third quarter.  Daimler Trucks and Mercedes-Benz Vans are still affected by very weak markets, but the low point seems to have been passed in Q2, and earnings showed an upward trend.  Daimler Buses maintained positive earnings throughout the crisis.  All measures that have been taken to increase efficiency and reduce costs showing increasingly positive effects.</p>
          <p>The most important goal at the beginning of 2009 was to manage the crisis and to stabilize the financial flexibility of the Daimler Group.  For this reason, Daimler launched a set of new short-term measures, for example, salary cuts, short time working, budget cuts, and many more.  Those initiatives were implemented in addition to the long-term divisional efficiency enhancement programs, such as Go for Ten at Mercedes-Benz Cars, Global Excellence at Daimler Trucks, Creating the Next at Mercedes-Benz Vans, Beyond Bus Plus at Daimler Buses, and Objective Number 1 at Daimler Financial Services.</p>
          <p>The targeted value of the 2009 countermeasures was &#x20AC;4 billion compared to 2008 numbers. By the end of Q3 2009, we had achieved 3.5 billion and for fiscal year 2009, we strive for more than &#x20AC;4 billion.  The successful and disciplined execution help the company to better manage the crisis and to safeguard our financial position.</p>
          <p>In respect of the short-term measures, the company expects to benefit in 2010 as well.  For example, the salary cuts, which will continue through mid 2010, should deliver the same benefits this year.</p>
          <p>It's very important to mention that all of the divisional efficiency enhancement programs are permanent and will be continued in 2010 and beyond.  That will help us to build on the improvements already achieved in 2009.</p>
          <p>Economic development in the third quarter confirmed hopes that the world economy has bottomed out and seems to recover again.  However, there remains some uncertainty especially in the industrialized countries because the upturn is still relying on temporary effects like fiscal stimulus and inventory cycles. Overall, global GDP in 2009 is likely to shrink by a good 2% as a result of the dramatic development in the first half of the year.  In this overall environment, most automotive markets remain difficult.</p>
          <p>Consequently, our sales assumptions are as follows:  Mercedes-Benz Cars expects to achieve sales above the Q3 level, due to the launch of the new E-Class station wagon and the full availability of the E-Class sedan.  In light of the market development, Daimler Trucks unit sales in the fourth quarter are expected to stay at the low level of the third quarter, and our regional mix will change.  The share of sales in Asia will increase whereas the proportion of European sales is expected to decline.  Mercedes-Benz Vans expects a slight improvement compared to the previous quarters of 2009, and Daimler Buses anticipates Q4 unit sales to increase versus the third quarter mainly due to higher deliveries in connection with major orders.</p>
          <p>Now last but not least, let me come to our EBIT expectations for the fourth quarter 2009. Mercedes-Benz Cars EBIT in Q4 is expected to show a moderate improvement compared to Q3 2009.   Results from ongoing business should benefit from higher unit sales and efficiency improvements. Our Daimler Trucks division anticipates lower earnings from ongoing business in Q4 than in Q3 due to weak demand in most important markets and a less favorable regional mix.</p>
          <p>The business repositioning at Daimler Trucks Asia and Trucks NAFTA will also result in charges in the fourth quarter. The countermeasures initiated will not fully compensate for these effects. Mercedes-Benz Vans is expected to achieve breakeven also in the last quarter of the year. For our Bus division, we anticipate a solid EBIT in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And Financial Services continues to face rising credit defaults and higher refinancing expenses. Nevertheless, the division expects to achieve a positive EBIT in Q4 again. Thanks to measures taken to cut costs and expenditures by more than &#x20AC;4 billion originally targeted, we anticipate positive EBIT from ongoing business also at the Group level.  However, as stated in previous quarters, we continue to monitor several risks which may impact the operating performance of our ongoing business. This includes potential expenses resulting from dealer and supplier support, and other negative impact from the discounting of provisions and additional expenses for the German Pension Protection Association.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, good afternoon, everybody; Arndt Ellinghorst Credit Suisse.  I will ask two questions one on Mercedes and one on Trucks.  So, on Mercedes, since sales to corporate customers are a very important part of Mercedes European business, could you give us an update on how you see this sales channel behaving at the moment?  And then on Trucks, there was an interesting message from Mr. Renschler recently where he stated that Trucks would be break-even at a 250,000 unit sales level, which is 50% below peak sales.  So, could you just talk a bit about the split between fixed and variable costs in that business and how this has changed over the last couple of years?.  Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Arndt, your question regarding MBC right; of course we have an objective to increase our corporate customer segment over the last two years because we have lost a little bit of momentum when we go back now three to four years.  Again we are having this as a target already,  but I do think, especially with our now E-Class, of course, we have a better possibility to increase this percentage on the one hand, and secondly we are with our CO2 measures better in place regarding our fuel efficiency measures, on the one hand, but also, for example, S 400 Hybrid that we do see also an advantage to increase here the market share over the upcoming quarters but also in 2010 on top of a possible slight recovery which would be clear. If market would recover of course in 2010, that should also have an impact on this segment anyway.</p>
          <p>Of course your second question regarding 250,000 units is a difficult one because Andreas is not here, so we might discuss this although I would like to inform of course all the markets about that I have not heard this statement of Andreas with the 250,000 units, so I am not aware of the statement, so I will talk to him and will get into touch with you when we're in London, and of course we're on road show the next couple of days next week, and if there is a clear answer to that question I'll of course I will give it to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So okay, yeah thanks a lot, Mr. Uebber . But on the corporate sales channel mix, do you generally see a different momentum in that sales channel versus your sales to private customers, or do you think that developing similarly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As of not yet, we don't see it yet, but as I said, from a segment point of view we don't see it yet. We feel that our position is better due to our products, products as what I have mentioned right now.  In 2010 there might be an EBIT impact also in the segment as such from the market point of view.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Next questions from Thierry Huon [Exane].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes good afternoon.  It's Thierry Huon speaking from Exane.  I have two questions one is about the, the tone of your release today, which seems to be a bit more cautions than the one we had last week when you released the preliminary figures.  Is there anything new in this release compared to what you said last week?  Because, honestly last week I thought that you were doing better than you thought and I'm not that sure today.  So if I could have some explanation, it would be helpful.  And the second question is about the Truck; when you say that you're expect lower EBIT in Q4 than in Q3 is this for the prior or after adjusting costs for restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thierry, your first question, I do think of course what we have given today additional information of course to the disclosure. The disclosure last week was only related to few numbers of EBIT, which of course were better than the market expected.  So, we had this on the radar screen of course in this regard. That was true for Mercedes-Benz Cars on the one hand, but also for Trucks, let's say, a less burden, so to say, in the third quarter.  So I can only confirm today that this what was released last week is today the same.</p>
          <p>Of course, we have given you additional information about some specifics, for example the German Protection, Pension Protection Association, the increased year, we have released the numbers which are included in the third quarter. You have again seen that we have impact in the third quarter from the interest side means the lower the interests are, the higher the discounted net present value of long term provisions are, and that impacts negatively, for example, also third quarter that was the same in the second and first quarter, so the amount of money we have disclosed to you as an impact here.  So I only can say it's the same what you have seen right now, I do thing most important was also, not only, but also the cash flow development which were better than we also internally expected with our disclosure now of we think for the fourth quarter that we're negative.</p>
          <p>So all in all, I do think it's the disclosure of what we have done last time and now of course we can add the outlook of course which I would not want to comment, if you have a special question to the outlook then please raise it.  The Q4 outlook for trucks is as we have said.  Regional mix will change definitely, we will see some lower sales in Europe.  We will see higher sales in Asia, and of course due to the profitability in these different markets, we will see a decrease in the ongoing operating profit in Q4 roughly as a special reporting item as we call it, so further measures for the restructuring programs, it's roughly between 80 and &#x20AC;100 million which we will see as an impact in the fourth quarter from both positioning programs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we take the next question from Jochen Gehrke [Deutsche Bank].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  I have two questions, if I may. The first question relates to the Group and your cost cutting and the second question would relate to Trucks.  Firstly, Mr. Uebber, when I look at your profit walk and your gross and your net cost impact, similar to what we've noted in the quarter before, there seems to be a very big gap between your gross cost cutting achievements in the third quarter and your net contribution, which on a sequential basis is actually down a little bit more than &#x20AC;200 million.  Could you explain me why that is and what explains this huge gap?  I understand that discounting of provisions is one thing, but your gross impact that you've disclosed is 3.5 billion by now, whereas your net cost savings impact is more like 750, what is really explaining the rest of that difference?  And secondly, on trucks, do you expect a major decline in the European market? Otherwise I have difficulties to follow your guidance on a clean operating profit because, obviously, this quarter like some others, you have book-to-bill ratios above one.  We should expect that fourth quarter on a global scale is seeing more volumes. Is Europe seeing price pressure or is the volume decline on a sequential basis more material than what I think?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe first, to your second question. First of all the order intakes you can see are not impacting the fourth quarter.  They are more impacting the year 2010 than the year 2009.  So, what we can see right now is clearly in order intake, of course, in our production plan of course for the third quarter, that we will see a decline in the European sales, and of course due to our different profitability we have in our different businesses, that has a higher impact on negatively spoken on our sales contribution than the positive impact we get through sales contribution from the Asian business.  And that leads to and should lead to and will lead to a profit decrease so to say in the Truck business.</p>
          <p>So, back to your second question, your first question, the 3.5 billion, first of all, let me say, if we would not have all the actions we have taken and which we have commented on that, whether that is short timing, salary cuts, postponing on investments which are not product related, further material cost measures, fixed cost measures, investment, IT programs and so on and so forth, but also measures on the revenue side, on the top-line.  If we would not have done it, our results for year-to-date would had been 3.5 billion lower than we can see right now, which means, what I want to say was that, that there are concrete measures behind it which we are tracking.</p>
          <p>Of course, now why can't you see it exactly in the profit walk? There are some other offsetting subjects which you have already mentioned.  These numbers from the interest rates level and the German Protection Association, Pension Association, gets up to a number which is more than 500 million.  So these numbers are not low on the one hand.  Secondly, some of the measures you will see also in the basket of revenue and mix, which are in the sales contribution area.  For example, when you change variable costs, these impacts are not on the cost side, but on the sales contribution side.  So, for example, when you look, when it comes to short timing, for example on the worker side, you have an impact there on the sales contribution side. And of course we should not leave out of mind that we have residual costs which are at the end of the day also negatively impacting, and last quarter at least some headwinds which we have not in the countermeasures. One example is a lower one; I do think one of you will ask me, what are the impacts on the supplier side and when you ask this question, I will tell you the number which is not included in the countermeasures, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So all in all it is the 3.5 billion right now, and we aim to overachieve our 4 billion target, which is, which we can confirm that we will over achieve this target. Of how much of course we will disclose to you in February with our actuals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So sorry just to reconcile this, I should not compare the 400 million to the 1.6 billion; I should rather look at the sequential step down in your volume structure net pricing in cars which is minus 160.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So sorry for that, but I do think in the crisis of course where we shooted for countermeasures, of course some of the disclosures, so to say, is also, so to say, not easy, but I do think at the end what counts that we as Daimler are now positive so that cars is positive, I do think that is the main results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we take the next question from Christian Breitsprecher [Oppenheim Research GmbH].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's Christian Breitsprecher. I have two questions one on the financial result, when you show a significant negative financial result and no real improvement there despite the fact that your liquidity position has improved again significantly, you have a industrial net liquidity position, but a significant negative financial result.  So could you explain a little bit what's going on there? And secondly, on the cost savings, you said that cost savings are also helping in 2010; could you give us a number what we will have as an incremental positive effect from these cost savings measures in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, for the first question, of course the interest income, there are two effects: one is from the pension side, because we have included in the EBIT the service cost and the interest cost is roughly 70 million from the way from the EBIT to the net profit.  The other one is the interest income which is then the remaining is 114 million, and this reflects right now the higher liquidity position in this regard, because of course you know that debt has a higher interest rate than you can &#x2013; where you can invest on the invest side of course the interest rates are very low, and of course we are let's say maybe too conservative, but of course we don't give one bank all the money.  So, to say, so we spread it of course over many banks, and of course we have it more short-term than long-term in this regard, because at the end we will reduce also the liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Therefore we have this effect in the, let's say, the outlook for 2010 will be that we will reduce the gross liquidity, and let's say in the second to third quarter, we will achieve our &#x2013; at the end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter, we will achieve our target profile again.  Of course that is not very difficult to achieve in this way, because we will be less on the bond side so to say, and therefore the gross liquidity will get down at the end of the day.  But as long as we have this position of course, we have a burden on the interest side.</p>
          <p>The cost savings questions of 2010, of course, we have said that we in the count, in the 4 billion basket, and of course, it will be somewhat more.  We have targeted also for one-time but for one-time savings, no doubt, everything what's accounted we took.  Therefore, the name of the game will be how do we substitute with our ongoing efficiency measures, these kind of one-time effects.  Of course, that is what we're looking into for 2010.  Our overall target of course, is that we can even further increase our measures compared to this year.  How much it will be?  Of course, we will, might tell you then in February next year, but we're currently under discussion of these kind of targets for 2010 and give me here some time to give you more information on that.  But clearly we need to shoot at the end of the day for more targets, well more efficiencies than we had at this year.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Next in line is Adam Jonas [Morgan Stanley].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, it's Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.  I have three quick questions please.  First on Russia, you mentioned that you saw early indicators of recovery.  I'd love it if you could mention what some of those indicators are because we're not seeing them.</p>
          <p>Second, profit from &#x2013; I wanted to ask a question on profit that you might have on improved residual values of off-lease vehicles, or maybe you could answer that from the scope of the 449 million charges you took last year related to residuals, how is that coming back into the profitability? For example, has Mercedes third quarter profit reflected some of that improvement in off-lease vehicles or has it been unaffected from that?  Has the profit been felt elsewhere?</p>
          <p>And finally because you opened the door to the question yourself, the thing that you mentioned about dealerships and supplier pressure on the fourth quarter earnings, how much order of magnitude impact should we expect that to be? I must say I'm a bit surprised to hear you say that because so far the information, the results from the dealers and suppliers have been pretty &#x2013; it has been pretty supportive.  So where is this coming from and what's the magnitude?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam, thank you for your question. First, maybe it was a misunderstanding, maybe I saw this wrongly.  But Russia has no signs of improvement right now.  So this is also what we can confirm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's what I thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't like it, but it is as it is, so there is no real improvement in Russia.  On the profit side we don't, we have no reversal of impairments of these assets.  That means of course what we have done, where at this point of time, I would only like to mention that you said we have to maybe to increase it.  But I do think or let's say the market developments confirm what we have done last year in the third quarter 2008.  So we used this kind of let's say impairment what we have.  But as I said, there is no reversal of impairment of these assets, so the profits are not impacted this stuff.</p>
          <p>Of course, the residual value development as such is in the U.S. again positive in the third quarter.  So we are far down from the peaks which we have seen four quarters ago.  And it seems to be that the expectation also for the fourth quarter is okay.  In this regard, UK also nothing, no bad news, so it's developing okay.  In Germany we have some pressure on the residual value side, but also not as big that we to speak it from an earnings point of view as a warning also.</p>
          <p>From the dealer and supplier side, which you mentioned on the supplier side, there is an increasing number of suppliers which are in problem, if I might say, so different phases, so to say. The impact which we had year to date of 60 million is not as big as we might have expected, but the subject as such has a huge impact on our internal capacity.  We have ongoing teams.  Of course you can imagine which we are coping with that subject on the one hand, and I cannot exclude that once in a while we get a bigger issue here on this side. And then of course the longer the crisis takes and the longer we don't have top line effects from the market point of view, the situation with the suppliers without that I can tell you how big the number would be, is increasingly an issue.</p>
          <p>On the dealer side, more or less the same.  We have not had real impact right now from the dealer side, so I cannot tell you any number because there is no number so to say, but we had some impact in different markets with insolvent dealers, which are not really a big issue.  I know we could work with that, but also there more and more dealers of course the longer the markets are as such as they are and in trucks we are down by 50% more or less worldwide in the truck market, you can imagine that also dealers are coping with that issue, and that could lead to possible impacts which I cannot really forecast, that is not possible. That's the situation there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for elaborating on that.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay next question we take from Adam Hull from WestLB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's Adam Hull from WestLB, three questions if I may.  Firstly on the R&amp;D, you're amortizing it at 169 lower than your capitalizing, so it's about a 0.9% benefit on the margin in Q3.  I don't know if you could comment a little bit because it seems to be not so much that capitalizing is high, but rather that amortizing level is very low.  You've got 6.5 billion on the intangible assets in the industrial business.  So just maybe little bit of a comment on that, will we continue to see that difference?</p>
          <p>And secondly CapEx, quite a low level in Q3, it was down 34%, 3.2% of revenues, 3.3 for nine months.  Just give us a little bit of an indication to what degree you think a sustainable level of CapEx for the group is, and when you think you'll start moving to that because obviously, revenues are pretty low at the moment.</p>
          <p>And then finally on Mercedes, I presume you've still got some pretty attractive FX hedging rates and that's I presume still helping Mercedes, particularly I guess on sterling.  Perhaps you could quantify some of that and maybe give us some indication whether you're still taking FX hedging over the next year or two, just still taking out fresh hedges on the dollar and sterling at these kind of rates?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam, your question regarding R&amp;D, of course there is some volatility quarter by quarter in these numbers, and that depends more or less at what point of time you start with capitalizing products, new products, engines, or whatever.  So all in all, you cannot really, let's say there's no indication from a quarter development towards a year development.  The only thing I can tell you is that we have roughly between 30 and 35% capitalization ratios.  As I said, it depends sometimes on what kind of products we had and that is more or less a stable number through the quarters.  And in trucks, we have a higher percentage in Q3 due to the restart with the SFTP, the future truck, for example which gets here into capitalization.  So it's based on product developments, on nothing else.</p>
          <p>The second question regarding CapEx, of course with CapEx development on the one hand, there's one part which is also related to products which we cannot really impact because we have this new product, and then we have to do tooling and then we will of course extend it.  On the other hand in the crisis right now, we try also to be very aware what we spend and what not. So today let's say what we are heading to here is of course lower than 2008. It might be higher in the fourth quarter on the one hand because we have postponed some spending on the one hand. And also for 2010, I don't see here right now if you might take this with you not very further room for decreasing. There's more let's say room for, so to say, investing into the product side for 2010.</p>
          <p>On the FX side, of course we don't comment to you on the numbers we have in one quarter. You've seen on our profit walk what the effect is regarding the third quarter and you know the year-to-date numbers, so to say.  For 2010, we are hedged by 60% for the U.S. dollar, for the British pound, and we are more than 60% on the Japanese yen.  But of course, the currency are of course, and something we not only look at when the dollar is 1.50, it's always a concern. But the 1.50 level of course is a concern, and will give us some thinking about how to offset this kind of stuff. It will impact certainly also the year 2010, and especially the pound of course has developed in the direction where we also have to take measures maybe on the pricing side in the UK and the land.  So of course it is something which we are watching very closely.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We take the next question from Daniel Schwarz, Commerzbank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, Daniel Schwarz.  I have one question again regarding the negative impact from dealers and suppliers in the fourth quarter.  Is that included in the segmental guidance for Mercedes or may that come on top of what you currently expect in the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And the second question would be whether you could comment on the coalition contract of the new German government, especially the plans regarding the company car taxes.  And the final, the third question would be the investment decision for the Rastatt plant of &#x20AC;600 million.  Does that imply very advanced negotiations with a corporation partner or would that be independent from your future strategy regarding small cars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, Daniel, to your first question, it depends on the magnitude of impact.  So if you would have a higher impact on the dealer and supplier side, of course it is extraordinary.  Then we would disclose it as extraordinary impact, and therefore it's not included in our guideline.  If it would be on a reasonable level than what we have seen in the third quarter, of course that is a number which is not over-exceeding our internal threshold of doing a public announcement with a special reporting item, which we would then normally do.</p>
          <p>On the coalition side in Germany, the company car, that of course is helping, everything helps.  So if we get here a leeway that we can use, the real price in the market for the company cars, which we are not allowed to do today, of course it would certainly have an impact which is difficult to forecast at the end of day. But as I said, every positive impact will help us also for the sales in 2010. And we hope that it will be then also get into the Minister of Finance that they will change this in this direction, as it is mentioned in the coalition program.</p>
          <p>The Rastatt investment by no means has no &#x2013; any relation and tied to a discussion of a corporation partner. It is fully standalone.</p>

          <p>Next question from Frank Biller.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, this is Frank Biller from LBBW.  Just two questions, one is related on the Mercedes side. Maybe you can give us an update on the incentives in Europe and how is it developing over the next month or over the last couple of months and also the future.</p>
          <p>And the other thing is on EBIT Mercedes; you talked about slightly better earnings line in Q4 versus Q3. Does that mean you're significantly above four percentage points in EBIT margin, or is it more on the range of Q3?  The other question is related to the Truck side. Revenues per unit sharply fell versus Q2. Maybe you can give us here an explanation why that dropped by more than &#x20AC;11,000 per unit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, and your question regarding incentives levels, we can only confirm that in the third quarter, we had lower incentive spending than we had in the first half year.  You know that we also have commented on that in the first half.  Of course we had the inventories, you know that.  And of course we also know that we have the new E-Class on board which goes together. So having gotten down the inventories to benchmark levels at the end of the second quarter and on top of the E-Class, of course introduction of a new product lead to lower incentive level, and this positive development I do think we will also see in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Your second question was regarding &#x2013; can you help me again?</p>

So the main subject is here that we have more light duty in Asia, and that means of course more light duty to come to then, for example, that leads to a lower revenue per unit in that quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even it might get worse a bit because we have less European business forecasted, as I said, than the entire Asian business.  So directionally it will get lower in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>There is only one question I have here left, and this is concerning your cost cuts. You mentioned on one hand that these cost cuts are definitely sustainable. And on the other hand, you said these salary cuts, these 30-hour working weeks for many of your employees in Germany runs until mid-2010, so what happened here? What do you expect here and isn't it unavoidable more or less that these employees have to turn back to their normal working schemes which means then a rise of personnel costs next year from mid-2010 onwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, you know our contract.  We have a timeframe until the middle of 2010, it's quite clear.  But when you look here on a let's say pure economic side, so to say, or in terms of countermeasures of course, we have seven months impact in 2009 and we have six months of impact in 2010, so I would regard this impact as even.  So if you compare now 2009 to 2010, you would have the same savings numbers but a different time-wise development, so, second half in the year more or less in 2009 and first half more or less in the year 2010.</p>
          <p>We have not finalized our total discussions how to cope of course with the long-term market demand which of course would mean then also our long-term capacity demand comparing the capacity would be then seen with the current capacity. Of course, we need to discuss, and we need to discuss with what kind of measures we will tackle this kind of gap, which are different in different areas. For example in the truck area where we have huge flexibility, of course you target this differently also in the aspect that you have maybe a three to five-year recovery in the market than in the passenger car business where you have lower flexibility.  We have a lower flexibility and we see maybe a recovery in two to three years timeframe. And of course in all our measures which we have especially in Germany regarding early retirement, voluntary severance programs, further short timing for example and other measures which we will discuss of course certainly for different areas differently. And that will lead then to a final also plan for the years 2010 and '11 as well.  So that discussion of course is not finalized yet, so we cannot comment on that further.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Aleksej Wunrau, BHF Bank in Frankfurt.  Just two follow-ups, first on your residual write downs, no I'm sorry, on these extra pension charges of 810 million in this year. Depending on the calculations you make, one could also arrive at a underfunding gap of roughly two billion.  So do we have to assume further charges in 2010, maybe in the dimension of further 1 billion roughly, and the second question is on the cost savings in this year, you exceeded the initial planning, but could you give us an idea of what amount of these transitory cost savings would reverse in 2010, and then we have the discontinuation of short time work schemes in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to your second question, the only thing what I would like to actually say that we target more savings in 2010 than in 2009, and I don't want to go further in this detailed discussions, because we have to finalize our discussions internally before we go to the markets and explain what we are doing for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Net of the reversion of the cost savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net of the reversion, of course. From a CFO point of view what should we do?  You know, I will not have a target so to say that we reduce our efforts, so we have even to further go in our efforts, because 2010 will be not an easy year.  It's quite clear the markets are not exploding in the fourth quarter; we cannot see this, and it will not come so, and therefore we have to prepare a very tough business in the year 2010.  And therefore the overall targets has to be that we are even doing better as a target for 2010. Whether we can achieve it, we will discuss internally and of course and when we have finalized our discussions, then we will also come to the markets with certain information which we will discuss at this point of time when we &#x2013; when we have this kind of discussion next year in February.  From the pension status point of view, of course the &#x2013; right now we are at &#x2013; I do think your question was related to the pension status?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is 4.9 billion.  At the end it depends a lot on the stock market developments. Now we can guess, I do think, but it's also a little bit speculation, but right now I do think the markets, we could see a setback in the stock markets.  We have a lot of liquidity in the markets.  It depends a little bit of how big a setback could be, would be.  In the long-term I do think I expect market's going up so, maybe look now at three to five years, and that yield is short-term regarding pension.  So, I would say, of course our gap will close at the end of the day over the time.  Now, it's difficult to say, how much it will be in 2010 or '11, that this little bit of speculation and that I don't want to make.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Ranjit Unnithan in JP Morgan.  I have two questions on trucks and one on cars.  On trucks, could you comment about pricing. I think you may have mentioned some remarks earlier, but how is pricing tracking in both the North American and the European market?  Second, what sort of order trends are you seeing in the fourth quarter? I guess we have one month down; are you seeing signs of similar sequential growth that you're seeing sort of from second or third quarter also sort of extending into the fourth quarter?  And the last question I have is on cars, in terms of the, I guess the mix of cars that you're selling, clearly you have a new model out there, can you comment on the transaction prices or rather the increase in transaction prices that you're seeing for the E-Class, and also generally in terms of consumers coming back to sort of your higher price cars, is that sort of been a noticeable trend? Has that sort of, is that improving in terms of product mix for the next couple of quarters?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly to your question about trucks, pricing is more or less stable.  So there's sometimes a little bit of up and down, but it's not worth, so to say, mentioning that pricing was stable in Q3 which is good.  Of course that means, okay that is a good situation, especially the question was raised always in Europe whether we can have this price discipline, which is right now quite okay.  Then you asked about the order intake trend fourth quarter, I do think what we can say is in the NAFTA, yes, there should be a further let's say trend which we have seen in Q3 with regard to order intake a little bit. As we also stated, EPA '10, based in Europe, I would not assume it.  There of course we will see what the market in 2010 is doing.  So, right now we also cannot confirm an increase in market in Europe in 2010.  There might be even maybe a decrease.  So, related to NAFTA, yes, the other areas we will see when we disclose it more or less.  Then your question regarding, the third question was...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Yeah, sorry, of course it's difficult to see from one month to the other to call it a trend.  I do think the only thing what we can say is right now that our new generation S-Class is doing well, and that the whole E-Class family is, with market shares of 40% in Europe and 60% in Germany, is doing quite well, and that should have a positive impact, but what we also see is that the segments are very far down.  So, we are talking about a lower level, but this, of course, this development, I do think will stay as it right now is minimum for the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on transaction price, is there anything you can offer there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Transaction prices, I've said in a question before that our let's say kind of incentive spending went down in the third quarter, and I mentioned here in the first half year we had the inventories, the high level of inventories, and of course now we have the positive impact of course of a new product family, as E-Class is.</p>
