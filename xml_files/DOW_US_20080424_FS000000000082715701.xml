        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Kathy and good morning everyone. I want to start today's comments on a high note, because I believe Dow has performed exceptionally well in the first quarter, given the challenges of a weaker U.S. economy and significant increases in raw material costs. In fact, if I could sum it up, I would say this quarter was about balance. We struck a good balance between taking fast and aggressive action on short-term business challenges and making progress toward our ultimate goal of transforming Dow into an earnings growth company.</p>
          <p>Now here you can see the highlights of the quarter. We delivered record quarterly sales with broad-based price gains and volume growth in emerging geographies. For example, we posted volume gains of 7% in China, 4% in Brazil, 11% in Argentina and 14% in Russia.</p>
          <p>Our stand out business for the quarter was clearly Dow AgroSciences, which set a quarterly record for both sales and EBIT. Sales increased 27% with an 11% jump in price and a 16% jump in volume.</p>
          <p>And once again, we posted strong and consistent equity earnings of $274 million. This was the fifth consecutive quarter in which equity earnings were above 250 million.</p>
          <p>Now all of this good performance has occurred despite the fact that our raw material costs rose 42% &#x2013; that's $2.2 billion year over year. This was the largest quarterly increase in the company's history, and nearly equal to the increase we experienced for all of 2007.</p>
          <p>As you can see on Slide 5, all of this led to earnings per share of $0.99 versus $1.00 per share in the same period last year &#x2013; I believe a remarkable achievement considering the challenges we faced during the quarter.</p>
          <p>These results are evidence of our strategy at work. Over the past several years, we have taken many deliberate steps to transform Dow to an earnings growth company, such as investing in our Performance businesses and growing our global footprint.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, our combined Performance businesses posted a volume gain of 6%, reflecting both organic growth and growth from acquisitions. From Polyurethanes to Epoxy Systems, to Dow Wolff Cellulosics, last year alone we announced 11 acquisitions, all of which are consistent with our strategy to preferentially invest in our Performance businesses.</p>
          <p>These bolt-ons have moved Dow further downstream where we are closer to the customer and the marketplace, and as a result we are better able to deliver total solutions that demand higher margins. And we are delivering value.</p>
          <p>For example, our Polyurethanes Systems Business has consistently delivered higher margins than we could achieve by selling the same products through our Components Business.</p>
          <p>And as I said, Dow AgroSciences posted incredible growth. Again, this did not come by chance, but because of the hard work we have done to take cost out and to grow through acquisitions and investments in new technologies and new products. Dow AgroSciences' results in first quarter speak for themselves.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about geographic strength, which was another important factor in our results for the quarter. Dow has two-thirds of its business outside of North America, with a significant presence in many emerging geographies where growth is robust. And our joint ventures have three quarters of their sales outside of the U.S. Now this combination of international business exposure provided Dow with protection against a weaker U.S. economy.</p>
          <p>Growing our Performance businesses and expanding our global footprint has been done with a view of the long-term. But we know we must also deliver solid results in the face of short-term challenges as well, such as rapidly increasing raw material costs and the current weakness in the U.S. economy, where housing and automotive continue to be a drag on results. As raw material costs increased to all-time highs, we moved quickly to raise prices across the company. Here, our expertise in price/volume management played a critical role, both in our Performance businesses as well as in our Basics segments.</p>
          <p>Our Basics portfolio performed very well. Basic Plastics posted robust price gains, in fact more than 30% in North America and more than 20% in Europe and Latin America.  Volume was only down slightly, 3% at a global level, which was partly due to capacity reductions in North America and Latin America in 2007, and to somewhat weaker industry demand. But the good news is we have not seen any significant decrease in demand outside of North America.</p>
          <p>In summary, I believe the first quarter was a very good quarter indeed, one in which the balanced execution of our strategy delivered strong results.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'd like to speak briefly about the performance of our joint ventures, whose results were an important factor in the success of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 6 should be a familiar slide, since we have shown it in the past. EQUATE and MEGlobal had a very strong quarter. At Dow Corning, a short-term spike in key raw material costs negatively impacted performance. However, we still expect Dow Corning to deliver robust growth in 2008 and excellent full-year results.</p>
          <p>In an effort to bring more clarity to the value these JVs generate, I would like to introduce some new data on our principal joint ventures that we will be providing each quarter. By the way, a list of our principal JVs is supplied in the appendix of today's presentation.</p>
          <p>We will now report on sales, EBIT and depreciation and amortization for our principal joint ventures each quarter as shown on Slide 7. Here you can also see Dow's proportionate share of these amounts.</p>
          <p>On Slide 8, we have calculated the equity earnings and EBITDA. Under the equity method of accounting for joint ventures, revenue, EBIT and depreciation and amortization for our joint ventures are not consolidated in Dow's income statement, just the bottom-line effect of these items is included as equity earnings. So, as a result, investors who use EBITDA as a measure may not fully appreciate the value of Dow's joint ventures. As you can see, Dow's proportionate share of the EBITDA of these joint ventures is significantly greater than their contribution to Dow's equity earnings.</p>
          <p>More information about these principal joint ventures is included in our recently updated joint venture White Paper available on our website.</p>
          <p>So, on that note, let me hand it over to Kathy, who will provide additional detail on the performance of each of our operating segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Geoffery. Starting with Slide 9, for the fourth consecutive quarter, Performance Plastics posted year-over-year gains in both price and volume. In Polyurethane Systems, the higher volume came both from the Hyperlast acquisition and from organic growth, as we continue to shift more of our components business into downstream higher value Systems.</p>
          <p>While volume for Dow Automotive and Dow Building Solutions was down, the decline was relatively modest as growth internationally mitigated lower volume in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The picture in Dow Epoxy was mixed. We've had a good start with our Epoxy Systems business, bolstered by three acquisitions late in 2007. We intend to pursue the same model with Epoxy that has been so successful in Polyurethanes &#x2013; moving downstream to higher value systems applications. Overall volume in Epoxy was down because of our exit from the peroxymerics business and because we decided not to chase business in Intermediates where margins are compressed because of added industry capacity. For the segment overall, margins were down because of higher raw material and supply chain costs, despite higher volume and aggressive action on price.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 10. Performance Chemicals had a good quarter, with strong volume and higher price. The year-over-year decline in EBIT was focused almost exclusively in Dow Latex, which was impacted by lower demand for acrylic latex used in architectural coatings. Margins were also squeezed in S/B latex used in paper coating and carpet applications, where the rise in raw material costs outpaced price increases. We saw good volume growth in S/B latex for coated paper in Europe, Latin America and in Asia Pacific, with the recent startup of our facility in China.</p>
          <p>Designed Polymers turned in a strong performance, with higher price, higher volume and higher EBIT. There are a number of high quality, high growth businesses in this portfolio, including Dow Water Solutions, Dow Wolff Cellulosics, and smaller businesses like ANGUS Chemical and Specialty Polymers, which contributed to top and bottom-line growth.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 highlights our star performer this quarter: Dow AgroSciences, which benefited from the strong industry conditions that you've read so much about, but these outstanding results didn't just happen. Dow AgroSciences has developed an excellent portfolio of crop protection chemicals, which stands them in good stead at a time when farmers are trying to maximize the yield of high value crops.</p>
          <p>We also saw higher price and volume in our seeds business in the quarter. Of course, the weather is always a factor in Ag results. There was a very early starts to Spring in Europe, and early season purchases of cereal herbicides boosted sales. It later turned quite cold, so we're not sure how the seasonal pattern in Europe will shake out this year. However, we are confident that Dow AgroSciences will continue to show very strong growth, year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Shifting to the Basics side on Slide 12, Basic Plastics results show our focus on price/volume management. In light of the extraordinary run-up in feedstock and energy costs, we pushed price up by 24% and were still unable to fully recover the cost increase.</p>
          <p>In polyethylene, volume was off slightly in North America and Europe, as customers turned somewhat cautious, buying only what they need. This lower demand in North America and Europe was partially offset by strong increases in Asia Pacific, as exports from North America continued to be advantaged vs. local production.</p>
          <p>Polypropylene volume was impacted by the shutdown of our plant at St. Charles Operations in Louisiana in December of last year, as well as planned and unplanned turnarounds at other Dow facilities on the Gulf Coast. Industry conditions for polypropylene were somewhat soft, reflecting ample supply and slower demand for durable goods such as carpet and appliances.</p>
          <p>In polystyrene, margins were compressed as higher prices were not enough to offset a significant rise in raw material costs.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year, Basic Chemicals &#x2013; Slide 13 &#x2013; reported sharply higher price and slightly lower volume. In Chlor-Vinyls, volume declined due to the combined impact of weak PVC industry conditions in North America and Dow's exit of the caustic soda business in Western Canada at the end of last year. Margins for caustic were significantly up from a year ago, but the impact of this improvement was masked by a sharp decline in margins on the vinyl side.</p>
          <p>As you know, chlorine has many high value uses in Dow, in polyurethanes, epoxies and agricultural chemicals, for example, all of which are reported in other operating segments. So Dow's Basic Chemicals segment doesn't reflect the full value of the ECU.</p>
          <p>Ethylene glycol reported strong year-over-year improvement, with most of the gain coming from higher results at our JVs including MEGlobal, EQUATE and OPTIMAL.</p>
          <p>One final data point, our operating rate for the quarter was 86%, down 1% from a year ago and from fourth quarter, principally because of a higher level of planned turnarounds.</p>
          <p>That wraps up the financial review of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the microphone back over to Geoffery for his update on strategy and outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Kathy. There were a number of notable achievements in the first quarter which support key elements of our strategy. These elements are growth, innovation, joint ventures, and last but not least financial discipline.</p>
          <p>Starting with growth on Slide 14, Dow AgroSciences announced it would further expand its plant biotechnology business with the acquisition of Triumph Seeds here in the U.S. Triumph markets sunflower, corn, and sorghum seeds across the U.S. and in approximately 25 countries.</p>
          <p>And moving on to Latin America, Dow announced a feasibility study to expand TDI production in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Dow is the number one producer of TDI in Latin America, and a new expansion would help retain our leading position, as well as fuel growth by meeting increasing demand for polyurethane products in this fast growing region.</p>
          <p>We also announced plans to break ground this year on a state-of-the-art membrane chlor-alkali production facility in Freeport, Texas.  This new, energy efficient facility will provide chlorine feedstocks which are critical to Dow's Performance businesses.</p>
          <p>Dow Water Solutions announced that its FILMTEC reverse osmosis membranes are being installed at three wastewater reclamation and reuse facilities in conjunction with the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.  And, PetroChina Petrochemical Company selected UNIPOL Polypropylene Process Technology for its new facility in China. The world-scale facility is the fourth polypropylene plant within the past 24 months to license this technology in China.</p>
          <p>Under the topic of Innovation, in the first quarter 32% of sales came from new products introduced in the past 5 years. This is consistent with our past performance in this area.</p>
          <p>Dow Building Solutions introduced STYROFOAM SIS Brand Structural Insulated Sheathing, the first ever three-in-one solution that combines structure, insulation and water-resistance in one convenient product.</p>
          <p>We also received final approvals for an innovative new polycarbonate product.  A leading optical media company, as well as two of the world's largest CD and DVD replicators, announced that a new Dow Polycarbonate product will now be specified for use in CDs and DVDs, and possibly high definition DVDs in the future.</p>
          <p>Innovation at Dow Automotive was also recognized in the quarter.  Automotive News magazine bestowed its highest honor, a 2008 PACE Award, to Dow Automotive for its IMPAXX energy absorbing foams, which help create safer vehicles without adding weight.</p>
          <p>Moving to joint ventures, I am happy to report discussions are going very well on our announced joint venture with Petrochemical Industries Company of Kuwait, and we remain on schedule to close by latest end of the year.</p>
          <p>Our joint venture with PIC is consistent with our strategy to grow our Basics businesses by creating new companies that can fuel their own growth. As an alliance between a world class chemical company and one of the world's leading oil producers, this new company will be well positioned to capture growth in key geographic regions, such as China, India and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>We also announced plans to build a new specialty elastomers train with our joint venture partner Siam Cement in Thailand. When completed, the new facility will supply customers in the fast growing Asia Pacific region with some of the most technologically advanced plastomers and elastomers in the world.  Now, this investment is consistent with our strategy to invest in fast growing regions such as Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>And, one last comment about joint ventures. EQUATE Petrochemical Company was honored with the first Corporate Social Responsibility award in Kuwait. The award recognizes several ambitious programs EQUATE has underway that serve its employees and society as a whole.</p>
          <p>So let's move on to one of my favorite subjects, Financial Discipline, here on slide 17.  Capital spending amounted to $359 million. We remain on plan to deliver CapEx at our full-year target of 2.2 billion, roughly equal to our level of depreciation.</p>
          <p>Now regarding share buybacks, we repurchased 10.8 million shares in the first quarter, the most shares we have purchased in one quarter in over 10 years. Since the first quarter of 2006, Dow has spent $2.5 billion buying back 61 million shares.  And, as part of our active portfolio management process, evaluation of our business mix continues.</p>
          <p>In February, we announced the formation of a new business portfolio, appropriately named Dow Portfolio Optimization.  The charter of this new business group is to evaluate and define a value-creating path forward for select Dow businesses. The goal is to find appropriate growth opportunity for these businesses or to divest them.</p>
          <p>Another example of active portfolio management in the quarter was the announced shutdown of rubber assets in Berre, France. This is consistent with our strategy to re-direct technical resources and investments to Performance businesses.</p>
          <p>Moving on to working capital; admittedly, here we have some work to do. While our days sales outstanding in accounts receivables is a very tight 38 days, our days sales of inventory has crept up to 67 days.  Reasons for this include an increase in export businesses from North America, which lengthens the supply chain; the deliberate building of inventory in anticipation of some second quarter turnarounds; and changes in product mix.  This said, we are committed to optimizing our inventory levels.</p>
          <p>And finally, on financial targets, return on capital was 14%, and return on equity was 19%, both solid numbers.</p>
          <p>So as we wrap-up today's prepared remarks, let's spend a few minutes on our outlook.  At a macroeconomic level, we're seeing softness in the U.S., and customers here are taking a more cautionary approach to their business.  As for Europe; Western Europe is slowing, but holding out well and Eastern Europe remains strong.  And the rest of world remains healthy.</p>
          <p>Turning to Dow, we expect second quarter to be another good quarter. We anticipate continued growth in regions outside of North America and robust growth in the emerging geographies, which constitute today 28% of our sales.</p>
          <p>With more than two-thirds of our exposure internationally, we are well positioned to capture growth in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, India and the Middle East.  We also see another strong quarter for Dow AgroSciences, plus continued growth from other Performance businesses.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we know raw material costs are going to be a key challenge, so we are keeping the pressure on price/volume management across our entire portfolio.</p>
          <p>In closing, I believe our strong global footprint, promising growth opportunities at both the geographic and business level, and continued focus on price and volume should deliver another solid quarter.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And at this time we would like to open it up for questions.</p>

          <p>Thanks Geoffery. That wraps up our prepared remarks. For your reference a copy of these remarks will be posted on Dow's website later today.</p>
          <p>Now we'll move on to our questions. Before we do so, I would like to remind you that my comments on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures applied to both our prepared remarks and to anything that may come up during the Q&amp;A. Clarence, would you please explain the Q&amp;A procedure.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you please update us with respect to your anticipated start up timing for your major projects I'm referring to the HPPO project and the EQUATE 2 project. And secondarily do you expect either of these projects to deliver meaningful earnings this year or is it next year that we will see more of the impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Gregg, its Andrew. On the HPPO project, it would be a set up in Antwerp, that project has had some delays. So we expect it to be back half of this year. In terms of start up on the EQUATE expansion, that will come up in phases, the third quarter will see the ethylene and EG, EOG plant come up and the polyethylene will come up in the early part of next year. So there will be some impact from that and the PO project later in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, outstanding. Would you also comment on your anticipated margins for HPPO just directionally? Would you think that your &#x2013; when the unit gets running, it's going to deliver margins in excess of what that are currently being seen by alternate technologies like POSM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly the announcement that both Dow and BSF made when we announced the building of that plant. We referenced to lower capital intensity, more energy efficiency and lower waste as three major improvements compared to POSM. We stick by those three statements, and that was in an energy world three years ago and the energy world of today that's even better. So obviously you have new asset, so you got of course, go through a high capitalization base. But we believe it's competitively advantaged versus POSM and I believe as a consequence of that, I speak for Dow, our strategy of &#x2013; Geoffery referred to in his remarks of value-add, by taking the PO to rigid polyols and along with the PU systems, this will add new margin to us over the medium &#x2013; short to medium term.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple of Ag questions. First, can you &#x2013; Andrew can you talk about your U.S. corn seed outlook both near term and longer term, specifically, just wondering what you &#x2013; when you think you can gain share this year, with your improved trade offering and another, Jerome Peribere set a pretty ambitious goal of becoming the number three U.S. corn seed company, say by 2012 or so. Do you think you are on track with that? And then the second question on Ag would be typically you do about 35% better in the first quarter, was this a real pull forward given some of those unusual weather conditions in Europe, or do you think this kind of strength is sustainable into the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first &#x2013; hi good morning Don. On the first the market share is pretty much as is right now. The real accelerator for us as I indicated and Jerome indicated late last year with the SmartStax announcement will really occur a couple of years down from now. So the fact that we're holding steady against as you know formidable competition in the corn sector is a strong statement of Dow AgroSciences' current position but doesn't speak to share gain to answer you specifically and really as we look at sequential quarters here we'll see the same pattern as last year's Q1 to Q2, we expect the same to repeat this year. Still a very good quarter for Ag but at the same time to the extent there has been a little bit of pull-through, Kathy referenced the seasonality factor in Europe which started early but it went cold so we expect the same pattern.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Andrew as we approach the conclusion of the PIC JV is your thought process still saying that if there are no large acquisitions visible you would deploy the cash to share buybacks more aggressively?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sure. Good morning, David. I mean clearly &#x2013; as we go through the year I repeated to many of you and so has Geoffery that our disciplines intact on the M&amp;A front. We had several years of strict discipline, financial and strategic criteria. We're going to go through the year and frankly the share buyback option as the Kuwait deal looms to close becomes to more probable. We've always said we're going to preserve that optionality in case one of the targets we've been interested in that as much for a month but for years. These targets become more realizable-we'll look at them but I think the probability weights heavily the share buyback to your question. As the year goes by. What you'll see from us is patience and prudence and discipline and as the Kuwait deal as Geoffery mentioned in his remarks is closer and closer through the hard due diligence phase to close the chances of share buyback increase quite dramatically.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David. Geoff here. I think we've been pretty consistent with how we've been executing this program and we've been averaging about $400 million worth at 10-11 million shares and we also indicated to you early last year that we'd probably complete the program by mid this year and we're on target.</p>

          <p>I couldn't follow your comments on epoxies and urethanes as well as I might have. Performance plastics had EBIT down about 25% in the quarter year over year. Is that the order of magnitude that epoxies and urethanes was down on an EBIT basis or was there &#x2013; were there EBITs better or worse than that 25%?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just are they more than 25 or less than 25?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that those two were probably &#x2013; let's see I'm looking at these things here. Not too different, probably a little bit less than 25.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because you have housing you'll have the housing business, which would be down certainly on a percentage basis more than that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just chime in, Jeffrey, they are difference because exactly where Kathy just ended up but they exposed to different things. Epoxy is much, much more exposed positively to electrical laminates the growth in Asia is so they saw what I would call mix issues out there and slowdowns that occurred which will catch up. So we are not worried about that at all.  Their coatings exposure is not as housing-related as polyurethanes because they're in industrial coatings and the oil and gas business and all the stuff they serve in coatings is still very robust. So it's disproportionate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Jeff, let me make a few comments on that. First of all we don't expect any change in the financial terms and the discussions in fact the discussions are taking place as we speak. There have been no showstoppers. The site visits have been completed and we are very confident that we will close the transaction still this year.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If we look at the Ag chemical part of the business and we stripped out new product launches can you give us a sense of what prices in margins are doing on the existing business? Trying to get a sense of what relative pricing power is like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, the new product launches I would say are a relatively small part of the total. They represent a fairly small percentage of the total revenue. So the margins stuff that you're seeing for the total segment is principally indicative of what existing businesses are like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and average prices are they up low single digits, mid single-digits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No the, prices are up &#x2013; in Ag we have the &#x2013; what was reported that externally like 16 -16% in Ag prices.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's mostly again &#x2013; chemicals is most of our portfolio. So you are going to see that in. But they were up in a similar manner actually both in chemicals and in seeds.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then just as a follow-up. With respect Dow Corning you said that it was a short-term spike in raw materials, I just wondering did the nature of the volatility give you any different view of the normalized contribution of that JV or its ability to help you, in a cyclical trough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No Mark, in fact this was an unusual kind of a spike and some raw material costs that occurred late January through February in fact the prices have come down and so in fact overall we don't expect it to negatively impact the performance that was planned for Dow Corning for 2008 and we expect continued growth in the earnings that we have experienced and seen coming out of Dow Corning over the last couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I just want to make one comment Mark, I apologize I was looking at the volume column.  The price in Ag is 11% but it is similar in both chemicals and in seeds.</p>

Ethylene glycol maybe in the <mark type="inaudible" /> what is your outlook for the chances for the EQUATE 3.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Sergey the comments you have been hearing and staying in the public domain speak to the north field and I think that's what you are referring to, yes it is wet gas and I think there is many companies who are, you know from oil and gas point of view looking at partnering with Kuwait petroleum clearly our incumbency with PIC, KPC, EQUATE 1, EQUATE 2 and <mark type="inaudible" /> and now, the opportunity that the north fields will present us to &#x2013; is one of the, you know basic reasons why this partnership make enormous sense. I mean, we clearly as a new joint venture as we launch our company here, the one we will close this year it will look overseas for investments in the Chinas and Indias but for sure we will look home, and the home being Kuwait.  So we think that's a great likelihood of a new project out there in the future, we will make any public statement until our partnership cements that, but no question availability looks increasingly likely.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going well as we promised and as we've talked about since we announced our Kuwait deal, one of the things that we said is that every joint venture stands alone and the interfaces between joint ventures is something that, we are pretty good at and so we have been working very hard making sure as we get closer to the close of the Kuwait deal, that very critical project is Saudi Aramco, Ras Tanura project is as critical to Dow as any project we have out there. In fact, probably a defining project in terms of the building blocks for our performance businesses as well as some basics businesses is going very well. We'll get to the next stage of that year this year this year. Everything is on track, the partnership is great. We are in regular dialogue, as Geoffery said, with Kuwait at a team level. We have equal amount of resources pointed at the Saudi project. And we are very, very confident that, that will proceed as currently planned.</p>

        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, P.J.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Several questions. First, on the financial side, your unallocated expenses were about 132 million, which was quite low compared to any of the quarters last year. And I know hedging gains go in here, was there anything particular in there, any hedges or any items that you benefited from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, P.J. let me quickly address that and you're correct. We're a little bit out of the range. If you recall, I think in the past what we've said was that, well, first of all, we regularly see quite a bit of movement in that category and what we've set for planning purposes, you should use a level of 150 to 200 million per quarter, which I think is a reasonable estimate.</p>
          <p>It just so happens that last year we were above that range because we had some unique items, we had $40 million that I think was franchised tax accruals and a special performance-based employee bonus that brought it up a level of I think 250 something million, 257 million. This quarter, we had lower accruals for performance-based compensation and for our employee stock purchase plan, because, of course, a lower level of the stock price, and we also had some benefit coming from an excellent performance from our insurance operation, as well as some hedging gains as you pointed out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Were the hedging gains significant or -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, nothing out of the ordinary. It's all part of the hedging, some of our operational exposures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one question for Andrew, I know everyone wants to know what are you going to buy, but is there anything that you want to divest particularly in specialties and maybe that's the goal of your portfolio optimization group. Because as you pointed out in the past, some of the specialty products are getting commoditized, and rather than waiting for them to be a complete commodity, why wouldn't you sell them or put them in the Kuwaiti joint venture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, I mean P.J., as always you are very good at putting the answer to the question you've posed in your question which is great and I mean all of you who are following us know exactly what you just articulated. One, we have a business portfolio optimization group for a reason and you've pointed out the reason in your question, which is the commoditization of certain businesses and assets and whatever you categorize them at, including the performance businesses, and that speaks to obviously what we've done in the last several years, which is 92 factories shut down, 42 sites exited, and 38 businesses sold. You can continue &#x2013; you can expect us to continue to prune from the bottom as these new feedstock, hydrocarbon commodity realities become obviously alive.</p>
          <p>And secondly, the solution that you spoke to, yes, we've got to get our joint venture formed. We will. But once our joint venture forms that creates an interesting and future possibility &#x2013; home for some of these pseudo-commodities. And we don't dismiss that, nor do we dismiss it in the Saudi Aramco opportunity, by the way. So you can expect Dow, that's a life strategy, to keep coming to life in terms of how we become number one in the world in terms of competitiveness given these new input costs.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>Good morning. Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm hearing from my Kuwaiti source that in fact that you guys may be expanding the scope of this Kuwait venture in your negotiations, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Peter . As I just indicated in the answer to P.J.'s question, the opportunities to do more are clearly top of mind for both of us. We really do have job one, which is to close the deal as announced, as intact, as promised in our early announcements, both of us are very committed to doing that. The due diligence is working perfectly.</p>
          <p>But I think your notion of doing more and as indicated in P.J.'s question, will be top of mind and there's some good logical fix that can occur and frankly creating this powerhouse of a joint-venture, this unbelievable opportunity to marry a feedstock-rich company, state-owned feedstock-rich company that has global expansion in its sights with a petrochemical franchise like ours gives us more scope opportunities. But frankly, Peter trying to keep this all orderly and manage them in scope, let's close the deal then we'll go to Phase 2. Clearly, that's our top of mind thought here. But no, I don't dismiss your hypothesis or even the statement you made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm a bit puzzled by your statement in the guidance for the second quarter, you're saying that &#x2013; this with a background that your fourth quarter earnings were down, your first quarter was a little lower and yet you're saying you expect another &#x2013; the second quarter to be another good quarter. Does Dow have a new standard for earnings now and the ambition is to have just a small decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, these comments are in the context of the environment that we're working. I mean when you face increased hydrocarbon energy costs in one quarter, equal higher cost &#x2013; equal to the entire &#x2013; close to equal to the entire year, prior year and then ending up with these type of results with an economy that is highly cautionary here in United States, in that context, I think we have done extremely well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Peter, if I can add, everyone on the call I'm sure is very conscious about strategic drive here. Our strategic drive we've said in over many quarters now is to create an earnings ridge, not a decline to a trough. And we made statements, I made it on the last earnings call that we would earn north of $3 at the next trough.</p>
          <p>I'm the last to keep wanting to see a decline on a year-on-year or sequential, but given these headwinds, Geoffery just referenced, given our strategic moves paying off already through the portfolio moves we've made inclusive of our joint ventures, we have arrested the decline and despite these headwinds, we still have got very good cash flows and earnings power here, and frankly, it's because of our strategy working and we've committed ourselves to changing our earnings profile, that's our strategy. The day that will arrive when that profile is transformed, we will start talking about year-on-year earnings inclines, and quarter inclines which is what this management team is driven to do.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Scott Burk with Bear Stearns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just one final question about how the cost increases are going sequentially, significant cost increases year-over-year but what does that look like sequentially fourth quarter to first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sequentially, that's about $500 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of the price increases that you pushed through in January and February, is there going to be a benefit going into the second quarter that if you've had some of the cost increases slow down sounded like in, say March, you're going to have a benefit that may help boost second quarter numbers and how does that look going out to the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly, I think there is no question that we had a phenomenal cost push based price increase environment in the first quarter and to the extent there is some carry over on some of the bigger products like polyethylene. There has been customer push back as you might expect. There is a slowdown in the U.S. We've been very upfront about that and no question we are seeing that volume slowdown having an effect on price increase environments in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>What we're saying is that internationally we're better off because of our mix and because of the robustness of the demand cycles out in the Chinas, Indias, the Russias etcetera. In addition, everyone is seeing the oil price &#x2013; all of our competitors have naphtha &#x2013; and naphtha crossing 900 bucks a ton out in Asia it means many of the crackers out there don't even cover cash cost. So there is a price moment even on the most basic of products in our competitive base and I know the Middle East producers, including ourselves, have an advantage but so far whether it be EOEG or polyethylene fundamentally they follow the price increases. So, I would say there is some carry over. It's not as strong in the U.S. clearly but international helps. So that's basically what you saw in the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

In that business, do you have some sense as to how much of that business is durable versus nondurable type applications?  That's my first question. And then, secondly I'm interested in what is Dow's position globally in terms of pounds or whatever way you want to basically describe it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will tackle the last question first. On polycarbonate, which as I think you know is destined for our new joint venture with the Kuwaitis. So that will go in there. One of the reasons we've done that is that frankly the position Dow has globally is we are number five in the world. Building ourselves to the top one or two from the position we are in, we just didn't feel that was something we could do on our own and that we needed some feed-stock backed integration which we can get with the new partnership, as you know key raw materials there relate to Aromatics and that's very key in our new Kuwait partnership.</p>
          <p>In terms of our position though, we do have two excellent joint ventures, one in Japan, and one in Korea respectively with Sumitomo and LG. Both of those joint ventures are actually the star of the shop. Both of them perform very well and most of their end use markets is what the Asian market's all about which is optical media which speaks to your question.</p>
          <p>And so if you take those two joint ventures which you don't see consolidated in our top line because they are joint ventures. And if you add our share of those joint ventures in our total polycarbonate business, you actually see a much more balance between optical media and durables and if you take the pure Dow business which is U.S. and Europe it's much more centered around durables, much higher percent. And so, out of &#x2013; I'm getting at your question Mike, but that's basically the balance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But your position in let's say, packaging-type application or bottles and things like that would be extremely small part of the overall portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, very small. If you are relating to the question on baby bottles and all that, we've made a deliberate decision to not be in that business and it slips to 1% in packaging as a whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Banc of America Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thanks, good morning. Geoff, I appreciate the additional disclosure on joint ventures. If I wanted to take the EBITDA numbers outlined in slide seven and use those to compute an adjusted EBIT to EBITDA ratio for Dow, I was wondering if you can help me out with the numerator as well. Do you have a sense of what Dow's proportionate share of the financial leverage would be for the joint ventures and the aggregate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I was thinking of Kevin, I don't know if you looked at the JV white paper that we had earlier. I mean to get an idea of the leverage of joint ventures, we do have at least for the principal joint ventures, what their total debt is and total equity. I haven't done the calculations. But that is in the JV white paper. Is that what you are looking for to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would take a look at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry, that just has it annually and we won't be able to get that for you quarterly. But you can at least look and see what the leverage of these principal joint ventures is. And as we've said a few times, the principal joint ventures make up the vast majority of our financial exposure in joint ventures. So, you can use this number and then leverage it for the total picture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kevin, just a rule of thumb &#x2013; most of these joint ventures have a pretty similar kind of financial policy to our own. And as you know, our practice has been debt-to-total cap of roughly 40% give-and-take 5% up and down. So I think that would be probably a pretty fair kind of an assessment across most of the joint ventures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful, thanks. And then Andrew, would you provide us with an update on your Styrenics joint venture with Chevron and then general efforts to improve profitability of that chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, we expect the &#x2013; I think Kevin; we expect the new joint-venture American Styrenics to begin operations very shortly, probably next month. We are &#x2013; obviously once that joint-venture launches and we'll look at its envelope and begin to expect the synergies of two parents are very much wanting to get. The first, of course, is on the downstream which is polystyrene, which is mostly our contributions and the second is the upstream, which is styrene. And I think the new joint-venture management or the new joint-venture Board will be intensely focused on making that the number one business in the Americas. I would tell you the focus from the two shareholders remains pretty intense and putting that company together for improving profitability and making that business a growth business again was the reason we formed it. So, no specific announcements, but you can expect that joint venture to get right at your question as it launches.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with BB&amp;T Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and Andrew, congratulations on evening up the series last night.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Frank. I remember the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Your commentary regarding PIC, the JV is very helpful. But in terms of what you're going to do with the cash and I'm curious does that &#x2013; does the timing of that announcement &#x2013; is it predicated on actually the closing of the transaction, might you make an announcement before the transaction closes?  If you can give any color on what your thought process is there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the color I provided, I think it maybe was even the first question asked today, is around our continual focus on discipline on M&amp;A. I mean in essence, I think we've said many times including on these calls that the hurdle that has to be overcome with any M&amp;A is share buyback and we understand accretion is instant on share buyback and takes time on an acquisition. But we've also said, the type of properties we're looking at are basically for growth. And yeah, cost synergies play a role in making affordability work but we want to grow, and we are putting in place a new earnings profile.</p>
          <p>So focusing in on the business and markets that we've talked about, our market facing units and our performance businesses many of which we've referenced on this call means that we are looking at clean buys or as close to clean buys we can get. And frankly, Frank, the value proposition has to be right as a consequence of that the discipline has to stay intact. So therefore, we say no or we reject books more than we kind of go to the next step. And at any one time, we're looking at many things, but any one time, it's not likely that something will drop and as based on history, as you can see, we've done 11 smaller acquisitions as Geoffery mentioned in his remarks. The probability is that they will stay small until the right opportunity presents itself as bigger.</p>
          <p>Meantime, then the deadline if you want to use that term on the close of our Kuwait deal increases the probability that share buyback will become a reality and we are fine with that. I mean we are preserving optionality and we are doing share buyback. It's a big "and" and that's how we're managing the company and that's how we're managing the precious cash our shareholders give us the right to manage. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can, yeah. I mean just one last one as you know that our $2 billion program if we stick to the recent trends will expire by middle of this year as we buyback more of our shares and complete the program. You can assume and we've been stating that all along in the last couple of years that we will have buyback programs in place to at a minimum cover dilution and of course subject to Board approval. We will regularly be in the market buying back our stock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. I think I've received the message there. And then I know, Kathy, during the discussion of the trends you mentioned that the second quarter would feature some turnarounds. Can you talk about proportionality between turnaround impact 1Q and 2Q, and along the same lines, licensing fees; proportionally was 1Q an unusually high period in terms of licensing fees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, let me do the turnarounds first, in high order of magnitude, we're probably going to have around $50 million more of turnarounds in the second quarter roughly than the first quarter and that's more of an increase. That's about the same kind of increase versus last year, same ballpark. And as far as licensing, I can't possibly predict licensing, that really does bounce around. But no, first quarter was not unusually large. It wasn't a whole lot higher than it has been other quarters. Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So clearly commendable that despite this $2.2 billion run up in feedstock costs, you guys essentially reported flat year-on-year EPS. I guess my question is that how much of an offset to those high raw-material prices did currency provide? Now I fully understand that you don't quantify sort of Forex benefit and the like, but if you could just generally speak about earnings benefit or reduction going forward from currency translation and export opportunities if the dollar does indeed start spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Hassan, let me address that question on currency. I mean we do have a very, very strong international presence that, of course, does translate into the benefits of a weaker U.S. dollar. But keep in mind, our international footprint is very much with a local presence; in other words, we have very large fixed assets. In fact, if you take the euro is really the largest component in the currency side. And in Europe 30% of our company's fixed assets and employees are located in Europe. So, of course, we have a fairly sizeable offset on the cost side.</p>
          <p>I can tell you that on the pricing side less than one third of the price increase is attributed to the stronger euro or the weaker U.S. dollar and then of course don't forget that in the last quarter or two there's been a very strong correlation between the commodity prices i.e. oil and U.S. dollar. Historically the correlation may have been considerably lower, maybe 10%. But certainly over most recent times there's been a flight from the dollar to commodities &#x2013; the metals and oil. And so I would expect that, if there were a major correction in the currency market that you would see a similar kind of correction on the commodity side which would of course also benefit us, so.</p>

          <p>Thank you. That question from Bill Young with Chunspeak.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I was kind of surprised given the big increase in polyethylene prices over the last 12 months that your equity earnings in Basic Plastics were higher than they were given the relatively stable raw-material costs and EQUATE. I realize you mentioned there were some offsets in ecopolymer and Siam Polyethylene but maybe you could add little flavor to the situation for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually answered the question. We did have offsets coming out of Siam Cement and EQUATE that's pretty it I mean ...a</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>EQUATE was up year-over-year Bill , as you would expect because prices are higher. As you said and Geoffery was saying it was Siam Polyethylene and ecopolymers that were bringing it down. EQUATE was up which is what you would think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'm just getting too much answer to the size of EQUATE relative to others. And secondly how long do you think the pain will last in the ethylene over capacity cycle over the next whatever number of years realizing that you still expect to earn $3 at the trough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so pain and pains always relative right Bill ? We clearly have said quite a few times and I believe CMI and others agreeing with this that we are going to see capacity at the back-end of this year that will cause oversupply but you know frankly the uranium stuff is still sputtering and it's not all going to come on seamlessly and to the extent that '09 will have some little more capacity than, '10 will have a lot more than clearly '11. I think you got yourself a jagged ride down to an ethylene trough. But remember we have announced our Kuwait deal. We've have announced all of our low-cost investments. We've got Peter Butler's questions about or someone's question about the EQUATE expansion not just the one we're talking about but the one we are talking about maybe in the future. So we have got mitigants that gives us confidence that our proportionate share of that decline can still on a pro-forma basis reach the target we talked about, $3 at the trough.</p>
