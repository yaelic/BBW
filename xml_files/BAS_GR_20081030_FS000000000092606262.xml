      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our conference call. The news and information that we are presenting today reflects a distinct change in our business environment. I mean you're seeing the affected sales, the impact of the global financial crisis is speeding up and hitting harder on the real economy.</p>
          <p>The economic skid marks can no longer be ignored. The decline in demand in important markets, stock piling by our customers and the fall in oil prices and other raw materials are signs of a recessionary trend that is likely to sharpen in 2009.</p>
          <p>Our cautious forecasts since the beginning of the year have unfortunately proved to be truer than we expected ourselves. The strength of our broad balance portfolio, our conservative financing and our team of highly committed employees worldwide becomes apparent in this difficult situation.</p>
          <p>We ended the third quarter with solid results. All operating divisions have increased their prices in some areas significantly. We increased volumes in almost all segments. Overall, sales rose by 13% to almost &#x20AC;16 billion. Adjusted for currency effect, sales grew by 18%. The earnings of our operating business also rose by 7%, despite further increases in raw material costs &#x2013; dramatically increased raw material costs, declining demand from important customer industries and the hurricanes on the US Gulf Coast which alone reduced the earnings by more than $100 million.</p>
          <p>EBIT, income from operations before special items of BASF Group, declined by 8% in particular due to significantly lower earnings in other. Here, significant expenses from hedging NAFTA purchases against increasing prices were incurred as a result of the fall in oil prices.</p>
          <p>Worldwide we are responding to declining demand by adjusting capacity utilization rates. And one example is the reduction of production from our keppela account plants worldwide as a result of weak demand from the automotive and textile industry.</p>
          <p>Our focus is on further improving our strong operating cash flow. We are concentrating on improving efficiency and sustainability, and this also involved the continuation of our conservative financing policy. At the same time, we are using the opportunities that present themselves in this challenging economic environment and continuing our strategy of value adding growth.</p>
          <p>Our sound balance sheet enables us to make attractive acquisitions now. Examples include our plans to acquire the Swiss chemical company Ciba and the Norwegian oil and gas company Revus Energy. We have come a significant step closer with regard to Ciba. Although, the preliminary acceptance rate published in the legally required interim announcement was below the necessary 66.67% threshold. The rate increased to more than 67% though in the course of yesterday and is thus above the minimum threshold.</p>
          <p>We will publish the definitive interim result next Monday. We are confident that we will then be able to proceed with the acquisition process and plot the transaction in the first quarter of 2009 and then start swiftly with the integration.</p>
          <p>We also confident that the shareholders of Revus Energy will accept our offer. With its high quality development and exploration portfolio, Revus strongly improved Wintershall's access base in the North Sea, especially in oil. And on the other hand, we are stabilizing Wintershall's portfolio with oil reserves that lie in a politically and economically stable environment.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look at the outlook before turning to the details of Q3. How are things likely to develop? The months ahead are likely to bring many extraordinary challenges of our business and hardly any positive impulses. We have therefore revised our assumptions and are now reckoning with global economic growth in 2008 of below 2.7% and chemical production growth of below 2%. We expect an average oil price of $105 per barrel in 2008 and an average US dollar exchange rate of $1.45 per euro.</p>
          <p>In addition to volatile raw material costs, we see risks in a further economic downswing. In view of these underlying conditions and based on the assumption that there will be no further adverse developments that cannot be foreseen at present, we have revised our outlook for the year 2008. BASF expects to increase sales in 2008 and we'll make every effort to match the previous years excellent EBIT before special items.</p>
          <p>Now as usual, I wanted to give you more details on the segments and the regions, I don't want to do this now. You have all this in very much detail in the interim report. And I would now like to pass the floor to Kurt Bock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks very much Ms. Hambrecht and good morning from our side. As already mentioned that sales were 13% higher than the third quarter of 2007 at &#x20AC;15.7 billion. Our operating divisions increased their sale prices compared for the same period of 2007. In total, higher sales prices contributed 17% to sales growth.</p>
          <p>We report the currency effect and the price effect separately. The currency effect was minus 5% because the euro was significantly stronger at $1.51 per euro compared to 1.37 per euro in the third quarter of 2007. This effect applied to all segments. The downswing of the economy was increasingly noticeable from September onward.</p>
          <p>Overall, we were still able to increase volumes by 1% in spite of the negative effects due to the hurricanes of Gustav and Ike in the US. Now EBIT of third quarter, EBIT appears that group was &#x20AC;1.5 billion or &#x20AC;180 million less than in the same period of the previous year.</p>
          <p>This decline was due in part to the hurricanes on the US Gulf Coast, which caused some plants to shut down for several weeks. These shutdowns reduced earnings by more than $100 million or &#x20AC;70 million.</p>
          <p>The earnings of our segment were higher than in the third quarter of 2007. Other, however, posted a loss mainly as a result of expenses related to hedging of raw materials, purchasing and currencies. Third quarter EBIT contains special charges of just under &#x20AC;60 million related to expenses for restructuring measures.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter of 2007 earnings included special income from the sale of our interest in a cracker in Geismar, Louisiana in the US. As a result of the improvement in the financial result, income before taxes and minority interest declined by only 7% to approximately &#x20AC;1.5 billion. At almost 46%, the tax rate was around 25 percentage points above the figure for the third quarter of the previous year. This was due to the higher level of income taxes for oil production that are non-compensable with German corporate income tax.</p>
          <p>Assessment of &#x20AC;31 million in the third quarter of 2008 these taxes were &#x20AC;202 million higher than in the same period of the previous year. In addition, the third quarter of 2007 contained non-recurring, non-cash income of &#x20AC;186 million, as a result of the German corporate tax reform.</p>
          <p>Net income declined by 38% to just under &#x20AC;760 million due to the significant increase in the tax rate. Earnings per share fell by 34% compared with the third quarter of last year. Without the one time tax effect in the third quarter of 2007, the decline would have been 26%.</p>
          <p>Now the cash flow. In the first nine months of 2008 cash provided by operating activities was approximately &#x20AC;3.6 billion. Earnings were at roughly the same level as in the previous year. Overall however, cash provided by operating activities decreased due to an increase in capital tied-up in inventories in particular as a result of higher raw material prices.</p>
          <p>Since September, we therefore have cut back production in some divisions and we'll tailor capacity utilization more closely to demand as well as bring forward scheduled shutdowns or maintenance. At &#x20AC;1.6 billion payments related to property acquired and equipment and intangible assets were slightly lower than in the first nine months of 2007 and were again significantly below the level of depreciation and amortization.</p>
          <p>As a result, free cash flow in the first nine months was almost &#x20AC;2 billion. The first nine months of 2008, we bought back shares for almost &#x20AC;1.6 billion. Almost &#x20AC;500 million of this month was spend on third quarter and thus as part of the &#x20AC;3 billion buyback program announced in June. All of the shares will repurchase our accounts on BASF.SE's. Share capital is reduced accordingly.</p>
          <p>We also bought back some shares in October. Our main focus at the moment, however, is on the financing side. We have concluded a bridging loan to finance the acquisition of Ciba. At the same time, we increased the maximum possible emission volume under our commercial paper program from $7.5 billion to $12.5 billion in October. The amount taken out is considerably lower and demand for the program is strong and continues to offer attractive interest rates.</p>
          <p>Assuming that sufficient shareholders accept our offer, we will also finance the acquisition of the Norwegian oil and gas Company Revus Energy, which we announced on Monday via the commercial paper program.</p>
          <p>In view of the current uncertainties in the commodities and finance markets, we plan to suspend our share buyback program. But we remain fundamentally committed to our goal of buying back shares for &#x20AC;3 billion by mid 2010.</p>
          <p>Now the balance sheet. Compared with the end of 2007, the balance sheet total rose by &#x20AC;2.7 billion to &#x20AC;49.5. While long-term assets declined slightly, short-term assets rose by almost 3 billion. The equity ratio was 40% as of September 30. Net debt amounted to approximately &#x20AC;11.2 billion, 60% of our financial indebtedness is long-term, that is what maturities of more than one year and the other majorities also stretched out until the year 2016.</p>
          <p>Let me close by taking a look at our share performance. It is not encouraging, even if the reference indices are also weak and we have developed parallel to the global chemical index. Towards the end of the quarter especially, stock markets declined substantially as a result of the financial crisis and the weaker economic outlook. BASF stock has been unable to avoid this downward trend and which is continuing in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Back to J&#xFC;rgen Hambrecht now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, ladies and gentleman, BASF is a benchmark for the entire chemical industry in terms of operational excellence and effectiveness. Thanks to our efficiency programs of the past five years in Europe and the United States. We have reduced costs by a total of &#x20AC;1.4 billion per year. We are now implementing the experience gained in a global program. But we are not satisfied with this.</p>
          <p>In addition to our on going activities to reduce costs, we have been defining our new excellence program, NEXT, since the beginning of the year before launching it in October. It's bent for a new dimension of value creation at BASF. Our aim is to reach the next level of operational excellence in conjunction with increased innovation and an enhanced corporate culture.</p>
          <p>NEXT involves all regions, all divisions, and all functions at BASF and it encompasses more than 500 individual projects. These range from the simplification of processes and increased bundling of resources through to the use of new IT technologies. One example of process optimization is the optimization of global planning and procurement processes, the project called Accelerator Project launched in April 2008.</p>
          <p>For this end, we optimize the whole process from customer order to shipment. International teams have examined processes and identified potential for improvement across all regions and divisions. That is expected to increase earnings by at least &#x20AC;175 million by October of 2011.</p>
          <p>We are counting on NEXT to established excellence in all areas of our day-to-day business. And we want to become even more flexible, faster and more decisive so that we can uphold our position as global market leader in the chemical industry. BASF expects NEXT to contribute more than &#x20AC;1 billion to earnings per year as of 2012 and the major part of it as early as 2009 to 2010.</p>
          <p>Implementation of the program which is associated with one-time costs of &#x20AC;300 million and investment of &#x20AC;700 million, we will reduce positions by more than 1,000 worldwide between 2008 and 2012.</p>
          <p>At the moment, ladies and gentlemen, nobody can tell how long the global economy will struggle with the fallout from the financial crises or how long the current state of weakness will last.</p>
          <p>In view of the extraordinary uncertainties, a firm forecast is not possible at present. But, one thing I think is for sure, in the past years the German economy has prepared itself for rougher times and this applies particularly to BASF.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, what we can all do without are additional burdens that will weaken our position in the global competition. I am, therefore, extremely worried about the EU's current plans regarding emission trading.</p>
          <p>If implemented, they would result in higher additional costs even for companies like BASF that use the best possible technologies. The best possible technology is globally in terms of climate protection. I would like to see an end to the systematic attempts to de-industrialized Europe.</p>
          <p>We therefore call on politicians to ensure predominantly free allocation of emission rights, instead of unilaterally worsening the competitive conditions of energy intensive sectors of manufacturing, such as the chemical industry.</p>
          <p>All of BASF stakeholders can count on the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that BASF employees will bring their full strength to bear to ensure that BASF maintains its position as the world's leading chemical company. In doing so, we will actively use the difficult economic environment as an opportunity just as we've always done.</p>
          <p>And now, we will be pleased to answer your questions as best possible. Thank you very much, Dr. Hambrecht, Dr. Bock.</p>
          <p>Now you have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Chorus call assistant. We will now open the Q&amp;A session. You now have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now the first question is from the German channel. It's from Michel Road, FAZ. Hello, Mr. Roads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have four questions. Number one, the job reduction you are down, Mr. Hambrecht, how will that be done? Will there be terminations of contracts and which countries will be involved, Germany, United States, Asia or the whole group? Question number two, the share price went down, like so many others. Do you feel that BASF will be taken over? And a third question, the dividend is supposed to remain stable at bad times too. Will that hold true? Two questions about the public figures in Asia, the results declined. I always thought it was a growth region, and growth related to profits too. So what happened there? And maybe Mr. Bock can explain to me the following: the second quarter there was earnings from hedging benefits from raw materials prices. Why were there losses in the third quarter due to the hedging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mr. Road. As to your questions about job reductions, I told you this is a global program that involved all regions and functions of BASF and because of this, a sub-division or breaking down to individual countries is not possible. With some parts of this program, we are in the defining phases of this program so we can't tell you anything about the individual years. But we want to get this improvement worth &#x20AC;1 billion. How will we go about this? When it comes to job reductions until 2012, we'll go about doing this like in the past. Probably natural staff turnover will take care of that. That's our expectation today.</p>
          <p>As far as the share price is concerned, are we scared of other companies taking us over? Well with this share price the danger has increased, that's the way the cookie crumbles. Whether somebody is now willing to pay so much money for a company given the current conditions, I don't think so, not very likely. But I'm looking ahead. Once things stabilize a bit and financial markets stabilize then I believe that there may be some desires, not just with regard to BASF but also with regard to others. And we'll try and prove that we are the very best and that's the only thing that helps you.</p>
          <p>Now as to the dividend, my statement is very clear. We'll keep the dividend constant and we'll try to raise it. We always said that, but at least we will keep it constant.</p>
          <p>As far as Asia is concerned. Yes, the results declined. This had to do with the fact that in the third quarter we were suffering from the impact of the declining business cycle in automotive and in construction, and the Olympic Games in China had a longer lasting impact. And there's much speculation now in Asia about the inventory pipelines, they are run empty because raw materials prices have gone down extremely. And it's always like this. In Asia speculation starts on the raw materials side at the very beginning and we felt the impact of that. Now in Asia we have a profitable growth. Just look at the contribution margin from Asia. That's stable in Asia and it goes to show how well we develop.</p>
          <p>Now Kurt Bock about the profits and losses from hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mr. Road, you're right. In the first semester and the quarter, the same quarter, we had a huge earning from hedging raw material supplies that we hedged against the volatility of oil and naphtha prices. In the third quarter, unfortunately this didn't go as well because the oil price declined more quickly than we expected, beyond what we had foreseen. So because of this, in the third quarter there was a loss. The market evaluation, this topic on balance, for the total year we had a slight loss in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Does this answer your questions, Mr. Road ? Okay. Now the NEXT program is not mainly a program for the <mark type="inaudible" />, so we wouldn't be able to get this billion if we just had to reduce 1,000 jobs.</p>
          <p>Next question is on the German channel. It's Siegfried Hoffman, Handelsblad</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Mr. Hoffman. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question about the hedging. I would like to know whether you will continue with this hedging of your naphtha supplies and what is the development you expect? And as to your forecast for the total year, it sounds like you do not believe that you will reach the previous year's result. Now which areas do you think will be weak in the fourth quarter? Which ones will fare better than the previous year? Maybe you could shed light on that? And the third question, your share buyback, which will be suspended now, what would be the conditions for you to resume buying back your shares? And right now that the share price is so low, maybe it's too low for you? Wouldn't it make sense to buy back shares right now? Are there any considerations? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mr. Hoffman, I'll answer the last two questions and Kurt Bock will come back to the first question concerning hedging. Now the forecast for the total year, well, you have interpreted this in the correct way. That's right, we'll have to make a major effort and we don't have enough visibility of the fourth quarter really. It's a problem. The situation seems to be panicky in some areas and this may lead to quick and unforeseen responses or reactions. But when you look at our portfolio, especially in this kind of situation, our portfolio is much more balanced than it was in the past. There are some areas which were run very well, I don't have to tell you that. The area of agricultural products, for instance, and cosmetics, nutrition, food, those areas will fare well. There are other areas which are less impacted, like polyurethane systems, which run quite reasonably, and our performance products worldwide.</p>
          <p>Now the areas that will are less well are all the areas having to do with the automotive industry. I mean you can read up on this in the papers. We hear this in the news every day. The automotive industry is hurting right now because there is strongly declining demand for cars. And sooner or later this will have an impact on us along the value added chain, there some areas having to do with the automotive industry, like in plastics or paints, parts of catalysts; some catalysts sell very well, other catalysts are hurting.</p>
          <p>The same goes for the construction industry in North American and parts of Europe. The construction industry is impacted very negatively. When we look at the sum total of the regions, then Latin America or South America runs very well. Asia is more stable than people suppose right now, than it looks like, given the speculations. And Asia is fairly stable. And in the current phase it helps to kind of compensate for lower growth in the US and Europe.</p>
          <p>As far as share buybacks are concerned, yes we'll suspend them until there's a stabilization in the financial markets. What we've seen during the last few days, now there has been a reaction on the part of Deutsche First. That was incredible speculation and it's not over yet. For as long as that continues we will not do anything. But internally we have set priorities. In view of our strong balance sheet, this is the time to take strategic steps to further improve the BASF portfolio. And before this background we are saying that, yes, we support share buybacks but we'll suspend it until there is a stabilization and then we'll check out how we can better position ourselves in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Hoffmann you asked about the program, whether that will be continued? Yes. It will be continued and we are talking about hedging risks, hedging volatilities and these risks increased in the last two months to a great extent than we had thought. This is why we had this effect. To give you information, we do raw materials -- hedging happened in raw materials, hedging for many years very successfully, so it's nothing new. Did this answer your question Mr. Hoffmann?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question, you talk about optimizing your portfolio, does this mean that you will have more broadly based acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry the sound was not very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, no, I understood him. I understood  Mr. Hoffmann. He asked whether we want to do more acquisitions. Well, Mr. Hoffmann apart from the big there are small acquisitions as well and we will take a very close look at what the market has to offer. I mean why should we refraining from doing so. On the contrary it's a favorable situation. We will use it. On the basis of what was our really conservative financing policy is possible and rest assured regarding financing we will do one thing, We will maintain our forward flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you don't see any problems there at the moment when it comes to financing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well when it comes to financing of course we have limits. Kurt Bock can comment on that. But let me repeat for sure we have the task to make sure that BASF in the long-term is positioned in the way that we are the chemical company and we will continue to do so. Let me add to this, I mean credit and bond markets are in an extremely difficult situation. Our CP program is running very well. We have spreads and BASF is regarded as an extremely good address here. And of course we have good financing positions and Ciba is supposed to be a backup financing for the CP program as well. We don't see any problems here. But of course the situation is extraordinary right now. And over the last decades we have not seen a situation like this. So I think it makes sense to be cautious. Okay  Mr. Hoffmann?</p>

          <p>Next question from the German channel by Ludwig San Platobrif, Frankfurt.</p>
          <p>Good morning, Mr. San</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>. Four questions, first of all Styrenics. In the interview this morning Dr. Hambrecht was not very clear what the future will bring. So are you negotiating at the moment? Is selling this possible in the present climate because of raw material fluctuations and other fluctuations? And other question regarding Asia, at the moment the situation is good but for how long will Asians be able to continue with this speed, if the situation gets worse in 2009? We hear first report from China of closures of export oriented companies, a considerable number of companies. So did this affect the China business production there? Did you cut production following the Olympic Games there? And next question when will the reduced oil price have an effect on the oil and gas division? Can you give us figures for Q4 and Q1 of 2009? And next question, do you have to expect major extraordinary depreciation for Q4 because of the bad situation especially when we look at the automotive business in the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will answer the first two questions and then Hans-Ulrich Engel will comment on the gas, oil price and Kurt Bock will comment on the extraordinary depreciation. First of all Styrenics, Mr. San &#x2013; I would not not clear this morning. I just said in view of the current market situation, we will intensely take a look at further activities and this includes all the options and I also said that our restructuring measures, which are required in this segment, will be tackled consistently and will be implemented.</p>
          <p>Regarding Asia, will Asia be able to keep up the speed of growth. Well, the speed will slow down a little bit. We can see this in Q3. In China, where we had growth of 9% and looking at the year, at the overall year, it's slightly above 10%. So China will continue to grow because it is mainly driven by internal demand, 30% of GDP and export are only 16% of GDP. Of course, lower growth rates but still high growth rates, so I am convinced that Asia is a stabilizing sector. The closures you mentioned are basically taking place in the textile industry in the South of China and the toy industry, yes, we noticed that in some parts and we are not only reacting in Europe and the USA by adjusting capacities. We also react in Asia and in China itself with capacity adjustments if we see a weak demand in the market. And we will continue to do so in future. And with this I pass on to Hans-Ulrich Engel with the gas, oil price link.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. San you ask about the effect of the oil price in Q4, of course, the oil price will have an effect in Q4. When we look at oil as such the effect will be a negative one, but we have a compensating effect for gas. As you know we suffered from the time lag effect in Q3 in gas trading. In Q4, we will see a relief of the situation with our purchasing prices but with the time lag we passed on the relatively high purchasing prices we had in Q1and Q2 to the so-called lag and lead effect. And, in case of gas this will be a positive effect for Q4, which normally is a quarter where we sell a lot.</p>
          <p>Regarding impairment Q4, you are right Mr. San, of course, we will take a very close look at our figures, from today's point of view nothing extraordinary will result from this compared to the previous years. And impairment normally are done when you have structural problems. At the moment, we are talking about the economic difficulties, and so this will not change from our point of view. Does this answer your question Mr. San?</p>

          <p>Good morning, Mr. Estuffie.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Mr. Hambrecht, I'd like to hear your opinion about the development of the share market of recent days? The extreme development in share price as with Volkswagen. What impression, do you have here? And I have a question regarding the plant in Ludwigshafen, can you tell us what direction the effect of the financial crisis and the new cost cutting program will have? What is the average capacity utilization of the production facilities? And how did this change in recent weeks? And my last question, regarding shutdowns of plants similar to the winter of 2001-2002. Do you plan this as well this year? 60 plants were shut down for three weeks. Do you plan the same thing this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Estuffie, my opinion on share market. Well, I have to tell you what happened there is speculation. The German DAX index because of speculation of only one share was out of balance this is why the stock market reacted now. And I must say that I think this reaction came way too late and I think it's not optimal. And maybe this damaged the reputation of Germany as a financial market. And of course it affects our share. No doubt about this, not only our share, but all other shares. With regard to only one other share and this goes in both directions upwards and downwards.</p>
          <p>Of course, people are speculating a great deal now. And not everything is related to facts. I don't think that the stock market development are only caused by the real events here, now your second question our plant in Ludwigshafen. What effects will the financial crisis have? Of course we won't have any direct effect, but effect of the consequences of the financial crises. So what is hitting real economy at the moment. It's in Germany on the whole 100,000 cars less will be produced in the months to come. We have to expect, Mr. Estuffie, that it will have effects on us as well. This is why our <mark type="inaudible" /> capacities all over the world, and this includes the <mark type="inaudible" /> facility in Ludwigshafen and in Antwerp as well and in the United States, will be reduced and the capacity utilization rate is 65% now in Ludwigshafen. There are a few plants where we have to reduce capacity utilization because we have to make sure that our current assets will remain in a stable position and of course in an environment where you don't have any clear prospects, this is quite difficult. Because along the value added chain, you have things that happened at the very front and then with the time lag, it arise at the end of the chain. We try to tackle this in a proactive manner. What does it mean when we look into the future, changes, yes, depending on how business develop, we will make adjustments in addition to what we've done so far, we will be force to do so. Shutdowns, as we had them in the past, well I cannot tell today. But I think rather not because we have many different businesses. Now, let me address one business which is running extraordinarily well. The business with Care Chemicals with high growth rates and high level of profitability. We have other businesses in the 2000 which are running extremely well. All our systems, I mean, we are producing in the area of Crop Protection for the season now and we won't be able to shutdown a plant here. But so, I can say, yes, in individual segments the capacity will be adjusted a general shutdown, though I think, and I stress I think, this will not happen.</p>
          <p>Did this answer your questions, Mr. Estuffie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Mr. Estuffie. Currently we are above this figure. And we'll have to wait and see how the economy develops.

And I think this answers, does it all this reflects the way we are dealing with each other <mark type="inaudible" />. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the next question, the next question on the German channel is from Ms. Rood Vainka, Manahma Morgan Hello, Ms. Vainka.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to Ludwigshafen. I have three questions. Now the cost reduction program and next the extent of the financial crisis, did that create a need for readjustments, because next is not only -- was not initiated due to the financial crisis only and to Dr. Hambrecht, I would like to know whether you see any decline in turnover of sales for BASF in the field of automotive for expecting the fourth quarter because everybody is talking about the automotive crisis. So to what extent will it impact BASF? Question number three, how about price increases that you have been able to push through? Now how about the fourth quarter do you think you will be able to maintain your price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ms. Vainka, about the last question, I mean, this -- well, price increases in an environment where raw material prices are going down. Well, that's a difficult one to pull off. You can only increase prices in an environment where you can create an additional benefit for the customers and sometimes you can do that because the customer may save costs, because of the solution you are offering the customer. Other than that I believe in this environment it's extremely difficult to increase prices. You have to see that both with cracker products and with inorganic products, like ammonia, within three weeks we had a price decline of almost 50%. And under such conditions it's extremely difficult even along the value-added chain of BASF to implement price increases unless we offer an additional benefit. Sorry, on the changes in turnover with regard to the automotive industry, I cannot tell because we don't do such surveys. But I can tell you clearly, yes, we are noticing the effect. We are noticing this in the field of plastics, in paints, catalysts and coatings, when it comes to automotive catalysts, but not chemical catalysts, they sale very well. And now we need to earn little more through selling catalysts for chemical reactions. And if there are shutdowns due to maintenance then of course they need good catalysts and try to implement them. So there is a negative effect. We're noticing that there is a decline in the automotive industry and you are reporting about these issues yourselves. It's not just the question what goes on in the US? This development has reached Europe too and Japan. There a dramatic decline in China too, the automotive industry is not growing fast enough anymore to compensate so that effect. The only thing that keeps developing well is South America, with regard to automotive. Another cost reduction program, you are right, Next was not initiated due to the financial crisis. At the beginning of this year, nobody was talking about this development. At the beginning of this year we initiated Next because we realized that there was major potential to be sorted out, processes. SIB systems are great. But once you random for a longer time was everything included than you'll find that you can take steps to simplify things without loosing your customer focus, the effort is true, you could focus even more on the customer and you can react faster and in a more defensive way that the focus of the this and this was not triggered by the financial crises because, we always have to keep learning how we can improve things and get costs down. This is an ongoing process. Okay. Ms. Vainka.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now as far as Next is concerned, the underlying question was, do you need to readjust?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It's not a readjustment of the old projects. These were just very simple cost savings program. What we are doing now, is something completely new and this is a new standard for the chemical industry. We are redefining the processes. We will simply file them in a financial way. This is not readjustment of the old project but this is the launch of a completely new cost savings program. Maybe it's wrong to say cost reduction or cost saving this is an improvement of our processes. And next thing new excellence target. So, we are setting ourselves completely new targets. So this is a completely new program.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question on the German channel from Gary Litman, Financial Times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to Hans-Ulrich, Kurt and Mr. Hambrecht. I have a question about the economy at the beginning of the year, you warned against seeing things in a way -- to best thing to me way and that the underlying company looks better than everybody has expected. When did your point of view changed over the summer due to the real economy or did it change on the 15th of September at the Lehman bankruptcy and everything that followed from thereon. And about hedging, Lufthansa said that it lost 70 million due contracts of -- that Lufthansa had with Lehman. Did something like that happen to you too? And it was said that the hedging business changed due to the Lehman bankruptcy, because there is a new kind of party risk now. So when you hedge with someone, the question is, will my counterparty continue to exist tomorrow? Is this something that has bearing on your hedging policy too? And the third question is just about Volkswagen and volatility. You said that this also had an impact on the BASF share. Can you tell me how and you said there was a speculative bubble, but who speculated, investors, punters or Porsche?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mr. Litman, the last question, I cannot really answer. But I would guess all of the above were involved. There were some who owned Porsche share, they were very happy, and there were others who simply speculated. They bet on falling prices of Volkswagen and the opposite happened. Then they had to change &#x2013; to switch and that hurt everybody. I think this description is correct. It's impossible that on one day one share increases by 100 % and all of the other DAX shares go down 10%. That's rather unusual as far as situations go. So when did our view change? Well, at the beginning of the year everything was fine. The situation looked totally different in the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter I pointed out several times that the path ahead of us would become more difficult. But until that moment, we did not foresee the dramatic consequences that were to follow and of the last few weeks this effect was exasperated almost day-by-day and for the first time people started talking about shutting down automotive plants for weeks on end. And those were the fist signals that were publicized that reached the public and even before that we saw that demand in Asia was slowing down. And people said, well, this is due to the Olympic games and the Paralympics. Firstly, I believe there was another effect. Ever since the raw materials prices are going down quickly, there was a short bucking of the trend. But ever since those times within the value added chain in the manufacturing industry, people are paying much attention to their inventory and they try to sell or to reduce the inventory that was bought at a higher price and sell higher priced products first, and that's happening an Asia. And that is something positive about that too. Just look back at the Asia crisis years ago, what it means is that there will be fresh demand in Asia maybe not that strong anymore but there will be fresh demand. And we have to be careful not to create panic. I believe it's wrong. If you hold on to the steering wheel and follow your course, we have to do our job and find out what happens, what the road looks like and respond quickly. The world keeps growing, humankind keeps growing. There will be growth rates. GDP will not fall below zero next year. That won't happen. We will have lower growth. And we have to adjust to that after seven very prosperous years. And this is something some people find hard to do.</p>
          <p>Now back to Kurt Bock about hedging, Lehman, counterparty risks and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we didn't have any business relationship with Lehman. So we are not affected. But counterparty risk is an issue today we didn't imagine a few months ago. And we are taking a very close look at it regarding our financial and derivative business and we are at ease. We think the measures taken by government to stabilize the situation contributes to the fact that the situation is not that risky now.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I answered your question. I am of the opinion that I answered the question. It did have an effect because BASF shares had to be sold in order to buy Volkswagen shares. I did answer it. This was &#x2013; Mr. Litman, the answer regarding the buying of other shares.</p>

          <p>Next question from the German channel Mrs. Sabina Vitovitz , Manama Morgan. Good morning, Mrs. Vitovitz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question regarding the next program, one of course 300 million. Do you have the amount in your books already or when will you have to pay this? And Ciba, do you have any idea about the amount of synergies, the extent of synergies and takeover of Rebos. Do you think that third-party will interfere here or did you talk to this major interesting shareholder regarding the takeover? And a question regarding financing, you increased your CP program. Can you tell us in how far -- to which extent you are using it today and what the interest rate is we are talking about. And credit lines at the moment? How high are they, with how many banks? And did you restructure the scope of banks here? Can you give us some background information? And mix of currencies in the financing, did you change anything here? Are you planning for any changes? Now regarding customers, do you feel that people tend to pay later and that you have higher number of days of sale outstanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mrs. Vitovitz, Many questions &#x2013; but okay, let me start with question number one. Ciba first. And next customers and Hans-Ulrich Engel will comment on Rebos and Kurt Bock next. Ciba, you asked about synergies. You know that, today, we cannot give you a lot of information. Also due to the fact that we can only discuss synergies in detail with Ciba once the deal is closed, once the entire trust authorities have given us their opinion. I mean we don't expect any problem. But the final figure is something I cannot tell you now. But I can tell you what will happen for sure. Synergies that normally occur in an average case of a chemical takeover will be achieved and the average is more than 5% related to sales. We will lead this objective. Customers, what are we experiencing there. I must tell you, when it comes to receivables, we don't have any major issues here or higher number of days of sale outstanding, but we are watching this. But it turns out that some customers can no longer pay, this often happens overnight, and in many different ways. And I must tell you that we are really watching this very closely, because what is happening in the automotive industry and in the area of automotive suppliers will have effect in different areas. And so, we really have to watch out to see what is happening because some companies may have a problem when it comes to financing. And I would like to pass the floor to Hans-Ulrich Engel and the possible interference here and he can give you the details, Mrs. Vitovitz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mrs. Vitovitz, yesterday you saw what we saw i.e. that Lundin published that they now have more than 9.2% of Rayvoss shares. You asked whether we got in touch with Lundin, no not yet. And this is open. We don't know what it is all about. Maybe it is just arbitrage trading, maybe this is a possible interloper but maybe Lundin has a lot of trust when it comes to the operating abilities of Wintersun and wants to be a minority shareholder in the end. And, well, we will find out all about this. And following the publication in the weeks to come we will see a change in the situation on the stock market, of course, because our prospectus has not been published yet. It will be published on November 10th at the Oslo Stock Exchange, so the shareholders will receive the offer starting November 10th and it will be open for, we expect, four weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mrs. Vitovitz, you asked for a brief lecture on our financing policy. Well I'll try to be as brief as possible. The scope of banks has not changed. Currency mix has not changed. The currency we used is based on the cash flows and, of course, we are opportunistic and try to use money in the best of the best market. Of course you can always swap it. CP program, well, this is doing very well. To give you a feeling, the spreads we received, compared to the normal situation up to Q2, tripled, and we are issuing below liberate. This is a top quality; I don't want to be more specific here. And the credit lines are sufficient and we are using the CP program, which is extremely liquid. We are not using the credit lines. I hope this was brief but exact. Well, what is the extent of utilization of the CP program? You'll find it in the report, &#x20AC;3 million, three billion? Yes, three billion, sorry, three billion of $12 billion. So it's third. And credit lines, the amount of credit lines? I won't tell you. Sufficient. Sufficient. They are sufficient, let me tell you. I mean, now let's be realistic, Mrs. Vitovitz we are in a very good position here compared to other companies not only because of our rating, but also because of our very sound balance sheet structure and our very conservative financing policy that we have been pursuing for many decades now. Okay, thank you very much Mrs. Vitovitz. Next question please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello there, another question about your acquisition of Ciba in general. Are you going to be making more acquisitions in the coming months or year? And in what sectors of the business would you be looking to make more acquisitions? And my second question is about research and development. Are you likely to shift your focus in terms of research and development in light of the current financial situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mrs. Sanderson, regarding Ciba and other acquisitions over the next year as well, obviously our active portfolio optimization will be continued, especially when you talk about future years. At certain points in time, of course, we will have to deal with integration as well and this is the case when it comes to Ciba in particular. Our portfolio optimization will be continued in a way that, on the basis of our financing, we remain very conservative and whatever this allows us in times like these, we will do whatever is possible. And acquisitions will take place in all sectors given the priorities. First of all it has to be innovation driven; secondly, we need growth above market average, less cyclical; and fourthly, it has to be a business which is closer to the customer. And with this I would like answer your second question, R&amp;D. R&amp;D, will we adjust R&amp;D because of the crisis? Well the top priority for us when it comes to utilizing our cash flow is to invest in R&amp;D and this is why normally we will not reduce funds there. But I have to say that in R&amp;D we have a potential to increase efficiency and we will use this potential.</p>

          <p>Good morning. One question regarding long-term outlook. In London in summer you gave a long-term outlook regarding your margin goal and you said that you had a limit of 14% when the economy goes down and the maximum was 18% that you wanted to achieve. Are there any changes regarding these long-term forecast because of the financial crisis and the weakening of the economy? Second question. By 2013 you had a comparison with the chemical world market, you were talking about a volume growth of about 2%. Will this remain unchanged? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Zeburt, generally the long-term goals will not be changed for both. But don't forget one thing, we have certain basic conditions. People tend to forget this. Because we clearly said what the oil price will look like and we also mentioned the currency range. And of course we have to observe this and watch it and, in general, we will not change our forecasts here. Thank you, Mr. Zeburt.</p>

          <p>Next question. A follow-up question from the German Channel by Mr. Hoffman, Handelsblad. Mr. Hoffman, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have one more question, regarding the cash flow development, which is the weak point in Q3. Can you tell us what share the changes in inventory have here that you mentioned? And what kind of outlook do you have for the cash flow development for the quarters to come? And, regarding the financing structure, you are not that conservative when it comes to financing and when you go ahead with the acquisition, net debt will be around 15, &#x20AC;16 billion by the end of the year. So, is there a certain cap that you define for yourself when it comes to the balance sheet structure regarding gearing or other key indicators other any caps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kurt Bock will answer this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as far as the cash flow is concerned, I'd like to refer back to page 15 of the report. So there you see the cash flow and the change of the <mark type="inaudible" /> assets. We have tie up of 71.6 billion and a major part of this is due to the increased inventories in this year and some of this has to do with increased raw materials prices. So we'll reduce that over the next few months. The free cash flow over the last five years was roughly &#x20AC;3 billion per year and we are on a good path this year and as far as financing is concerned, we feel rather well. You're right of course, compared to five years ago, our net indebtedness increased clearly by the same period of time, yes, that increase &#x2013; grew and has great, of course the greater earnings and of course as Hambrecht said our strategy takes its queue from financial independence. And we have set ourselves to limits. And we will continue to be a self refinancing conservative company.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What are the limits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, currently these limits have not to been reached. We have AA minus rating. That's the best rating in the worldwide chemical industry in the US, face-to-fare of the chemical industries. And we have junk status. So BASF has a rating for which we were approved past several years, would be too expensive, too inefficient that the kind of structure will not make sense. The share buyback topic at this year, it was beneficial that we need an AA for BASF. So personally I think, but only that we wanted to have A at least, but this should help you on that one.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from German channel, a follow-up question from Sabina Vitovitz of Manama Morgan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mrs. Vitovitz, hello again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now my question, I'd like to rephrase my question. I wanted to know is that one billion cost savings enough, in view what's going on, on the markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mrs. Vitovitz now how much is enough when you have to save cost. First of all, we have to take a look at where do we go from here. And we have to look at how we shift the future. NEXT this part of this. We want to be &#x2013; we want to improve our standing compared to the competition. We will be one nose ahead of the competition because our cost savings program, when you look at it over the last few years, we saved &#x20AC;1.4 billion. I mean this continues in parallel, we are aligning organization that never stops thinking. What we are doing right now is a completely new approach and it takes time. That's why we're talking about 2012. I believe that within global competition with the things that we're doing now and next year that we're well positioned.</p>

          <p>Well, hello, Borga, Reuters I have a follow-up to the figure you mentioned, Mr. Hambrecht, run about or the average value for synergies in takeovers of the chemical company 5%, I guess this relates to the sales of the takeover target?</p>
