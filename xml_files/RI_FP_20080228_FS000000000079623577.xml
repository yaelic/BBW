        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Denis. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the presentation of the Pernod Ricard half-year results for H1 '07-'08. Two key messages &#x2013; two key messages prevail, first of all, historical progression of our business. It is actually historical for two reasons. First of all, given the buoyancy of the business in the first half year &#x2013; the buoyancy of our business.  The buoyancy of our sales &#x2013; we commented on this in July when we gave you our sales presentation. It's also historic in terms of the way this progression has taken place and given the growth of emerging markets as we announced last January. The top three contributing markets to sales growth have been China, India and Russia in that order. We believe that that clearly illustrates the future of our industry and where future profit growth lies for the most part.</p>
          <p>Second key message is just as important, the acceleration of profitability growth. Our margins increased very sharply over the half year, which illustrates the success of our premiumization strategy, as well as the additional margin growth contributed by emerging markets. This dramatic growth in margin has given us sufficient comfort to invest more heavily in advertising and promotion to prepare for the future.</p>
          <p>A few key figures now. Sales. &#x20AC;3.713 billion, up 10.1% organically. Once again, the top 15 brands have been the growth drivers &#x2013; 13% growth for the top 15 brands in our portfolio. There are two key drivers.  First of all, emerging markets, with 25% growth, and premium spirits &#x2013; on emerging markets as well as worldwide, premium spirits grew 17% in sales organically.</p>
          <p>Operating profit from ordinary activities. &#x20AC;966 million, up 15.3%. As you can see, we've managed to get five additional percentage points from the topline to the bottom line, and I'll explain that to you when I walk you down the profit and loss account. This strong growth is due to the buoyancy of our business, and due to better margins. And once again, very importantly, this growth was &#x2013; well, took place while we invested heavily in our brands.</p>
          <p>We have &#x20AC;595 million in &#x2013; &#x20AC;594 million, excuse me, in net profit group share, 18.6%. And you have the net profit number just below that.</p>
          <p>So, here you have a short form P&amp;L, I don't want to delve into too much detail, I just like to wrest your attention to the right hand column to help you understand what was at play over the half year and what has been at play with Pernod Ricard's business model.</p>
          <p>So, you see 10% growth in sales on the top right corner there. You see that our margin grew faster. Gross margin after logistics costs rose 12, nearly 13%. So we are in a position to boost our margin faster than our sales. All this has enabled us to decide to strongly increase advertising and promotion investment, nearly 15% growth for that item. In spite of that 15% growth, we have succeeded in increasing the contribution of our portfolio after advertising and promotion.  You see the figure there. You see the ratio over sales, 12%.</p>
          <p>And all these dynamic factors have allowed us to achieve over 15% growth in operating profit from ordinary activities. And you see that the 5% difference between the topline and the bottom line actually unfold when you walk down the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>What about currency and scope? First of all, the currency effect has once again had a significant impact.  Sales was hit &#x20AC;88 million negative. The operating profit from ordinary activities also significantly hit, &#x20AC;49 million. The reason for such an impact on profit is the scissors effect that we're suffering because we sell in &#x2013; significantly in euro &#x2013; dollar denominated regions. Although, we produce in strong currency regions which are &#x2013; for the most part euro denominated and we have many of our cost, cost &#x2013; central cost and so on in euro regions, which is why we are hit by currency on our operating profit.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we give a bracket anywhere between 80 and &#x20AC;90 million. That should be the total effect and obviously if the dollar stays where it is today, as we speak, we'd be in the upper portion of the bracket in terms of the negative impact we could expect to suffer.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the scope impact, it has to do with the disposal of certain brands namely Rich &amp; Rare in the US, also ascribed to the termination of some co-packing agreements, bottling for Fortune Brands, for instance.  There is a &#x20AC;54 million impact on sales.  But the impact on operating profit from ordinary activities is a mere &#x20AC;6 million if I may say so. Because it's &#x2013; we sold off low margin businesses.  For the rest of the year, our guidance remains the same. The scope effect should be &#x20AC;110 million roughly. And &#x20AC;10 million should be the impact on our operating profit from ordinary activities.</p>
          <p>We commented on sales at length in January. So I'll just repeat the key messages.  Growth took place on the strength of the top 15 brands, that generated over 70% of organic growth. In the first half, premium brands, which accounted for a little more than one-third of sales, were responsible for more than half of organic growth for the half year. You see the vitality of these premium brands within our business.  And emerging countries, which generated nearly two-thirds of organic growth. China experienced organic sales growth to the tune of 31%, India 49% and Russia 51%. As I was saying, these three countries were the top three contributors to Group growth in the first half.</p>
          <p>The benefits of premiumization clearly show up in H1 sales growth. 7% growth in volume for the top 15 brands, but we generated 13% sales growth.  So you've volume growth 7%, 13% sales growth so 6% difference there, better than last year. The additional growth was a mere 5% last year, clearly there was stronger volume growth, but let me remind you that this was a favorable comparison basis, because the comparable half year in '05, '06, was a year of acquisition &#x2013; following the Allied Domecq acquisition when we pushed out some stocks.</p>
          <p>Also please note that we were able to grow each and every one of the top 15 brands in terms of sales and faster than for volume. So for each and every of the top 15 brands, with price and mix effects, sales grew faster than volume.</p>
          <p>Briefly, now let me throw you the performance of the various brands. Chivas, 13% volume growth, 16% sales growth. Chivas grew very handsomely worldwide, namely on emerging markets. Ballantine's, 8% volume growth, 12% internal sales growth. Ballantine's is doing well. For Ballantine's Finest the value end of the line up and the mix has been enhanced given the sharp rise in the superior qualities of Ballantine's in Asia.</p>
          <p>Ricard, experienced a good half-year, 2% volume growth, 3%internal sales growth, with quite a pickup in Q2 in France and market share gains. Martell, probably the most emblematic brand for this value strategy, 6% volume growth, 27% internal sales growth. As you know, we've decided to clearly prioritize the upper-end of the Martell line up to the detriment of VS. So there is a significant drop in VS volume. Nevertheless, we are still experiencing strong growth for the Cordon Bleu, the XO and Noblige.</p>
          <p>We've also significantly improved &#x2013; enhanced prices on a number of markets, namely in China, but its fair to say that Martell prices were raised significantly worldwide, which generates the very positive effect between volume and sales. You see the 21% difference there. Needless to say, that this also translates into better margins, I'll come back to that later on.</p>
          <p>Malibu. Malibu, 6% volume growth 13% organic sales growth, quite a difference there too. The brand grew in all regions.</p>
          <p>Kahl&#xFA;a. Kahl&#xFA;a was the difficult brand in the half year. A 1% drop in the sales situation in the US remains tricky.  At the end of 2007, we unleashed a new communications platform called "Dare to be Curious". And we do hope that the benefits will be good.</p>
          <p>Jameson, the success story goes on. 60% growth in volume, 20% organic sales growth.  Strong growth in the US, but not only in the US. There are dozens of markets where Jameson has experienced double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Beefeater grew 4% in sales with a dip in the US, stability in Spain and strong growth in countries such as Russia, the UK and Greece.</p>
          <p>Stolichnaya.  11% organic sales growth. The brand has grown everywhere and Stolichnaya Elit, which is the ultra premium product in the Stolichnaya line up. Stolichnaya Elit doubled volume simply put.</p>
          <p>Havana Club. 16% growth in sales.  Double-digit growth in all regions. Quite a few homeruns here.</p>
          <p>The Glenlivet. About 18% growth in sales. The Glenlivet is doing very well in the US and in Asia, as well as on some European markets such as France, the Glenlivet is really doing well.</p>
          <p>Jacob's Creek.  Back to successful performance in terms of both volume and sales. You can see that sales is growing faster than volume. 10% growth in sales.</p>
          <p>Mumm. 17% growth in sales with very good inroads in France but better mix. We hiked prices. We have a slight problem with Mumm in that we don't have enough to sell.</p>
          <p>Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t. 7% organic sales growth with very good performance in Q2, namely in the US.</p>
          <p>Montana. 6% growth in sales. You see the value strategy there. Volume is down 5%, partly due to the fact that we have shortages on some markets, but we're constantly &#x2013; significantly raising prices.  6% rise in sales, it has a consequence on margins. So, on a whole, 7% growth in volume and 13% growth in sales, organically speaking.</p>
          <p>Okay. Let me now move onto the most dramatic portion of this performance of ours for the half year. We already spoke about the growth in sales, but I would like to speak about margin now, and you can see our gross margin after adjusted costs, on like-for-like ForEx basis, it would have jumped from 56% of sales to 58% of sales.</p>
          <p>200 basis points may not be very, very dramatic, but let me put it this way. Consider that for the full year &#x2013; consider that we achieve a 200 basis point improvement in margin if the river doesn't rise, if you consider &#x20AC;7 billion in sales, rounding it off, granted, we're looking at &#x20AC;140 million more. So with no sales growth &#x2013; with that kind of margin growth, we could generate 10% bottom line growth. You see how powerful our ability to improve profitability is.</p>
          <p>Now where does this margin enhancement stem from? Well, from the top 15 brands, which generated 70% of the growth. And the growth &#x2013; results from what I spoke about in sales. Strong growth in premium brands, the price hikes that we achieved.</p>
          <p>The success in premium brands has very strong impact and emerging markets are growing especially with these premium brands, and that has a beneficial effect on our margin, it's true in Asia, it's also true in Eastern Europe for instance.</p>
          <p>This firing power, this ability to improve both sales and margin, has given us the opportunity to ramp up our advertising and promotion expenditure, which is important at a time when markets are building up for the future.</p>
          <p>We thought it would be a good idea to increase A&amp;P spend to gain further market shares and make inroads on these new very promising markets out there. You see that this translates into organic growth of nearly 15% in A&amp;P spend and you see there on a ForEx basis, the A&amp;P investment over sales ratio would have jumped from 16 to 16.9%, actually it's 16.8% given the ForEx impact.</p>
          <p>There too, for strategic consistency reasons, we focused on the top 15 brands. 80% of the rise in A&amp;P spend was focused on the top 15 brands, and a major portion involved the premium markets and the regional markets, but quite clearly there were few old &#x2013; mature markets where we increased our investments namely to support the launch of new ad campaigns.  One example is Ballantine's.</p>
          <p>Strong increase in business, strong increase in margin, strong increase in A&amp;P spend and in spite all of that we've boosted our contribution after advertising and promotion, 12% organic growth.</p>
          <p>CAAP amounts to &#x20AC;1.503 billion.  You see that on a like-for-like currency basis, the CAAP over sales ratio would have jumped from 40 to 41.1%. Actually the published data shows 40.5% given the currency impact, but you see that margins have improved considerably, while improving our investments.</p>
          <p>Structure costs.  Unsurprisingly, we're still very consistent as to how we implement our business model. We told you that in the long run, we were hoping to grow our business faster than our structure costs. This has &#x2013; been the case for the half year, see the organically structure costs rose 6.5%. If you exclude the stock of cost options, it would have been 5.5%, so there is 1% there that's due to a technical effect, due to the booking of stock options.</p>
          <p>5.5% is pretty close to 50% growth of the topline. And this cuts our structure costs over sales ratio, which would have been from 14.7 to 14.4% <mark type="inaudible" /> currency ratio is 40.5%. So, the &#x2013; actually, structure costs have especially increased on emerging countries where we're setting up our structures and networks, namely in China, Russia and India.</p>
          <p>So, in summation, business has been buoyant, we've been able to sharply increase our margins and our CAAP over sales ratio, our structure costs are contained, growing slower than sales. Those three beneficial factors have enabled us to sharply increase our operating profit from ordinary activities, up 15.3% to &#x20AC;966 million. We've also improved our operating margin which would have jumped from 25.3 to 26.7%, on a like-for-like basis, 140 basis points up there, while increasing our investments in ad spends.  So we are preparing for future growth with these investments and further growth ahead.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the geographic breakdown. You'll see that all regions contributed to the growth. Asia and Europe were the top two contributors, with 37.5% each in Asia and Europe &#x2013; in Asia and Europe.  Emerging markets generated additional growth. In Europe, mature markets performed very well all the same. In the Americas, significant contribution to growth, 17%, and in France, &#x20AC;10 million contribution, which accounts for 8% of the overall growth.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the growth by region.  First of all, Asia, rest of the world.  This is probably the most dramatic portion of our growth. You see a 13% growth in sales, gross margin after logistics cost rose 22%, you see the growth difference there. And you see the jump in gross margin over sales ratio, 48.2 to 51.4%. Here this is due to Martell, our whiskies in Asia and so on. Strong growth in sales and even stronger growth in margin. In such a growing region, of course, we are putting money to gain market shares. So we are pouring money into advertising and promotion expenditure, 20% rise there and in spite of this 20% rise, our operating profit from ordinary activities is up.</p>
          <p>We see twice the sales growth in Asia.  Has extraordinary profitability because the ROC, as we call it, operating profit from ordinary activities, our sales ratio is 25.8%, quite comparable with what you have in other large regions.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at brands that have generated this growth. Martell, Ballantine's and Chivas were the main growth drivers. And as I was saying about A&amp;P, we, of course, invested heavily in the fast growing areas &#x2013; China, but not only China, we also invested in India and various other markets in region.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Americas &#x2013; less dramatic there. Internal organic sales growth, 10%, you see the gross margin after logistics costs has grown similarly, 9%. We significantly boosted our advertising and promotion investments, so you we see we did not sacrifice A&amp;P spend at all and our operating profit from ordinary activities rose 10% or so, organically. Operating profit grew just as fast as our sales. Let me remind you that the Americas was the region that was first and foremost hit by currency and scope. So, actually there is a drop from 277 to &#x20AC;165 million in operating profit from ordinary activities. Chivas, Stolichnaya, Jameson, Malibu and Something Special were the most dynamic brands that spurred this growth.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to Europe now. And Europe is doing very well. Growth is very strong. You can see the results here. For quite a few years Europe was &#x2013; well, it was medium ranking in terms of growth. However, I think that changes have come about because Western Europe is doing better than it used to and we now have extra growth coming in from Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>There are hundreds of thousands of consumers, even millions, who are discovering our brands. You can see that this growth is demonstrated and translates into a 90% growth in our sales. For Europe, we are also improving our margins significantly after taking away logistic costs. You can see it's gone up by 12%. And this is also an area where we are investing quite heavily. Advertising and promotion expenditure is up 15% and the OPOA has done is very well indeed, and organically it's up 15% and we have improved the ratio of OPOA over sales by 29.5%.</p>
          <p>Now, Europe, you have got the top 15. We've got Chivas, Ballantine's, Jameson and Jacob's Creek, very good brands there. But, we've got other brands which are local leaders on their markets and there are very good premium brands as well. You've got the Armenian Ararat brand, you've got the Olmeca Tequila, and Ruavieja is a liquor, which does extremely well in Spain, and it's creeping up to the 1 million case mark.</p>
          <p>If we look at France, now this is a region where we are back in growth &#x2013; 8% organic growth. We've got the gross margin after &#x2013; which is up 7%. Advertising and promotion, up 5%. We've been very disciplined in the structural costs, and overall the OPOA over sales, here the results is up by 12% for France. So, once again we've improved the operating margin &#x2013; the ratio of OPOA over sales has gone up from 23.2% to 24.2%. So, we've got good brands. However, the whiskies have done well and our champagne brands have done extremely well too.</p>
          <p>If we look at the breakdown by geographical zone. Europe, which was losing market share quarter-by-quarter, in fact it has picked up. It's on the up turn and the extra growth we're getting from Central and Eastern Europe, this means that Europe now is recovering and weighs more in the overall total of activities. Of course, Americas' suffered slightly from changes in scope and the currency translation affects. There we are for the operating profit from ordinary activities.</p>
          <p>Lets move on to the financials per se, the financial income/expenses. We've got net financing costs of 168 million, I beg your pardon, 176 total in financial income and expense from ordinary activities. We've got net financing costs of 168. We've got 8 million of other financial income and expense from ordinary activities. So this ties in with &#x20AC;6 million worth of amortization of the bank charges, which have been paid in relation to a syndicated loan.  The debt represents 33% in Europe &#x2013; in Euro, 43% in dollars, 4% in other currencies. We've given you the breakdown of the debt, the part which is variable.  The part which is capped, it's variable, but it's capped, you have this in the different currencies as well. And we've given you in the final column the part which is fixed, so you can see that further growth &#x2013; we've got 61% of our debt of which in fact would profit from &#x2013; interest rates are going down and we are already beginning to enjoy the fruits of this.</p>
          <p>Changes in the debt. Our debt on the 31st of December, 2007 was 6.631 billion compared with 6.5 billion on the 30th of June of last year. How has this changed?  We've got a free cash flow of 109 million, I'll come back to that in just a minute. Let me remind you that traditionally the first half of the year is not a period in &#x2013; when we get a lot of free cash flow. It's tied in with the seasonality of our activity of course.</p>
          <p>We've had contributions to the pension funds and financial assets that dispose 169 millions. 80, 90 million are paid into our pension fund, roughly &#x20AC;80 million are paid to Fortune Brands &#x2013; this is a tax guarantee, which we gave in acquiring Allied Domecq. We've paid out dividends and so on, 273 million. And then the 7 millions of dividend paid out to our Cuban partners and to minority interests. In Corby, this is a Canadian company and we've had a translation &#x2013; currency translation adjustment of 217. This is a positive &#x2013; this reflects the exposure we have in dollars. This has impacted our operating income but when the dollar goes down compared with the euro, then our debt also goes down. So we've improved the ratio of net debt over EBITA, which was at 3.9 in June last year and now it goes &#x2013; stands at 3.8.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to the comments on the 109 and how we've got to that figure. 109 million of euros compared with 289 million for the preceding year and there is really one element, which explains the fact that the free cash flow is lower in this first half year. It's the line of increase in the working capital requirements. And last year we had increase of 284 million, this year we had an increase of 550 million. Now there is 260 million difference there so, this explains a difference in performance &#x2013; otherwise we would have had a very nice increase in our free cash flow. This gap, this difference between the two is explained by two very basic things. First of all, reconstituting the Cognac stocks and the development of stock in the champagne activities.  We said, and we carried this out in H1, and this represents &#x20AC;150 million worth. And secondly, we had a very strong level of activity in the second half of the year. Our customers represented &#x20AC;110 million worth of orders, but this is money which will be coming in at the beginning of the next half year.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to the other elements of the net profit from ordinary activities. We have income tax; you have this standing at &#x20AC;184 million. This &#x2013; we have 2 million of income tax effect on other items we have 183 million of income tax on items from ordinary activities. We have a minority interest to &#x2013; these are the minority interests of Corby and what is due to our associates in Havana Club.</p>
          <p>And if I look at all the different factors, which I just outlined and which go to make up the OPOA, group share, net profit from ordinary activities group share, then we have an excellent performance. Increase of 12% in profit from ordinary activities and group share is up at 12%, 18% on like-for-like basis. And this really reflects the excellent growth and the strong performance of the group.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look at the non-recurring elements. Operating income and expenses total 5 million. How do we get to that figure? First of all, the net capital gains and losses on asset disposals and valuation. This gives a low revenue &#x2013; a low income of 2 million. We have restructuring charges which have been implemented in the industrial part of the activity. And we've optimized our structures as well. And of course this translates into our accounts, so this represents a negative effect of 17 million.</p>
          <p>And then we've had other revenue, non-recurring income and expenses. In fact, we've had &#x2013; too &#x2013; we've put in too much for our pension fund. So, we took back this excess provision representing 20 million. There is also an unfavorable exchange rate &#x2013; difference &#x2013; a cost of 9 million there. And it's the fact that we have &#x2013; this represents a debt in euro related to the Mexican peso and of course, the euro has gone up, which means that we have a charge on that &#x2013; an expense on that.</p>
          <p>Now, if I look at the Group share of net profit, all the different factors. Now, this translates at the end of the day into this and a net profit Group share, which represents &#x20AC;588 million worth, up almost 18%, a very nice increase indeed in the net profit for the Group share.</p>
          <p>Just to conclude and to talk about the prospects for the future. You have seen that each H1 for the year 2007-2008 has been a very good half year for Pernod Ricard. We have strongly increased in terms of activity. We've done very well in terms of the margin. Profits have gone up, so much in fact that we decided to significantly improve &#x2013; and I think far more than our peers have done &#x2013; our advertising and promotion, which really strengthens our growth prospects for the future. For all these reasons, we are revising our growth targets upwards for the whole of the operating year. And now we are talking about an operating profit from ordinary activities over at least 12% for the 2007-2008 financial year. Previously, we were talking about a growth of just under 12%.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take your questions ladies and gentlemen.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Antoine Belge, HSBC. Three questions. First of all, on the gross margin. You've had a very good increase, so much so, although &#x2013; I beg your pardon &#x2013; although I do believe that you've had negative impacts in packaging and material costs. So, could you give us a breakdown of the negative and positive impacts on the 200 base points that you've seen an improvement? What are your prospects, secondly, for growth for the second-half?  Do you believe that you continue to contain these increases in costs? After that, the American market, you've talked about the sales there. Are you still optimistic for the American market? Have there been any significant changes, since then? And if the American economy were to slow down even more than you are forecasting, do you &#x2013; where do you think the premiumization is going? Do you think you've got &#x2013; what are the price mixes which are most at risk? And then finally, could you talk perhaps about what is happening on the vodka market, the Stolichnaya dossier, VNS? What is happening that VGO apparently has come to an agreement with Cater 1 and does that actually change things fundamentally?</p>

          <p>I'll give the easiest answer. On your final question, there is no comment whatsoever. No comment at all on your final question.</p>
          <p>On the gross margin, we haven't had any negative impact due to costs for the first half of the year and we not expecting any unfavorable elements to occur in the second half year of the year. We were protected on most contracts so for that.  We were very lucid about the second half of the year. We have a few contracts up for re-negotiation. On glass in particular, we think it's going to be difficult on that. That's true, it's very difficult, however, to quantify it. Maybe there will be a &#x20AC;15 million or so of impact, but we are not going to be sitting there with our arms folded waiting for things to happen. And we are certainly going to work to reduce the impact of hikes in the costs of glass.</p>
          <p>What will be the overall impact? We don't know, but for this half of the year, at any rate, there is nothing significant in terms of negative impact. The favorable impacts which we've seen has been the implementation of the industrial synergies, which we've had with Allied Domecq. We said basically 30 million worth which was going to be rolled over two or three years. Now, I think roughly half of that will be covered in this half of the year. There is a small part of that which will be taken up in the products, which are coming out in 18, 20 years or so. So &#x2013; but otherwise, I think we'll have been &#x2013; be having 18 to 20 million's worth of positive impacts. So, for that half of the year, its going to be pretty positive and it really down to the industrial strategy of synergy with Allied Domecq.</p>
          <p>For the US, what was seen there is that our strong brands are continuing to develop and I'm talking about what's happening now. There are brands are such as Jameson, Glenlivet, our wines, our champagnes. These are products which are developing at the moment, which are growing. So, we are talking about the market being more difficult. When you go in to a New York restaurant, now, it's difficult to believe that the situation as bad as some people are saying. Are we heading for a really more difficult economic environment? All I can say is so far so good.</p>
          <p>What we see is that what's doing well is still doing well and as far as expected.  Concerning our brands. What was doing well is still doing well or what was having trouble, then we're still having a few problems with these brands. But I mean, we hope that the new brands the <mark type="audio gap" /> for Kahl&#xFA;a will help us, will boost this brand. And a mass market product which is not as premiumized as others, for example, the Seagram's Gin. Products such as that, it's not doing as badly as all &#x2013; as all that. So far, so good.</p>

          <p>Francois Digard, Natixis Securities. First question, on the OPOA for the first half of the year, can you talk about the geographical zones in the Americas, North and South America? Can you do the split between profitability, between North and South, and then do the split geographically between East and Western Europe.  As well, are there brands which are really different?</p>
          <p>And then currency conversion for the end of the financial year, the weakness of the sterling pound is bringing in an extra factor which I think is good for you in terms of margins, because you talked about costs in sterling which were sold in dollars. So it's not as bad as if you were working in euros. I imagine this is included in the guidance you've given us.  Is it or not?  Maybe you could just specify this and explain how the whole thing works when the pound sterling goes down? And then, finally, have you had any impact on your figures from the fact that in France nobody is allowed to smoke in cafes and restaurants anymore, is this going to hit your figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will give you the easy answer, says, Mr. Ricard. On the final question, the ban on smoking in restaurants in France, it's still a bit too early to really judge the impact of this. Let me remind you that the entr&#xE9;e market represents about 20% of our overall figures, what we see outside of France. So where we have got more experience, is that the figures do go down, they slide a bit, and then they pick up again, and we get back to normal levels of consumption.</p>
          <p>At the moment we can't really give a final judgment on it. If there was an impact on a small part of our sales, well I mean it has been made up for &#x2013; by our figures abroad. On the geographical zones a lot has been &#x2013; we've already said an awful lot. Our competitors, I have to tell you they say far less than we do. However, for the geographical zones, let me say that yes it's true, it's clear that the so-called emerging markets, countries, are developing faster than the mature markets. I don't think that's anything new for you. But that is the news, that's what my answer is.</p>
          <p>On currency translation effect, you've seen the subtleties linked to the loss of value of the pound sterling linked to the euro. Now, that's good news for us, it's nice to have a good piece of news from time-to-time. We have a reduction in the input costs expressed in pound sterling, but that's why I'm not worried about the guidance we've given on ForEx.</p>

          <p>Isabella Laurent from <mark type="inaudible" />. Could you tell us how you intend to schedule price hikes, namely in the US, because sometimes we learn about that once it's done.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, traditionally price hikes in the US take place in the summer. And in France they place in winter. Why? Well it's just a habit, I guess, the force of habit.</p>

          <p>Ian Shackleton from Lehman Brothers, question for you in English. Two questions if I may.  Just coming back on the Americas, obviously you've got quite a big increase in A&amp;P and obviously in logistics. Do we assume that is all in sort of the emerging market in the Americas, or is quite a bit of that A&amp;P being focused on the US with the new brand launches? And the second question was about the cost of doing business in China, A&amp;P, obviously in that Asia, rest of the world region up quite materially. But are the costs of business in China still going up or have they actually started to come down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To give you a very brief answer on China. Our profit in China is growing all the time. It's as easy as that. As our business grows, operating cost increases, but in actual fact our business generates more and more profit and we have never stopped making more and more money in China, year-after-year.</p>
          <p>As far as A&amp;P is concerned, I think, Emmanuel aptly said so earlier, we are obviously investing on growing markets, as well as on more mature markets. And as far as the US is concerned, we are strongly investing in our brands. There is this new Kahl&#xFA;a campaign called 'Dare to be Curious', which is a new communication platform. It's not just a campaign, what we are doing is, we are fully repositioning the Kahl&#xFA;a brand. There is a new look, cosmetics have indeed improved considerably from the past and we are repositioning the brand to make it attractive to young adults, people in their 20s and early 30s, because the housewives aged below 50 make up an attractive market segment, but it's kind of lackluster for the brand. So we're repositioning the brand. We're investing in the A&amp;P. I'm stressing, Kahl&#xFA;a, because it's something new to this group. I can also speak about Beefeater or our wine brands, because we're also investing in our wine and champagne brands. So our A&amp;P spend is growing worldwide.</p>
