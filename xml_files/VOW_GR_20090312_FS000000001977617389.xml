          <p>Good day, and welcome to the question-and-answer session of the Volkswagen AG Annual Media and Press 2009 Conference Call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would also like to greet you, a very well welcome to Autostadt in Wolfsburg. As already announced, the Managing Board of Volkswagen AG just will be happy to take any questions from analysts, and investors, and bank representatives. The media already had the opportunity to ask any questions they had this morning. So, I would like to get started right away, and I would like to ask if there are any questions from the participants here. Please give us your name and wait for the microphone to be brought to you. Thank you very much. We will start with Mr. Ellinghorst.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. I have two questions. First question about your capital costs. While I believe that all of us here agree that everything is getting more expensive and the cost of procuring capitals are increasing, so this is a long lasting trend. Did you ever examine what influence this has on your business, because in the automotive industry, there is a tendency that you'll get money at 6% and 1.9% financing is offered to your customers, while you have to pay more for raising funds. What does it mean for your long-term growth if financing and leasing terms have to be increased, and what kind of price flexibility could result as a consequence of this?</p>
          <p>And my second question, I am sure that in the past you've been very clear, and you had a clear opinion, Dr. Winterkorn, and also Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, concerning the blocking minority at Volkswagen, and that you can actually live with it very well, and that you're happy that it exists and that you assume that it's going to be continued. Could you just give the brief update, your comment on the 20% blocking minority at Volkswagen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to answer your first question. There is no doubt, and in fact, I already said it at media conference this morning. Well, I started to give you the answer to this question, that increasing capital costs, refinancing costs, obviously means that the customer has to pay more, so this means added cost to the customer. And there is no doubt about it, this is definitely going to have an effect on the volume component, especially since we know that in particular in some of the emerging markets the availability of financing and price or low price and low cost financing in particular, that this is a main driver for the growth of the automotive market. Because in these countries, they don't have any assets readily available, and in many cases all you get is a kind of down payment, and then you are dependent, as a customer, on somebody making the financing scheme available to you. So this is definitely going to have negative effects, if in the long-term capital costs increase.</p>
          <p>The second point, which we should not neglect, is higher capital costs obviously also mean that the expectations for rates of return would tend to go up and the requirements of a particularly efficient control of capital or handling of capital, or how much capital is tied up, that this would also increase and become more stringent.</p>
          <p>I believe it would be premature to give you a final assessment or outlook of the medium-term scenario and how it's possibly going to develop. Well, I think if we have to reckon with higher capital costs, it does not inevitably have to have negative consequences for our business, because this trend will mean that the underlying quality of the automotive business will rather increase, will be improved because the requirements imposed by the providers of funds or the capital market, the requirements concerning the creditworthiness of the people borrowing money will become more stringent, and it's a clear equation which we're looking at here. And it will definitely mean that consolidation will be further fueled by this trend.</p>
          <p>Now the blocking minority, I can only say very briefly, I believe you are familiar with the situation, you know it quite well. The revision of the Volkswagen law, well, it's not finalized yet, well, it has not been formally adopted yet by the EU Commission. But it has not been finally accepted by the EU Commission or it's &#x2013; the Commission that it was &#x2013; couldn't accept it. And this would mean at the end of the day that at some stage, at the end of this year, beginning of next year, the trend will be again submitted to an EU court.</p>
          <p>And I think it would be speculating to judge or to try to predict how the judge of the European Union would, or what kind of decision he would take concerning this topic. So we will have to wait and see here, but &#x2013; all we can say now is we are quite happy with our current situation, and we don't think this is a main, decisive, or key factor for our corporate policy.</p>
          <p>Mr. Pieper?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>J&#xFC;rgen Pieper from Bankhaus Metzler. I have two questions. Distribution cost is one thing, you had this major leap in the fourth quarter. Is it &#x2013; well, in conjunction with what Mr. Wittig said, because you said that you have to build up your distribution and sales efforts. Is it just a temporary phenomenon which is going to last one or two quarters, or is it going to last longer? This strong increase or development of distribution costs and then this scrappage bonus, well in fact on the one hand, everybody says the volume effect is quite large, particularly over a couple of months.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, they don't want to change their forecasts in the first quarter. They have been saying for a while that there might actually be a loss. So, does it mean that the profitability effect from the scrappage bonus is not to last because this is primarily for small cars, or is the loss so significant that the 50 million or whatever plus, that it cannot really offset for the positive effect they've created?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, distribution costs. If you look at this quarterly leap, you will see for the first time Scania was consolidated here, so Scania is now included in our distribution costs for the first time. That's something you have to bear in mind. And this is a considerable volume, that's one thing.</p>
          <p>Secondly, well certainly, while some of this relates to sales promotion activities, which is quite common in the industry, but when we do a benchmark assessment in this market, I can tell you that with our &#x2013; grants are always in the lower third of manufacturers granting sales, bonuses, or promotion allowances. And, last year we launched many new products, for instance, the Golf. The Golf, as our best selling model, certainly was accompanied by a launch campaign, and the same applies to Skoda, the Fabia campaign and its effect, and with Audi there were a couple of launch campaigns and the SEAT Ibiza. So, that's part of the costs; that explains part of the costs. And this is a cyclical phenomenon because of the fact that high volume models were newly launched, so sales promotion costs were actually in clarity about the model, if compared to the competitors and the initial consolidation of Scania.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe I can briefly follow up from what was said about distribution costs. But certainly marketing of new product is a main element of our distribution costs, but let me just give you an example that shows you that other cost factors also play a role. You know that in 2008, there was considerable strain in the area of freight costs until the recession hit us, and we had underuse of capacities, which meant that the situation, the strain eased, but nevertheless this played an important role.</p>
          <p>On the question of rates of return in conjunction with the scrappage bonus, bonus of scrapping old cars, let me just tell you this. Yes, in Germany, and this will have an effect on our sales beginning as of March. We will have a positive development, but Germany is just one among many markets. We have a large number of markets when we have two digit change rates in the wrong direction, but the trend is going in the wrong direction, so this situation definitely had a positive, a supporting effect.</p>
          <p>But in particular by adjustments to our production programs, we had negative effect in the first quarter, and this cannot be fully compensated. And I could also add that all of the new orders coming in February will be executed at the earliest in March or April so they are not going to have any effect on results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Schneider?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Horst Schneider, HSBC. I have just a couple of brief questions. First of all, if I've calculated things correctly, in the fourth quarter 56% of R&amp;D development, R&amp;D costs were capitalized. Is that a long-term trend that in 2009 will continue, will it be higher than in 2008 on the average, that is your capitalization of R&amp;D cost, or was this a one-off thing?</p>
          <p>Then, if I look at the balance sheet and I see asset sales was <mark type="inaudible" /> for sale. I might conclude that from the sales of your truck activities in Brazil, you had a one-off profit of 800 to &#x20AC;900 million, can you confirm that, or is the figure actually lower?</p>
          <p>Then, the last question, it's calculation of cost of capital and that's crucial for calculating your investments. You're expecting a low cost of capital, lower than in 2007, 7.2%, and the equity cost &#x2013; equity capital costs are seen as lower in 2007 in 2008. So, the cost of capital projects used for your calculations, is that going to be going up in 2009, and will that mean that you will have to postpone more of your investment projects as a results of that? Mr. P&#xF6;tsch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, let me tell you about capitalizing R&amp;D costs. Quite simply, I'd like to make clear here that for many years now we at Volkswagen have been using a procedure at all of the Volkswagen Group companies. It's well established, which ultimately means that there is no room for arbitrariness. We have organizational guideline that stipulates this procedure. It's been confirmed by our external auditors to say that it's correct. It describes how during the product creation process, using certain milestones, how we capitalize costs.</p>
          <p>Now, it's like this, if you have a &#x2013; if we have a project, and we haven't completed the feasibility study, the R&amp;D costs are completely set off against expenses, and then if the project begins to look like it's going to the market, we start capitalizing costs.</p>
          <p>So, the quintessence is this, if we're operating in an environment in which a smaller number of new products are going to be launched, then R&amp;D capitalization would tend to go down. But if we've got a big pipeline of new models that are going to be launched, this rage as a result of our fundamental principal here would tend to go up.</p>
          <p>So, consequently it's nothing special. It's an upshot of the fact that we have important projects like the Golf 6 and the new Polo, and these have both been capitalized now, very quickly. And you know what, Audi, they have models that are based on the longitudinal trend, modular system, the A4 and the Q5, and it's like this at SEAT and Skoda too. Things are developing very dynamically there as well. So, very clearly we'll be at a comparable level in terms of capitalization rate, for a while before probably in 2010 this will start to go down.</p>
          <p>Next, selling Resende to MAN. You are not completely wrong in what you read. We expect profit of several hundred million from the sale of that, and we expect a capital injection when the deal is closed; that will be about &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Then you expressed concern about cost of capital. I understand that concern very well because of course these are things that we're thinking about too, and therefore, in our reporting we reflect the actual market-related cost of capital but in analyzing products or investments or projects, we're going to continue to use the same cost of capital rate, and we're not going to decrease it. I think there was a follow up question by Mr. Schneider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I do have a follow up question about the one-off profit from your Brazilian activities. Nevertheless, despite that one-off benefit, you're going to be negative in the first quarter, have you already taken that into account?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we haven't taken that into account because we do not know when the deal will be able to be closed. And thus, what I have stated refers to the development of earnings prior to any account taken for a profit from the sale of Resende.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jochen Gehrke next, he's in the back row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Jochen Gehrke, Deutsche Bank. I have three questions. First of all, a question about inventories, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. Last year in nearly every quarter we saw an increase in inventories partly due to Scania. How long will you take to reduce that to a normal level, and how will that be spread across the different quarters in sequence?</p>
          <p>And then my second question, Dr. Winterkorn, about SEAT. You have long been a strong advocate of SEAT, and now you're pointing out the fact that the market is difficult, that's true. But I believe it's an issue that can't be taken care of that quickly in view of the problems in the Spanish economy. So, how long do you think you'll have to continue to invest in SEAT, and how long will you stick to them before you perhaps come up with a different decision?</p>
          <p>And my third question, Mr. Winterkorn, about a year and half ago, you invited us to come talk about Lamborghini, you looked at your brand portfolio, eight brands, and you said Volkswagen is a group that can do more. Now you said when you started with regard to consolidation that well, let me say this, is it the right time to acquire assets? The prices are low now or on the other hand, is it something that you would not do under any circumstances at the current point in time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. P&#xF6;tsch begins and says, well, I will briefly mention inventories and answer that question. We are already talking about this. We were mentioning general figures, and I think it's logical to not just look at the inventories in our statements, it's also important to look at dealer inventories and the figure there is just under 200,000 cars that we have in inventories around the world, that is in the Group and thus in our &#x2013; on our books and at our dealerships, excess inventories, that is readymade vehicles.</p>
          <p>Now Mr. Wittig already said we believe that in general about half of these excess inventories will have been reduced by the end of first quarter, and then we will be able to eliminate these all together, we hope in the second quarter, so that in the second half of the year our inventory levels would be at the ideal level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Gehrke, says Dr. Winterkorn, you asked about SEAT. We'll be looking at SEAT for a long time to come because we really continue to back up SEAT. We can't leave SEAT the way it is now, we know that. I think our product decisions that we've made in the last two years are important, the first one was Ibiza two door, four door. The car is a great success in the market, and there will be a third version of that, the Estate or Station Wagon. It'll be a beautiful car.</p>
          <p>And then we have the Exeo and Exeo Station Wagon, two different versions. These are two great cars that we've added; expenditures on those relatively low. Leon is going well. We do have a weakness with the Altea and the Toledo, but I believe that currently, we don't have a product weakness. Rather it's a market weakness, and that is why I mentioned the Spanish market in this context.</p>
          <p>And another important point is that we are going to make SEAT more sales-oriented. I think that that brand has more potential in the marketplace. And you read, I'm sure today, that we are making changes, not because of our short-term plans; it's our long-term plan. Mr. Schmitt is going to be 63 at the end of the year. And as of the 1st of the September, he is going to be leaving that position, but we hired a sales pro, so I think that SEAT does have sales opportunities, and we are continuing to back our investment in Spain.</p>
          <p>And then you were asking about additional brands for us. You should never say never, but currently with our nine brands, we really believe we're well-positioned. The A00, the new small family, will be rounding things off at the bottom, covering additional niches, additional segments. So we don't think there's a need for additional brands. I also believe it would be wrong in today's day and age to purchase additional capacities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Denninghoff, you're next.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Albrecht Denninghoff, BF Bank. I have questions about three areas. First, can you say something about capacities, please, consolidated, and then worldwide, consolidated worldwide in the last three years, 2000 &#x2013; or five years, 2003 up to 2008? Then what do you think will be the case up to 2012? I am especially interested in the distinction between capacities you've increased as a result of increasing productivity, or are planning to do, and also to what extent have you actually made investment in these two five-year periods, or what investments are you planning to make in these capacities?</p>
          <p>Then I have a question about production adjustments. Could you give us some figures, please, about how many man days, working hours in the first quarter and in the first quarter &#x2013; fourth quarter last year, first quarter this year, were, let's say lost, or how much change has there been, for instance with time banking?</p>
          <p>And then third, you mentioned your quantitative objectives for your Strategy 2018, plus you underscored those compared to your competitor, Toyota, well that's when you mentioned these, and the profitability of that competitor that they can achieve has gone down. So, doesn't that mean that your return on sales is going to be lower than it was, perhaps, it looked in the last two years? Now if you don't have the right exchange rates backing you up, doesn't it mean that your original objectives are perhaps less realistic than you might have thought a couple years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to answer your question about our capacities in the last five years, says Dr. Heizmann. How they've developed in the past five years, well, we've had an increase of about 10% in the last five years. And this means there's been an increase in technical capacities, and also we've achieved increase as a result of optimization. I don't know exactly what the ratio is. I'd have to check that for you.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look farther into the future, well, currently we are planning to set up capacities because we'll have new factories in Russia, and in India, and the United States. In addition to that, in China too. In China, in particular, because of our two new plants, Nanjing from SVW and Chengdu from FAW Volkswagen.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we are constantly revising things based on the current market situation, and our revised market forecast. So, that we look at how we're going to expand these factories in particular in China. Then you asked about production adjustments in the last quarter; do you have those figures, Dr. Neumann?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dr. Neumann says, well, if we look at all of our working time measures and say that's 100, well, half of that was achieved by reducing work weeks from 35 to 30, and the other half was achieved, that is three-sixths were achieved &#x2013; well of the three-sixths, two-sixths were achieved. One-third was achieved by reducing the amount of time in time banking, and the last one-sixth, that is short time working.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. P&#xF6;tsch says, yes, then I'd like to tell you about our profitability objectives, the question about that and the competitor, Toyota, that you mentioned. Mr. Denninghoff, I'd like to say the following. We have not formalistically made Toyota's objectives on profitability to focal point of our strategy. We believed and do believe still that Toyota does certain things best and are therefore a benchmark in certain areas. And therefore, in some areas we've been gearing ourselves toward these benchmarks.</p>
          <p>We showed last year that even if the market is quite challenging, it's possible to achieve double-digit profitability. And therefore, we don't see any need at all to revise or cut our profitability objectives. I can say once again that our strategy is ambitious, and this ambitious strategy has to be financed, funded. To do that, and also to secure it against any fluctuations in the business cycle, the company as a whole has to be brought up to a higher profitability level. I think we did that quite well last year, and despite the difficult times, whether in terms of productivity, costs, or investments, even these current and difficult times, we will continue to make good progress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Denninghoff, let me add something to that, says Mr. Winterkorn, something that we are sticking to and not changing. In 2002, 2003, I came back to Audi, and we introduced the objective for return on investment, and in Salzburg we said that to our team for the first time, 18%. And a lot of people on our team said I was crazy. Last year, Audi achieved 18.9%. And I can tell you that if you have long-term objectives like that, you've got to stick to them, regardless of what's going on in the competitive environment.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mr. Breitsprecher, you're next.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Breitsprecher, Bankhaus Oppenheim. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, I'd like to ask about the results forecast, your guidance. For the first quarter you said, okay, you'll probably be showing a loss. At the same time, you said that you're cutting inventories, half of that will be done in the first quarter, and the other half will be done in the second quarter. Doesn't this mean, obviously, that in the second quarter, you will also be posting a loss?</p>
          <p>And my second question is for Professor Winterkorn. It's about the situation with your suppliers. In the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, maybe they can hang on, hold tight, maybe they have a little fat on their ribs, they can release cash from their working capital, but in the second and third quarters of this year, it might be a real catastrophe for your suppliers. And Toyota today stated that they expect that in the United States, basically 20% of their suppliers will be at an acute risk of survival. Doesn't that mean that in a couple quarters, Volkswagen might have to spend a whole lot of money in order to supply &#x2013; support their suppliers, inject some equity, give them loans, what's your estimation of the situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. P&#xF6;tsch begins. Well, let me briefly answer your first question first, your question about profit or development or profit or loss development per quarter. Let me just say this, you know that in the first quarter, well, it's not the best quarter of a year. The second quarter as a rule is better, and we believe that in the first quarter, we will have taken care of a number of things, which means that we do see a ray of hope for the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Breitsprecher, suppliers, says Dr. Winterkorn, we're looking at that intensively. Yes, there are certain risks. We are monitoring very closely what's going on, but I think Mr. Garcia can actually make the best statement about that subject.</p>

          <p>Mr. Garcia says, yes, that's true what you said. The cash situation really depends to a certain extent on our production figures, that's first. And secondly, our suppliers of course are called upon to take the necessary measures, measures which would allow them and us to come through the crisis together. We are telling suppliers that it wouldn't be acceptable for survival to be based on participation by OEMs. What we're doing is what Dr. Winterkorn said. We do have a critical and proactive risk management system that we've introduced. We're scanning the situation, risk situation at our suppliers' companies.</p>
          <p>And there is an opportunity in this situation too because well, the opportunity is to drive forward a certain consolidation in the markets, and Volkswagen, the Volkswagen Group, has stated that it is its objective to move forward, to drive this market consolidation and not be driven by the consolidation or shakeout. And that means that we don't think that we're going to have to take an equity share in our suppliers. Of course there's always a risk of insolvency, but you've had that in other years too. So far, so good.</p>

          <p>Okay, next question is Adam Hull.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, I've three questions. Adam Hull from Execution Limited. Firstly on Audi, if I look at the annual report, I notice the provisions there for what you call obligations from sales operations, up just on four billion. That's another 10% increase year-on-year, it's on top of 28% increase you saw last year. And these are quite big numbers. It's roughly double some of your closest competitors, and I think about 12% of your revenues. Could you just clarify what exactly is in there? Is there any particular changes going on within that, is it conservative accounting? Just give us a bit more of a feel for that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Latin America is clearly at the moment performing reasonably well. If you could give us some sort of feel for the margins there, is that a &#x2013; some of your competitors are talking about close to double-digit margins in Brazil. Just give us a feel, is this sort of close to 10%, just a bit more of a feel within particularly obviously VW brand there?</p>
          <p>And then finally, on working capital, you've talked a lot about Q1, Q2, but if we look at the full year, you had a &#x2013; last year you had 3.6 billion outflow. And is it feasible that you see clearly more than that coming back? Yes, inventories were overly high, but clearly the run rate at the moment is very different. Just to give us a feel maybe for the full year, given your broad expectations for markets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now on the first question, concerning the provisions in sales operations for Audi. Well, I might say, well actually you could have addressed the Group or other brands as well. But actually as a matter of principle what we adopt is a conservative, a careful, a prudent policy, which means of course that whenever the market conditions, and this is in fact what happened since mid of 2008, become much more difficult, when the going gets much tougher, then of course we are of the opinion that we must adopt a very careful approach. We must be cautious. And the balance sheet statement must be worded in a cautious manner, and this was done as a matter of principle for the whole Group, but also for Audi. And this is something that's reflected in some items and among others also in the provisions and the risk provisions for sales operations.</p>
          <p>In South America, well, first of all it is true. When the markets performs normally, if we have a normal market performance, then significant margins can be achieved. And these margins can certainly be up to 10%. So up to 10% margin can be achieved, but there as well I would like to say, and I leave this &#x2013; leave it to you, you can draw your own conclusions. In South America, we do not adopt a policy of cashing out on any situations.</p>
          <p>You know for yourself that in South America as well, we launched an entirely new car, a new Golf, and it's going to get a whole range of different derivatives. But we are investing in the quality and productivities there. Because we are very much convinced that this market as well is going to develop and reach world standards very soon, and then those manufacturers which adopted a different kind of corporate policy will definitely run into problems in this market. So we do not live at the expense of the future, no. We also heavily invest in Brazil and in Argentina and also in Mexico.</p>
          <p>For your third question about the development of the working capital, first of all let me make the following comment. There, of course, you also have to take into account once again, that due to initial consolidations &#x2013; or initial consolidations did have a certain influence on the working capital. And in fact we believe that a large part of the build up of the working capital in the year 2008 will exit from &#x2013; be recouped in 2009. We can get it back in 2009, particularly by reducing our stocks in inventories, not only for finished products by in the entire pipeline. Because all in all, we have to prepare our self for slightly lower volumes.</p>
          <p>And also in those areas which associated with rapid slump in the market, for instance production. So as a consequence working capital is naturally a pool for us, a pool from which we can reap or make positive contributions to our cash flow.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Are there any further questions from the floor? Ranjit, from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Unnithan, JPMorgan. My question is on the year-on-year profit walk you provided. So first question, your impact on revenues from volume prices and mix, if you add them together was about 2.4 billion, but the impact on operating profits was just 100 million positive. Why was that so low?</p>
          <p>Second, when you look out into '09 I know there's a lot of uncertainty among volume and currency rates, but how should we think about product cost. It was a one billion positive in '08, could it be a similar number in '09? And similarly on fixed costs and startup costs, 100 million positive in '08. How should we think about that in '09 because presumably on those two items you have greater visibility? And the last question is if currency rates stay at the level they are today, how should exchange rates impact the operating profit for '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, first of all, let me comment on the first question. Question as to how the effects from volume prices and mix related to sales revenues and the result on the operating profit, how all of these lines support each other. Now let me tell you, first of all, that with the price effect shown, for most of the price effect shown driven by inflation, most of these are inflation-related measures. Only very few of them are structural price measures. Most of the price measures shown are measures initiated to compensate for inflation.</p>
          <p>Let me give you an example. We certainly performed substantial price adjustments in South America because we have high level of inflation; in terms of the structure, inflation is quite high. So there's a positive effect in our sales revenue component, but no effect on the operating results or profit because the inflation-driven price measures were basically just relate to the cost increase in the sales revenue, which also results from inflation. It can only compensate for this effect, so on balance very little is left of it when all things are taken into account.</p>
          <p>The second point was a question about product cost effects in 2009. And you refer to the one billion, which we had achieved in 2008. Well, I think that in spite of the environment, which deteriorated significantly, we should be able to perform in more or less the same way. Our performance should reach more or less the same level, but you indicate part of the explanation when you go back in time a few more years, but it's clear that over the past few years on an average, on an average, this one billion was achieved over the past three years. And this was mainly due, or influenced by the efforts taken by Mr. Garcia in the Purchasing and Procurement Department.</p>
          <p>This already shows you, but this is going to become a bit more difficult naturally. We discussed the situation with our suppliers before and knowing what the situation they are, but our position is not so unfortunate because there are so many product innovations, and this means that we are really making progress in these areas. So, such a performance target of about one billion can definitely also be assumed for 2009 once again.</p>
          <p>Now for the fixed cost, I had also announced that the cost measures, which we conduct or the cost initiatives which we take, must show some kind of effect, and for the fixed cost as well I think there is a likelihood, an opportunity, that a positive contribution should result. It doesn't look so good for the exchange rates. You know that we &#x2013; I have good hedges, long-term hedges so that we have a nice and tidy basis for our calculations, but the underlying exchange rates will tend to deteriorate compared to the level in 2008. So, from exchange rates we expect a negative influence on our operating profit or result. I think this should answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just one more sentence, I would like to add concerning the product cost. Mr. Garcia, this is Mr. Winterkorn on, Mr. Garcia is this year handing out the orders for the Modular Longitudinal concept or platform. And even if there is a crisis out among our suppliers, this modular concept for which we have a large volume is something that everybody wants to share, and everybody wants to participate in it, and that's our big opportunity. Everybody wants to have a share in the modular system.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Thierry Huon. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Thierry Huon from Exane BNP Paribas. Just a simple question. It is mentioned in the annual report, and you said it earlier this morning that the Financial Services had a capital injections, I guess, from the parent. Could you specify the amount of this capital increase, and could you tell us what part of the cash of the Automotive part is lent to the Financial Services? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer your first question first. The capital increase I can say was up about 600 million for Financial Services, the injection. And then, question two. How much cash from the Automotive division is used by FS. There are many fluctuations in this amount, in these amounts, but let me reiterate. We support the fact that Financial Services is broadly independent and works at arm's length. Only if there are special developments in the marketplace such as in the middle of last year, would we help out to come up with a bridging solution for FS. I don't think it would make any sense at all to pay huge spreads, which, a couple weeks later would be much lower. At some point in time last year, the highest number was six to seven billion. But by the end of the year, this had been cut back down to about three billion.</p>

          <p>Next question, Mr. Raab, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael Raab, Kepler. Two questions. First of all, Professor Winterkorn, listening to your statements, we increasingly get the impression that in the future, the automotive industry in the future will focus much more on volumes, that will be decisive. What do you think is the critical mass in the automotive industry?</p>
          <p>Then question two, if you look at current market developments and listen to dealers in Germany in particular in the premium segment, you get the impression that one competitor in particular now is very aggressively using cash for selling. So, my question is to what extent you believe Audi will be able to get away from these very negative price effects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Professor Winterkorn says, the critical mass in terms of volume is hard to define. This of course depends on components used. Look at an instrument panel, if you make 500,000 of them or one million, you really won't make much of a profit on that, but if you try to use different assemblies, engines, transmissions, and achieve economies of scale there, effects are higher. Now, if you ask me what the critical mass is, critical size is for a carmaker, I'd like to say, my general feeling, well it shouldn't be any less than three million. Mr. Wittig?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Wittig says, I think at Audi, in the last few years in particular, our qualities have shown that they're in the premium segment, and this has had a positive effect on used car values, and this is a major substantial increase in long-term value, not just supported or subsidized.</p>
          <p>And therefore, I believe that the path we've taken is the right path to adopt. We're going to continue it, and with Audi we're not going to get into a price discounting war or a residual value competition that in other parts of the world has led to quite bitter experience. We're not going to do that. So I think with its current product policy, its current business policy, and with its current sales organization, Audi is on the right track, and we're going to stick to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Winterkorn says, one thing can definitely be felt right now, Audi is a part of this big Group, and we can feel it now. And for some engines and some transmissions and some suspension components, Audi really can benefit from leveraging the synergies of this Group. They're getting positive results from that, and therefore, I believe that Audi compared to their two main competitors, is in quite a good position.</p>
          <p>Okay, we've got time for one final question. Yes, go ahead, thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank Biller, Landesbank Baden-W&#xFC;rttemberg. I have two questions. One is about cost of materials, raw materials cost. In the fourth quarter in particular, we saw a major decline. In fact, you have hedged for certain raw materials for periods of up to five years. Can you tell us what your earnings effects were in the fourth quarter in particular, and what the situation will be in the current year, that is in terms of reductions of costs? And then interest results, five billion interest results last year, just 1.5 compared to one billion. Is that the result of Scania, or why is there this big increase from one billion to 1.5 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Garcia says, let me tell you about raw materials. Well, we haven't hedged for steel and petroleum-based raw materials for five years. We have one year or several year contracts depending. In 2007, there were drastically increased raw materials prices; this didn't hit us. That wasn't an additional one billion for product costs, we &#x2013; that went right over our heads because we hedged early, and now we have concluded contracts, which show that our raw materials developments this year will be stable; that's guaranteed.</p>
          <p>And over the long-term we expect a decrease for steel in particular when we get back to the level of early 2007. Right now we're moving towards a level of early 2008, right now for steel and compared to 2007, that was already higher. So that means, drastically over the long-term, we only expect to get positive results, if we get back to early 2007.</p>
          <p>For crude oil, you are right, crude oil that's down to a low. For crude oil we have very flexible contracts with our plastic suppliers who are dependent on crude oil. We've concluded very flexible contracts. And in the first quarter we already see that for certain products, there are price reductions because we've got flexible contracts, but more important though, is our logistic costs because this of course has an impact on our forwarding agents. And we also expect a reduction in logistics costs too.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. P&#xF6;tsch says, with regard to the last question and our interest earnings. You should take into account there that there were proceeds from sales included. So, it's not just purely interest earnings.</p>

          <p>Let me give you a housekeeping announcement, a technical announcement. Since many people are interested in going on a factory tour, we'll meet down below near the welcome desk at just before three, and we will begin the factory tour then.</p>
