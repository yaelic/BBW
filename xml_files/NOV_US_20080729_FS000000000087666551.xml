          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the National Oilwell Varco Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, July 29 of 2008.</p>
          <p>And at this time, I'd like to turn the presentation over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of National Oilwell Varco, Pete Miller. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andrew and good morning. Welcome to the National Oilwell Varco Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. I am Pete Miller, Chairman and CEO, and with me today on this call are Clay Williams, our Chief Financial Officer and Mark Reese, the President of our Rig Solutions Group.</p>
          <p>Earlier today we announced earnings of $421.7 million or $1.04 per share on revenues of $3.3 billion. Included in this were pre-tax charges of 40.7 million or $0.16 a share related to the Grant Prideco merger and a new tax charge due to the earnings repatriation that we made on some money from overseas. Excluding these charges net income from the period was $486 million or $1.20 a share.</p>
          <p>Clay will expand upon these numbers in a moment. But we're very pleased with the results we had both year-over-year and on a sequential basis. Additionally, today we announced record new capital equipment orders of $2.2 billion. We also shipped a record 1.34 billion from backlog this quarter but still ended with a $10.8 million backlog total.</p>
          <p>This backlog number is our traditional capital equipment number and does not include anything that came from the Grant Prideco acquisition, most specifically drill pipe. However, I will say the drill pipe backlog increased 19% since the end of the second quarter. We are extremely pleased with these numbers and we are also very pleased about the direction of the business in the future.</p>
          <p>At this point in time I'm going to ask Clay to give you a little bit of color on these numbers and I ask Mark to give you an overview of what we're seeing in the market place. But suffice it to say that we are excited about what we've accomplished but even more excited about what the future looks like. Clay?</p>

          <p>Great, thanks Pete. Before I begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2008, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates including but not limited to comments about our outlook for the company's business. These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>They are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. I refer you to the latest Form 10-K National Oilwell Varco has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business.</p>
          <p>Further information regarding these as well as supplemental financial and operating information may be found within our press release, on our website at www.nov.com or in our filings with the SEC.</p>
          <p>Later on in this call, Pete, <mark type="inaudible" /> Mark and I will answer your questions; we ask that you limit your questions to two in order to permit more participation.</p>
          <p>National Oilwell Varco generated earnings of $422 million or $1.04 per fully diluted share in its second quarter ended June 30, 2008 on revenues of $3.324 million. On April 21, we were pleased to close our acquisition of Grant Prideco for a combination of $3 billion in cash and the issuance of 56.9 million shares of NOV stock.</p>
          <p>As a result, during the second quarter National Oilwell Varco recognized transaction related charges totaling $62.5 million pre-tax or $0.10 per share after-tax and additional tax provisions associated with the financing the transaction, the $29 million or $0.07 per share.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we generated $7.2 million pre-tax or $0.01 per share after-tax in earnings from Grant Prideco operations that were later sold during the quarter. Excluding all these items, earnings were $1.20 per share reflecting very solid operational performance by National Oilwell Varco.</p>
          <p>Under GAAP purchase accounting, the company's financial statements include results only from the last 70 days of Grant Prideco operations in the second quarter, including additional prorated amortization and depreciation of 31.6 million, a step up to fair market value of Grant Prideco's assets and liabilities.</p>
          <p>In order to provide better comparability of operations on a quarterly basis, we've supplementally disclosed adjusted financial statements for the company by quarter starting from the first quarter of 2005 as if we had combined operations for all periods.</p>
          <p>Last quarter we informed you that Grant Prideco operations would be included in our existing Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies segment, and the supplemental disclosure in our press release and on our website depicts the combined adjusted results on this basis.</p>
          <p>Including the expected additional depreciation and amortization charges from Grant Prideco's stepped up balance sheet for fixed assets, intangible and reevaluation of liabilities for each period but do not include expected cost savings in periods before the merger, do not include the results of divested Grant Prideco businesses in any period and also do not include the amortization of inventory step up, which will transition out of the next couple of quarters and be reported separately within transaction costs.</p>
          <p>Later on, our comments on operations will discuss results on this combined adjusted basis, but first let me take on the number transaction items related to the transaction in Q2. Charges of $62.5 million in the second quarter consisted of costs associated with accelerated investing of options, financing fees, transaction costs related to Grant Prideco's previously agreed sale of portions of its Tubular Technology and Services segment to Vallourec and the amortization of inventory step up. We expect additional transaction cost of approximately $30 million in the third quarter and $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and stepped up inventories continue to roll out and we will continue to disclose these separately.</p>
          <p>The completion of the sale of the TTS businesses to Vallourec in Q2 brought in approximately $785 million in cash. This amount will be reduced later this year as we pay $270 million in tax on the gain. As I mentioned, these businesses generated a little over $7 million in operating profit in the quarter under National Oilwell Vallourec ownership before they were sold in June.</p>
          <p>The $29 million of additional tax provision I mentioned earlier was incurred due to our decision in the quarter to repatriate $194 million from overseas to pay down some of our revolver borrowings. And it drove our effected book tax rate up to 37.5% in Q2. We expect that most and perhaps all of this to be offset by foreign tax credit held by Grant Prideco prior to the merger, minimizing the cash impact.</p>
          <p>Excluding this additional tax provision, our rate was 33.2% in the quarter, inline with our expected tax rate going forward. During the second quarter we are pleased to settle some of the outstanding litigation Grant Prideco had related to its bit technology receiving net $127 million in settlements. These do not show up as a gain in the quarter but are instead booked into purchase accounting of Grant Prideco's assets. We will continue to vigorously pursue our claims against other infringing parties related to this important technology that our ReedHycalog business pioneered.</p>
          <p>Finally, our press release notes that we transferred certain NOV product lines out of our Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies segment at the beginning of the second quarter, which totaled about $98 million of revenue during Q2. Approximately 71 million of this was the movement of rig instrumentation product into the Rig Technology segment and a $27 million balance was the transfer of artificial lift and industrial products into the Distribution Services segment.</p>
          <p>These changes were made in accordance with FAS 131 to reflect realignment of management responsibilities following the Grant Prideco acquisition. Given the small amounts involved, we have not adjusted for this move in prior periods. The integration of Grant Prideco's operations has gone like clockwork. The chief savings of $6 million pre-tax during Q2 on overhead reductions and we expect this to increase to $9.7 million in each of the third and fourth quarters and to rise to approximately $11 million per quarter beginning in 2009 based on steps we've already taken.</p>
          <p>This will result in an annual savings rate slightly higher than the $40 million per year we expected when we announced the transaction last December. Most importantly the merger further strengthens NOV's position as a manufacture to the oil field, supplying the critical hardware, technologies and comprehensive service to oil and gas operations worldwide.</p>
          <p>We're pleased to welcome this vibrant, capable organization to the National Oilwell Varco family and we thank the Grant Prideco legacy employees for their hard work in helping put the new NOV together. You are doing a super job and we are grateful.</p>
          <p>On an overall adjusted combined basis, excluding the transaction related NOA, second quarter results were excellent. Consolidated revenues were $3.445 million, up 9% from Q1 and, up 21% year-over-year. Operating profit was $778 million, or 22.6% of sales, up 160 basis points from Q1 March. Operating profit flow-through or leverage was 40% sequentially and 30% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to specific segment operating results for Q2 on this adjusted combined basis. Rig Technology generated 1.9 billion in revenue and $506 million in operating profit in the second quarter, yielding an operating margin of 26.5%. Excluding the transfer of the instrumentation products from Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies, the group generated 33% flow-throughs on 15% revenue growth sequentially and 33% flow-throughs on 31% revenue growth year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Revenue out of backlog increased 18% sequentially to $1.337 million and reported non-backlog revenue increased 22%, due in part to the additional $71 million in instrumentation products revenues, all of which flow-through the non-backlog revenue.</p>
          <p>Excluding these additional instrumentation products revenues, our base rig aftermarket business surged 30% on higher spare parts sales, partially offset by lower sequential sales of small capital equipment that does not go into the backlog. Recall that in Q1 we had a very high level of handling tool sales that didn't repeat this quarter.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, our backlog for capital equipment sales from the Rig Technology segment stood at a record $10.8 billion due to a record level of orders of $2.216 million received during the quarter. Seven floating rig packages, surging demand for land rigs, both domestically and overseas, and steady demand for jack-up equipment fuelled the strong showing.</p>
          <p>Equipment for international markets was 91% and orders for offshore equipment totaled 87% of the total backlog at June 30. We expect revenue from backlog to continue to rise, and as of June 30, the scheduled outflow of revenue from backlog is expected to be a little over $3 billion for the remainder of 2008, about $5 billion in 2009 and nearly $3 billion balance thereafter.</p>
          <p>Our Rig Technology segment continues to wrestle with rising costs, particularly steel, utilities, logistics and foreign currency related costs. But our efficiency initiatives such as quick-response manufacturing and broader outsourcing, our wide manufacturing footprints and modest price improvements are helping us maintain margins which have remained stable on newly won projects.</p>
          <p>In a moment Mark will share more color on our execution and outlook for Rig Technology. But overall looking forward into Q3, we expect modest growth in revenue and comparable margins to Q2.</p>
          <p>Our Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies segment generated revenues of $1.244 billion in Q2, down $69 million from Q1, including a full-quarter contribution from continuing Grant Prideco operations in both quarters. However, excluding the $98 million in products transferred out on April 1st, revenues were up about 2% sequentially at 23% leverage, and revenues increased 10% year-over-year at 20% leverage.</p>
          <p>Our Services businesses in Canada saw revenues in operating profit decline from the first quarter to the second due to the annual spring break-up there this year, with revenues dropping $59 million at high leverage from Q1 to Q2. Spring break-up occurs every year in Canada, and is a result of transport restrictions on heavy rig movements by the authorities to prevent damage to roads during the spring thaw.</p>
          <p>Activity and outlook in Canada are both rising following the lifting of these bans several weeks ago. Fortunately, this seasonal Canadian decline was offset by strong results overall in most of our other businesses. Drill pipe sales posted sharply higher margins owing to favorable mix improvements in the types of pipe sold, with premium and large diameter drill pipe rising to 48% and 39% of the mix respectively.</p>
          <p>We contend that the large premium segment of drill pipe sales will continue to grow as oil and gas companies push complex well-path designs beyond the torque and tensile strength capabilities of standard API pipe designs. And NOV is well positioned to capitalize on steadily increasing usage of premium drill pipe in horizontal, directional, and extended-reach growing programs.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, drill pipe revenue fell slightly due to shipping vessel delays and disruptions caused by the earthquake in China. Although we do not intend to report drill pipe backlog in future periods, I will nevertheless point out that backlog for drill pipe increased 19% sequentially from Q1 to Q2, the first increase since 2006, as orders surged 85% sequentially with strong North American land contractor &#x2013; with North American land contractors reentering the market and new build rigs ordering pipe. Integration of Grant Prideco's drill pipe businesses is going well, and we are rolling out new drill pipe tracking products and expanding OEM repair and maintenance offerings through NOV's worldwide pipe service operations.</p>
          <p>ReedHycalog bit business acquired with Grant Prideco also performed well in Q2 despite a sharp downturn in Canada related to breakup. Revenues increased 4% at solid flow-throughs on higher sales in Latin America, Europe, Russia, and the Far East. The inter-gauge business also acquired with Grant Prideco delivered a record quarter, and the integration of this business with NOV's leading downhole tools business is proceeding well.</p>
          <p>As part of the integration, we are consolidating a number of sales facilities worldwide and leveraging our combined manufacturing capabilities and capacities to improve lead times and reduce costs. Addition of Grant Prideco's bits and downhole products to NOV's offering of drilling motors, monels, jars, and shock tools completes an impressive, comprehensive package of bottom-hole assembly hardware, making us a one-stop shop for critical iron needed to drill complex well paths, and we are now exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on continued growth in horizontal directional and extended reach drilling.</p>
          <p>Our other Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies businesses continued to execute well in the quarter and benefited from rising activity associated with shale gas plays in the U.S. and steadily rising activity overseas. Increased rig construction and reactivations are fueling demand for the pumps and liners from Mission and solids control and waste management technologies from Brand.</p>
          <p>Tuboscope is benefiting from sharply higher mill and processor activity in response to type OCTG inventories and higher pricing, and expansion of its drill pipe repair and maintenance operations. Overseas demand for fiberglass pipe for large projects began to increase during the quarter, and demand for drilling motors, non-mag drill collars, and fishing tools in the Middle East continued to push higher following the opening of our new facility in Dubai late last year.  Waste management demand in the North Sea and U.S. land also picked up nicely in the Q2.</p>
          <p>Inflationary pressures, particularly steel, labor and fuel, continue to pressure the business. The recent price increases, most in the mid or high single-digit range, and a relentless focus on efficiency had generally been able to hold margins. For Q3 we expect mid-single digit revenue growth at solid flow-throughs as we emerge out of Canadian break-up and continue to benefit from rising drilling activity.</p>
          <p>Our Distribution Services segment revenues of $426 million were up 16% from the first quarter.  Excluding the transfer of artificial lift and industrial products from Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies, revenues increased 9% sequentially at strong flow-throughs. Operating profit was $24.8 million or 5.8% of sales. U.S. revenues ascended to record levels, fueled by high demand for operating supplies by rigs moving into emerging shale plays. Service companies and oil and gas operators also increased consumption of MRO supplies in the face of higher service activity and high commodity prices during Q2. And margins improved sharply on line pipe sales this quarter.</p>
          <p>While bidding pressures remain fierce in many mature regions, pricing pressures appear to be abating in new high-growth domestic areas. Canada declined overall due to breakup, but the business there benefited from cost cutting initiatives executed in prior quarters and rising demand in southeast Saskatchewan and high shale activity in British Columbia which drove better than expected results.</p>
          <p>International sales improved as a number of overseas locations opened up over the past few quarters began to gain traction, notably in the Middle East, Africa and Norway. A large valve project into the Far East also contributed to strong results as did high cable sales into international offshore rig ups.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter the Distribution Services segment expects to open a handful of new locations to improve coverage of the emerging shale plays across the U.S. and to continue to expand overseas including, supporting very high levels of interest by drilling contractors for stores on new build offshore rigs. The group currently has three stores physically located on offshore rig staffed by NOV personnel.</p>
          <p>Third quarter Distribution Services revenues are expected to increase in high single digit range at very solid flow-throughs. Turning back to National Oilwell Varco's consolidated second quarter income statement, interest expense increased $14.2 million and interest income decreased 5.2 million as a result of borrowing to finance the Grant Prideco acquisition and lower cash balances.</p>
          <p>Debt swung lightly as we drew down $2.1 billion on new revolver to finance the acquisition in April, then repaid most of the borrowings from cash flows out of operations during the quarter and from proceeds from the sale of the TTS business to sold later in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Other expense swung from a credit in the first quarter to a debit of $14.6 million in Q2 due to FX movements on Grant Prideco and Norwegian NOV businesses and much higher bank fees associated with letters of credit issued to bank cash down payments to National Oilwell Varco by drilling contractors for new rig orders.</p>
          <p>Equity income from our voestalpine joint venture increased slightly to $70.1 million and we expect some result in Q3. This is the joint venture that supplies green tubes to seamless pipe used in our drill pipe manufacturing business that came in with the acquisition. Weighted average fully diluted share is outstanding of 404 million shares represent the partial quarter impact to the shares issued for consideration to Grant Prideco shareholders and we expect the full quarter of Q3 amount to be approximately 420 million shares.</p>
          <p>On allocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segments schedule, which is pro forma for the Grant Prideco acquisition in all periods, the $49.7 million is down $22.1 million sequentially. This item benefited from overhead costs savings coming out of the Grant Prideco merger of about $6 million, the turnaround of pipe payroll taxes paid in Q1 on incentive compensation by both organizations and net lower profit eliminations on intercompany sales between segments.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization was $106.4 million in Q1, up $44.9 million sequentially due to the affect of the acquisition. We expect total Q3 consolidated National Oilwell Varco depreciation and amortization to be in the range of $120 million, excluding inventory step up amortization. Q2 amortization of inventory step up of $46.1 million is not included in DD&amp;A on the supplemental EBITDA schedule, but is rather included as part of the transaction costs reported on the line below.</p>
          <p>Our June 30, 2008 balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $2.3 billion, up $485 million sequentially due to the acquisition. Working capital excluding cash and debt was about 17% of annualized revenue generally consistent with recent prior quarters. Cash flow from operations was a record $753 million in the second quarter and leveraged cash flow was $528 million. Customer prepayments and billings in excess of cost a measure of customer financing of our working capital needs increased $524 million to over $2.6 billion. This contributed greatly to the company's strong cash generation in Q2. It will be reinvested in inventory abroad as we execute our large rig construction backlog.</p>
          <p>CapEx was $106 million in the second quarter and we expect it will continue to rise quarterly and little over $400 million for the full-year. Our cash balance was $1.6 billion down 487 from the first quarter and our debt totaled 1.7 billion as of June 30, up about $1 billion from the prior quarter. Now these corporate credit ratings was raised by both major rating agencies during the second quarter in view of our strong financial condition.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn it over to Mark for his comments. Mark?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Clay. Good morning. Over the last quarter, our overall inquiry and quoting activity has remained brisk for all product lines in rig categories with new land rig inquiries rapidly increasing. As a whole, we're seeing very little softening across any of our product segments.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the overview of our three major rig categories. To start with floaters, inquires for both our drillships and semis remain very high with a tremendous amount of emphasis they have put on the assets needed to meet Brazil's growth strategies. Other areas driving this demand are deepwater Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Central Asia. Jack-up inquires and orders remain very stable with demand being driven by many of the shallower plays such as Persian Gulf, the North Sea and Asia.</p>
          <p>Land packages, as you probably are aware, the land market has made an about-face since the first of the year. Specifically in North America. We started this year believing that the new rig and refurb activity in North America was going to be somewhat lighter than we've seen in 2007.</p>
          <p>However, beginning in Q1 that made a quick switch and going into Q2. We've since increased our forecast program for IDEAL, Rapid and our newly designed Drake rig. This demand is really being driven by the increase in oil and gas prices, with the majority of the rigs destined for the Bakken, Haynesville and the Marcellus plays.</p>
          <p>Moving onto the Middle East and North Africa, we're really excited about these areas. Inquiries on orders are very active for our traditional 1,500 horsepower IDEAL rigs, but we are also seeing more inquiries for our testing design, higher horsepower rigs with desert moving systems, and high ambient temperature packages.</p>
          <p>Our MD Totco organization has also received very positive feedback from the contractors in this area, for them expand their instrumentation and monitoring services.</p>
          <p>Moving onto Russia, this is a mark that holds a lot of opportunity for NOV and our drilling technology. There is a tremendous demand for our higher technology drilling equipment that has a proven track record in drilling and safety performance. We estimate a potential of between 200 and 250 land rigs for this market over the next five years. Most of the applications are to be driven and end up in North Central Russia.</p>
          <p>We are always looking at expanding our global footprint so we can better serve our customers. A few of the expansions that you should expect to see over the next 12 months starting in Russia. We are working on plans to expand our land manufacturing business and service capabilities, the services growing market. Our current plans are to have this facility up and operational sometime in the first half of 2009. Middle East is another area that we are looking at with a growing demand for these land rigs in this region. We're in the process of expanding our current rig up capabilities to extend to a four-rig path rig up facility. This expansion will be fully operational in Q2 of 2009.</p>
          <p>And moving back to the States, up in the Northeast with all the activity planned for this area, we are working on our final details for the new rig up facility and service facility to support the projected growth in the Marcellus Shale. This facility will be located in the area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and will house other NOV operations, so we can better service our customer base in that area.</p>
          <p>In June, we held an Executive Open House for our Houston-based technical college. This facility is the second that we have opened over the last year, with the first being located in Kristiansand, Norway. Third is targeted for Singapore in 2009. These facilities are designed to deliver over 700 trained INC and service engineers into the market over the next 12 months. As everyone is well aware, for decades our industry has under invested in developing trained and experienced personnel. My thanks to go to NOV's Board and Mr. Miller for making this tremendous investment in our people and our industry's future.</p>
          <p>These colleges are staffed with professional educators and state-of-the-art simulators and learning tools. There are three core curriculums, mechanical, electrical and controls and the students will not only receive classroom time but they work alongside with experienced servicing engineers getting hands-on experience.</p>
          <p>NOV has always been committed to train our employees, it has also made a very large investment to train our customers. In 2007 we ran over 2,000 customers through our training facilities. In 2008, we are forecasting to almost double that number. We are also introducing our new NOV mobile training unit which is really a 50-foot school and take this trailer straight to our customers' location or to well sites and we can actually train the crews on the equipment that they are going to run that day. It's been a very successful tool for us as well as for our customers.</p>
          <p>I would like to take this opportunity as well to announce our intention to open up another technical college in Macae, Brazil. This investment will be designed to train our customers' personnel and safe and efficient operations and that of the equipment. We do believe this investment will create a huge enabler not only for our customers but for the local workforce to operate the large inventory of NOV equipment either currently operating or under construction for Brazilian waters. As always, NOV continues to lead the charge in bringing new technologies into the drilling. Our design criteria is deliver safer, lighter and higher performing products for our global customers.</p>
          <p>I'll give you a quick update on where we are at with some of the recent developments. Our TDX-1250 top drive. These shipped or have on order 10 of these new revolutionary top drives. This technology delivers an industry-leading 105,000 foot pounds of continuous torque, very compact and easily maintained package. First 1250 FAT took place in Q1 in our Orange California facility and the FAT exceeded everyone's expectations. The next product is our CRT 350, this casing running tool has a tremendous market acceptance and is designed to deliver our customers safer and faster casing operations.</p>
          <p>As of this call we have either shipped or have on order over 85 with this CRT 350s. As I mentioned earlier, our newest product is the Drake rig. This rig was designed specifically to accommodate the tight road restrictions and small locations our land contractors are experiencing. Drake rig is a 1,000 horsepower rig with a three-piece telescoping mask, and a rugged design that can accommodate some of the harsh terrains these rigs are going to see as well can also accommodate a moving system from path drilling design.</p>
          <p>Looking into the future, as in the past our biggest challenge is execution. Going forward we are going to continue to execute. I'm very comfortable of our ability to deliver on our commitments. But there are always going to be bumps in the road. We currently have over 600 INC and service engineers working in 13 shipyards around the globe. To date we've commissioned and delivered 29 drilling packages by working extremely close with the shipyards, contractors and vendors.</p>
          <p>NOV has not impacted the delivery of any of these vessels. Before I turn the call over to Pete, I want to personally thank the hard-working people of NOV for their commitment to making this happen. We have the best people in the industry and day in and day out they deliver on their commitments. As well, I would like to thank the thousands of vendors that support NOV around the globe. Pete?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mark. And at this point I'd like to just kind of summarize on a few things and talk about a few things we have in place. But the reality of the business today it's about the shale plays, it's about deep water, and it's about continuing to retool this business. Technology and efficiency wins. We are able to provide the products and services that people need to be able to win this. I think the shale plays are going to be exciting all throughout the U.S. and quite frankly the world. If you think that the shales are only in the Marcellus and the Haynesville and not in Argentina and Russia and other places, you are wrong. They are all over and the technology that we learn there is going to be expanded. And again, I can't emphasis enough the retooling of the fleet, the best rig wins I think that's pretty indicative as you look throughout the United States, we're prepared to make sure that we take care of this.</p>
          <p>I would like to talk about a couple of initiatives that we have in place in our PS&amp;S group, For instance in our &#x2013; what we are utilizing the same sort of business model that we utilize in drilling. When you looked at what we did when we started building this company 10 years ago, it was really to integrate the package to make things easier on our customers.</p>
          <p>Today when you look at Tuboscope and Grant Prideco, we're really starting to integrate a pipe management system. We call this the Leon system and what this enables you to do is you can engineer, manufacture coat, inspect, reface, rethread and monitor that pipe all through the life of the pipe, and the interesting thing is we are able to take some of the electronics that we learned in the drilling side with NV Totco, with our V-Isis system, and things like that and be able to monitor this pipe. And I think it really has an opportunity to revolutionize the way the people are able to use drill pipe. In our brand operations we've recently acquired a company that we call portable power that not only enables us to take a lot of the brand equipment out into the field but also be able to use this portable power to be able to power it up and do it much more efficiently than just depending on the rig and interestingly enough a lot of this portable power has really cool emissions control and noise pollution, things that you are going to need as you are drilling these shales in the towns of Freeport, Fort Worth and other places around the world.</p>
          <p>So we think these are the sorts of initiatives that we are on that are really pretty exciting. If you look at downhole tools, today we can provide the bits, the motors, the shock subs, stabilizers, the monel collar, the andergauge openers. We can do these things and provide our customers with this hardware that works just seamlessly, and oh by the way we also have a really cool product called IntelliServe which we think we are going to be able to really develop over the years to be able to take that information that comes from all this and ratchets it to surface at about 10,000 times the speed with which it's done today.</p>
          <p>So these are the kind of things that are going bode very well for technology of this industry and I think position ourselves to take advantage of it.</p>
          <p>And finally in our Distribution business, we're using the same sort of business model. As Clay pointed out earlier, we are integrating, we're putting rig stores on these drilling rigs we are taking inventory away from our customers, reducing their total cost of ownership, taking care and ensuring that we have got the products and the services in place, when you look at the number of these deepwater rigs that going out and the types of rig stores we're putting on these we think it's a really, really cool business that's going to expand well into the future. So we are excited about where we're going. but it takes good people.</p>
          <p>And I want to make one mention of one thing that we've done over the years and this is our next-generation program. And just to kind of to give you an example of how this works, we just hired our next-gen nine program. We have eight prior to that and the folks that are in our company today are doing great business and great work and they are providing great leadership. And you look today, we just recruited 50 people and to give you an example of how this worked out, 16 came from the U.S., five from Canada, six from the Middle East, five from Singapore, two from Norway, five from China, five from Latin American, two from Russia and four from the U.K. They are all college grads from many disciplines and this is the type of program that's building us for the future. A lot of companies just try to hire away and move around, we want to build from within. We think that's extremely important and we think it's going to dictate what happens in this company for the next 20 years.</p>
          <p>So I would also like to echo Clay and Mark and thank the 36,000 employees in this company for the great job they're doing, welcome to Grant Prideco people who I think is a wonderful company, and we are very bullish needless to say on where we're going into the future. So at this point Andrew, I would like to open it up to any questions that our listeners might have.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question will come from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Hi Bill, how are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm well. Thank you, Pete. I think I heard Clay mention that you guys had seven floater packages in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Bill, this is Mark. We had five drill ships and two semis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Along those lines can you share with us what the average order size was per package and what that represents with respect to a percentage increase over where you might have garnered a similar order last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, we're staying fairly stable on our margins. Only increases that we've passed through to the customers are sitting on inflationary issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And these packages are tough to nail down a specific price, it'll range anywhere from 290 million on a drill ship to a 150 to 180 million on a semi, it depends on the configuration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then the follow-up question is with respect to the North American land rig business and the explosion being driven by the shale plays. What in the second quarter, what was the percentage improvement in your North American land rig business versus Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead Clay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our backlog jumped up about third, actually over a third in Q1 to Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But Bill I also might point out that a lot of the explosion in the land business has not hit this backlog. We are dealing with a lot of different things like write down of course, as we always point out the backlog cuts off at 1st of July.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And a lot of things that we've done. I mean it's for one month into the quarter and quite frankly its pretty good month. And so a lot of things that are coming out of the explosion there &#x2013; the first part of that, it started kind of when the Haynesville shale was announced. And so there is a lot of activity in May and June but it isn't going to manifest itself into orders necessarily until the third quarter. But it's pretty exciting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Pete, with respect to the crystal ball business here for a second. Could you venture a prophecy as to the number of U.S. land rigs that you expect to see built over the next, call it two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'll do Bill is I will call attention to Clay's disclaimer on future observations. But I &#x2013; I tell you what, I think that natural gas in the next administration is going to be looked upon as very much of a very viable alternative to many of the energy issues we're facing today. And I would not be surprised to see the rig count in the United States and especially when you see things like the Marcellus come into play and I have actually said this on record before, 22, 2,300 rigs working in the United States does not surprise me at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. Thank you very much guys.</p>

          <p>Thanks Bill.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a bit of a follow-up to the previous question. You mentioned the five drill ships and two semis ordered during the quarter. There was close to 30 new bills in general offshore I guess awarded during the quarter. Can you give us a sense Pete on how many we are still quoting here for potential third quarter orders for NOV?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will say this, I think one thing we will point out that there has been a lot of talk about Brazil. Brazil is not in here. We don't have, there's a lot of things that are going on in Brazil and I think they'll manifest themselves in the future. But a lot of the &#x2013; we pretty much have established, Bill, that we don't put anything into backlog until we've got a solid contract, and in many cases a down payment. We don't put notional things in a backlog, we don't put LOIs in a backlog.</p>
          <p>And so I think what you're going to see is there's still an extreme amount of business that's out there, and I think well as we go through the next couple of quarters, you're going to see some nice orders that come in. I mean I think that they'll start to &#x2013; look, many of the things you have heard about Brazil, because people announce things early. That doesn't necessarily mean they get ordered early, because you have got to do a lot of engineering, you have got to do a lot of things there that prepare for it, but rest assured, we're bullish.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so no Brazil floaters at all in the second quarter backlog?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my follow up. Clay, could you be a little more specific as it relates to the flow-throughs that you are expecting in the third quarter in the PSS segment? I know you said solid, but just trying to get a sense of what you are thinking there more actually...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Historically this business has been around 30% is kind of our long-term guidance. We fall a little short of that this quarter on a pro forma basis excluding all the noise. We had some items this quarter that kind of flowed through, and none of these are terribly material but you expect them to turn around. We had some labor pressures in South America and some inflationary pressures, and what we began to see in the second quarter was price movements within many of these businesses that will offset this going forward. So I think they will help the leverage going forward.</p>
          <p>Additionally of course, Q2 &#x2013; the thing that really impacts the Petroleum Services and Supplies group in Q2 is Canada break-up. In an aggregate, our PS&amp;S businesses declined $59 million in Canada, and that typically declines at very high decrementals. So in Q3, what we typically see is Canada starting to bounce back, usually not as strong as Q1 but when Canada comes back, it comes back with pretty high incrementals on the increase in revenue coming out of the Canadian break-up. So we think Q3 will, very likely going to be higher than our kind of 30% incremental flow-through bar as we see Canada bounce back, and also as we see the turnaround of the number of &#x2013; couple of unusual items that impacted Q2.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Robin Shoemaker with Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about the aftermarket business a little bit here. I think previously you had indicated at some point you might be able to give us an idea of what kind of aftermarket revenues you expect from a drill ship, a semi, a jackup of the generation that you're building now, and so that's really my first question, if you have an idea there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know, Robin, I will tell you what, the first big drill ship that went out was the DrillMAX for Stena. And it went out at the beginning of the year, and it hasn't had any downtime yet. And so we haven't had to ship that many spare parts to it, which we're pretty astounded by because it's actually one of the most complex rigs that we've seen. So if that's an indicator, gosh it might be a whole a lot less than I thought. But having said that, we're excited the way that that ship's run, but we really don't have, I think, a very good indicator yet. I will say this, though.  As you've seen in the, you look at the numbers that we have this quarter, you can see that we did ship a lot more spares.  Those are probably for more existing rigs that are on pretty significant day rates, and we have been moving things out pretty dramatically. But we're very pleased with way these new rigs are running, so I'm going to beg off that question for about another quarter or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the packages that you're building, possibly for deepwater rigs going to Brazil, assume those would be large, kind of full packages, most likely as part of a turnkey rig construction program. And would that include also, would you be bidding drill pipe as part of that package?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If that's something that the customer wants us to supply, we certainly will. It's two different pieces of equipment, and it's nice having Grant Prideco in our organization, it's a terrific product to pass on to our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's a product that's fungible.  But we certainly would be amenable to giving a little bit of a price break if they wanted to throw in a few things like that, we would offer a carrot or two. So but I think if you want the best equipment, you're going to want the best drill pipe, and the best drill pipe is Grant Prideco, so I think we'd feel pretty comfortable they'd be buying that, too.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Pete, you're certainly excited about the future, just trying to pin you down a little bit, are you willing to say that orders for rig tech are going above the $2.2 billion level as we go forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, if I ever said that, my General Counsel would be in here and smack me around for an hour and half. Let's just say I'm bullish. We, historically we haven't given guidance on this, we've just said that we feel real confident that things are looking pretty good. If you look back over the last four or five quarters, we've said we feel pretty good. I think Robin Shoemaker was on just a minute before you, and he always asks me if I think that quotations are still robust and I would say they are still robust.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; but the real problem, Doug, too, and I want to make sure we emphasize this, we cut all of our backlog off in a date certain.  And, for instance we cut this off at first of July, or really the 30th of June, and we've had orders that came in the second, third of July. Well quite honestly that doesn't bother us if they come in two days late, but it does bother the fact that that might make the backlog a little bit bigger. So by doing that, it's hard to &#x2013; these projects, a lot of them, are complex, they don't come to pass in just a matter of days.  You go around through iterations, you have to tender offers, you have to go back in and retender, and so it's difficult to say that it in any 90-day period these orders are going to come in.</p>
          <p>I will tell you this: we've said before, kind of look at backlog over the last nine months and it's been very, very robust, and I think that you'll continue to see backlog over the next foreseeable future be very good. So that's a long-winded way of saying I'm not going to tell you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask it this way, in a way that you have responded in the past. Have you signed any deepwater rig orders so far in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No number though?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is your next number, how many?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask a question of Clay. Certainly been talking about the input inflation, the cost inflation that you're seeing in the business. Margins were up on a pro forma basis. Is it fair to say that that's almost entirely related to efficiencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't &#x2013; Doug, I don't think we are getting a lot of price-driven margin expansion. We are probably getting a little volume leverage. So as we are doing more, as we're doing repeat orders on many of these big rig packages in particular, we are able to &#x2013; you just scale the learning curve. When you build the first kind of rig-design you learn a lot, and I think we've got an organization that's very good at capturing the lessons learned and applying them to version number two of the same rig design, and version number three.  And you're starting to see multiple offshore rigs built on the same design and efficiencies that fall out of that. And then in addition too, we talked a lot about this in preceding quarterly conference calls, we've been pushing a lot on working smarter on quick response manufacturing. Mark mentioned a number of new facilities that we &#x2013; he plans on opening, he is also &#x2013; we've opened up a couple of others here in the past several quarters that are contributing to the improvement. We made sort of rifle shot investments in new machine tools, it is overall it's a kind of combined effort of all that but I do think overall it's more efficiency driven than price driven.</p>

          <p>Good morning Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So, easy question first. Distribution in the past play, you guys are kind of suggested a 11% kind of incremental flow-throughs whatever terminology you want to use. Seems like business is gaining momentum there again. Is it quite possible that we will be on track for that 11% incremental kind in the back half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Actually we got it towards 10% curve but kind of in that range. Of course you get in any two periods you get FX and mix issues and all that sort of stuff. But, if you kind of take a long-term view of distribution it's typically had 10% flow-throughs. I think that's probably what we are expecting in Q3, Q4 this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then, we've led very, very rapid turnaround in the North American businesses that you guys have referenced so far this year. Got up to 13 box gas now we are under nine, so is it quite possible that things could slow down as rapidly as they picked up? What's your general stands on the sensitivities around some of these programs related to 8 or $9 gas. Pete, do you want to take crack at that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Kurt, I'll go ahead and take that. This is Mark. We really haven't seen any slow down or enthusiasm lightening up on the rig side. I think a lot of the energy that we are seen in Haynesville is going to carry through. I can't speak to the economics of the oil companies but we certainly haven't seen anybody blink on their desire to move forward to fly out these rig packages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Kurt I'd add to that &#x2013; we still come back to the retooling thesis. I think there's cash out there today and lot of these rigs are being designed specifically for the shale plays and there is rigs that are sitting out there, that can't do these shale plays. And I think if you look at some of the drilling contractors that invested heavily in new technology, they are winning the game. And so I think you're finding guys that are coming back in and saying, we are going to invest in new technology and I think that even if you saw a decrease in the price of natural gas, you are still going to see the shale plays being drilled and you're still going to see the demand for these new rigs. So we think there really is a retooling and you're going to see some bricks on the downside retired a little bit. So we think it's going to stay pretty robust.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And Pete, you referenced in the past &#x2013; we, I think, understand the evolution here, progression of deepwater and land. On the jack-up market you referenced that every time a slot opens up it's going to get filled. Are you still seeing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. I think over the last couple of quarters. I can draw the numbers to &#x2013; and I think I'm still a little bit ahead of the game. I think last quarter there was like four, five delivered, I think there were six orders. And I think that you're going to continue see that. The jack-up business is not dissimilar in many cases to the land businesses, you're seeing some retooling. The ability of these jack-ups to be able to drill more efficiently. I mean, I think everybody read the article last week about MacMoRan re-entering one of those deep shelf wells that Exxon had passed up on and while those are in shallow water, those still take a rig that could drill to 30,000-some feet. And so that demand for these high-performance, efficient jack-ups, I think, will continue and as they come out of the shipyard they are going to work and they are going to work at pretty good day rate. So we think that's pretty indicative of the fact that they're going to remain a good business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Despite all the jack-ups deliveries here recently here, Kurt, 82% of the existing fleet is still more than 20 years old, this is a &#x2013; worldwide, the jack-up fleet is pretty old.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Marshall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'm looking here at your backlog driven revenues and I think most people perceive you as a backlog-driven company, but it appears by my math only about 40% of your revenues actually came out of backlog. So and that the ratio that percentage seems to be going down probably because of the Grant Prideco acquisition. Help me to understand going forward the growth that you anticipate in the backlog-driven revenue and profit side versus the rest of the business which appears to be 60% of your revenue base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think the outlook for continued revenue growth out of backlog is very bright for the reasons I think we just covered, Marshall, a combination of retooling land rig fleets, retooling the jack-up fleet and then building out brand-new deepwater capabilities for drilling where there was none before and packages for kind of all three of those buckets flow into the backlog. And frankly I think if you look back over the last few years, I think that retooling and secular build out of the deep water fleet really started in earnest about three years ago.  2005 kind of kicked off that phase of this industry, and we think that it's going to be bright for years to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we also, and to add to what Clay is saying, we are also positioning ourselves to really increase the size of that non-backlog too.  Because I think it comes back to supporting these rigs as they go out, but even more importantly, when you look at the business model that we are offering up on things like drill pipe management and downhole tools and distribution, we think both of those, or all three of those, are really going to increase dramatically with what we're able to do with these deep water rigs.</p>
          <p>Our Brand operations are going to be very effective on the deep water rigs. So we think we're going to get a double whammy: not only do we get to build these rigs, but we also get to support these rigs with the many different support elements and the manufactured products that we have that will continue into the future. So, we know a lot of people track that backlog, but I think the other very, very important element of what we do is the rest of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that was my point.  It seems like the non-backlog, at least recently, has been grown faster than the backlog. So does that continue, you're kind of looking at growing kind of at a similar rate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could actually see the non-backlog business growing even more dramatically.  We've got an interesting position out here. We sell to everybody.  There is very few people in the industry that sell absolutely to everybody.  But I don't care if you're Schlumberger, if you're Exxon, if you're Conoco, if you're the drilling contractors or if you're Halliburton, we sell to everybody. And a lot of the reason for that is our business model, is we want to produce the tools and the services to take care of those tools, that can take care of our customers. But we're not going to compete directly with them in what they do. Schlumberger is a great data acquisition company.  We want to provide the tools for them to acquire that data.  And so as they grow in that we think we're going to be growing along because we can provide those, plus we have the worldwide footprint to take care of that. So we think it's a great story, and it's probably the story that's littlest known about us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. A follow-up Clay, just a quick one for you. I'm just a dumb engineer and earlier in the call you were talking about the stepped up inventories rolling out; I didn't hear it all. Walk me through what's going on there I guess you're saying things are going to improve because of the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's a good question Marshall. Under purchase accounting we had to write up the value of Grant Prideco inventory as of the date that we close the acquisition, April 21st. So there is a certain amount of purchase price that's allocated into inventory. And then as those inventories turn around and flow out as revenue, we relieve that step-up. So what you're seeing there is a kind of the normal turn of that Grant Prideco inventory out the door as revenue, and we're &#x2013; to make our financial results more comparable, period to period to period, and not be obscured by that purchase accounting complexity, we're reporting that separately as transaction cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I assume that rolls out over pretty short &#x2013; two quarters, three quarters, that you get that done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in fact I gave a little guidance in my commentary; in Q3, it will be in the range of 30 million in Q4, 16 million, and then probably down to zero or close to zero by the beginning of 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir. We have time for one last question, and that final question will come from the line of Dan Pickering with Tudor Pickering &amp; Holt. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize if this question has been asked. I had a little bit of trouble with the call. Pete, we're seeing some of your bit competitors, notably Smith, getting involved in the directional side of the business. Is that something that NOV considers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We are going to provide the tools for that, Dan, and I think that it's important that we do that. We have the world's largest fleet of downhole motors and I think with our bits and ReedHycalog, with what we do with monel collars, we are going to supply those to the Halliburtons, to the Weatherfords, to the Schlumbergers of the world, and even quite often to the Smiths on the override.</p>
          <p>And we believe that being the manufacturer of that, and having the capability to service those tools and to take care of our customers, puts us on a much better position to prosper. I quite frankly don't especially like the prospect of going directly up against Schlumberger, they are a very big company. But they are also a heck of a customer, and so our business model is to be the provider and the supporter of these tools, but to leave the directional drilling business itself to our customers. Plus it gives us a lot more customers out there, because why you've got the big four, you've also got all kinds of smaller directional drilling companies that come to us for the support. So we think it's a much better business model for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. Okay, thanks. And then Clay, I know that your organization has been very busy combining the Grant Prideco NOV organizations. Any acquisitions in the quarter, do you feel like the company is ready to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions or is there going to be a digestion period here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah actually Dan, I don't think we are missing a beat, and I can't speak highly enough about the job that our organization has done pulling together Grant Prideco and NOV. It was a very big job, but I'm very proud of how it's turned out. I think that the ability to integrate acquisitions is a key competitive advantage of NOV. As you know, we've done over 150 acquisitions over the past decade and have really learned how to execute well.</p>
          <p>We did have one other small acquisition that we closed during Q2, it rolled into Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies. Didn't contribute much in the quarter, but it's a good basis going into Q3 and we are continuing to look at several other potential acquisitions. This is something we do very routinely. We've got a great crew here that it works closely with operations to execute these deals.</p>
