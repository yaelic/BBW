          <p>Thank you and good morning and good afternoon, and welcome to this teleconference regarding TeliaSonera January-March 2008 report. I'm Martti Yrj&#xF6;-Koskinen, Head of Group Investor Relations. At my side are Mr. Lars Nyberg our President and CEO, and Mr. Kim Ignatius, our Executive Vice President and CFO.</p>
          <p>In the conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding future business and financial performance of TeliaSonera and the telecommunications industry. These statements are predictions that involve risks and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that the actual results will not differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to many factors, many of which are outside the control of TeliaSonera.</p>
          <p>For your convenience you will find a supporting slide presentation available at our website teliasonera.com. The aim is to finish this call in approximately 45 minutes.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like the hand over to our President and CEO, Mr. Lars Nyberg.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Martti and welcome everybody on the call. I think we believe that the results for Q1 were satisfactory because we met our own most important, but also the market expectations. I am encouraged about the growth and particularly for the first time in five quarters, some of that growth now fell down to the EBITDA line, which I found encouraging.</p>
          <p>This growth was driven by business area Eurasia and business area Mobility. And Eurasia, we actually grew more than 30% in Swedish crowns and nearly 40% in local currency. Business area Mobility grew 9% driven by Spain and Denmark primarily. This is also encouraging because these two markets are key to us, meeting our ambition of maintaining the EBITDA margin this year compared to last year. Business area Broadband was flat with Sweden down 5%. I would have liked to see a little higher growth in Broadband and IPTV during the quarter, which means simply that you have to do better going forward.</p>
          <p>There has been some discussions about our investments and potential acquisitions areas et cetera, I'd like to make some comments on what drives our investments going forward.</p>
          <p>If I start with the business area Eurasia, I want to &#x2013; we want to expand in this part of the world. We are looking for opportunities in emerging markets with low penetration, reasonable size of population and of course a growing economy. The growing economy is important because there is a very strong correlation with growth of economy and growing penetration rates.</p>
          <p>We also look at the cultural fit, with our current footprint and the possibility to utilize our existing experience and resources in the area. We also believe that for everyone of those markets we need a strong local partner.</p>
          <p>In Mobility, we have during the quarter reconfirmed our ambition to acquire all shares of LMT in Latvia. At the same time, we have backed-off from Lattelekom. The reason is simple, if seen politically, very difficult, and frankly, I believe we can invest that money better. When it comes to CapEx priorities, traffic volumes on data growth requires continued expansion of coverage and capacity in Mobility.</p>
          <p>In Broadband, the investment will be mainly focused on platforms common infrastructures including core networks and a gradual fiber roll out in Sweden and Finland. In business areas of Eurasia capacity and coverage and quality of networks are the main drivers of CapEx.</p>
          <p>We have not changed our outlook, it remains the same. And in this outlook one of the most challenging tasks is our ambition to maintain the E BITDA margin for the full year 2008 compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>Let me comment on the key drivers for achieving this.</p>
          <p>Eurasia is the growth engine for the Group. We grew, as I said, more than 30% with a 50% EBITDA margin. Continued growth in Eurasia has a positive impact on the group's EBITDA margin. Second driver of course is Spain. Spain was inline with our plan in the quarter. We increased the number of subscribers to 559,000 with a loss of 388 million Swedish crowns.</p>
          <p>Our plan for the full year which we have set already after the fourth quarter is that we should have 1 million subscriber by the end of this year, and the loss should not be bigger than 1 billion. To achieve this, we are at a turning point starting in 2Q when losses are expected to be lower and, later in the year significantly lower than the prior year quarters.</p>
          <p>Another driver is Denmark where we have spectrally lower margins than competitors. There is no reason for that and getting those margins up as we plan to do this year will certainly help us to maintain the same EBITDA margin as last year.</p>
          <p>The last important driver for this objective is our efficiency measures, the 5 billion program. We did save on the gross basis 200 million Swedish krone in Q1. 250 people in Sweden and Finland has been transferred to what we call the TSO and the Pool in Finland. Our program has the objective to save the 5 billion as you know.</p>
          <p>We think we will achieve a gross saving, actual saving of 1.5 billion this year that includes the Q1 saving, the 200 I talked about, but annualized of course, annualized and new savings that we have in the making. The remaining 3.5 billion savings will mostly occur in 2009 and some might flow over to 2010. To make all this happen a lot of management priorities and decisions together with the agreements with Swedish and Finnish unions will have to be executed in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>In this remarks I made, I think I have covered most of my five priorities. When I joined the company, I announced the five priorities. I have talked about the efficiency measures, I have talked about our ambition to expand in Eurasia and I'll make some comments about the migration of fixed voice in Sweden to value-added services.</p>
          <p>The two remaining priorities is the world-class customer services operation, and we spent a lot of time in the last three or four quarters on putting real metrics based on Six Sigma into this and we are doing the root cause analysis, how to make sure that our customer services performance can improve. It's not bad today, it's actually viewed as best in Sweden, but it can substantially better and has to substantially better certainly if you talk about world-class.</p>
          <p>The fifth priority last year was to reorganize and get better focused on business-to-business sales, particularly in Sweden and Finland. That has been executed and the organization at some place.</p>
          <p>With that I give Kim the chance to comment on some more details on the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. I'm Kim Ignatius. Good morning and good afternoon to all of you. I will try to summarize the financials for Q1 and will follow the slides presentation as well.</p>
          <p>We did have good growth and improved EBITDA during the quarter. Net sales at the level of SEK 24.4 million, a increase in sales in local currencies of 6.6% of which 4.1% was organic growth. This organic growth level is higher than the growth level we experienced during 2007. And we had an EBITDA at the level of 7.7 &#x2013; SEK 7.8 million, an improvement compared to last year.</p>
          <p>When analyzing the EBITDA development and the underlying OpEx, we can see that for this quarter our efficiency what comes to cost of good sold has improved. We have a gross margin level that is flat in comparison with '07 and this is the first time that its taking place for quite a lot.</p>
          <p>EBITDA margin is coming down from 33.4% to 31.8%, there is two major items behind this development and one is the profitability development in Eurasia. Eurasia is doing very strong, good growth high margins. But the margin level in Q1 last year was at the level of 55% while it is now at the level of 50. The other impacting factor is the increased completion in Mobility and also the impact of regulatory intervention.</p>
          <p>Looking at financial items, very low number for the quarter and that is because we had booked a 275 million kroner penalty interest on the receivables that we have had for some years from Tele2 on interconnect payment.</p>
          <p>Income taxes, the effective tax rate is a bit higher than last year. We've done some adjustment which comes to deferred tax liabilities based on future dividend payments.</p>
          <p>CapEx 3.2, last year 2.3 clear increase what is driving this is again Eurasia. In Q107 we had very low levels of CapEx in Eurasia because of some vendor arrangements ongoing, now with that normal speed plus we are building networks in the new markets we recently entered.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, 1.1 when we last year had a higher level of 2.5.</p>
          <p>Looking at net sales for business area, slide 7 Mobility grew with 1 billion positively in all markets. Spain is starting to have a real impact, close to 300 million, impact on the sales increased for Mobility. Acquisition of debitel in Denmark helped us to grow our numbers and overall we can see the data usage starting to have an impact on the trends. In some markets we also got some positive boost from the FX development.</p>
          <p>Looking at Broadband Services the decline in traditional fixed-line services continues at the level where we have seen it, during the last few years roughly 10% decline on annual basis. And this decline we have not been able to offset completely with growth in IP services.</p>
          <p>Eurasia growing very nicely as we have stated at 650 million, impact of Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan being the biggest growth markets.</p>
          <p>Moving into operating income by our business area, what we see in the Mobility Services is that we do have the increased cost in sales and marketing, to keep our positions in the markets. Still suddenly increased cost in Spain, compared to last year. Also, of course the markets that are growing like Denmark have been forced to increase their OpEx as well. All this adding up to a fact that we have pretty much a flat operating income in the Mobility business. We did also have a one-time item last year positive 140 million released of interconnect provisions.</p>
          <p>Broadband Services where we had a flat net sales development actually shows an improvement in operating income, and this is because of reduced costs, less growth initiatives and also overall a lower level of sales and marketing expenditure. In addition, we have this year a lower level of depreciation in the Finnish market.</p>
          <p>Eurasia adding 0.5 billion into our operating income compared to last year, Russia adding 240 million, Turkey close to 200 million. What is positive is that even though the margins are coming down in Eurasia and we do have higher depreciation, still we added 100 million at the operating income line from that business.</p>
          <p>Looking at cash flows, EBITDA positively developing. Last year we had 530 million as dividend from associated companies because of the sale of an asset during that year. This year, we don't have the similar type of transaction. Interest paid 500 million higher than last year, high level of net debt and also higher costs of capital. Our paid income tax is at this time lower than last year by 500 million. Some fairly good sized difference is also in the pension items.</p>
          <p>And then the paid cash CapEx being about 800 million higher than last year, adding up to a free cash flow at the 1.1 billion level. Our key ratios continued to be strong, return-on-equity and return-on-capital employed both at the level of roughly 19%. And we do continue to have a solid capital structure.</p>
          <p>Thank you, I will hand it now back to Martti.</p>

          <p>Thank you sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. First question comes from the line <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name and location. <mark type="Inaudible" /> your line is now open.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I must have pressed the button by accident. I didn't have a question at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" /> please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name and location.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="inaudible" /> Dresdner Kleinwort in London. My first question is to Lars with regards to sort of the relative balance of priorities between growth and cost cutting. Is it fair to say, listening to your explanations today, that you have recently started to put more focus on the cost cutting in your list of priorities compared to growth than you initially might have thought when you entered the company? That would be my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is with regards to Lithuania Mobile. I'm a bit surprised by the 7.5% growth that we are seeing there. You are attributing this to high volume growth, but looking back to history, the last time it ever did anything like that was in Q2 '03. So is there anything else going on rather than just volume growth, and if yes what explains the extremely strong growth rate?</p>
          <p>And then last if I may, the 5 billion gross cost cutting. If you wanted to get a rough gauge of what it might do to the net costs, can you give us some help, whether the net cost impact of this program would be relatively higher or lower than that of the last cost cutting program? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, this is Lars. I do not think that I have changed priorities. I think both growth and cost cutting have been, from day one, priorities. I did actually talk quite a bit about the necessity about your cost cutting on the day of my announcement when I joined the company on September the 3rd and I announced the five &#x2013; the five priorities that I did mentioned in my remarks and the cost cutting is very important.</p>
          <p>When it comes to growth I said Eurasia, because I think there is a real opportunity to grow in Eurasia, which I think we have proven certainty in the first quarter. And I think there are opportunities going forward. So I think both of those two priorities are probably very high on this list of five priorities. I have not changed my position.</p>
          <p>With regarding the net, maybe you can give me the net of prior programs, when the net savings of prior programs, because I've been trying to understand that. We have changed a little bit in the way we think about cost here. We used to &#x2013; before we used the decision point to the sort of state what kind of cost saving that would generate going forward. I don't want to do that; I want to talk about real cost savings.</p>
          <p>And we'll still talk about gross cost savings because it's a continuous discussion on where we invest. And I have no problem to invest quite a bit of these gross savings provided these investments are good. And I will keep that they are in the management team at least for the time being, before I would go on and share net numbers. The gross numbers, though, I will share and the number of people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And when it comes to doing installation the volume growth is very much related to increased sales when it comes to equipment meaning laptops and terminals.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is <mark type="inaudible" />. I'd just like to know how many, or what percentage, of your IPTV customers are now paying for service, since there have been any early funds of churning ops?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Lars, it is still a small portion and it's too early. I think we said all along that in the second and third and the fourth quarter of this year, we will start seeing the results on how many are sharing and who are not sharing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is <mark type="inaudible" /> from <mark type="inaudible" />. I just have a question, a follow-up question from this morning's presentation. Alpha announced saying today that they should be able to consolidate Turkcell because the takeover needs to return the shares, but that they have the patches very low; do you have any comments for this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Lars. Yes we saw the verdict yesterday from Virgin Islands that says that Cukurova should return the shares. We saw that actually from the filing done by Cukurova on the stock exchange in Istanbul, but it &#x2013; the filing also said that he would go to the next level of court which is, I believe in London.</p>
          <p>So we'll see and I must also say that this issue is a little bit more complicated than between Alfa and Cukurova because we have also a court case, actually twice and we won it twice against Cukurova for over the same shares, so it's not as simple as Alfa says.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I also ask you on the IPTV net, the intake which was very slow this quarter. We also looked at the other players in the market and it seems that the whole market was a bit slower this quarter. Is that the main reason or is it &#x2013; would you say something in more about the churn levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I &#x2013; answered the churn level it's too early talk about churn yet, because of the offered in May that of one year free of charge, that will happen in the second and third quarter. It is correct that what you say that the whole market was a bit slower. But, it is very important to me and I will maintain to my people that I would have liked to see a little bit higher growth even if the market was slower.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jakob Bluestone from Merrill Lynch in London. Just a quick question on your CapEx. Can you give us any metrics in terms of your fiber build out either in terms of homes passed or how many homes you intend to pass? Just to give us a little bit more of an idea of what are you doing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Kim Ignatius. We don't have a plan to kind of cover a specific amount of the households that are private build out. We said all the time that when building out, rolling out every decision has to be based on the business case, meaning that there is a demand for this capacity and we also find that there is a financial return for that investment. So I can't give you any exact target levels.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from the line of Francois Arth. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Francois Arth from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;neral in Paris. Three questions please; can I comeback on the IPTV first to understand that the growth is smaller or slower this quarter? Do you expect that to increase again going forward or what measure would do you take to make that happen?</p>
          <p>And on the churn, I'm sorry to comeback to that again, but what exactly are you going to offer to the customer who has not been paying for a year to stay with you for the remaining of the year? What do you &#x2013; why do they have to say with you? What kind of products do you offer differentiation in on this. That's the first one.</p>
          <p>The second one, I think last you said to excel on the 4% replacement; you were interested but you didn't get it. Why is that the case? Was it a price issue?</p>
          <p>And finally, third question, on MegaFon, in terms of dividend, when can we expect something and what kind of size can we expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, this is Lars again. First of all, we have introduced some different price schemes for the customers who currently have &#x2013; are not paying, so we have three different levels of offers. So we have also low priced offer, which I think is attractive for some people. I don't think we should make too big of issue over the fact that we didn't grow as much as I would have liked to see in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our success in this is based &#x2013; is based on the couple of things. The most important thing is that the content is good and attractive. That we have no or very small technical issues with the systems. I think we have a good content, it could be better. We have a good technology, it could be better. And we are working very hard on those things. I feel pretty confident that you will &#x2013; we will see the growth and we will gain market share, because we are also very determined on this issue. It's very important strategically for us.</p>
          <p>On the Turkcell, there was a block of 4.1% available within that offer to buy all of it. We have said we could enter to buy a piece of it and we didn't get anything. It doesn't really matter from our position or control position. We did this more to send a signal that we are committed to Turkcell. We like Turkcell. We like to stay in Turkcell. We like to own more of Turkcell if possible. That was more the purpose of the background to us choosing this that we didn't get it, so we dint get it.</p>
          <p>Dividends in MegaFon, we have said repeatedly we would like have to have dividends. But you should realize its only possible in the last year may be or two years, because prior to that, all the surplus cash was used to pay the &#x2013; to build the networks. But we have said this publicly and I think there are couple of other players that say the same thing, maybe, that of you will see.</p>

          <p>Next we have a follow-up question from the line of Peter Nielsen [CAI Cheuvreux]. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Peter Nielsen here in London. Just two question please. Firstly, on the cost reductions, the 1.5 billion for this year, would they be overwhelming to be within the fixed line business?</p>
          <p>And second question, as you point out in Norway you've benefited from the move of the Tele2 MVNL contract and obviously we'll see the full impact in Q2, how much have we seen in Q1, if I may ask relative to a full quarter's impact from that contract being moved? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it would be a misunderstanding if everybody believed that the dominant part of the 1.5 is coming from broadband. Of course a big chunk is coming from broadband because that's where we have our legacy. But a lot of savings will have to occur outside of broadband in staff organization, in headquarters, in mobility maybe not so much in Eurasia, to be honest with you, but certainly in basically every other part of the organization.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to a Tele2 <mark type="inaudible" /> agreement. If you remember, we saw an agreement last summer to takeover the Tele2 traffic in Norway to our own network and that agreement stipulated that the customer base of Tele2 should be in our network as of April 1st this year. It is on our network today. What they were &#x2013; to what extent did we have a full run rate or not in Q1, we had a good run rate but of course not the full one.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. James Britton from Lehman Brothers in London. Few questions from me. First of all, can you say what medium term termination rate, in middle <mark type="inaudible" /> do you expect to use regulated target when it announces its new study on cost in June?</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you just talk a little bit about the impact of the launch of Skanova Access; has it had any material impact on the broadband market in Sweden and then will it, at some point 2008?</p>
          <p>And third, when do you expect to find out the identity of your new co-shareholder in MegaFon since Health Mode put its faith in a depository?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start with the Skanova, the purpose why we did this Skanova, the network separation, first of all is to comply I think with what we expected to be the legislation and clearly the political issues. And I have an ambition that I hope that our competitors in the marketplace will perceive Skanova as a good supplier. I think it's way too early to think that we've had any impact. But by doing this at least I am trying to send a message that we are serious about equal treatment and fair treatment and a good service provider to every operator.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the question about MegaFon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you please repeat it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was just &#x2013; just wanted to find out a little more about the potential shareholder changes in MegaFon out of those 25 since staked in depository, so what are the implications of that to the shareholder base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did this again, we don't have any information of the purpose of this transaction on or what is behind it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then when coming to termination ratios in Sweden, in July &#x2013; 1st of July last year we lowered our termination price to SEK 0.55 and at least I haven't heard anything on any other suggestions by the PTS.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're not aware of the study being concluded on in June?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. But, I mean, typically in our markets there is pressure on the interconnectivities.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Andrew Hogley from Execution [Execution Limited] in London, slightly cheeky question, do you think TeliaSonera would benefit from being part of a larger European telecoms group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wonder why I'm not surprised I got that question. Okay, I'll give you the standard answer. No, joking apart. I took this job to try to make a successful company more successful. That's what I am focused on as my task. I also realized when I took the job that two of the big owners have stated that they would like to sell, and, of course, that creates a lot of interest and maybe rumors even, and I will not comment on rumors, speculations or intentions. In case, if and when, somebody makes a bid for this company, we have a competent Board who will handle that with the best interest of all shareholders. That's my comment.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. It's Andreas Ekstr&#xF6;m from Carnegie.com. Just one question, Lars that you mentioned this morning on Denmark is a small part business but you said it offers some great potential for you. And as I'm sure you're aware that has been a disappointment for many years in Telia. Where do you see that you have a cost disadvantage versus your competitors in that market? I think that average margin is around 25% in Denmark, when do you think that you can reach that level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, that's exactly why I don't understand why we have the margins that we have. And I'm not going to speculate when I can reach the 25 as you mentioned, because that is the kind of margin that the comparable players have. And I'm pretty determined that we have to improve in Denmark. And I know that my colleagues in the leadership team are as determined as I am, but in the picture is also several years of disappointment, I realize that. Maybe Kim wants to add something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we also have had during the last few years transactions arrangement that had impacted our capability to kind of optimize the margins level. We bought Orange, it took some time to integrate that business into our own. After that we did some internal restructuring between the fixed and mobile businesses. Thirdly, we recently acquired debitel. All of these transactions always takes time &#x2013; some time and focus out of the normal business and period. And I think now it's time to make sure that we build this current new business into a profitability level where it needs to be.</p>
