          <p>Good morning. My name is Catora, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Occidental Petroleum Corporation First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operating Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Stavros. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Catora, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to Occidental's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call from Los Angeles this morning are Dr. Ray Irani, Oxy's Chairman and CEO; and Steve Chazen, our President and CFO. Bill Albrecht, Oxy's President of U.S. Oil and Gas; and Sandy Lowe, our new President of Oxy's Oil and Gas International Operations, will also be joining us and available during the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>In just a moment, I'll be passing the call over to Steve, who will provide further details on our quarterly results and operations. Our first quarter earnings press release, investor relations supplemental schedules and earnings conference call slides, which refer to Steve's remarks, can be downloaded off of our website, www.oxy.com.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Steve. Steve, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. Net income for the quarter was $368 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to 1.8 billion or $2.22 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008. 2009 first quarter net income includes after tax non-core charge of $39 million, including $21 million for severance, $10 million for railcar leases, $5 million for rig termination costs and $3 million for discontinued operations.</p>
          <p>The core results were $407 million, or $0.50 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 1.8 billion or $2.19 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year. Here's a segment breakdown for the first quarter. Oil and Gas first quarter 2009 segment earnings were $545 million. After excluding the rig termination costs, the first quarter 2009 core results were 553 million compared to 2.9 billion for last year. $2.3 billion decrease in the first quarter earnings was due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices and higher DD&amp;A rates.</p>
          <p>Occidental's average realized crude price in 2009 first quarter was $39.29, a decrease of 55% from $86.75 in the comparable period of 2008. Oxy's domestic averaged realized gas price for the quarter was $3.54 per MCF compared to $8.15 per MCF to the first quarter of 2008, a decline of about 57%.</p>
          <p>Worldwide Oil and Gas sales volume for the first quarter of 2009 were 654,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of nearly 8% compared to 607,000 BOEs per day in the first quarter of last year. The increase includes 22,000 BOE a day from domestic operations, 15,000 BOE a day from Oman and 10,000 BOE a day from Argentina. About half the domestic volume increase was attributable to our acquisitions from last year. Higher production sharing volumes and now the change of Libyan contract terms in the Middle East and North Africa added about 10,000 barrels a day to our results. The first quarter of 2009 Oil and Gas sales volumes were 34,000 BOE a day, higher than the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Exploration expense was $58 million in the quarter. Over the course of a little over a year, Occidental has drilled 35 wells, seeking non-traditional hydrocarbon bearing zones in California. Of these wells, 13 are commercial and 12 are currently being evaluated. Four of these wells currently account for approximately 28 million cubic feet of gas a day and 3,000 barrels of liquids of gross daily production.</p>
          <p>While it is too early to speculate on the ultimate reserves of production associated with this activity, it is progressing nicely. We will continue to invest in this program, despite weak gas prices, since we currently believe the total cost that is finding and developing and lifting will be less than $10 per BOE. We expect to drill 20 exploration wells in California this year. Occidental holds approximately 1.1 million acres of net fee minerals and leaseholds in California, which have been acquired mostly in the last few years to exploit these opportunities. This is essentially all the data that we have at this time to discuss with you.</p>
          <p>Oil and Gas production costs excluding production and property taxes were $10.48 a barrel, for the three months of 2009, a 13.6% decline from last year's 12-month costs of $12.13 a barrel. This decline is due to lower workover, maintenance utility costs and the effective higher production sharing volumes. These costs are in line with our fourth quarter guidance where we indicated we were actively renegotiating our supplier contracts and laying down some rigs.</p>
          <p>Taxes, other than on income, were $1.71 a barrel for the first quarter of 2009 compared to $2.62 for all of 2008. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect lower crude oil and gas prices in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were 169 million compared to our guidance of $100 million. The higher earnings were attributable primarily to higher caustic soda margins. Chemicals earned $179 million in last year's first quarter.</p>
          <p>Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were $14 million compared to $123 million in the first quarter of 2008. The decline in earnings was due to significantly lower NGL realized prices in the gas processing business and negative mark-to-market adjustments in crude oil marketing.</p>
          <p>Non-core adjustments for the first quarter of 2009 included a $32 million pre-tax charge for severance. We do not expect to record any material additional amounts for the rest of the year. Additionally we recorded a $15 million pre-tax charge related to railcar subleases to Lyondell, which are being restructured as a result of Lyondell entering into bankruptcy.</p>
          <p>The worldwide effective tax rate was $0.39 for the first quarter of 2009 compared with our guidance of 46%. The decrease in rate reflects tax benefits resulting from the relinquishment of international exploration contracts. Occidental generally records no tax book benefits on foreign expense exploration until the project is relinquished.</p>
          <p>Capital spending for the first quarter of 2009 was $1.1 billion. As previously mentioned, our capital run rate in the first quarter of 2009 was greater than the $3.5 billion total year level and will decline throughout the year. We expect the second quarter capital will be in line with the $3.5 billion annual run rate.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations for the three months of 2009 was about $1.3 billion before working capital changes. We used about $500 million for payments related to higher capital spending and other expenses from the fourth quarter of 2008, which were approved at year-end.</p>
          <p>We used 1.2 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures and acquisition costs and $260 million to pay dividends. Based on our annual capital spending forecast, we expect our second quarter capital run rate to drop by about $300 million.</p>
          <p>The higher first quarter 2009 capital run rate, the payments related to fourth quarter 2008 capital and other net cash outflows, decreased our $1.8 billion cash balance end of last year by $700 million to 1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for three months were 811.8 million, and the weighted average diluted shares were 814.4 million.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead to the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas production volumes to be in the range of 640 to 660,000 BOE per day during the second quarter at about current prices. This volume range reflects increases in both in Dolphin, Oman and Qatar.</p>
          <p>With respect to prices at current market price, a dollar change in oil prices impacts quarterly Oil and Gas earnings before income taxes by about $36 million. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices had a $20 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. While current NYMEX gas price is around $3.50, prices in the Permian and California are currently about $3.00, while the Rockies gas is in the range of $2.50. We expect exploration expenses to be about $60 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs.</p>
          <p>We expect Chemical segment earnings in the second quarter to be about $100 million. Weakness in the global alumina and pulp and paper markets are expected result in reduced demand and margins for caustic soda. Domestically weak construction and housing markets are expected to continue to reduce demand for vinyl.</p>
          <p>We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter of 2009 to be about 43% of current prices. Our first quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the supplement.</p>
          <p>We continue to negotiate cost reductions across all areas, including, but not limited to, drilling rigs, service rigs, drilling services, artificial lift, maintenance, repair, and operations, chemicals and oil country tubular goods.</p>
          <p>On average, we have negotiated about a 20 to 25% reduction across all areas from the peak 2008 level. The attached chart indicates the range of reductions we are realizing across the broad cost categories and may not reflect the trends across the entire industry. The effect of these reductions is not yet in the first quarter run rate. We have realized about one-third of the reductions we need to do to achieve economic results in the current price environment.</p>
          <p>We expect the full effect to be realized over the balance of the year and into next year. These cost reductions impact both capital spending and operating costs. We will not provide any additional detail or increase granularity about the components of the cost reduction other than those available on the attached schedule.</p>
          <p>We're now ready to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, appreciate the color on California activity. Can you give us a little history on how overall activity in California has evolved over the last year or two and some of the assumptions that go into how you arrived at a sub $10 a barrel estimate for S&amp;D analysting cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We started this project, I think five years ago, with a notion that there were reservoirs that weren't &#x2013; that hadn't been productive elsewhere in the state. And so we began accumulating acreage. We really don't want to get into any more detail about how the numbers were computed. It's very early in the process and really not something &#x2013; we told you what we think we can tell you with high certainty, and we want to stay away from speculating about what it might turn out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one more question on the Permian. With CO2 representing about 50,000 barrels a day of future growth, how are you assessing the overall risk to that future growth, and what is the potential recourse in kind of a worst-case situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about SandRidge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Things are going just fine with SandRidge. We don't have any reason to believe that anything is going to happen except the plants going to be delivered generally on time. So, there's plenty of drilling locations in the area with lots of CO2. So, I really am not worried that we won't be able to supply CO2. If SandRidge doesn't supply it for some reason, which I don't expect, the area is loaded with wells with the small amounts of, relatively small amounts of methane and lots of CO2. So, it's not something we spend a lot of time worrying about. And I think they're doing fine. They seem to be okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I could sort of follow-up on the CapEx question and your cost question, I just want to get some sense from you as to how you think about the returns, or the difference between your realizations and your target costs in terms of when you actually might see some of your shorter cycle activity turn back up again so that, the trend in volumes that looks to be down sequentially this year might actually stop and reverse?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our volumes, of course, are up sequentially but -</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean from the Q1 level, right? I mean your 54 guidance, 640 to 660 for next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, to some extent the &#x2013; each quarter's a little difficult to worry about. We try to estimate how much trouble we're going to have in a quarter, and we ran a little better in the first quarter than probably we planned. And so we try to &#x2013; there's always something in the oil business that makes your production a little slower. So, that's why we give you a range.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, if I think about the full year, you guided to 4%. You're starting off at 8%. I just assume that there's some trailing off as we move through the year. Is that -</p>

          <p>We're still sizably above, especially in gas &#x2013; in the Piceance, we could have a lot more production in gas, but it just doesn't make any sense at these levels. So, we're a long way away in getting costs in line with $2.50 gas in the Piceance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The UAE is still short of gas. The increase in potential volume for Dolphin would have to come from Qatar. And right now, they're really not looking at any new projects basically in that regard. We're still assessing how much an oil field has and has our hands full. So, Dolphin, we will take advantage during periods when Qatar cancel out again, to move some of the gas into that pipeline. So the pipeline as you know can handle more than is produced by the concession area we have. So, even that's that on that issue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>What &#x2013; theoretically, what is the throughput on Dolphin? I mean, I know 2.2 is sort of the targeted capacity level, but if this summer &#x2013; could there be days or periods where you're at three?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Dr. Irani. We have the ability to flow 3.2 billion a day through the pipeline. We do not have the contractual rights to that, as Dr. Irani has said, nor do we have all of the compressors currently in place to handle that. I'm sure there will be possibilities for the &#x2013; technical possibilities are all there for the future.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good question. As you know, they're talking about opening up a whole bunch of fields there. And as you would expect, many, many companies are looking at entries there. We have been studying those opportunities. There are huge fields, there are medium fields and there are smaller fields.</p>
          <p>Realistically, the way they are looking at awarding potentially these areas is to consortia. And you can bid on as many fields as you want, but you can't have more than a certain amount, and in all probability, the very huge fields will be given to consortiums, not just any one company. And the &#x2013; I'm talking if we wanted 10 billion barrels or more.</p>
          <p>And realistically, the super major would probably head those elephant fields. And of course, we don't mind participating in some of those, and those discussions go on. But there are other fields, medium fields, smaller fields, some of which we may be able to hope and lead one of those activities.</p>
          <p>So it's a free for all and lot of interest by a lot of people. How the secured situation materializes is of great importance, because President Obama, as you know, is planning to withdraw the troops, and this time it's serious, and so we have to watch very carefully all that develops. But clearly in the future, Iraq is one of the key areas that offers opportunities for international oil companies to participate, and this is going to be a bigger gold rush -</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the timing certainly feels anyway like it's more prescient if I think about the scale of opportunities for a company like OXY, I guess it would make more sense that round two in September would be a higher probability scenario versus round one in June. Is it realistic to think that by 2010 OXY will be in Iraq in one way or another?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I sure as hell would like to. But as you know &#x2013; okay, there's a desire for us to be there. And &#x2013; but again, the Iraqis keep, understandably, their government has many other issues to address, and deadlines get delayed, changes in some of the bidding conditions change and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>So we have a desire and &#x2013; but looking at when this could really bring money to the bottom line, you are talking years, let's face it. Because it's going to take investment, and it's not going to happen overnight. So, I sure as hell would like us to have good news for you by 2010, but I can't speculate on when it could have any meaningful income.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, indebtedness and &#x2013; no, right now they're trying to sell or farm out or whatever the right word is, acreage that's expiring and trying to get people to drill it for them. And they started out with, we'll call it unattractive terms, and they're getting more realistic. Whether there's anything there for us, I don't know. But that's where you are now. They're trying to cut their capital effectively, cover their capital.</p>
          <p>But I think as we move through the year, more interesting things will come loose. I don't have any real guidance, but I don't know if it will be next year or this year, but I wouldn't be surprised to see more activity in the back half of the year.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then if you can comment on the &#x2013; I know you talked about the net PSC effect that you had in the quarter of about 10,000 barrels a day.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mukhaizna as you recall, when we took it over from Shell, was producing 8,000 barrels a day. It's now in the 50s MMB, maybe 80, and ultimately we &#x2013; our contracts says we'd get to 150,000. So that's a continuous ramp-up of that activity. Sandy, could you add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir, we are right now just under 60,000 a day. We only have about 25% of the steam capacity commissioned so far, so we see quite a nice ramp-up, as Dr. Irani says, 80,000 by the end of this year and the 150 in the year 2012. We have new drilling rigs out there that are putting in routes faster than we've ever done, and everything's on track.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Understood. And then on &#x2013; shifting to Latin America, the volumes in Argentina were up pretty substantially sequentially fourth quarter to first quarter. Can you give us a little bit of color around that too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's &#x2013; remember, they had some strikes and stuffs in last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's basically back to where it should be. One of the volume variances I talked about earlier was pretty hard to predict.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Understood. And then shifting to the Midstream side of the equation for a second. I saw your slide where you showed us the first quarter '08 versus first quarter '09. I was also looking at your supplemental information where you gave us fourth quarter '08 versus first quarter '09, and in that slide you had gas processing and NGL prices only affecting the sequential quarter over quarter operating profit by 22 million, and mark-to-market adjustments affecting the number of 131 million. So I guess what I was just trying to get at is, what were the actual cash earnings from that business in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cash earning of the business is sort of about $60 million. There's a market &#x2013; in our pipeline system, we buy oil from producers, and we ship it to the &#x2013; and we lock in the margin, which is a dollar or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's say you buy it from them for $40, and we sell it immediately for 41 or 42. Well, the oil doesn't get there. It may run over the quarter, end the quarter. And let's say oil prices, meanwhile, have moved up. You have to mark-to-market the change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so you get that back. It's not a real thing. The real profit is a dollar or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that &#x2013; and so you get a lot of volatility in the number from quarter to quarter, over the year it shouldn't matter. So when prices are coming down, you'll get nominal gains from it. When prices are going up, you'll have nominal losses over the end of the quarter. This is why we broke the segment out so we can see all this noise in it. But there's nothing really fundamental going on, but NGL margins are clearly constrained.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Natural gas, while the spread is wide relatively, the absolute prices are real low. I mean you're paying $3 for the gas and selling liquids for 43 last quarter. But it's a lot &#x2013; that's &#x2013; the magnitude of the spread has shrunk considerably year-over-year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got you. And then, on the tax rate, 39% versus 46%, I think I understand what's going on there, but is the entire difference between your guidance and what you actually reported, that tax benefit from the relinquishment of those contracts?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got you. And then, last question on working capital, so I understand, that negative $500 million of working capital does reverse itself over the course of the year, is that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>No.</p>

          <p>No?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that was like an accrued liability from the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I see. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So our &#x2013; if you want to think of it, paying off that obligation in the first quarter that was accrued in the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>So it obviously affects your cash. When your business is &#x2013; when you're spending less capital, your accrued liabilities have to be paid &#x2013; normally, it wouldn't make any difference if you were at the level. You'd always fill about the same accrued liabilities, but now your accrued liabilities are declining.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, guys. I've got a couple of things on the production outlook, if I could kick off with the press release you put out a couple of weeks ago on Awali. Can you give us an update as to when you expect to be able to confirm what your share of Awali will be?</p>
          <p>And probably the more important question is, I'm trying to understand where your geological rights end in the context of the field, because there is clearly a very substantial gas opportunity, the deep gas rights in Bahrain? If you could give any color as to what your potential entitlement or potential opportunity is there, that would be great, and I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Bahrain, the question is &#x2013; well, we expect to sign a deal before the end of the month. At least that's what has been announced by the people from Bapco two days ago, and it looks less likely. So, before the end of the month, we hope to give you in the announcement guidance on what the volumes are impacting OXY.</p>
          <p>We see a fairly interesting number of potential activities, including the one that you will see some more details about within a week or two. And as you know, when you go into a country, you will always look at new opportunities, and we think there are some there. So it's a modest field relative to the measures, but a number of them have beds, and we've been fortunate to succeed in taking initially the existing oil and gas fields and have the opportunity to increase the production, but we're looking at other things we might do there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a much deeper gas zone that's being bid out, significantly deeper, and that's what this other bid package is, Doug.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Right. Separately, in Columbia, we've seen a little bit of activity there, appears, on the Cira-Infantas field, obviously we've talked about backwards and forwards. But it looks like Ecopetrol came out recently and talked about their net share getting up to something like 30,000 barrels per day by 2011, but what's interesting is that appears that you guys have now awarded contracts for the water pumps. Can you just talk a little bit about whether you are actually moving forward to stage two and what you expect your net share to be?

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the Cira-Infantas field is moving ahead quite nicely. There &#x2013; we have new, very fast drilling rigs putting in wells, and again faster than we've ever done before. And the progress is running around 24,000 barrels a day. So there's water injection planned and a number of other enhancements. And not from me, with Ecopetrol's projections on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I guess -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Historically, they've been fairly optimistic projections, as you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, I guess where I'm going with this, Steve, is that if you take &#x2013; go back to 2006 when you laid out your long-term production guidance and all the upside potential that you talked about if XYZ projects happen. You've now got Awali, seems Cira-Infantas is going well. You've added the SandRidge deal. You're talking obviously a lot more optimistically about the Stephen shale and the Antelope over in California.</p>
          <p>So, when are we going to get a revised longer-term expectation in terms of your production outlook and can you just give us an idea of whether you think you've actually hit what you at that time laid out to be your stretch goal for the projects you've got in hand? And that's it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I think we have consistently said overtime, and we reconfirm, ignoring this economic downturn issue for now, is that we can &#x2013; we believe we can grow the business in volume between five and 7%. It may be lower in that low price environment because clearly we're going to put this capital in, and our business is not going to be growing in a smooth curve.</p>
          <p>So you're going to be seeing increases over the next couple of years from both definitely, Mukhaizna, as Sandy just talked about, from Bahrain, which we will be taken globally operation during the remainder of the year, increases potentially and domestically, increases in the Piceance as gas prices improve, and there are other projects we continue to work about.</p>
          <p>But we at OXY don't believe like giving you a number of projects that we're thinking about that may happen, but we like to have high degree of certainty before we start sharing with you our thoughts and dreams. So I can't sit and tell you, well, in Iraq we're going to have so much. I can't. But realistically, that, that's a wish by me. This is a wish by other people. So we have a lot of places we can drill.</p>
          <p>Bill, would you share with them how many places we can drill in the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Dr. Irani, thank you. We currently have roughly 10,000 locations to drill in the United States, with about 6,000 of those locations in the Piceance alone.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my call. In the middle of 2008, you made a small investment in an oil sands project in Canada. Under current economics, do you anticipate that project moving forward, and if so, under what timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Total runs the project, as you know, and so they've delayed until costs come into line. So I would &#x2013; almost everybody up there is waiting for cost decreases before they move forward, and I think Total made that announcement a few months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as a follow-up to that, if there are potential opportunities to increase your stay, either in that project or the oil sands more generally under current commodity prices, would you consider that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that project is &#x2013; the rest is Total. So I don't see them selling down. They'd probably be more interested in taking our share than the other way. As far as other projects go, we look for quality operators and quality reservoirs, and so that sort of limits the opportunities in Canada.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I was interested in your commentary about Dolphin. I don't know, somewhat unexpected for me in terms of the discussion around the market diversions. Ray, I think you mentioned in instances where the Qataries might not be able to sell the gas to other markets, they could divert and put through the Dolphin line, provided &#x2013; allowing you to ramp up to your capacity there or towards it. Did I understand that correctly?</p>
          <p>And if so, I'm curious around the logistics there. My thought was that most of the Ras Laffan projects were somewhat ring fenced from each other in terms of the gas feed, albeit having some shared utilities or that that was planned longer term. So I wouldn't have thought the logistics would have been that easy to kind of transfer the gas in between the various projects based on markets, but I'd be curious if you thought otherwise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think &#x2013; let me start out, Brian (sic) [Robert], and I'll turn it over to Sandy. Even before we started producing gas from Dolphin, we put some gas through to significantly hundreds of thousands of &#x2013; hundreds of millions of cubic feet a day purchased from Qatar. And Sandy, would you give him some feeling on the logistics of this gas Qatar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir, I'd be glad to. Qatar has a lot of LNG, which as you've alluded to is pretty well ring-fenced, but there's a lot of domestic consumption there, which has a seasonal swing. And there are times when there's more available gas than is used in their domestic power generation, et cetera, so sometimes that's available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. But then on terms &#x2013; specifically, would you expect a diversion of the LNG, or it sounds like that pretty much goes as is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are some technical interconnections that could be used, but generally speaking, the LNG has been ring-fenced as part of the deals that were made. It would be more domestic oversupply that we get to use.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think &#x2013; so don't feel that this is a substitute for LNG, it's not. It's even opportunistic &#x2013; understanding between us and Qatar that when they have extra gas, it can be used in the UAE, and when there isn't, there isn't. So it's not really going to be an alternative to LNG.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Qatar has a fair amount that's dedicated for its domestic use. And how much they need depends on the growth in the construction and other utilities, and those sort of go up and down and sideways.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
