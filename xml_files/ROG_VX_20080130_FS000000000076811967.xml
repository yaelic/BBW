          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> see so many familiar faces.  Now 2007 has been another outstanding year for us in terms of the financial results operationally as well as in terms of delivering our pipeline for the future.</p>
          <p>If you look at the commitments we have made at the beginning of 2007 as they are summarized on this first slide.  You can see that we have delivered on all of those commitments and we have done that consistently over the last few years.  For the seven straight year group sales increased in double-digit to a record 46 billion Swiss francs, 4 billion increase entirely due to organic growth.  Clearly the main growth driver was the Pharma Division with sales growing twice that of the market, driven by the strong demand for the key drugs in oncology, transplantation and virology.  Sales of the oncology portfolio were up by 20% and cancer now represents approximately 50% of our total Pharma sales.</p>
          <p>Roche Diagnostics strengthened its number one position in its market, again outgrowing the market with a growth rate of 6%, and Bill and Severin are going to talk in more detail about that.</p>
          <p>As predicted, the order for Tamiflu in the second half of '07 declined, but if we exclude sales &#x2013; pandemic sales to governments and to corporations, the underlying growth in the Pharma Division continues at double-digits.  If one looks at the fourth quarter '07, it was the strongest quarter in the year in terms of growth rate for Roche Pharma.</p>
          <p>Most of the stockpiling orders have now been filled, so for 2008 we can predict that sales of Tamiflu will continue to decline significantly.</p>
          <p>The fact, however, that we've set up our supply chain as an international network allows us to turn that supply chain down without having any one-off expenses due to the change in demand.  The combination of the higher revenue and a number of the productivity improvement programs which we have put into action over the last few years has led to the fact that despite a significantly faster rise in R&amp;D expenses, overall costs grew below sales.  So we are showing a 22% increase in operating profit to 14.5 billion, the highest ever margin increase of 3.5 percentage points and for the first time that the group is exceeding the 30% margin limit.  Combined with a lower tax rate, we increased net income by 25% and that includes no exceptional items.</p>
          <p>The group's balance sheet as you will hear from Erich was also strengthened further.  Core EPS grew twice the rate of sales at 20%.</p>
          <p>In view of these results, the Board is recommending to the AGM that we increase the dividend by 35% that leads to a dividend payout this year of 4 billion compared to 3 billion last year.  So we are also maintaining our profit &#x2013; our promise to progressively increase not only the dividend but also the payout ratio.</p>
          <p>Overall, we are taking further steps to strengthen the base for our future growth and for sustainable future growth.  We have separated the role Chairman and CEO.  We've talked to you at the beginning of the year and at the half-year of our new R&amp;D model that is now in full operation throughout the group and is proving a great success and gaining momentum in all the various research centers.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we have also focused on growing our pipeline further, we continued with over between Pharma and Diagnostics with approximately 40 licensing and alliance agreements to acquire product and technologies, the most important ones were probably the acquisition of Alnylam and the RNAi technology, our agreement with Transgene to enter into the field of therapeutic vaccines and our agreement with Toyama to develop a entirely new group of oral rheumatoid arthritis compound.</p>
          <p>2007 has been a record year for us also in terms of our acquisition activities, THP to strengthen our presence in therapeutic antibody research, BioVeris, 454 and NimbleGen to strengthen our position in diagnostics and with NimbleGen and 454, we really became the market leader in the exciting field of gene sequencing and high density microarrays.</p>
          <p>Very importantly, week before last, we signed a definite merger agreement with Ventana.  That acquisition not only gives us access to tissue-based diagnostics, a field where we have not been present in the past, but also is an important milestone in our leadership position in personalized medicine.</p>
          <p>If you look at our current pipeline, on the market we have nine products that generate sales of at least 1 billion Swiss francs.  Apart from sales at 2009 in the U.S., we have no major patent expiries over the next few years.  We are firmly committed and have the clinical trial programs in place to maximize the potential of our current assets and to build our product for the future.</p>
          <p>We've talked about the fact that 2008 Tamiflu sales will continue to decline, as we've filled most of these pandemic orders.  If we take that aside, we expect in 2008 to continue to outgrow the market in the Pharma division.  And this continuous growth is carried forward through our existing products in the oncology area, Avastin, MabThera, Herceptin, and also by the introduction of new products like Mircera.</p>
          <p>If we look at 2008, I think we can see three different forces playing out here.  First, clearly we continue to improve our profitability.  On the one hand through the product mix, which improves margin.  On the other hand the overall growing portfolio is also improving profitability and step-by-step as we are implementing our productivity programs also those results are coming through.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we have the decline of Tamiflu, which is really a decline of 1.7 billion Swiss francs approximately in sales and the profitability link to that.  And thirdly, we've clearly decided based on the strength of our Phase II program, based on the strength of our portfolio to continue to invest heavily in R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>We expect, in 2008, significant new clinical data out of our CNS program and we will have to make important decisions in moving another four compounds into Phase II.  And it's very encouraging to see the depth and breadth of our new product portfolio emerging in all therapy areas.  The main focus of the additional development expenses will be on our late stage clinical trials on products like pertuzumab, ocrelizumab, the GLP-1 and the CETP inhibitor as well as the various programs for new indications, line extensions and adjuvant therapies for our oncology pipeline.</p>
          <p>I and you hear a lot and discuss a lot that the pharma model is broken.  I don't know if this is the case or not but there is one thing I'm very clear about.  Roche is significantly different from its competitors.  No other company has a research set-up as we have with a majority shareholding of Chugai and Genentech.  No other company has a leadership position in biotechnology on a global scale as we have.  No other company has the link between diagnostics and pharmaceuticals and the potential for achieving leadership in personalized healthcare as we have.  Most of our competitors face over the next two to three years significant patent expiries.  We don't.  We can continue to grow significantly with our existing product and we will be introducing new product in new therapy areas.</p>
          <p>So for 2008, we expect to outgrow in both divisions Pharma and Diagnostics' respective markets, to grow high single digits excluding the pandemic sales of Tamiflu.  Despite the lack of those sales and despite the higher R&amp;D spend, we expect core EPS for 2008 to be at least at the same record level as 2007.  And as an expression of our continued cash generation and the strength of our financial position we also will continue to raise our dividend and our dividend pay-out ratio.  With that summary I will hand it over to Bill.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Franz.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Pleasure to pick up with the opportunity with a number of people in the room this morning on the conference call, a lot of pleasure to be able to be in front of you and just take you through a lot of the highlights and of some of the news flow that's developing within the pharma business.</p>
          <p>If we start with some of the highlights, so a double-digit growth in sales as we promised.  If we put to one side the sales to government from Tamiflu, the underlying growth was at 14%.  The operating profit margin moved forward strongly; a lot of this to do with product mix, a little to do with currency, but really the fundamentals are strong.  We progress our assets into a number of the areas we wanted to; Avastin moving into breast and lung in the course of the year in Europe.  We know that the renal cell carcinoma was approved just at the year-end by the European Union and at the beginning of this year we have now seen the approval of Avastin in the later lines of metastatic colorectal cancer unrestricted by the chemotherapeutic choice.  So, I will go into that a little bit more as to what that means in opening up the market.</p>
          <p>Mircera launched in Europe, clearly a fairly busy marketplace these days.  The differentiator here is allowing us to move into some of the areas of the market, which we have the competitive edge and we use NeoRecormon also in other parts where we also can deal more in price.</p>
          <p>In terms of pipeline progress, Actemra was the major milestone since we have the opportunity in September, October to share the third quarter sales results, the filing on schedule for both the United States and for the European authorities and progressively now that will be taken out around the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>We moved to humanised second-generation anti-CD20, ocrelizumab, into Phase III in lupus and into late stage Phase II in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  Pertuzumab, the dimerization HER2 product which has a broader field of activities in just Herceptin alone, we saw very encouraging results using it in combination with Herceptin, and we have now moved that into Phase III in the metastatic breast cancer setting.</p>
          <p>CETP inhibitor, we took the decision to move into Phase III and the first patients will be recruited in the course of the coming months.  The GLP-1 product we fully budgeted for the entry into Phase III second half of this year, a little bit more profiling data that we are looking for out of the second Phase II study, but very encouraging.</p>
          <p>So when you put that together and this, as many of you'll remember, is the scorecard that we shared with you at the beginning of 2007, you can see how we closed out the year, achievements across the board where you see the green ticks. On some occasions the data did not support, for example, the p38, Phase II rheumatoid arthritis that we shared with you earlier in the year and so forth.  And some of the data like the adjuvant <mark type="inaudible" /> data, still events driven and we are not there yet.</p>
          <p>If we then turn to just a brief commentary on the figures, and I know you've had the chance during the morning to look at this but just to reflect first half, second half year for Roche Pharma still at 12% growth.  You saw the year-on-year comparison that Genentech announced 10 days ago or so which filled some of the early growth Lucentis in its first full year.  That's a very considerable sales level but the final quarters of the year-on-year did not have the same evidence approach.</p>
          <p>So a slightly more modified growth rate in the second half year than the first half-year.  And for Chugai it was slightly stronger second half year excluding Tamiflu because some of the new products were coming through. We saw Avastin being launched at the midyear in Japan, in the autumn Tarceva and also Copegus joins Pegasys and allowed us to fully compete with the product.  All of this and the overall growth rates as I said in double-digit and also as you will see in a minute from the P&amp;L, the cost controls did allow us to move forward yet again on margins.</p>
          <p>Many of you over the recent years when we've talked about margins, I know I've been modeling how far and where can this go and all the rest of it.  I think probably since 2000, 2001, when we had our call to action reshaping, this has been a subject.  As you know for the last two, three years we've really moved on to earnings per share, but certainly every time I've asked what should we do, should we keep going on margins or should we invest in the future and profile the products?  People in this room and beyond have encouraged us we must do what's right for the mid term.</p>
          <p>That is you'll see in the rest of the presentation, what we're doing.  We've got ourselves into the top tier performance here in terms of margins.  That's where we aim to stay, but we also want to intelligently develop our future.</p>
          <p>If I just go back one to the P&amp;L, you see that the sales line up 11, royalties and another operating income was a strong performance for the year but quite a lot of this is underlying.  Over 200 million of it is regular royalty that just close in year-on-year.  Some of them were one-off gains but each year we've had one-off gains from issues like the older stock deal with GSK or when we've sold some products to the third party.  And what is it that we have we done with that money?  We've put it into funding other one-off activities. We had to write off to 135 million for Viracept last year. That was the cost to the P&amp;L.  We've also been operating on a major project of unification of our SAP systems.  These are all projects that we can tick.  So this is not something unusual in here and we do share in full transparency with you on the financial results, but nothing unusual that we need to comment on in here.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales, the fact that despite the Viracept intervention and its impact on the COGS that grew at only half the growth of the sales line.  Our colleagues around the world on marketing and distribution expenses have performed impeccably and moving as we've been signaling to you for a number of years, the more we've in specialty care, the less we have in primary care and the higher the sales that you get of a Herceptin on top of the fairly fixed field force and so on, so that starts to have a leverage on the shape of the business.</p>
          <p>As we close the year, we also have the provision in our accounts for the fine tuning of some of the primary care field forces turning back in two or three of the European markets, turning back into Mircera field force in the United States and that's all fully provided for in here.</p>
          <p>In terms of research and development, yes, you see 7.598 billion invested in R&amp;D and you could add on top of that about another 700 million in us acquiring technologies, products, companies, like THP, Alnylam.  So, a very significant belief, but innovation is at our core, innovation is the only way forward in this industry and as I hope you will see in a few minutes with the pipeline, we believe we are facing good back from good projects which will play out in the years to come.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A you may be thinking it looks a bit excessive and certainly one is always trying to chip away at the G&amp;A growth.  There are some extraordinary items like the legal cost in the United States on the Mircera judgment; it was Judge Young in Boston, but underlying that the G&amp;A did grow proportionately less than the growth in sales.  All of this resulting in the operating profit growing by twice the growth of sales.</p>
          <p>So, what lies behind this in terms of the various areas that we are operating in?  Let's start with oncology.  What you see is strong growth in the different geographies of the world and of note Europe/Rest of World actually is slightly larger in the proportionality of sales than the sales in the United States and of course in Japan the growth rate is more modest at the moment, but that's because of Avastin, Tarceva and so forth are only starting their journey into that market.</p>
          <p>What you can see on the right hand side of the chart, relative to the products in the small print at the bottom; this is taken from IMS. You can see the stellar performance of Avastin into the world markets.  It is the most successful oncology launches ever.  And when you look at the individual brands that are making this up MabThera/Rituxan still growing in its first line adoption, still growing in maintenance but we do still see growth there along side the rheumatoid arthritis sales that I'll come to a minute.</p>
          <p>For Herceptin, the penetration in the United States as you know from our Genentech colleagues is of the order of 75% of the early breast cancer markets are <mark type="inaudible" />.  In the five top European Union countries this is now approaching 70%.  And as we get probably north of 80%, we are going to be more reliant on the Rest of World on the adoption rates of the product.  There will always be a small part of the patient population that may not be suitable for therapy.  So, we'll continue to grow Herceptin around the world and of course continue to monitor carefully as somebody answered the question this morning on the HERA study that looks at the second year of treatments, does this add further to outcome or not.  Again this is event driven and somewhere this year or next year we would hope that there is an interim analysis that gives that answer.</p>
          <p>For Avastin in the United States as you will have heard from Ian Clark the major growth driver last year was in non-small cell lung cancer. In Europe it's still pretty much been in metastatic colorectal cancer in the minority part of the market that we were on label with.  We have also launched in breast cancer and as you all remember with the capping program in some of the countries and also later in the year in non-small cell lung cancer.  So those are still growth engines as we go into 2008.  Indeed the growth outside the United States that lies behind the 41% worldwide growth was a 64% growth in the Rest of World.</p>
          <p>Xeloda growing stronger at 19% both in the U.S. and non-U.S. and it's still predominantly in the adjuvant setting; very encouraging over the year-end, how the European Union is encouraging us forward on the expansion of the label and also in the United States.  We are still in discussion with the FDA on that position.</p>
          <p>For Tarceva, its non-small cell lung cancer that's the key driver at 76% growth in Europe/Rest of World and as you will remember pancreatic cancer, a smaller cancer in incidence, but certainly a nasty one I have seen in during the course of 2007.  When you look at the proportionality and this something I know Karl shared with you over time, historically we intended to look at cancer as about 50:50 U.S. and Europe and that may still be right; what is underestimated is the broader Europe to the Eastern Europe, through Middle East, Africa, through Far East and Latin America.  Certainly when you get towards early breast cancer or cancers like lung cancer where the prevalence in Asia is very strong and in Eastern Europe it's very strong, you should expect that proportionality to grow.  So with Herceptin, it's actually two-thirds of the revenue is now coming non-U.S., similarly for Xeloda, and more to come Tarceva, MabThera, and Avastin.</p>
          <p>On Avastin itself, and I am locking the potential for the product, you can see that in green we have marked where we have launched.  What you see in blue is where we have actively got work underway and this is helping you to sort of keep a track on the flushing out of what we are doing in the studies.  And just while I mentioned that you will see in the appendices through the presentation, I hope you'll find the useful summary of some of the acronyms and the names that we are using for these trials and where we are in the rollouts, just as a full memory of check point for you.  If you just take it from the market that is opening up for us.  So what you can see is that by the expansion of the colorectal market for Avastin and Xeloda, you can see that currently our European Union label for Avastin for the 5FU sector and Irinotica.  So as we've explained to many of you in the past, it's about one-third of the market that was opened to us.</p>
          <p>The new label, which we just got approval on Avastin in the last few days, and in the next few days we're expecting to come through from the European Union, the Xeloda label will for both of those products, open up the other two-thirds of the market.  For non-small cell lung cancer, you can see on the right of the screen effectively the two-thirds of the market that is covered by the label that we secured last year.  So again, we couldn't have asked for &#x2013; given our data set, we couldn't have asked for a better label to launch into that market.  And when we look at Avastin in breast cancer, again this is a rather fragmented market, but what you can see is that the target label, which we secured in Europe, opens up about 80% of the market.  And this is a really good step forward.</p>
          <p>And, what do we need to do in profiling in breast cancer?  Clearly, and I've no additional news to share with you today, but clearly there are interactions underway between Genentech and the FDA.  We have an action date at February 23rd and the data is as solid as it's always been, it was a 5:4 judgment called ODAC, and we do know that privately one of the ODAC members has changed their minds after the meeting. If that has any influence or not remains to be seen.  But it shows you there is &#x2013; there are two schools of thought here.  So we work on this to secure the label by the end of February.  We will during the course of this first half-year be getting the results from the AVADO study, which you will remember is looking at the two dosage forms for Avastin in this area.  It's not really trying to check one against the other, but to say what is the strength of signals with the regular dosage i.e. the colorectal dosage or with the higher dosage, which is what we have already on our labels.</p>
          <p>We'll also have the RIBBON-1 data, which is with the other various chemotherapies, all of which enhances the dataflow that we can build the adoptions of the European doctors.  Our adjuvant studies have started very good to see the both in HER2+ and in HER2-, that's underway and as you know the area that's outside of breast cancer but back in colorectal cancer where everybody is watching and that's the American study in the adjuvant settings for colorectal cancer.  We should have the chance of two interim reviews this year held by the Drug Safety Monitoring Board and as you know the two that were held last year encouraged us to go ahead.  So that gives the encouragement in the room on safety.  And from first principals, there is no reason why this product shouldn't be effective.  So, I think it's more a matter of knowing when is the data maturing now, that the Drug Safety Monitoring Board can at least might smoke out the chimney.</p>
          <p>What should you expect in news flow for this year?  AVADO and RIBBON-1 clearly, but we have started the Phase III in pertuzumab along with Herceptin and HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and also at the turn of the year we partnered and agreed the formal partnering on Herceptin-DM1, this is the armed antibody that delivers by using the monoclonal antibody targeting process and binding as Herceptin does now, but also then releases a toxin at the site and so you are getting almost a chemotherapy and a targeted delivery mechanism.</p>
          <p>Few years ago, we had the first molecule that did not meet our standards, what was very interesting to those of you at ASCO this last year is that there was some very good Phase I data on this molecule and that's the encouragement to move forward as quickly as we can.  The adjuvant studies, as I mentioned, starting.  In terms of metastatic colorectal, that's the data I have touched on which is already coming through.  So we will have the majority of this year to use that data in our marketing activities in Europe.</p>
          <p>And other good news that has already happened this year is the readout by the Advisory Board on chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  This is the German study group that was operating in 11 countries, significant number of patients, and it's jumped the hurdle one year earlier than planned.  So, again, very encouraging and that will be an additional submission that we will make to the authorities this year.</p>
          <p>Turning from oncology to inflammation/autoimmune, an area that we traditionally know it from CellCept.  CellCept itself did grow by 10% this last year, but what may be interesting is the richness of the asset that we are profiling now in this area.  As you know, we started with MabThera into rheumatoid arthritis into patients not responding to the anti-CNS.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to share with you that worldwide our sales are now in excess of half a billion Swiss francs in this area, so we are off to a good start.  We also have in this year the data that will come through on the profiling of MabThera in the earlier treatment settings in rheumatoid arthritis.  The first study jumped its hurdle that was the SERENE study and we did give that signal out to the markets in the last few days.  Though SERENE has met its primary end point, the other studies will play out in the course of this year and that will be the basis for us going into the authorities with the submission.</p>
          <p>Actemra as I mentioned towards the end of last year file, the action date is in the fourth quarter of this year for the United States.  So we would expect to affect a launch before the year-end.  For the European Union, we would expect by the end of this year a recommendation for approval, and also during 2007, we initiated the Phase III program on the second-generation fully humanized version of our anti-CD20 called ocrelizumab.</p>
          <p>We also initiated Phase III work driven by proof-of-concept work that we did with MabThera/Rituxan in lupus.  Other totally unmet medical needs, a high hurdle.  Yes, it's been a graveyard for many molecules, but there is a high hurdle to be jumped here, but there is some very interesting proof-of-concept data that has come through.</p>
          <p>Similarly in multiple sclerosis.  As you'll remember this last year, we saw very good results in the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis.  That's about two-thirds of the patients with MS.  For that group of patients &#x2013; and this is not comparative study data, it's just absolutely studying MabThera, but just to put in a proportionality for you, the strength of the signal is somewhere between a beta interferon and Tocabere.  So it is certainly in there with a very strong clinical signal.  Again for that population, we believe that ocrelizumab is a fully humanized version, is the appropriate one to go forward with, we need to do just a little bit more dose ranging on ocrelizumab as an enabler to Phase III and that's what's underway.</p>
          <p>So when you summarize the work that we have underway since we are a dominant feature in the anti-CD20 space, you see two lines of attack.  Second-generation, fully humanized version with less potential for immunogenicity, and enhance tolerability, shorter infusion times and greater comfort that we can give to the patient.  And we'll profile and take forward that line of work rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, lupus nephritis and also the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>We have a third generation compound that we are actively pursuing.  This comes out of the work of GLYCART, the company we acquired a couple of year ago, spin-off from ETH in Z&#xFC;rich, actually the research team originally came out of California, and this is a way of turbo boosting the activity of a monoclonal antibody, this has multiple applications beyond CD20, but on the so-called ADCC, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, this is a potentiator of the positive actions.  It also enhances apoptosis in the cancer cells and we are now into proof-of-concept.  We are in Phase I inpatient and some of those patients are patients that have not responded first-line anti-CD20.</p>
          <p>Here we have a high hurdle.  We want a product that can deliver a differentiated clinical outcome versus MabThera/Rituxan in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  So that's the high hurdle, but one that we believe we are up to addressing.</p>
          <p>So, again in this area, what should we be seeing in 2008?  The work of MabThera in earlier lines of attack on rheumatoid arthritis and the filing; Actemra, the regulatory approval quarter four; a wildcard that we should see during the first half here in the primary progressive multiple sclerosis.  One-third of the market is primary progressive, totally dissatisfied, no treatment lines at all.  This is not an area where you look at beta interferons or anything else, an unmet medical need of a high order.</p>
          <p>Now there is a reason for that because people have tried it and it hasn't worked.  There were some interesting signals early on, but it remains to be seen whether this regulatory enabling Phase II/III study indeed first of all doesn't jump the hurdle and doesn't jump in a convincing enough way that we would take that data set forward to the regulatory authorities.  And also the start of the work &#x2013; sorry, the re-launch of the work of MabThera in lupus.  So a busy time and emerging area of strength for us.</p>
          <p>In virology, Tamiflu as we touched on, it's about half a billion less in total revenues than it was last year, but at 1.9 billion so substantial.  And with the indicative guidance that we can give you for the year 2008 at the moment is a modest 100 to 106.  That's the line of sight we have at the present time.</p>
          <p>With PEGASYS, this has shown very strong growth in market share in U.S., Europe but the market itself is either flat or slightly declined.  One of the reasons for that is there are a number of new and emerging treatments so there may be a little bit of warehousing of patients waiting for the possibility of a newer outcome, I'll come to that momentarily, but for PEGASYS, we launched both PEGASYS and COPEGUS combined in Japan and that is now off to a good start, more than 25% market share as the year closed and also seeing significant growth China to Latin America to the Middle East.</p>
          <p>So it tends to be the revenue growth that's coming from the international markets, the emerging markets, the market share growth coming in these historic areas like the U.S. And as the year close, I have to say there was good news from the competitive front.  The post approval obligation which Schering-Plough had to look at two dosages of PegIntron plus ribavirin through that they added a third arm, but with a lower titration or a deeper titration on the COPEGUS dosage.  So actually they tried to skew the design of the study in favor of PegIntron by having higher ribavirin and even with that skewing of the protocol they didn't manage to get the differentiation.  So actually when you do any form of modeling that compensates for that ribavirin dosage, PEGASYS is still the class act.  PEGASYS has still gross margin share product in this area.</p>
          <p>If we then turn to what we are developing forward, sorry maybe pro memoria just to help in the modeling here, that just remind you on the quarterly figures of Tamiflu between pandemic and to allow you and I would just draw your attention as we start this year, we have to wash out quarter one, quarter two 2007, 1.2 billion in the first half year and the line of sight here I remind you is 100 and 150 for this year, total year.</p>
          <p>In terms of hepatitis C, because it's the key product now, PEGASYS is being used by a number of companies that are trying to profile new molecules &#x2013; small molecules, trying to enhance the outcome, particularly for genotype I patients.</p>
          <p>For that area, it's principally two modes of actions polymerase and protease.  That we have within the Roche mandate and in-house polymerase, a polymerase one patient with Pharmasset and the protease inhibitor we partnered with InterMune.</p>
          <p>All are early, you can see it between Phase I and Phase II, all delivering rather interesting reductions in viral load, and still there are issues that we need to address. Within the Roche polymerase that the more advanced, as I have shared with this audience and beyond in the last &#x2013; part of last year, we saw some neutropenias.  We believe that we can try and titrate because neutropenia is not just from the investigational drug, it can also come from the underlying interferon and particularly from rhinovirus.  So, we are trying to titrate and see is there something in the dosing that we're &#x2013; we can see the sweet spot of the viral load reduction, but with tolerable toxicity.</p>
          <p>And there are similar stories to unfold in each of our assets, but we do believe that we can profile these strongly as assets for the future.  Also I should say that many of the potential competitors for these products also have, PEGASYS as the fundamental care in their study.  So for the years to come, PEGASYS will be a mainstay of.</p>
          <p>Turning to metabolism and bone, BONIVA exited the year in the United States was more than 50% market share in patient, performing well, holding up to the onslaught of two rather noisy competitors and making its way and as you would see from the sales its rapid approaching 1 billion in turnover.  So this product is on track.</p>
          <p>With Xenical essentially the launch of OTC Alli in the United States for GSK on which we receive royalties and milestone payments, is performing well, but it takes the edge off the revenues that we get from the prescription brand essentially.</p>
          <p>More importantly, may be then Xenical or Nutropin for our discussions today are what are we doing on our pipelines.  Now I don't need to tell the people in this room that HDL is our future frontier in terms of cardiovascular risk reductions and the CETP inhibition is an elegant way of approaching this were it not for torcetrapib.  And what we have done is to send the best part of last year understanding the background deepening our understanding of the levers that need to be pulled here and of the role of HDL and of the type, the shape or form of HDL that we should be looking for, it's not just as uniform as LDL is, it's not such a simple story.</p>
          <p>But, when we look at own CETP inhibitor that we partnered with Japan Tobacco.  We can see what we have in our hands is a well-tolerated product with none of the cardiovascular exposure that torcetrapib has.  No interference with the interferon (4322) pathway that we now know is the principal liability of that compound. We've looked at it in some considerable details in our own laboratories as well as studying with external laboratories.  So, we do know that we have a product that is Phase to take into Phase III, we know that we have a positive effect on HDL.  We know that we do not have the liabilities of torcetrapib.  We have discussed this index with many key investigators around the world.  I personally have had a number of meetings with these people along side or ahead of developments.  Wasn't an important decision for Roche and we have also had interactions with those at Food and Drug Administration and the European Authorities. It is clear and this was put on the table by ourselves that given the torcetrapib experience this would require a mortality morbidity study.  So it's a 15,000 plus patient study that will be run around the world and this we are ready for, able for and I hope you will come with us on the journey.</p>
          <p>What we have also tried to do in the structuring of the designing and in looking at the safety monitoring board, in looking at other studies that we can do that continues to profile the benefits and the chances of success.  We have those at gated time points where we know that we can take the necessary decisions including, for example, futility analyses at the appropriate point to know if this is absolutely spot on.  So that's a way of gating expenditure but the thing is we have got an excellent asset in our hands, and we are taking it forward to places.</p>
          <p>Turning to the other key program that will be coming through this year, on the basis of the first Phase II, Phase IIb study that we have had on our GLP-1 partnered with Ipsen, really encouraging, a good once a week profile, clear administrations, clear dose response, clear any aspect that are clear, highly competitive, we know it.  We even had one of our competitors join the conference call this morning, wanting to hear what we are saying about it.  So you will have to forgive us if we are a little bit more suspect in how much data we share.  But we do have an instinct molecule here.  We are aiming for a best in class profile.  We still have another Phase II data set to come in, some of the interactions with the authorities on the Phase III program, but we are fully budgeted for the year that we will go into Phase III and that would happen in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>So again what do we expect moving forward out of our portfolios in 2008 period into Phase III first patients recruited probably beginning in quarter two. GLP-1 should move into Phase III second half. We will be sharing the first Phase II data at an appropriate congress during the year and further back in Phase II and this is a more difficult path to go down, the DPP-IVs, which we know we are a complex class, there we set the hurdle very high. We are not going to go forward into Phase III unless we've got clarity on the differentiated profile, and that would have to include weight loss. We also with the PPAR alpha gamma have some really interesting dimensions that we are seeing in Phase II. We know it's a regulatory difficult path to go down. So again, we will take that data. We will worry it through and we will look ourselves in the eye and say is this the right asset to go forward with.</p>
          <p>So, from there to what's the outlook in some of the catalyst; as usual we share with you the tracker or the says what would play out on the delivery times of our Roche managed submissions. So this is not including the profile of what will compute my colleagues in Chugai or in Genentech and you can see for this year a couple of significant line extensions for Avastin. One of them has a higher hurdle to cross than the other and that's pancreatic cancer.</p>
          <p>Tarceva and Avastin in non-small cell lung cancer second line. If that jumps the hurdle, this would be an enormous validation of targeted, targeted therapies. MabThera, in the general RA population I am pleased to add to that the CLL indication from MabThera as well. As you know we have significant Phase III programs running but this is just to try and show you the message of the breadth of the trials moving into Phase III, some of which only started towards the end of 2007 like Avastin into metastatic breast cancer. It's a huge program, it's part of a global program. Actually believe it or not, it includes more than 200,000 patients that we have in clinical trials somewhere in the world on our products. So when people talk to us about pricing and medicine and access programs I believe we are doing a very incredible access program around the world based on it.</p>
          <p>That should in turn provide the food for growth for the sustainable growth of the company over the years to come. We believe in the richness and the depth of the programs. We have assets in our hands. Ladies and gentlemen, from last year that will be the food for growth, going forward. We have these interesting molecules and significant line extensions to profile for the mid-term security of the company, and I hope that you are encouraged as I am by the richness and the depth of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>This will give you the scorecard upon which to track us for the coming year, and let me just summarize the point on &#x2013; that lie behind the divisional above market growth. Our estimate of the market for this year will be 45% growth for the world markets. We believe that we can grow above that as you have heard at high single-digits. We have to part to one side the pandemic sales of Tamiflu in that assessment for regular business for tracking, and there will be out of our revenue lines for the best part of 1.7 billion that will have to walk out of Tamiflu revenues and profits.</p>
          <p>So that's how the Pharma Division speeds into the overall picture and with that I would now like to hand across to Severin, to take you into the Diagnostics business. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to lead you again through the Diagnostics results one more time before J&#xFC;rgen Schwiezer will take over. It has been an extraordinary successful, a special year for Diagnostics. We on the one hand could build on our market position in a number of new products, but even more importantly we could strengthen our overall structure, overall position with a number of transactions, licensing agreements, and acquisitions. And I will come back to this in a moment. Let's start first with the sales result.</p>
          <p>Overall, 6% growth in local currencies, 7% in Swiss francs as you can see the strong growth in Professional Diagnostic with 8% primarily driven by the immunology business. Diabetes care has been picking up, we are now at 5%, I will come back to this in a moment. Molecular Diagnostics, minus 2% due to the loss of the industrial business following the expiry of the PCR patent. If we would correct for this we would have grown by 3%. Applied Science is doing very well with 11% growth driven by the sequencing business.</p>
          <p>You can see that the growth momentum has accelerated over the last three years and as we go forward I will expect it to continue. With this, we have also kept our clear number one position in the in-vitro Diagnostics market 19% share with Siemens now in second place 13% share.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the P&amp;L. As you can see we have increased our operating margin to 17.6%. If we then again look into the individual cost items, these are actually very much distorted by one-off item. You see a slight development in cost of sale, a slight development in R&amp;D, that is the result of the impairments which we had in 2006. Conversely, if you look at general and administration, we had a number of one-off items positioned for legal and environmental matters. We have restructuring provisions for BioVeris and also some one-off VAT tax issues.</p>
          <p>Let's go into the business areas, Professional Diagnostics primarily driven by immunochemistry. This is the biggest segment in the market. We are growing twice the market speed with strong instrument placements and a good pickup of novel markers such NT-proBNP.</p>
          <p>Diabetes Care is now really recovering from the decline of our former flagship product, the Accu-Chek Advantage. You can see that the new product start to kick in and offset the evolution of the Accu-Chek Advantage and that should continue as we go into 2008.</p>
          <p>Molecular Diagnostics, the core business virology is growing through the solid 4% primarily driven by our strong CAP/CTM platform. This is the mid throughput platform which we launched already very successfully in Europe and we have now introduced this platform in the U.S. Blood screening is flat, very competitive price sensitive market.  And as I mentioned before hand, the industrial business is declining as expected due to the expiry of the PCR patent.</p>
          <p>Now, 2007 has been a very special year by completing our portfolio of technologies. If you can see we have now a much, much stronger position on the research side, where we entered with 454 Life Sciences and NimbleGen, and also BioVeris in the immunochemistry area. And certainly, with Ventana we entered the important tissue-based market segment.</p>
          <p>Now, that on the one hand strengthens our core business but it also enables us to give a better for support from the diagnostic side to the Pharma business along the whole value of chains.  Keep in mind that if we talk about personalized healthcare, it's not a matter of developing the drug and then you add a companion diagnostics at the end of the day.  This is a very concurrent focus, which starts very early on in the research after the commercialization. And as you can see, we can satisfy the demand from the very beginning through the commercialization along the various technologies.</p>
          <p>Now, shortly to Ventana, Ventana is the clear leader in tissue-based diagnostics, about 300 million turnover and 1,000 people based in Tucson, Arizona.  The tender offer of $89.50 will expire on the 7th of February.  With this we expect the closing in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Now this is certainly a very attractive offer to the shareholders of Ventana but it does reflect the strategic value this business has for us and it also reflects the value which we put to a friendly takeover that together with existing management we can accelerate the integration out of Tucson.</p>
          <p>Ventana offers us important synergies within the Diagnostics business especially our know-how and our capabilities around detection of protein markers and of nucleic acid markers.  But even more important is that in the combination of Ventana and Roche, we can now give full support to particularly in the area of oncology that indicates of solid human tissue-based testing.  It's very, very important to identify bio-markets and eventually develop companion diagnostics along the way.</p>
          <p>It has been a very busy year for us.  We have completed three acquisitions with NimbleGen, 454 and BioVeris and we have signed a merger agreement for Ventana last week.  What I would like to point out is that this is not just a random series of acquisition for the sake of participating in the overall consolidation within the diagnostics industry.  This is very, very targeted acquisitions, very much aligned with our overall strategy.  And our overall strategy clearly is for medical outcome.  Also in Diagnostics, like in Pharma, we have a number of diseases where we do not have proper tests or where we do have no tests at all.  And the enabler for this strategy is eventually the progress in science.  It's the progress in molecular biology and we believe at Roche that is exactly now our servings can build.  We're the leader in genomics and the life science area.</p>
          <p>We're the leader in Molecular Diagnostics.  We are the leading company in immunochemistry.  We are cutting-edge in proteomics and as you know we are the biggest biotech company in the pharma world and if you look at these acquisitions, they build exactly on those strengths.  This NimbleGen and 454 in genomics with BioVeris in immunochemistry and with Ventana of making the link in the important area of oncology between the Pharma and the Diagnostics Division.</p>
          <p>With this, I am very confident that also for 2008 we will continue the momentum and outgrow the market.  Thank you very much.  Erich?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  At this time of today and at the end of my colleague has not too much to be added, so I will be relatively short, at least, we have enough time for Q&amp;A.  So, 2007 was a strong year.  We have to practice here, we have addressed it in the conference call together this morning.  And I hope as we put on this chart that we have increased again our transparency, listening to you as our key customers and adding more and more information into the reporting for you to really charge performance of this company.</p>
          <p>One point which is not on this chart but which is extremely important in parallel to actually increasing the transparency to the external partners, we also think from my side that we have made huge progress within the management information system at Roche internally.  We had all the 250 senior managers together last week in a senior management meeting and we discussed the performance through '07 in detail and the outlook into 2008.  And I read everything you write and did say 2007 was a smooth year.  They actually were conservative at the beginning and in the end it's a brilliant year.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, it's not that easy.  If we really see how we started 2007 and how we ended 2007, that was not just doing the <mark type="inaudible" />.  There were many, many decisions for instance taken around Mircera in the United States, which was a major project and we were very flexible to adapt to the developments, which were happening there.  Or if you read that we have sold out on pale products in the Pharma business, this is not forgetting one-time effect.  What we have realized there are restructuring charges.  We have realized that for instance, the primary care business for some years to come in Europe has a political math.  We have sold the old health products to third party staff.  Builds have taken the consequences particularly and has actually very quietly.  We haven't heard anything about this.  Actually, it moves more than 350 out of this office.  We actually constantly adapt to how things develop and I think that's the important thing for me that I have trust at Roche as the information <mark type="inaudible" />.  We have almost online information at hands to make proper management decision.</p>
          <p>The figures you have seen here and as I dare to say on the morning call, we can be a little bit proud of these figures but you can be really assured when we had the team together last week this is not the celebration, yet we were proud, but it was always and you have heard this me saying several times nobody gives you anything for the past, but it is a good platform to go into the future.  Auction and here also the two sides of a coin, we have the conference calls and the media conference. And I can tell you I had three microphones actually here, and said how can you justify that you make so much money on <mark type="inaudible" />. And then the reaction was the same as we are saying here.  My question was then mainly other institutions or company who spend over 8 billion in research and innovation, in investments. And so the dialogue has to be always around innovation.  Of course, we are pleased that it goes into the right direction but at the same time, just with these things to the public who decides it. We are also under real scrutiny and within the position of the society.</p>
          <p>And therefore, and I think if you look at this P&amp;L, this is a P&amp;L which is not only attractive for investors but I think this is also an P&amp;L which is coming as acceptable for society because it's true, we are a high-tech healthcare company putting a lot of efforts into producing complex instruments but also complex therapeutical activities in the pharma sector, that we have our marketing and distribution under control and that we have a very, very clear commitment into innovation. And also and I said this morning, I repeat this this morning, also our behavior pattern might be anti-cyclical but we are not bad as no major projects were killed.  We're actually quite excited that we in parallel have to really expand, and I can tell you along the two projects some of you have started to focus, easy and cyclic; we are talking about several 100 million just for 2008 in additional costs to get these projects started.  Because we also understand, competition is out there and it's either first in class or it's best in class.  So we cannot &#x2013; it's either really a go or a no go, and the good news for Roche is, it looks very much like a good go.</p>
          <p>I've broken down just as one example, the G&amp;A cost also for you to make it clear that we are not going over the top in G&amp;A and administration cost, on the contrary.  But you see the consequences of the restructuring cost of the sales force in Europe, and also of course we immediately reacted when Mircera was not on the market in the United States. The respective people we had built up were also players in an active manner for actually giving this cost.  We saw that we had some cyclic mitigation cost in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Coming into the financial field, nothing spectacular and I may say good that nothing is spectacular.  You know that we have more 20 billion in liquid funds and altogether the hits we took out of the so called financial crisis was actually quite minimal, 68 million we have beared and of this actually 8 million are really lost and the others was a reassessment of certain bonds.  So altogether a healthy picture, we are constantly de-layering debt.  In this ongoing year, we will have 2.2 billion Swiss francs of debt actually to be repaid and we are going on in this direction.</p>
          <p>Good news and that was positive and this is not by coincidence, that was an ambition for several years but taxes take a lot of time.  You have first to close the history, then you can build the future and there is no gap allowed between the history, historic behavior and the actual and the future behavior.  But the good news is that the Roche core tax rate as of this year could be sustainable for the future as we were able to really sit together with authorities in the various places in Switzerland where we are doing business and actually have so called ruling factors &#x2013; now I'm doing some marketing for Switzerland, that's a big difference to the country.  You can actually go there and you put your facts on the table and then you actually negotiate with them and you get an unlimited link as long as you are behaving where you have closed. We are actually on safe legal ground. That's of quite high value, especially when the end of the negotiations those are two expenses.</p>
          <p> We spend which maybe is also not typical because you are used &#x2013; the higher &#x2013; the better the return is, the higher the risk is and I was quite pleased that with our officers at the end of the audit committee when I had presented this stuff they actually stood up and they confirmed that they &#x2013; the value at risk has actually also reduced.</p>
          <p>EPS, good trend, equity good trend, balance sheet, quite strong.  Karl Mahler and myself do a lot of road shows and you may allow me that when we presented the Roche results yesterday to our own managers, I mean I made the comment, we travel very often to Singapore to Abu Dhabi and to Kuwait, but the good news is we don't have to offer discount to our shares there.</p>
          <p>So, net cash in a good shape and as we've said, we are actively monitoring, at the moment we have about 180 companies on our radar screen from tiny startups to bigger ones, but we're following them actively with a traffic light system.  Red means at the moment a killer, don't touch, yellow really have a monitoring and green where things are working even on due diligence and the fascinating thing is in this field a red can turn into a green very quickly.  The things are constantly moving.  It's not like somebody is there to say, oh, we have looked at this price so many times but sometimes they suddenly start to look attractive.  So that's the payout ratio.  I know that we didn't spoil you last year with the share price. At least I think as now in other marketing arguments plus the dividend yields.  Now it's about 2% and with Franz having made a very clear commitment that he wants to increase the payout ratio, I mean this also make Roche attractive for people who go out for constant value.  So, you have our objectives for 2008 and I won't read it again.</p>
          <p>I think this now starts us open for your questions.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>With that ladies and gentlemen, I think we have got approximately half an hour for your questions.  Who wants to kick us off please and I think there are microphones around the room.  Please, let me start here with the lady.</p>

          <p>Ken Yeo at Dresdner Kleinwort. I just had a couple of questions on products.  Just on Herceptin, you mentioned in Europe that in the top five countries it's kind of nearing the 70% penetration rate.  I'm just wondering how much further you think it's going to go there, whether it's nearing peak?  And, also what the actual length of time is that people are using Herceptin?  Is it the full twelve months or is it, are people using it a little bit less, a little bit more? And, then secondly just on Avastin, I was just wondering the feedback that you're getting in terms of what doctors are deciding on the dose to use, particularly in lung and in breast cancer, whether it tends to be the higher dose or lower dose and is it varying much by country to country?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Herceptin with the adoption rate, 70% in top five and as I mentioned a little bit earlier, I think by the time we get north of 80% we'll start to see it slowing down.  It's still interesting even in some countries there is a vast array of access.  It's getting slightly &#x2013; the good news for those in the room is, it's getting slightly better in the UK but we've been having to track for the Department of Health the adoption rates and there were times when you had a twelve-fold greater chance of getting hold of Herceptin in the counties towards the south than in the North of England.  So there was a vast disparity in the adoption rate across the country and there are similar disparities in some of the other markets but as best as we can tell it is of the order of 70%, 80% I think we could maybe start to see it slow down, but for your modeling purposes please don't underestimate royalty income. The stunning results that this product brings are appreciated by many people including all of you.</p>
          <p>For the length of duration in Europe I would say it's predominately the 12 months, there are always some that try to get away with a little bit less.  There is still this quirky study out of Helsinki, which had a nine-week duration and some people including even PHARMAC in New Zealand, though fortunately it's still contained to very small markets, they really have thought well, we will just get reimbursement for nine weeks even although it is clear from the data the signal is not the same signal as you get with one year. So I feel sorry for the ladies that are in those countries, because they are not getting the full benefit, they're getting a marginal benefit, but it's predominately one year and people are interested in seeing what will happen with the second year of therapy.</p>
          <p>For Avastin, still one would say very much as we've guided you over the years. For Europe, the typical medical school would be starting low and only going higher if you need more therapy.  So the majority, as we tried to guide you, will probably be at the lower dosage and the minority at upper dosage.  And there is a little bit of a school of medicine thought, I think you will find this a touch more in Germany than you'd find in Latin Europe or here in the UK for Avastin in general, we are still not endorsed by NICE.  You've probably read there are people that have sued the government to try and be able to pay for Avastin on top of their therapy.  I got a rather frosty look from some of the people close to the Department of Health and they said, no, no, no, we must have a one tier system.  And I said well, I think some form of co-pay is probably going to be required over the years to come.  Oh, no, no, no, we don't believe in co-pays.</p>
          <p>Well, excuse me, what is the prescription charge in this country if it's not a form of co-pay?  What is it that if you go in to get your spectacles, on the National Health Service you can get Harry Potter, but if you want something that's wearable, you pay for the rest.  So co-pay does exist in this country.  If you want a filling in any of your teeth you will be outside the National Health Service.  So there is a co-pay form, but I am just trying to evidence you here in your own home country what we are up against in one market.  The good news for society is that some other countries are faster in the adoption.</p>

          <p>Clearly, and indeed good point, Franz, because one of the questions was what will happen after the AVAiL study to the use in lungs in America.  Will they move back to the lower doses?  The answer is not.  I think they were at 25% low dose, 75% high dose before the AVAiL study and it's now about 30/70, so a little erosion but nothing of a drama because the medical school said start high and only ease back at tolerability of the problem, it's a different medical school.</p>

          <p>Craig Maxwell at JPMorgan.  If you could, could you just give a little bit more color on the international markets on the oncology franchise?  Outside of U.S. and Europe, about how big would it be now? And then I guess with these drugs timing is critical, in the next five years what percentage of global sales could that be for your oncology franchise? But it's just really on the thing of how quickly it becomes a real important earner.  And then on the CETP, I am just a little bit confused, enrolling a 15,000 patient program which is obviously very big and the ATC is in March that will be a really good opportunity to basically advertise that your safety data is good, so can you confirm whether or not you have actually submitted an abstract to the ATC on the CETP?</p>

          <p>Question on international markets.  It's not something that I would tend to track and we have taken a view that we wouldn't break out another column and say here is U.S., Japan, Europe and then another column for rest of world.  But you do get a flavor for it when we show the proportionality of some of the key products that are like Herceptin where historically people would have thought 50:50 U.S. and Europe, but we see it's now two thirds, so that additional 15, 16% or so tends to be from those markets, is a reasonable straw poll for it.  I haven't got in my mind a separate forecast of compound growth rates because...</p>

          <p>And it also varies from product-by-product, it varies from country-to-country.  And if we, over the last couple of years still, look at Russia we can see that with the resources that Russia has acquired they're within reimbursement programs all of a sudden for deadly diseases and for cancer which has significantly boosted our sales of oncology product in Russia, for example.</p>

          <p>It's an interesting question. And see when we set out on that journey of marketing specialty products, we had countries in Latin America, in Asia who said well those will be very difficult to sell here and they had 70% of their sales in what I would call the old product which Roche had. Today if you look at those countries they have significant growth rates. They have improved their market share positions and between 70 and 80% of their sales would be in the high value specialty products. So there has taken place a significant shift also in those countries because more and more people can afford those drugs and that shift is taking place much faster than we sometimes expect. The ATC one?</p>

          <p>So the 15,000 patients that will get up and running, we are not planning and I've no practical knowledge that it's the ATC that we are targeting for that data as yet. It's not decided which particular meeting. The interesting thing is here we are now into a two-horse race as far as I am concerned, it's between ourselves and Merck and it will be highly contested, highly competitive, and our team will choose the right moment. But clearly as a positive signal I would agree with you, but we have the opportunity with the clinical brochures and the people who work with on a confidential basis, as the recruiters in the studies, here with them without necessarily putting it up in the broad speech for Merck to benefit from. We'll pace ourselves here but as soon as we know at which congress we are sharing that data, we will &#x2013; through Karl's office we'll mention it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Bill Meurner, CC Securities (80.13). I have two questions on products. First on GLP-1 can you give us a bit more color on the reasoning for what some of us feel is a delay, because we could have expected an early announcement, earlier in the year for the Phase III decision? Have there been any new facts? What is the difference between the Phase II study that is ongoing and the previous one? And would -- are you expecting Phase II results from the study before to make a decision? And second question on Tamiflu, when do you expect storage replacements to catch up and new significant sales to come from government buying, will it be <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all on GLP-1 we are not delaying, we are not dragging our heels. The second Phase II study explored higher dosages than the first Phase II study, and we want to see the full data set and to be able even to do some pharmacokinetic modeling to make sure we've got the sweet spot between the control of glucose, the weight loss, and the potential side effects. So the whole thing we'll look at very carefully and that's part of the work that we're doing in the first six months of this year.</p>
          <p>Maybe the difference between our approach and other companies' approach, some companies when they've made the decision to go forward with Phase III, announce that as a Phase III decisions, I respect it. In our world, we usually only communicate the entry to any given phase when the first patient has been administered. So that may also be contributing. I mean, we're in very close contact with our partners at Ipsen. It's a very strongly working team, and we're doing I think what is right here to make sure we've got the strongest differentiated profile that we should give to this product range. That's in all our interest.</p>
          <p>For the DTP 4, we're still waiting on the results for the Phase II data, which we'll have during the course of this year to know whether there is weight loss or not.  And, indeed what's the strength of the other component parts of the signal, as to whether we go ahead or not. High hurdle, I will see the data when it comes in and very cool-headedly will look at it.  If we track and follow what's been happening from Januvia to Galvus it's not always compelling to know what should happen next.  And whether indeed given the different mechanisms of action that are playing out in the diabetes, is this the right one to go.  I'd remind you we're also working with glucokinase activator inhibitors and we're also working on SGLT.  So there are different mechanisms and placing the right horse in the race is as important as the race.  So I think it's going to be interesting.</p>
          <p>For Tamiflu, at the moment, my advice to you would be not to model what the future holds for this. And why do I say that?  The bulk materials that we've sold to governments have probably a 10-year shelf.  The capsules would have a five-year shelf life and we do have a business model that we're out testing with one or two governments at the moment, to rework that data, to rework the materials and replace it at a lesser price than they paid first time round.  But we haven't got any buy into that growth.  This would be a little bit like we are selling an insurance policy and on the main policy that people took out for a five year period, on the renewal of the policy they get a no claims discount. It's got that sort of feel to it.</p>
          <p>But some governments, including the United States, have already computer simulated that they could increase the shelf life from the five years and that I think it what the U.S. has done.  So those are the technical background.</p>
          <p>What also needs to happen is that there is the political will of governments who want to keep stockpiling.  The issue has not gone away.  The World Health Organization says we are as at risk as ever.  But as you see changes in governments and maybe no particular surrogate signals of the avian outbreaks from the scientists, mind you if you were to talk to the Indian government right now they are having to kill millions of the flock because they do have outbreak.  We've seen culling of the flocks here in the United Kingdom.  UK government is mobilized, is activated, but there is a change of premier, there is a change of Prime Minister.  We are in an election year in the United States.  So predicting how it features on the political agenda for a government is rather difficult.  So I think it &#x2013; I would be rather prudent in looking out 2009, '10.  That's why we are also giving you a prudent guidance here.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, clearly our approach which has been different to the torcetrapib approach, which I think Pfizer was looking at this more as a Lipitor line extension.  We have been profiling our product in combination with a variety of statins. So this would be add on, it would be two tablets once a day -- that's the profile that we take into the study.  In terms of partnering, no, we &#x2013; no decision to bring a third party into this.  We already have a partner in Japan Tobacco, they are not participating in the development cost, but they are a partner.</p>
          <p>We will look at the market closer to launch and take a view, what are the dynamics of that market and the creation of that market.  If I am to believe the publicity from Merck, at the moment we're about a year ahead.  But it's always hard to judge in these areas, there can be misinformation as much as information &#x2013; I believe we're about a year ahead.  So late stage, if we need more share of voice we can look at do we build field force for it or we do a short-term co-promotion with somebody or rent-a-rep if that's necessary.  At the moment, our mindset is that we are doing this ourselves.</p>
          <p>In terms of what we're building in, there is some work, from memory, Sachin, the imaging work which some see the eye versus some of the other elements that people have been following, would not lead out earlier.  So there is an element here that we are doing a number of partner studies to try and help us on understanding some of the dimensions of the product going forward, but it's &#x2013; I don't believe it's including imaging studies.  And the imaging work has had mixed press on whether this is a real predictor of outcome.</p>
          <p>Then to the partnering activities.  The single largest element I think this last year for Pharma would be Alnylam and an Alnylam doesn't come along every day.  So it's not a matter of a budget figure that we look at each year, it's more a matter of these are ripe and interesting assets and given the financial warchest that Erich's the custodian of, we know that if we find the right assets then we'll do right things.</p>
          <p>But it's &#x2013; I know it's rather difficult for you to model, but it's not something that we are obsessed on a budget dimension for.  If you want to take it on a broader basis, personal view would be that we should have that rich diversity of our own discovery efforts, but we should never close our mind to what happens outside of our walls.  So there is a huge amount of creative mindsets outside of the company.  I would personally be happy if two-thirds to three-quarters of the innovation came internally through Roche, Genentech, Chugai, and a quarter to a third was enriched from the outside &#x2013; would be a comfortable feel for the portfolios.  Not a financial number, it's more an intellectual shaping.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bertrand Menier from Exane BNP Paribas.  The first question is, do you foresee any change in the current pricing environment in Europe, and notably for Avastin, and especially in breast cancer the high dose.  Second question on the GLP-1; is there any chance to see in Phase III, the once daily and the twice monthly dose?  And the final question is on Rituxan in primary progressive MS.  Can you directly file with the Phase II, Phase III data that you expect in H1 '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The pricing environment in Europe; first of all maybe a broad issue on Europe. Over recent years when we looked at our business plans, we typically see as a result of the various instruments of torture that member governments use to break out with every now and again, that we lose roughly two percentage points of growth on an annual basis.  Some of that is price competition, the majority of it is interventions from the government, and they just break ranks, I mean coming from Exane in France you know well, you reach a position where you have a convention with the government, and there is a change of Health Minister and all bets are off and he just says I want this.  So there's always that political agenda that we have to contend with, but it's about two percentage points.</p>
          <p>Specifically to Avastin, as a part of all of that the interesting element here is that the higher dosage for Avastin at the moment has not proven to be tricky. We have a large, almost like a registry in Germany, which is allowing us to move forward well and that is not proving troublesome.  We have countries that historically are more tricky in pricing like Italy, but Rome has now agreed on reimbursement for Avastin in breast cancer.  It remains to be seen how strong the uptick is in regions of the budgets.  But if necessary we will put in place what's needed there.  So it does tend to be more of a battleground every now and again, but I would say that there is not a step change on any of our products in pricing, neither Avastin nor Herceptin for early breast cancer or whatever.</p>
          <p>In terms of GLP-1, I think if I remember the correct -- the question was on once daily and the twice monthly.  The once daily data, we do have that data.  I am not sure where we and Ipsen have got in terms of releasing it, but if we felt that it would be not in our interest from a patent point of view, we probably wouldn't release it early because it's not the product we are going for.</p>
          <p>We have an obligation in all studies to publish it, it's a matter what is the right moment and when we are getting ready for launching it.  The twice-monthly data, I think it is premature at the moment.  It's a bit of a long shot.  Primary progressive multiple sclerosis with MabThera; that study has been designed but it would be suitable for a regulatory filing if the strength of the clinical signal is there this would be a single study, and typically for a regulatory authority they like to see two studies, they are always ready in an area of complete unmet medical need to look at one study provided the signals is there and that's what we have to wait for.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Amit Roy from Citigroup.  A few questions, firstly on rituximab and ocrelizumab. Rituxan is a very potent drug, <mark type="inaudible" /> 93:14) it should work, but in a sense how do you &#x2013; when you come to ocrelizumab, how you are going to position this?  I know the argument of it's humanized, but Rituxan does &#x2013; you don't get much tumor lysis or you don't get any tumor lysis Syndrome, which is a lot of the basis for the infusion rate of reaction we have seen with Rituxan in cancer. In the inflammation setting Rituxan is actually pretty safe, so how you are going to sort of position that in SLE and RA when Rituxan will be there first at clearly a lower price. I assume you'd want to obviously increase the pricing of Ocrelizumab?  First question.  Second question, following on from your point about getting reimbursement for Avastin in Europe.  Do you see the lack of overall survival in the oxaliplatin combination of Avastin obviously on the labels but in terms of reimbursement do you think the lack of OS is going to have an issue with regulatory authorities, I should say reimbursement authorities such as Italy for example you mentioned in Europe?  And then the third point on that, is there any cause for the FDA to have any reason to look at that particular study &#x2013; the 966 study from an FDA perspective?  I don't think there is, but just to make sure that there isn't?  And lastly, in terms of &#x2013; on Avlantia I saw on the wires, on Bloomberg that 10 billion R&amp;D spent, and I was asked by Mike Carr to the ask the question of whether that was true for '08, so I'm asking that question. If you could shed some light on that that would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the shopping list.  So Rituxan, B cells &#x2013; at one level, you are absolutely correct.  There is a certain built-in mechanism by its very action on B cells that protects it against some of the neutralizing antibodies and so forth that you see with monoclonal antibodies.  However, the majority of our data exist in the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma settings, and as we know from a number of immunosuppressants, when you start to look at them in longer-term chronic diseases such as lupus, such as nephritis, such as multiple sclerosis, you can see more idiosyncratic responses.  So not only do we think it is a correct thing to do to go with the fully humanized version in working with a number of the clinicians they fully agree and they believe this is particularly in America this is a strong differentiator.  There will be other dimensions to the product we can build in. As an example, we are looking at elements like infusion times, relatively long infusion times.  For people with a chronic condition, elements like that would be further differentiation.</p>
          <p>So we've worked on the clinical differentiation, we've recognized that this will have to justify at the time of launch a potential pricing difference between a biosimilar and this brand that's fully built in to our thoughts and calculations.  And of course I would not &#x2013; I'd be remiss if I did not at least put on the table for this audience that we do have a longer patent term.  So in terms of starting now, it is also commercially more interesting to put this into a product with a longer term output commercially.  So I think there is quite a lot that we are doing on this whole CD20 franchise and trying to take those different factors into account.</p>
          <p>Reimbursement of Avastin, now the interesting element here is that it's not so much the difference between time to progression or overall survival benefits.  When it comes to pricing and reimbursement it's a quite different game that gets played.  I had the opportunity with our Health Economics people of visiting Mike Rollings at NICE the other week and what we took him through just to make sure he is fully aware of this, if you were to take the case of Avastin in breast cancer and the time that it has achieved for ladies with breast cancer based on the U.S. studies and the modeling. By the time you look at the incremental Taxotere that you'd need, if you look at the cost of administrating the Taxotere and handling the side effects of Taxotere and you were to look at the cost of an infusion of anything on top already you would be in trouble with the UK's arithmetic model even if the drug was free.  So there are certain societies in which I come from one, and we all &#x2013; those of us in this room come from, where it is a rather arithmetic modeling that takes part.</p>
          <p>What is much more encouraging is the way in which some of our Scandinavian colleagues look at a more societal role for drugs. Or indeed in France a much more individualistic role, saying we can't deny this benefit to an individual patient that was the differentiator in the French government giving Herceptin before we'd even submitted the dossier for European Medicines' approval.  And they were giving full reimbursement on Herceptin in breast cancer and ladies in Britain were having to take the government to court.  These were the differentiators. So it's not the subtleties between time to progression and then overall survival that play out on this reimbursement avenue at all.</p>
          <p>It's interesting to see sometimes these hurdles are put in place a bit like a fourth hurdle by the regulatory authority. We have many products in Europe but there are still &#x2013; they have been approved on tumor shrinkage.  We have some others that are rather recent additions to the marketplace that are on a surrogate marker time to progression.  And we have others that have been approved on overall survival.  So there is even a consideration that's given and I would remind you we had an extraordinarily difficult battle to get with full high statical power Tarceva in pancreatic cancers, there was indirect fourth hurdle playing out here.  So it is politics as much as medicine as much as economics as much as arithmetic that we are having to contend with here and it's not always so easy to do but the colleagues that I have around Europe are well used to this environment country-by-country and do find their ways.  And that's part of the reason why Avastin is selling as well as it is.  I am sorry I missed the question on the FDA, whether they would want to...</p>

          <p>Some of the 966 and the other data sets we are using along side Xeloda and it will be profiled and we are looking to work with the FDA so that some of that data also is on the Xeloda label.  I don't think there is any reason, given where Genentech is with the Avastin label that it would be automatically on the Avastin. So I don't see a change there.</p>
          <p>And then your final intriguer from Bloomberg &#x2013; 10 billion the final frontier.  Just to remind you when you look at the figures this year we are already in excess if you take the absolute P&amp;L on R&amp;D plus the partnering work that we have done we are over 8 &#x2013; Ian? 8.2 billion.  So if we are going into another year of growing stronger on the R&amp;D line than we are on the sales line, it's not wild.  It may not crack some magical number but it's not wild. What's fascinating just as a reflection for you, certainly this year we will probably be spending as much on research and development as this corporation had in turnover 10 years ago, which tells you the journey that we have been on and how far we have come.</p>

          <p>Let me just repeat the very same comment I think I made a year ago on that point.  And that is we are very happy and we will continue with our model with Genentech and Chugai.  It is not our intention to acquire 100% and integrate any of these companies.  As we ourselves in Roche for various reasons don't have the ability to buy back shares, one of the ways we can use our cash and in some cases this may make sense, we can increase our stake in any of those two companies if that's what we decide at the appropriate time and we have contractually the freedom to do that.  That's the way that should be interpreted.  Severin can you...</p>

          <p>Your first question was on the top line for Diagnostic as we go forward into 2008 and the new product introduction.  There is a summary on the last slide, perhaps if I just pick out the highlights. For Professional Diagnostic certainly I would expect additional momentum from the license for HCV, you know we got the license from Novartis.  Also that is the biggest assay in immunochemistry and on top of it it should have some spillover on the infectious disease channel overall because labs tend to run infectious diseases on one single platform. So that should give momentum there.  We are also rolling out smaller throughput system the cobas 4000.  You know we have launched the cobas 6000 recently.  This is the mid-throughput system.  They are now entering into the cobas 4000 and the cobas 8000 is still to come.  In Diabetes Care, we have just renewed the portfolio.  So certainly Accu-Chek Aviva will play an important role, we have line extensions on that product and we have a couple of new products such as the Accu-Chek Performer.</p>
          <p>In Molecular Diagnostics, the growth is primarily driven by the CapCPM (104:37) platform.  We introduced this real time platform, real time PCR platform in Europe some time ago and we are only now after we have the FDA approval in the U.S., we're only now rolling it out for the U.S.  We started with HIV and we expect HCV to come in 2008 and those are by far the most important parameters.  If we look into Applied Sciences, we certainly expect further growth in the sequencing business.  And we are rolling out the next generation of this ultra fast instrument and of course, we should see the first product hitting the market from the NimbleGen acquisition.  So there is a host of new products in the pipeline and that should keep the momentum which we have seen towards the end of the year in Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>Now, your second question was when do we see the positive bottom-line impact from the acquisition.  I would assume that the bottom line is going to improve, so in particular for 454 Life Sciences as we are building up sales.  NimbleGen is still in a very early phase, that was a technology transaction.  So I would expect that we further invest into this and that the sales would grow up slowly.  As for Ventana that is already a very reasonable profitability when we take over the business. From the figures we have received it is in the range of the average profitability they have already today in our Diagnostic business. So we will see now during the integration planning whether we can make additional investments to accelerate some of the programs in Ventana, but it shouldn't be too dilutive on a operating level.  Of course on the EPS level you have the impacts of less interest income because we have to finance the transaction.  But overall I would see a positive trend in these acquisitions in terms of bottom line.</p>

          <p>Jo Walton from Lehman Brothers. Three questions please.  You've presented a very persuasive argument for the growth of your cancer products outside of the U.S. to be much bigger in the future.  When we saw the growth of those cancer products in the U.S., it was accompanied by spectacular increase in operating margins for Genentech.  Even if we adjust for all the payments between yourselves and Genentech, is it realistic to assume similar margin improvements for the rest of your business as you see those cancer sales grow outside of the U.S.? Or does it all get eaten up by your investments for the next leg of growth with your CETP inhibitor, et cetera?  Second question is just on the dividend payout. You've said you want a continuous increase in that over the next three years. Can you give us some sort of guide what is the benchmark that you think would be a reasonable dividend payout that we could get to?  And the final question is on Ventana. This just might be me not understanding how this works, but is there a certain amount of shares that you need to get in order to close that transaction, because there seems to be rumors that a couple of Board members with more than 10% of shares don't want to accept the deal and if that's the case, is there a limit?  You know, do you have to have 80% or 90% and what would happen if you didn't get that amount of shares tendered?  Thank you.</p>

          <p>On Ventana, there are two scenarios.  One is that we would get more than 90% of the shares then the transaction would close very quickly.  The other scenario is that we need more than 50% of the shares and in this case we would expect the closing in the second quarter this year.  So our planning assumption is that we get over 50% of the shares and that we close in the second quarter of the year, but we only need 50.1% of the shares, that's enough.</p>

          <p>I think Jo, please don't try to model that there is a quantum leap in margin improvements out of growing in international markets.  I think we got the change in the product mix, which allows that through the step change in the product profile and what have you.  What we're talking about is incremental growth on brands that are well established and we've got the main benefits ensuant in the size and scales and given that we're in the top tier already, it's hard to see a quantum leap out of the top tier into the stratosphere.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's very simple, the answer we don't have a benchmark, because I think we want to maintain the flexibility that we need in order to run our cash resources. It depends also a little bit where are we going with acquisitions, what opportunities do we find in the market.  I do not have a benchmark for the payout ratio.</p>
