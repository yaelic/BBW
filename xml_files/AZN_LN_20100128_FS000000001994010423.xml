        <plist>
          <p>Well, good afternoon, everyone. For those of you here with us in London, we're glad you could make it. And those of you that are joining via the webcast, welcome; we're glad you're there. As I think you may have seen from our press release, we have an awful lot to cover in today's program.</p>
          <p>I'm going to start with a review of the highlights from 2009 and cover the headline financial results, including a review of our revenue performance by region and by key brand. And then, following that, Simon and I will provide some insights into our strategy and to our planning assumptions for 2010 and beyond, as you saw in our press release, looking at how we're approaching the coming five-year period, which as you all know is a challenging one for AstraZeneca and for our sector. And finally, Anders Ekblom will come up and provide the end of year review of the pipeline, the performance of the R&amp;D organization and give you a sense of his priorities for the organization for the future.</p>
          <p>But let me move on to 2009, which was a year of significant accomplishment for AstraZeneca. There were some notable successes, which I'll cover, tempered as ever by some disappointments. But I think it was on balance, from my perspective, a strong overall performance for our business in the year. We achieved revenue growth of 7%, core earnings per share growth of 23% in constant currency terms, and that is a strong performance as you know. And it's one that exceeded our own expectations as we entered the year 2009 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>Central to this success was operational execution of our plans in what as you all know was a difficult economic climate. But we had improved organizational flexibility and I can assure you we have a highly committed workforce that helps to pull all of that through. You know some of our out performance was due to the unexpected revenue upside that we received from the Toprol-XL situation in the United States as well as from the sales of the pandemic H1N1 flu vaccine that we sold to the U.S. government.</p>
          <p>And while the revenue may have been unexpected, I can't say enough about the performance of the people in the organization in making sure that we had Toprol-XL to put on the market, to make sure we had H1N1 flu vaccine that we could actually create. We were the first company among them all to be able to deliver vaccine to the market and we had people working 24/7 to accomplish that and to get Toprol out there, much less the results you saw in all the rest of our business. So I think they were extraordinary efforts from my perspective.</p>
          <p>2009 was also a year in which AstraZeneca was at the forefront of science in our industry. You all know one of the biggest landmark clinical trials in years, the Brilinta PLATO trial, engaged academic and clinical communities across the globe. I think we made very good progress on the pipeline with four major regulatory filings for new products during the year. Brilinta, as you know, was filed for acute coronary syndrome; CERTRIAD for mixed dyslipidemia; VIMOVO for pain; and we announced the filing of the fixed dose combination of ONGLYZA with metformin for the treatment of diabetes.</p>
          <p>When you combine that with the response to the complete response letter from the FDA for Motavizumab, which we responded to in December, we actually have five opportunities for new products in 2010. So that can be good news for us if we can get them all through the regulatory process. Now that amount of R&amp;D output is well above that's &#x2013; what's required to deliver what we said is our average of two new medicines a year, which is in fact why we express the target as an average. Inevitably there are setbacks. This year you know we withdrew the application for ZACTIMA when we saw the overall survival benefit was not there compared to the modest benefit we had seen in progression free survival in the trials that preceded it. We knew that there might be some benefit but in the end we chose to withdraw it.</p>
          <p>We had two significant approvals during the year. We launched ONGLYZA globally, so we were excited about that. It's the first product out of the partnership with Bristol-Myers in the diabetes area; I think a nice opportunity for us. And we also launched IRESSA in Europe. So two products that we're now behind and investing in to make successful.</p>
          <p>We had new external partnerships through the course of the year. We actually had four late-stage opportunities that we brought in. Legal issues are a fact of life in our sector. As many of you know, 2009 was no exception. The major positive development on this front was the appellate ruling that upheld the Seroquel patent in the United States, something that I think we said we felt very strongly about and it was upheld by the court. On the downside, you read &#x2013; may have read, we reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Attorney's office in Philadelphia to resolve investigations that were related to Seroquel sales and marketing practices. That particular investigation accounted for 524 million of the 636 million legal provision that you saw in adjustments to core earnings in '09. In summary, a year of strong financial performance as well as a year of progressing and advancing our broader strategic agenda.</p>
          <p>Let me though turn to the headline financial results for the full year. Growth rates I give will all be in constant currency. I said revenue grew by 7%, that was to $32.8 billion. If we exclude the performance of Toprol-XL and the H1N1 vaccine in the U.S., global revenue growth was 4%, so that's up from where we were at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Once again, we were able to achieve significantly greater profit growth than revenue growth. That was a result of the disciplined resource allocation that we have and I think demonstrates the benefits of our formal restructuring programs as they continue to unfold. Core operating profit also increased by 23% to $13.6 billion. And core earnings per share up to $6.32, which was in line with the guidance range that we gave out during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now in bridging from core EPS to reported, adjusting items to core earnings were somewhat larger than last year, with lower restructuring costs that were more than offset by the legal provisions that were taken. The reported earnings per share number was, grew by 22%, so that was good. The Board recommended a second interim dividend of $1.71. That brings the dividend for the year to $2.30, which represented 12% growth. Simon's going to say more about our dividend policy and the share buyback during his presentation. We had a very strong cash performance in 2009. And as a result of that, we've completely eliminated net debt and we enter 2010 with net funds of over $0.5 billion.</p>
          <p>If you take a look at revenue growth by region on a constant currency basis, you can see that revenue &#x2013; we saw revenue growth in all of our regional business segments. If you look at the revenue in the U.S., we're up 9%, boosted by Toprol-XL and H1N1. Revenue in the established markets outside the U.S. grew by 4%. And as we expected, our emerging markets business grew by double digits by the end of the year, so very good growth.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to note here on this slide, I'll leave it up here for a second, you can see that our growth rates continue to outpace the market growth rate in nearly all regions of the world. This is IMS's data. The AstraZeneca there is in blue and the orange are the market sales growth rates. But you can see as you look across we've had very good performance as well.</p>
          <p>Our key brands provided more than $2 billion in constant currency growth in 2009, growing by 12% in aggregate. As we expected, Nexium sales were lower in the U.S. on stable volume but lower prices, and that was broadly offset by growth in Nexium in the rest of the world. Seroquel's double-digit growth provided more than $0.5 billion of constant currency growth; full year sales reached $4.9 billion. That growth was fueled by the growth of Seroquel XR. It now accounts for 11% of the prescriptions, the franchise prescriptions in the United States. It accounts for 24% of the franchise sales in the rest of the world. So with the new claims that have just been added to it I think we expect that that's going to continue to be a significant performer.</p>
          <p>CRESTOR had another very good year. Sales were up 29% to $4.5 billion and our growth was well above the statin market in all regions in the world. We look forward to continued growth and further support, more of a boost when we get the Jupiter data included in the label.</p>
          <p>ARIMIDEX sales were also up in 2009, but I think you know we lose exclusivity on ARIMIDEX later this year. So that will have an impact on 2010. And SYMBICORT had another very good year. Sales were up 23% to nearly $2.3 billion. We grew market share by six percentage points in the U.S. last year, which is also I think an excellent performance. The press release is there. I think it probably speaks to a lot more detail and certainly the fourth quarter gets covered there. So I won't spend any time on that.</p>
          <p>What we want to do is spend some time today on looking forward. And before I do that, I thought I would just reflect on the fact that 2009 marked the 10th full year since the creation of AstraZeneca back in 1999. And since our sector more than others is really a long cycle industry, I thought I would just briefly review our performance over the first 10 years that the company was in business as AstraZeneca, and in doing so I hope set some context for what we hope to accomplish as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Back in 1999 the newly merged AstraZeneca employed some 47,000 people in the pharma division, healthcare revenue was about $15 billion and only 6% of our revenue came from the emerging markets. We had two blockbuster products, and as we look to our immediate future we recognize that some 55% of our revenues came from products that were going to face loss of market exclusivity over the next five years. We had a pipeline that had 41 new molecular entities that were in clinical development and a number of life cycle management projects as well to support our growth products and franchises. Annual R&amp;D investment at that time was about $2.5 billion, and it was really exclusively focused on small molecules.</p>
          <p>What happened next? Well, as we expected the patents did expire on products that were generating some $8 billion in revenue at the time and subsequently they declined by about $7 billion. But we also had a pretty strong base business, fueled by franchises like Seroquel, ARIMIDEX, CASODEX, ATACAND. We made strategic investments to grow our emerging market businesses and revenues, and together the growth franchises, along with the emerging markets, generate $11 billion of new revenue in our base business and more than made up for the patent erosion. The sales transformation was completed by more than $13 billion of revenue that we've derived since then coming from our investments in R&amp;D. Those were primarily Nexium, CRESTOR and SYMBICORT, bringing us to where we are today, which we reported sales of over $32 billion.</p>
          <p>So in the last 10 years we are not just a revenue story. We did begin the process of reshaping our operating model. We took more control of the cost base of the business, but I would say to you there is still more that needs to be done on this end. The result of our efforts so far enabled us to leverage compound annual growth of 8% into mid-teens growth in operating profit and in earnings per share over the period. And that financial performance drove strong shareholder return for AstraZeneca and put us amongst the best in the large cap pharmaceutical sector for that 10 year period and we outperformed the market indices as well.</p>
          <p>So as we turn the page on 2009, AstraZeneca is an organization of some 63,000 people strong. We have revenues as I just said in excess of $32 billion over the decade. We've built 10 blockbuster products and our emerging markets business now accounts for 13% of our global revenues. Our R&amp;D investment in 2009 was $4.4 billion. That's underpinned by capabilities in both small molecules and in biologics and we have a pipeline that now includes 103 projects that are in clinical development and a robust program, I would say, of lifecycle management projects to support our key product franchises. Today, as 10 years ago, more than half of our revenue base faces loss of exclusivity over the five-year period and I am confident our management team will respond and adapt our plans accordingly.</p>
          <p>I am going to spend the next portion of my presentation laying out the strategy of what we see as the key priorities for AstraZeneca over the next few years, and then Simon will follow up with some thoughts on how we see the business shape evolving from a financial point and perspective.</p>
          <p>And each year, at the beginning of our business planning cycle, we assess the challenges and the opportunities that are represented by the markets where we compete. We candidly assess our own strengths and weaknesses as an organization. We stress-test our short and long-term planning assumptions to assure ourselves that whatever the past success has been, the strategic path that we are following is the right one for our business for the future. We continue to believe that the most value creating strategy for AstraZeneca is to be a focused, integrated, innovation-driven global biopharmaceutical company that's prescription based. Focused, in that we will continue to be selective about those areas of the industry that we chose to compete in, targeting the product categories where medical innovation or brand equity continues to command a premium.</p>
          <p>Integrated, in that we believe the best way to create value within this industry is to span the full value chain of discovery, development and commercialization. Innovation-driven, in that we believe our technology base will continue to deliver innovative products that patients will need and payers will value. And global, in that we believe our ability to meet the health needs of patients and healthcare systems in both in the developed and emerging markets is a core capability of ours, as we've demonstrated in the past.</p>
          <p>So, yes, the near-term challenges of patent expirations and the long-term pressure on prices are real and they continue, but so are the drivers of demand: unmet medical need, the aging of the developed world and the economic growth in the developing world. With these powerful forces at work over the cycle, we believe that our industry is capable of growing at least in line with real global GDP. Some IMS forecasts suggest that the range is 4 to 7% or even higher through 2013, but I'm just going to go with GDP at this point.</p>
          <p>And within this industry I think we believe the best performers will continue to earn attractive returns on invested capital. I'm confident that AstraZeneca can be one of the better performers through the cycle. We possess the innovative capacity to discover and develop meaningful medicines for patients, be they small molecules for biologics. We have the necessary global scale and reach in the marketplace, and our ability to commercialize products is among the best in the industry. We're continuing to develop an industry-leading cost-management capability. And we already have one of the most competitive supply chains in the sector.</p>
          <p>I'm acutely aware that it's shareholder funds that we invest to bring innovation to patients, and we're going to manage this business to try to deliver shareholder value in the short term and in the long term.</p>
          <p>Now the strategic priorities that'll drive our actions in the years ahead are very much in keeping with our current agenda. We're on an evolutionary journey here, not a revolutionary one, albeit our evolutionary journey is an accelerated one. I believe, and firmly believe, that determined execution and delivery on these activities can deliver value over the cycle.</p>
          <p>If there is one overarching theme to our plans, it's recognizing that the fundamental strategic imperative for AstraZeneca and for our industry is to improve the productivity of the research and development investment. For AstraZeneca, meeting this challenge will require our R&amp;D organization to embrace more transformational change than we've ever had before. We're going to further refine our disease area priorities, making a rigorous reallocation to capital to those areas that offer the greatest chance for technical and commercial success.</p>
          <p>Our use of Lean Sigma to drive out costs, waste and inefficiency across the business will continue. And within the R&amp;D organization there'll be more focus on improving the efficiency of development activities. This will continue to change from a highly fixed-cost operating model to a more flexible one that allows us, that gives us the capability to scale our R&amp;D investment up or down quickly as scientific opportunities emerge or the situation changes.</p>
          <p>To do this, we'll continue to make greater use of outsourcing and strategic partnerships with other organizations. And our drive for greater efficiencies will also call for consolidation of our research and development sites. Simon will outline some of the financial dimensions of these changes in just a few minutes. But let me say this isn't just about cost cutting. It's also about improving on the capabilities that our organization can deliver. And to bring about clarity to our R&amp;D investment decision making we've formed a portfolio investment board, which is chaired by me. Members of it will include Simon, Anders, Tony Zook, who is now the head of our global commercial operation, and a few other members of our senior management and R&amp;D group.</p>
          <p>This group will be accountable for all R&amp;D investments within the group and will be charged with delivering the pipeline of products capable of generating attractive returns on our invested capital and driving shareholder value. Our commitment to scientific innovation is stronger than ever. And I believe that in order for AstraZeneca to be among the best performers in this industry we need to deliver on a consistent basis a flow of new products that meet the needs of patients and their caregivers at a value point that payers are willing to support.</p>
          <p>I believe that this demands more external collaboration than we've had before. It includes collaborating with payers. We're setting out to build an industry-leading capability in payer-partnering to ensure that the value proposition for AstraZeneca and the payer community is aligned in the development process. And it will also include more extensive collaboration with industry and academic partners to access the best science wherever it resides.</p>
          <p>External project opportunities will compete alongside in-house projects for funding from the portfolio investment board as we seek to construct a pipeline that sensibly manages the risk and reward trade-offs that we can see across our entire portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now on the commercial side, our plan will build on the organic investments we've made in the emerging markets. In addition to commercializing the current and new product offerings that originated in-house, from within AstraZeneca, we believe that we can continue to drive double-digit growth by selectively augmenting our emerging markets portfolios with branded generic products that are sourced from outside of AstraZeneca when we see the opportunity for them to create value under the umbrella of the AstraZeneca brand.</p>
          <p>We will continue to re-shape our business, adapting our cost base to the realities of the marketplace today; and as you all know, that is changing. These structures will continue to impact on our people and the communities within which we operate. Since 2007, 12,600 people have left AstraZeneca as a result of our efforts to focus services where we really need them.</p>
          <p>Over the same period, some 8,000 people have joined the company. We've grown in important areas, like biologics division, and as I said we're investing in emerging markets, and we expect a further 10,400 people to be impacted by changes in the next five years. Naturally, as we develop these programs to respond to productivity challenges, many of these changes are subject to the requisite consultations with works councils, with trade unions, with other employee representatives and it has to be done in accordance with local labor laws. These things are underway but, as you know, they take some time to get done.</p>
          <p>Effective strategy is about making the right choices about what you do. Effective leadership ensures that how you do it is in line with the values of the company. And justifiably, high expectations of customers, payers, regulators, relevant stakeholders are significant, and our team, my team, will continue to embed a culture of accountability throughout this company that will nurture a spirit of innovation in all functions, not just in research and development, so that we can drive efficiency and agility and we can reinforce a shareholder value orientation for all of our employees.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to turn the presentation over to Simon. He'll take you through some of the planning assumptions we're making that will guide our actions over the next few years and he'll be followed by Anders, and then we'll move to a Q&amp;A session. So Simon, over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, David, and good afternoon to everyone. Now David's outlined our strategic priorities. I will flesh those out with a little bit more detail and also share with you the planning assumptions that we're making as we set out to deliver on those priorities. In doing so, I'm going to look forward over a five-year horizon from 2010 through to 2014.</p>
          <p>This period will be a challenging one for the industry and also for AstraZeneca as our revenue base transitions through a period of exclusivity losses and new product launches. During this period, we believe that it will be helpful for investors to understand the company's high-level planning assumptions for revenue evolution, for margins, for cash flow and business reinvestment that will guide our management of the business over the next five years.</p>
          <p>I'll start by outlining some of the general assumptions that we are making about the wider industry environment. As David mentioned, we believe that over the long run the global biopharmaceutical market can grow at least in line with real global GDP growth. In common with most external forecasters, we expect global GDP will continue to recover from the lows of 2008 and grow steadily through our planning horizon.</p>
          <p>We recognize that downward pressure on revenue from government interventions in our marketplace, including various proposals that have been made as part of U.S. healthcare reform, remain a continuing feature of the challenging market environment. However, for the planning period we're assuming no further step changes in the evolution of these pressures.</p>
          <p>More specifically for AstraZeneca, our planning assumptions for revenue, margins and cash flow do not assume any material M&amp;A or disposals over the planning horizon. They also assume that we experience no premature loss of market exclusivity for key AstraZeneca products over the period. And finally, we assume that exchange rates for our principle currencies do not differ materially from those average rates that have prevailed here in January 2010.</p>
          <p>In growing our business, our first priority is to drive our key franchises, most notably Crestor, Seroquel XR and SYMBICORT. We aim to continue to gain market share for our key brands that retain exclusivity. We expect to successfully commercialize our recently-launched products and the next wave of products from our internal and in-license pipeline, and we'll continue to drive our emerging markets business through organic growth of products from our current portfolio and pipeline, but also as David mentioned through selective additions of branded generics to further capitalize on our prior investments and commercial infrastructure.</p>
          <p>We plan on sustaining our double-digit growth in our emerging markets. At this pace, emerging markets could grow to become more than a quarter of our total revenue by 2014. Our planning assumption is that revenue will be in the range of $28 billion to $34 billion per annum over the planning horizon through to 2014. We do expect a significant portion of our current revenue base will come under pressure from the loss of market exclusivity on a number of key products.</p>
          <p>Alongside growth from key brands and from our emerging markets, achievement of revenues within the planning range will require a risk-adjusted contribution of around 4 to $6 billion by 2014 through recently launched products, the current pipeline or further licensing. We aspire to performance near the top of the planning range by 2014, when we expect to have returned to a period of more consistent revenue growth.</p>
          <p>We continue to make strong progress in reshaping our cost base, both through improved efficiencies and through improved cost flexibility. We have benchmarked our costs in every function of our business against best-in-class levels, both within and outside the pharma industry, and we will use all of the tools available to bring these in line with best practice.</p>
          <p>Our clear objective in reshaping our business is to build a long-term, sustainable, successful business in a market environment facing continued pressure on price. We'll complete the former restructuring of our supply chain and continue to drive our Lean program, striving to maintain our gross margin above 80% through this period. We'll drive further efficiencies in sales and marketing spend through continuous improvements in sales force productivity, testing and exploring new approaches to meeting our customers' requirements for the information and the services needed to make the best use of our products.</p>
          <p>We are reducing G&amp;A costs through continued operation improvement and through consolidating and selectively outsourcing scale-intensive processes. We're delivering significant savings through implementation of best practice and procurement and working capital management, and we'll continue those efforts.</p>
          <p>Over the next five years, our planning assumption is that we can maintain a core operating margin before R&amp;D expense, which we see as the key measure of profitability in delivering our marketed products, in the range of 48 to 54%. This is higher than the 45% that we've averaged over the last decade but somewhat lower than the record 55% achieved in 2009. So it looks to be a reasonable planning assumption.</p>
          <p>In short, our business reshaping activities are not simply designed to mitigate short-term pressure on the top line. They are central to our view as to what is required to provide appropriate reward for committed investment in biopharmaceutical innovation in the long run.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to focus on cash generation across the business. Achieving revenues in our core pre-R&amp;D operating margins in line with our planning assumptions, alongside tight management of our restructuring programs, working capital, tax and interest, will generate strong cash flow over the planning period. Now subject to investment opportunities and prospective returns, our aim is to reinvest approximately 40 to 50% of our pre-R&amp;D, post-tax cash flows to drive future growth and value. And our investment priorities are, firstly, internal and external discovery and development investment to build our pipeline of innovative medicines, and then tangible assets and information technology to drive productivity improvement and to support growth.</p>
          <p>After reinvestment in the business, the residual cash flow will be available for any other business needs that may arise, repayment of debt as it becomes due and distribution to shareholders. This cash generation profile and the reinvestment rate is broadly consistent with our track record since the merger. Over the last decade, the company has generated about $87 billion of pre-R&amp;D, post-tax cash flow. And we're reinvested about 45% of this cash flow in internal and in licensed R&amp;D and investment. This reinvestment drove the strong sales and the profit growth over the period. The company also invested about $17 billion in material acquisitions, notably MedImmune, to transform our biologics capability, and funding the first stage of the Merck exit arrangements. And this reinvestment was achieved while distributing $34 billion to shareholders through dividends and periodic share re-purchases.</p>
          <p>Our third strategic priority is to deliver value from our investment in innovation, whether that's internal R&amp;D or in licensed technology and projects. Now as David described, our goal is to launch on average two new medicines per year. The objectives of our R&amp;D trades program are to further strengthen our innovative capabilities and to improve significantly the R&amp;D efficiency with which we deliver out output goals. These plans include disease area reprioritization, reorganization and process improvement in development, site consolidation, continued focus on externalization and other efficiency gains.</p>
          <p>As a result, we plan to achieve material efficiency savings in R&amp;D, and these savings will partially mitigate the increase in investment that would be required as a result of the maturation of the current pipeline as projects progress to the later and more resource-consuming phases of development. As a result of these actions, we plan to fully deliver the existing portfolio at a lower cost than would otherwise be expected.</p>
          <p>When fully realized, the annual savings by 2014 will be in the region of $1 billion per annum. Of this, we estimate that approximately half is cost reduction, the other half cost avoidance. Based on preliminary estimates, approximately 3,500 positions may be affected by this program. However, this is a dynamic process, including positions which will be retained whilst being relocated to another site, the investment in new skills and capabilities and further expansion of our biologics activity, than that reduction in positions may be around 1,800. The cost of this restructuring is estimated to be around $1 billion, of which approximately 60% will be cash costs. Of course, these are preliminary estimates; they are subject to the requisite consultation process, which is under way.</p>
          <p>I'll now review our progress in all of our restructuring efforts, explaining how this new program in R&amp;D fits into the overall picture. In the period 2007 to the end of 2009, our cumulative restructuring activities have incurred $2.5 billion in restructuring costs, impacted 12,600 positions and have achieved $1.6 billion in annualized benefits as of the end of 2009, so it will grow to $2.3 billion by the end of 2010. Some of these savings in dollars and in head count have enabled us to accommodate our investment in other areas to drive future growth. The gross number of 12,600 positions affected has resulted in a net reduction of some 4,600 after the planned expansions in biologics and our emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Now the next phase of restructuring has three components. Firstly, the completion of activities remaining from the first phase of restructuring, some additional initiatives in supply chain and in SG&amp;A, and the new program in R&amp;D that I've just outlined. We would expect to incur about $2 billion in further restructuring costs in the period 2010 to '14. In terms of phasing, I would expect around 60% to be charged in 2010, with most of the remainder in 2011.</p>
          <p>Another 10,400 positions are expected to be affected on a gross basis, fewer on a net basis depending on how much we choose to reinvest in high-return opportunities. This phase of restructuring when fully implemented is expected to generate annual benefits of around $1.9 billion by the end of 2014, half to be realized by 2011, with most of the remainder realized by 2013.</p>
          <p>Now over the last few minutes I shared with you the planning assumptions that will guide our management of the business over the next five years on a course that will be rewarding for our patients and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Anders, I'd like to narrow my focus for the big picture and provide some thoughts on our 2010 financial guidance that we provided in this morning's earnings release. Over the course of last year, we've tried to be transparent about those elements of 2009's revenue performance, chiefly Toprol-XL and the pandemic vaccine, that were unanticipated and unlikely to be durable. This will provide a headwind as we enter 2010. This year we will also bear the full annualized effect of the loss of exclusivity to Casodex and for Pulmicort Respules in the U.S. now that Teva has launched its generic product. ARIMIDEX will lose exclusivity in the second half of the year, and add in the uncertainty around the potential impact of any U.S. healthcare reform measures that may be enacted and 2010 will be a challenging year.</p>
          <p>As a result, for 2010 we anticipate up to a mid-single digit decline in revenue on a constant currency basis. For pre-R&amp;D operating margin will be lower than the 55% level achieved in 2009, but it should be near the top end of our mid-term planning range of 48 to 54% of revenue. Also note that consensus expectations for net finance expense are considerably lower than our assumptions. With yields on cash still very low, we expect net finance expense at around $550 million for the year.</p>
          <p>As we noted in the press release, we expect the tax rate for 2010 to be around 29%. Our target for core earnings per share is set based on the average exchange rates for our principle currencies that prevailed during January 2010. And on this basis we anticipate core earnings per share in the range of $5.75 to $6.15. Of course, this target takes no account of the likelihood that actual exchange rates for 2010 may differ materially from the January 2010 average rates upon which our guidance is based.</p>
          <p>As we did last year at our quarterly results announcement, we'll endeavor to be as transparent as we can in terms of how actual rates are affecting our performance. An updated currency sensitivity estimator has been provided to assist you in modeling your own currency assumptions.</p>
          <p>I'll conclude with a few comments about today's announcement on the dividend, including the newly adopted progressive dividend policy and the share buyback. With today's announcement of a second interim dividend of $1.71, this brings the total dividend for the year to $2.30. That's a 12% increase compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Today we also announced the revision to our dividend policy going forward. In recognition of the group's strong balance sheet, sustainable significant cash flow and the Board's confidence in the strategic direction and the long-term prospects for the business, the Board's adopted a progressive dividend policy, intending to maintain or grow the dividend each year.</p>
          <p>The Board recognizes that some earnings fluctuation is to be expected as the company's revenue base transitions through this period of exclusivity losses and new product launches. The Board's view is that the annual dividend will not just reflect the financial performance of a single year taken in isolation but reflect its view of the earnings prospects for the group over the entirety of the investment cycle.</p>
          <p>As a result, dividend cover may vary during the period but with a target of an average dividend cover of two times, a payout ratio of 50%, based on reported earnings before restructuring costs. In setting the distribution policy and the overall financial strategy, the Board's aim is to continue to strike a balance between the interest of the business, our financial creditors and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>After providing for business investment, meeting our debt service obligations and funding the progressive dividend policy, the Board will keep under review the opportunity to return cash in excess of these requirements to shareholders through periodic share repurchases. And in addition to the increase in the dividend, today the company announced that it will undertake up to a billion dollars in share repurchases in 2010.</p>
          <p>So I'll now hand over to Anders Ekblom, our Vice-President of Development, for an update on our strategy for building a value-creating pipeline. Anders?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon. Good afternoon, everyone. Over the next few minutes, I will address three topics. First, I will talk about the 2009 R&amp;D performance. I'll review the latest snapshot of the R&amp;D pipeline, and in doing so I will give you some flavor on the potential pipeline deliveries as I see over the few next coming years.</p>
          <p>But actually, changing from what I said, I will first start sharing my thoughts on our R&amp;D strategy, outlining some of the key changes I propose to make and why we would like to do them.</p>
          <p>As David and Simon mentioned, the industry is operating in a challenging environment. Healthcare decision-makers are applying ever-increasing scrutiny to medicines and the cost-benefit equation is being redefined. Traditionally, safety and efficacy were the key clinical hurdles we had to pass, but increasingly, health economics is becoming a major driving force in the success or failure of new therapies.</p>
          <p>At the same time, breakthroughs in science are throwing up more new drug targets than ever before, and globalization is bringing millions more patients into the market for our medicines. And in addition, aging populations throughout the world mean an increased demand for our medicines.</p>
          <p>2009 was a year in which the R&amp;D organization at AstraZeneca made good progress on its priorities. We made six significant regulatory filings. We shared landmark data for CRESTOR and Brilinta, and we gained approval on ONGLYZA with our partners at BMS.</p>
          <p>Over the recent years, we have driven change in structure, productivity and cost effectiveness, and 2009 is evidence of that bearing fruit. But if I take a critical look at our recent history, it's clear that we've been through a period where we delivered too few transitions from Phase 2 to Phase 3, and consequently, fewer products than we expected to the market.</p>
          <p>We also need to bring our medicines through R&amp;D more quickly and at a reduced cost in order to help our investments deliver an acceptable return for the shareholders. The focus on speed of development is also more important than ever, given the need to maximize the time we have to sell our medicines under the current patent protection. There's been a lot of good work done, but I believe we can do more in AstraZeneca.</p>
          <p>We have critically evaluated what we need to do to increase the rate of success in bringing new products to market and to tackle the rising cost of R&amp;D. We believe we have a strong foundation in many of the classical scientific disciplines required for successful drug development, but there are areas where we can improve and add. So I'm going to explain some of the financial and people implications of the proposed changes to our R&amp;D organization, and I will now go into a bit more detail.</p>
          <p>Improving our capabilities in certain areas, focusing on disease areas where we believe we have the highest chance of success, and a new proposed operating model, together with reducing R&amp;D's global footprint, will collectively give our people the best opportunity to deliver medicines that are valued by patients, doctors, payers and shareholders alike.</p>
          <p>So let me now touch on the capabilities we need to strengthen. First, R&amp;D is intrinsically a people business, and a core part of our plan is investing in enhancing the capability of our people. Let me give you two examples.</p>
          <p>First, we will build our capabilities in personalized healthcare. By identifying those patients who will benefit most from the medicines, we can increase the magnitude of treatment effects seen in our trials and delivered to our patients. An example of this will be IRESSA, our targeted monotherapy that proved to be superior to conventional chemotherapy in first-line treatment of DFR positive non-small cell lung cancer patients. This was achieved because we were able to identify the patients who would benefit from IRESSA. These days, we demand that every product in our pipeline prepares a biomarker constructed outline and ways to identify the most appropriate patients for the drug.</p>
          <p>Another example is improving our predicted science capabilities, which is our ability to predict efficacy and safety, which would allow us to make early decisions about R&amp;D investments and improve the probability of success of bringing the products to the market.</p>
          <p>Both of these approaches will help improve probability of success in clinical development and help us target our investments more efficiently. We need to see that all these capabilities shown on this slide are core elements of the way we operate. They need to become as natural and intuitive to us as the classical scientific disciplines that we master today.</p>
          <p>In addition, continuous improvement using Lean and Six Sigma approaches will drive further productivity improvements across R&amp;D, as will business process outsourcing, strategic partnerships with other organizations, and so forth. Using these levers, we will continue to drive the change from an operating model with a high fixed cost base to a more flexible cut model, where we can scale investments up and down depending on opportunities.</p>
          <p>The final area I believe we can improve upon is the rigorous management of the portfolio to ensure that our resources are invested in only those projects with the best prospects. Consequently, as part of our strategy review, we also conducted a thorough assessment of the disease areas we operate in. We reviewed each of the disease areas to assess whether there was the best potential for discovery of the medicines, the level of unmet need, ability to undertake efficient clinical development, competitive intensity, degree of pricing pressures, and any other anticipated market access challenges.</p>
          <p>Following this review, we remain focused on our current therapy areas. So it does not represent a change in our current therapy area focus, but it will require change in emphasis between disease areas, leading to improved prioritization within and across them. Stopping work in de-prioritized areas will allow us to refocus our resources into those areas where we believe we can deliver the most important new medicines. We will continue to look at new therapeutic areas via externalization, ensuring that we optimize our own assets and look at in-licensing opportunities where we believe we can find further value.</p>
          <p>This thorough review of R&amp;D led us to recognize that we also need to redesign our operating model to give our people the best opportunity to deliver the medicines we need to deliver. There are three elements to this operating model.</p>
          <p>First, the formation of eight innovation-focused innovative medicine units, which I will call for IMUs for simplicity going forward, which brings together discovery and early development with one single aim, to deliver valuable medicines ready for late-stage development in the disease area of focus. This integration will ensure a clear line of sight and accountability to deliver opportunities for late-stage development. Each will be responsible for sourcing innovation from inside and outside our walls, and demonstrating that innovation can deliver valuable medicines to patients prior to progression into late development.</p>
          <p>Some of these IMUs will be focused on small molecules, and some will be focused on biologics. They will be funded based on performance and opportunity. Investment will be reviewed on a rolling business case basis by the newly formed senior level governor's group that David described earlier.</p>
          <p>Our proposal will help drive a healthy tension between internal research spend and external opportunities, ensuring that investment in one is traded off against investment in the other, with the goal of delivering potential new medicines against agreed targets. And this is an important change.</p>
          <p>Late-stage development will be undertaken by one single global medicines development organization. Global medicines development will provide AstraZeneca with a global and highly efficient development platform capable of conducting trials in the highest quality for both small molecules and biologics, and we provide a competitive advantage in attracting external partnerships.</p>
          <p>And finally, all the R&amp;D investments will be overseen by the new senior level governor's group David described. It will, I believe, bring greater clarity to our R&amp;D investments and decision-making, and will be accountable for all major R&amp;D investments across the group. This new model will allow us to more rigorously manage our portfolio and ensure that our resources are invested in only those projects with the best prospects.</p>
          <p>To push toward greater efficiencies, it also drives us to consolidate our R&amp;D activities on a smaller footprint globally. This proposal will potentially lead to closure of some of the R&amp;D sites, which I recognize will be impactful for many of our people, and we need to ensure that changes are handled with sensitivity. We are now entering into a period of consultation with employees, trade unions and other relevant stakeholders. And before change are finalized, I'm unable to provide you with more details today. The impact of these proposed changes will be a gross position impact of 3,500, predominantly but not only within R&amp;D, and a net reduction of about 1,800 positions.</p>
          <p>We've been on a journey of improving time, cost and quality in R&amp;D. Now this is our next step in this evolution. We truly believe that we will emerge from these changes as a stronger and more productive company with greater innovation in our labs and better ability to get the innovation to market quickly and cost efficiently to meet demands, because that's ultimately what we are here to do in AstraZeneca.</p>
          <p>And though 2010 clearly looks like a year of change from an organizational perspective, it's also big here from a product perspective. So let me now take you through some of the highlights of 2009 and illustrate what our current R&amp;D portfolio looks like, and give you a flavor of 2010.</p>
          <p>2009 was a productive year for AstraZeneca. We had 60 approvals in the last 12 months. We launched ONGLYZA in U.S. and Europe, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. ONGLYZA's now approved in 36 countries with submissions to 50 countries. Partnerships like this one with BMS is important for our business going forward.</p>
          <p>As David already mentioned, we were the first company in the U.S. to supply H1N1 swine flu vaccine. And this is a good example of the skilled biologics capabilities we have at MedImmune.</p>
          <p>In December, Seroquel XR was approved in the U.S. as a joint therapy in major depressive disorders in adults. We also received a new complete response letter for its use as acute and maintenance monotherapy in MDD, and we're currently evaluating this CRL.</p>
          <p>Following delivery of the IPASS trial, IRESSA was launched in Europe for patients with locally and advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with activating mutations or ND4.</p>
          <p>We also successfully gained approval for SYMBICORT COPD indication in the U.S. and in China, and we are now in China listed on the National Reimbursement Drug List. SYMBICORT was also approved for the use of treatment of asthma in Japan and we launched earlier this month. The development plan for COPD in Japan has been agreed with the regulators, the PMDA, and will progress shortly.</p>
          <p>One of the most exciting events during 2009 was the presentation of the positive Phase III PLATO results for Brilinta, our anti-platelet drug for acute coronary syndromes. Cardiovascular disease accounts for more than one in four deaths worldwide, and while ACS treatment has improved with therapies such as Plavix, there is still a huge medical need to fill. We believe Brilinta can help address that need based on the results of the real-world PLATO study in patients with ACS and which demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular events compared to Plavix. We submitted regulatory filings in Europe and U.S. during the fourth quarter last year, and in the U.S., it will undergo standard review with PDUFA date of September 16. In Europe, we will use the trade name Brilic.</p>
          <p>Turning to CRESTOR, in April 2009 we filed an sNDA in the U.S. to update the CRESTOR label to include the data from the JUPITER trial. On the 15th of December, we had the successful FDA Advisory Committee meeting, which culminated in supporting vote for a positive benefit risk based on JUPITER. We are now engaged in final labeling discussion with FDA, and we hope to conclude those discussions in the near future.</p>
          <p>The next three products are fixed dose combinations of therapies that are clinically proven in their fields. It's been estimated that there are 29 million adults in the U.S. alone who, despite their current lipid-lowering therapy, do not reach their targets as recommended by guidelines. Some of these patients have LDL predominant disease and are the patients we believe benefit the best from CRESTOR. But approximately two million have mixed dyslipidemia with abnormalities in LDL, HDL and triglycerides. These patients are the target population of CERTRIAD, which is an investigational product containing the active ingredients of CRESTOR and Abbott's fenofibric acid TRILIPIX. We believe this product has significant potential in the lipid-lowering market.</p>
          <p>VIMOVO is our combination of entric-coated naproxen and immediate release esomeprazole for the relief of arthritis pain. And approximately half of the 150 million patients suffering from osteoarthritis worldwide are at risk of developing NSAID-associated ulcers, and this is the opportunity for VIMOVO.</p>
          <p>During the second half of last year, we reported a positive Phase III result of VIMOVO, showing a greater than 70% reduction in endoscopically confirmed gastric ulcers when VIMOVO was used compared to naproxen alone. Importantly, this benefit was maintained even in the presence of low-dose aspirin, which is an important point, as many of these patients are elderly and may have cardiovascular comorbidity requiring aspirin therapy. Based on these results, the U.S. NDA was submitted in June 2009 and the MAA in October.</p>
          <p>Our ONGLYZA net-forming one daily combination has been filed in the U.S. and we anticipate filing in Europe later this year. Fixed-dose combinations of DPP-4 inhibitors with other anti-diabetic agents are increasingly used in the management of diabetes. And we believe that this addition will help us drive the continued uptake of ONGLYZA.</p>
          <p>Finally, we show that in advanced breast cancer, 500 milligram dose of FASLODEX increased the time patients live without evidence of disease progression versus the currently approved dose of 250 milligrams. The data has been submitted both in U.S. and Europe and from the basis our first filing of FASLODEX in Japan. We are delighted that the CHMP have issued a positive opinion of FASLODEX 500 milligram dose change and we anticipate final approval by the European Commission towards the end of March.</p>
          <p>In addition to these pipeline progress, we have added five new projects to our late-stage pipeline, namely Olaparib for advanced breast cancer, Ceftaroline for pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections, NKTR-118 for opiate-induced constipation, and TC-5214 for the treatment of major depressive disorders. Our anti-infective portfolio has also been strengthened by the acquisition of Novaxel towards the end of last year.</p>
          <p>I believe they demonstrate our commitment to access the best new medicines from either internal R&amp;D or external sources. What they all have in common is the potential to bring real benefit scenarios of significant unmet need and will therefore drive future value creation for our investors.</p>
          <p>Given that some of this is new to you, let me just spend a couple minutes on each of them. Firstly, we have Olaparib, our noble PARP inhibitor, which appears to provide considerably anti-tumor effects in patients with mutations in the BRCA genes and has also the potential to enhance the effects of chemotherapy. The slide shows the results from our Phase II study in advanced breast cancer patients who have the mutation in the BRCA gene, and I am pleased to announce that the first Phase III trial will operate in patients with BRCA-mutated breast cancer will commence towards the middle of this year. The study will involve about 300 patients, and we are currently undergoing regulator consultations to ensure that our development and diagnostic structure meets the requirements of the regulators. The study will commence as soon as these are complete.</p>
          <p>Assuming a mid-2010 start, we would anticipate regulatory filing for this indication from late 2012. We also anticipate additional Olaparib data to guide further Phase III investments during the year.</p>
          <p>TC-5214 is an exciting new approach for the treatment of major depressive disorders, or MDD. And it is a common disorder. Research has shown that the majority of patients who are treated with first-line SSRIs do not achieve adequate control from their initial therapy. The Phase IIb trial in patients who have inadequate response to initial therapy showed that TC-5214 improved the Hamilton Depression Score of patients by six points more than placebo when added as an adjunct to their current therapy. Secondary efficacy endpoints were also significantly improved by TC-5214.</p>
          <p>We and our partners at Targacept are currently finalizing the global Phase III program, which we anticipate starting mid-2010, and we anticipate filing for an NDA in 2012. We will also explore its potential as a monotherapy in a Phase II study in MDD.</p>
          <p>In September, we entered into worldwide license agreement for Nektar 118 and 119 with Nektar Therapeutics. Nektar 118 is an oral peripherally-acting opioid antagonist and an investigation for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation.</p>
          <p>It is estimated that 40 to 90% of patients who take opioids for pain management will develop constipation. Less than half of those patients find effective relief from treatments available. Phase II studies demonstrated that oral Nektar 118 increased the frequency of bowel movements in patients with opioid-induced constipation, while importantly preserving the opioid-mediated analgesia. We anticipate initial regulatory filings in 2013.</p>
          <p>During the latter half of the year, we licensed Ceftaroline from Forest for countries outside U.S., Canada and Japan. This is a next generation cephalospirin, which has broad-spectrum coverage, including some resistant pathogens such as MRSA and multi-drug resistance streptococcus pneumonia. We have seen impressive Phase III data in both community-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin infections, and we are currently discussing with regulatory agencies to make initial filings in Europe in the third quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Our presence in the anti-infective arena was further strengthened in December with the acquisition of the French bio-tech company Novaxel. This team gives us access to Phase II beta-lactamase inhibitor, which we believe has excellent coverage against a spectrum of beta-lactamases present. It allows us to maximize the potential of Ceftaroline, strengthen the collaboration with Forest and gives us actually the potential to breathe new life into previously leading antibiotics, like Ceftaroline, to which resistance has emerged.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the slide, the combination of these agents offers promising scope to treat the infections caused by a wide range of pathogens, including some that are increasingly hard to treat, and we hope these agents will offer confidence to get the right treatment to patients the first time. Despite the number of therapies for patients with type 2 diabetes in recent years, there remains a significant need for more effications and complementary therapies to help improve glycemic control, address important core morbidities such as obesity and decrease the complications of those. Dapagliflozin is an exciting new therapy in a new class of potential anti-diabetic agents that works by promoting glucose excretion through the kidney, thereby improving glycemic control.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, its mechanism of action is completely independent of insulin and its effects, and as such could potentially be of utility at any stage of the disease in combination with any of the current available therapeutic options in diabetes. Initial data from the first two Phase III studies showed HPA1C lowering consistent with other oral antidiabetic agents, which was accompanied by a beneficial effect on weight and blood pressure. We believe that this combination of effects is unique and differentiating from current therapies available in diabetes.</p>
          <p>With regard to safety and tolerability overall, we have reassuring profile, including rates of hyper-glycemia similar to placebo. We have seen an increase in signs and symptoms suggestive of genital and urinary tract infections and these events were generally mild to moderate in severity, managed according to usual clinical practice and rarely led to treatment discontinuations. Not all these events are proving infections and the numbers reported to-date are likely to include some events associated with the mechanism of Dapagliflozin rather than necessarily an effective cause. This is obviously something we're going to investigate further and we're waiting for all the Phase III data to come in during the year.</p>
          <p>All <mark type="inaudible" /> Phase IIIa studies have now completed their treatments and there are more new data to come during 2010 prior to making initial regulatory submissions in the latter part of this year. We continue to plan for global submissions in the fourth quarter. In December 2008 the FDA revised their guideline for development of registration of new treatments in type 2 diabetes to include the specific analysis to rule out unacceptable cardiovascular risk. The timeline from the NDA staff is contingent upon accumulation of sufficient events within the development program to comply with these FDA guideline requirements.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, RECENTIN is an active molecule positioned in the commercially attractive anti-angiogenic market. We have two Phase III trials studying RECENTIN in combination with chemotherapy in first line colorectal cancer, one against placebo and the other head-to-head versus the market leader, Avastin. Avastin head-to-head study's designed to test for both superiority and non-inferiority of the primary end point.</p>
          <p>Delivering superiority to Avastin will be a major breakthrough for patients in this disease but it's also obviously high risk. However, we also believe that non-inferiority scenario could be a viable commercial outcome depending on the full data package. All the regulatory challenges will be increased. Data is expected from both the studies as well as our glioblastoma Phase III study, REGAL, in the first half of 2010, with positive data leading to submission in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>So putting these changes into context of our overall pipeline, we can see significant growth in the overall size over the last five years, and we now have a size and distribution that we expect to maintain for the next coming years. We have reviewed the pipeline and taken the decision to remove 20 clinical projects that we don't feel have sufficient probability of delivering an acceptable return on investment.</p>
          <p>Good examples would be the discontinuation of the two first class compounds, AZD9056, the P2X7 receptor antagonist, and AZD5672, the CCR5 receptor antagonist. Both failed to meet the efficacy hurdle we had set for them.</p>
          <p>Today the portfolio has 146 projects, for which 103 are in clinical development. Of those projects in Phase I and beyond, 19% are biologics, 55% are first in class and 31% are sourced from external sources. However, R&amp;D is about investing in the right business cases to move projects through development, and that's the underlying reasons for the plans I've already outlined for you in our proposed operating model. So it's not only about numbers, obviously.</p>
          <p>I believe that 2009 is good evidence of the progress we have made with our late-stage pipeline, and this chart emphasizes this further. It shows the potential first major filings for each new product, and thus, it doesn't include filings by country and does not include projects where we have already made the first major filing.</p>
          <p>We hope to file RECENTIN for both colorectal cancer and glioblasatoma during the year. I've already mentioned to you that we plan to make initial submissions for Dapagliflozin and Ceftaroline later this year.</p>
          <p>We also see the potential for us to make an additional 13 significant filings over the following four year period to the end of 2014. You will notice that these are a mix of in house and external opportunities and span all the therapy areas of interest to us.</p>
          <p>One of those with potential for filing in early 2011 is Cybotemptun . Cybotemptum is our oral, once-daily anti selin A-receptor antagonist that we're developing in both metastatic and non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, which fits well with our Casodex and Zoladex experience.</p>
          <p>Treatment for advanced prostate cancer typically involves hormonal manipulation with agents and ultimately chemotherapy. Cybotemptum potentially offers a new treatment for patients who have become resistant to their hormonal castration treatment, and we anticipate seeing the first Phase III data in the fourth quarter this year.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we have the potential to bring a number of new medicines to the market in the coming years, and we will continue to look for additional opportunities to supplement the pipeline.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, 2009 has been a busy year with delivery of a number of new medicine and submissions of another six regulatory filings. We have bolstered the last stage pipeline with four exciting new opportunities, and we see the potential for a significant number of new medicines over the coming years.</p>
          <p>We realize that we need to do more to ensure to create value for our shareholders, and I'm confident that the strategic proposal I've outlined to you today will give us the best opportunity to accomplish that. Our plans amount to a complete rewiring of our R&amp;D to form one coherent, value-driven research and development platform that, I believe, has the potential to put us in a good position to meet our R&amp;D target to deliver, on average, two new drugs per year.</p>
          <p>And with that I would like to leave it back to David.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Simon.</p>
          <p>Okay, time to move on to Q&amp;A. Just a couple of points I want to make. Number one, for those of you that are on the telephone, you can press star one on your phones to indicate that you would like to speak.</p>
          <p>Also, we just wanted to remind everybody, we have a few other members of our management team here: Bruno Angelici, who has run the rest of the world business outside of North America; Tony Zook is here, who runs North America and has taken on more; and Jeff Pott is here, our general counsel, as well as a few other folks. So hopefully we can answer your questions, but that's probably where we ought to start.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Alexandra Hauber from JPMorgan. I have three questions.</p>
          <p>Firstly -- and thank you very much, first of all, for giving that 2010 to 2014 outlook. That's quite helpful, but I still have a few questions on that.</p>
          <p>Firstly, just to get the R&amp;D spend roughly right, for which you give some sort of guidance. Firstly, on the CapEx directionally. That was down this year. Is it going to be -- should we assume that's roughly flattish, or is it in that period where you will have to make further investments in something like the biologicals? Because at some point, you should get eligible products. So just the direction of the CapEx spend. And also, given that you're doing this cut of the R&amp;D organization, should we assume that the external part of R&amp;D is going up?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the revenue guidance. You say you aspire towards -- to the top end of the 28 to 34 billion, but aspiration is obviously not a commitment. So I was wondering what needs to happen so you get to that 34? Is it that some of this probability &#x2013; you said that the pipeline forecasts are probability adjusted. Is it that these probability adjustments need to go away? The risk adjustments need to go away? Or is it other things such as growth rates in emerging markets? So what's the bigger variable here? Or do you have something else?</p>
          <p>And then the third question is on the pipeline and those filing timelines you gave us. There's still no MedImmune biological on those filing timelines in this 2010 to 2014 window, which suggests to me that there is delays from where we were originally expecting things to be, at least in December 2007.</p>
          <p>So have there been any delays, and when should we expect the first medi-biological to come to the market? And another product which wasn't on the list for the filings was 837. Can you comment on where we are on that one? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, good. Well, Simon, do you want to maybe just make a couple of points about the R&amp;D spend guidance and CapEx? And is the external R&amp;D spend going up in the context of our overall guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks for the questions, Alex. I think we have framed our planning assumption over a five year period as re-investing 40 to 50% of our cash flow back into the business to drive future growth and value.</p>
          <p>Actually, where we sit within that range will depend a lot upon the nature of the opportunities that we see. But I think that the track record over the last couple of years shows that we are very actively pursuing externalization and licensing opportunities. And I think that you'll continue to see that as a very important part of our strategy as we go forward.</p>
          <p>So one part of your question, do we expect externalization to continue to be an important part of R&amp;D and potentially nudging up?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>-- is going to become a larger portion of that 45%, which you are going to &#x2013; assuming it's extra light now, is that going to grow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will depend very much on the opportunities that we see. And I think the pace of externalization that we've delivered in the past 12 months, we would like to see those sorts of opportunities as we go forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, we spent, over the last couple of years, somewhere around about 1 billion, 1.2 billion sort of level, and I expect that to be a number reasonably around that range going forward. Don't expect a major change in the level of capital investment in the business. The mix may change a little bit, actually, from tangible assets through into information technology, which is a very important part of driving productivity in the business.</p>
          <p>So I think that's the two specific questions on the other components of the reinvestment. On revenue, we're obviously confident of our ability to deliver within our planning assumptions, the range we provided. And we absolutely aspire to be on the top end of that by the end of the period.</p>
          <p>There are three critical drivers of that. One is that we sustain our record in growing the market share of brands where we've got exclusivity, and I think you can see we've got a very good track record of doing that. You saw that from the growth in brands like XR, CRESTOR, SYMBICORT that we reported in '09.</p>
          <p>Secondly, getting to that top end we'll need to see continued growth in double digits in our emerging markets. We've been growing in the sort of early to mid-teens over recent years. We think we're very well positioned in those markets. We've made very substantial investments in terms of our infrastructure, commercial infrastructure. And you saw that in the fourth quarter of '09 and we believe that that will continue to bear fruit. We have been positioned amongst the fastest growing in all of our emerging markets in recent years and we don't see any reduction in that momentum. And then thirdly, as I think you saw, we've now got a portfolio of almost a dozen projects that are in either just launched in the case of ONGLYZA in our late stage. And taking a reasonable risk adjusted view of those we absolutely see those delivering 4 to 6 billion by 2014 and those are the three components that get us to the top end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. On many, we are going to look at some data actually on a project in the next couple of months to decide whether it goes into Phase III, in which case it probably would hit in the period, we just haven't seen the data yet on 545 and lupus. I know we've also got our flu vaccines registered &#x2013; well, filings now going on globally. We filed in Asia and in Europe, so we're hoping to get those approved over the course of the next year. Tony and Peter here, are there any others &#x2013; and Motavizumab is also under review at the FDA; now we've done response to the CRL. So there are a few things coming along and there are a number of projects in Phase I, as Anders said, I think and early Phase II. 19% of that portfolio is in biologics. Andrew?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew Baum from Morgan Stanley. Just two questions, if I understand you have set a particular course within R&amp;D inside the organization. And yet when I look from the outside you don't have a head of R&amp;D as far as I'm aware. You don't have a head of discovery, and you've taken your R&amp;D head count, or you will do, take it down by about 15% over the next four years. So my question is how do you reconfigure, how do you see the structure of R&amp;D going forward in terms of the management structure? And are we looking at an internal solution to this or an external? And if it's an external solution, then does the dynamic and the fact that you already set the course create any potential difficulties in attracting the correct candidate?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the 4 to 6 billion that you identified as being potential revenue target. Perhaps you can care to maybe break it up for us. And so, how much comes from yet to be identified in-licensing opportunities? How much from emerging markets? I know it's a tough question but maybe some indication of the magnitude of the various components will be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, all right. Well, let me cover the R&amp;D situation. We did have a resignation at the head of discovery back in November, and we've taken that opportunity to benchmark our internal candidates against external candidates as to think about what's the best way to go forward. And that process is well underway. It does fit to some degree with the approach we've taken with the restructuring R&amp;D because we have the management team's very involved. The focus is on integrating the discovery and early development groups into these innovative medicine units that Anders talked about. And I think, as we have talked to people about the opportunity, we're making it very clear that we've got some things underway to make sure they understand it if they were to join us from outside, what we have done so far, if you will, to do that.</p>
          <p>I haven't sensed yet that that has not been -- affected attractiveness. I think the attraction is whether or not somebody wants to come in and take a look at that segment of our business and see if they want to run it. So I haven't sensed that we've lost any ground as a result of that. And we felt that because we had already undertaken to start to make the changes in R&amp;D, that in talking with the management team there and amongst ourselves as to leadership we felt like we had a pretty good handle on what was going on and could go forward. So I think we're ultimately going to have a slightly different integration approach from the innovative medicine unit level, and that will affect the leadership of that group. And that's going to happen relatively soon I hope.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because of the 4 to 6 billion, the quantum is a view across, both recent launches and the pipeline and potential further additions to that pipeline. I set out the sort of 12 projects which feature most prominently in that in my presentation.</p>
          <p>When we looked at each of those projects, taken a very hard look at their regular pre-technical commercial success, we think that the basis of that is very much in line with what the industry's achieved in those particular areas, and that brings together to the 4 to 6 billion. It's fair to say that most of that in the planning period is going to be in our Western markets, which is typically where we launch first, rather than stronger contributions from the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>But I wouldn't unpick the 4 to 6 more specific than that at this stage.</p>

          <p>Sebastian <mark type="inaudible" />. Thanks for the long-term guidance. Apparently the consensus stands at around $28 billion in sales around 2014. And you have a pretty detailed view of where consensus is sitting by product. Is there any products where there would be a material difference between your view of what they will be in 2014 and where consensus view? Could you help us with this, please?</p>
          <p>And secondly, more on 2010, could you share with us what is your scenario for Nexium and SYMBICORT in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, do you want to take the 2014 guidance question? And then maybe I'll ask for Bruno to comment on SYMBICORT and Nexium in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think the consensus of 28 billion, I think that's something that we've seen from the collections we've done.</p>
          <p>I think looking across the portfolio, we feel that, particularly in the emerging markets and the businesses outside the more closely followed markets, such as the U.S. and one I'm sure the major European markets. We think that our potential to drive strong growth may be underestimated. And that's across the portfolio, so it is a geographic variance as opposed to a specific product variance.</p>
          <p>We also see, across the brands where we've got exclusivity, we feel that the track record we've got in growing share with strongly differentiated brands across the portfolio may be somewhat underestimated. And in addition to that, we obviously have a high degree of confidence in the delivery of the pipeline that we've just described, and with the breadth of projects that we have to drive revenue growth, since the overall portfolio factor, that may be underestimated.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can. On Nexium we lose our date of exclusivity March this year, so then you can assume that during the course of the year there will be generic entry. That's our assumptions.</p>
          <p>In the case of SYMBICORT, we lose the date of exclusivity for the substances in the fourth quarter this year. And our assumption is that the generics will come in within the next 12 months but not earlier than that.</p>
          <p>You should know that the asthma market in fixed combinations is very device driven, and in our case, we have the Turbuhaler device, and to that we have patent expiry on June 2017. So we know where the exclusivity goes. You cannot say exactly when generics enter, but the assumption for Nexium is '10 and for SYMBICORT during '11, late '11.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Mark Purcell from Barclays Capital.</p>
          <p>First question, healthcare reforms outside the U.S. What are you factoring in there in terms of your guidance? Secondly, on CRESTOR, can you discuss the net pricing at the moment for CRESTOR and your outlook for that going forward in the next few years? You seem to be confident in the patent protecting Seroquel XR in the United States. I just wondered if you could comment on that? And then lastly, the PARP inhibitor, I just wondered how ambitious your Phase III programs could be? There could be clearly a much wider use of that product than you currently have focused on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, okay. Let you get to the PARP inhibitor in a minute and you guys can handle maybe the CRESTOR pricing, Tony or Mark. Outside the U.S. each year, Mark, we take our best guess at what we think the government interventions will be. A couple of years we've been on, a couple years we &#x2013; one year we underestimated, one year we overestimated. So we have a rounded accommodation. I can't put a number out there for you that thinks, given the economic circumstances, we will definitely continue to get an increased pressure in those markets, especially in Europe, and I think it's more evolutionary than revolutionary has been our experience. It's kind of incremental change.</p>
          <p>And regarding the XR patent in the U.S., we have a patent, it's been challenged. We believe that we've got a good position with our patent and we are going to continue to defend our intellectual property there very vigorously. So we feel strongly about that one. Do you want to do the PARP inhibitor? And then I'll ask the guys for net pricing on CRESTOR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean as you saw, the PARP inhibitor <mark type="inaudible" /> quite a unique and interesting class, because as I tried to say there are two opportunities. One, going down the backyard route, which is very specific for the repair mechanism, but also it can be used in conjunction with chemo. It's that latter part where we believe it's going to expand more. And, as I said, we're going to go through this during the year. So I would expect an expansion of the program going into different opportunities. Then, of course, we have the triple negative breast where we have the competitor compound going down. So I would anticipate the program to expand into various indications, both bracket specific as well as the chemo.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Relative to CRESTOR, I would tell you that going into 2010 our access rates have actually improved. They were pretty high to begin with and now they've improved further. Relative to net price, there has not been any significant change in the net price. In fact it's been relatively stable the last few years. This year we consider it to be stable, if not up slightly in base.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Couple of questions on guidance. If you were to end up hitting the top end of your revenue range for 2014 and the operating income margin range, it implies that revenues would be about a billion higher than they were in '09. And operating income would similarly be about a billion higher, which is not really what anyone models. And if that's achievable, then your stock is massively undervalued at current prices, in which case it would seem like you should be taking every last cent you have to do share buy-backs with. But I don't really see that happening. And I'm wondering how I read into this in terms of the confidence, your confidence in your new guidance. The second question is in that guidance you talked about returning to more consistent revenue growth downstream of 2014. In that timeframe, my model has CRESTOR absolutely dominating the P&amp;L and being much bigger than any other product. But if my information is right, that drug goes off patent in the U.S. in 2016. And I'm wondering how that's congruent with saying that you'll have more stable revenue growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Simon, you want to take the guidance issue and the share buy-back and our position on where we are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. In the guidance range that we provided does indeed paint a scenario where we're at the top end of our revenue range and sustaining the sorts of operating margins that we provided in our guidance. And we've, as we've laid out, have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver within those planning assumptions. If we turn to the buy-back program, we're very pleased with the very strong cash generation of the business in 2009. We've entered 2010 with net funds of half a billion. And then the back of that, that's a function of the very strong focus we've put on cash as a business over the recent past. We're pleased to resume the share repurchase program, which you'll recall we ceased back in October 2008. We've also announced today we'll see a billion dollars of share repurchases during the course of 2010, and also that the Board will keep under review the opportunity for further cash distributions as we go forward. And we will, as I said, keep that very firmly under review.</p>

          <p>And as for CRESTOR in 2016 and what the line will look like, Tim, appreciate it. We have gone out to 2014 with our best guess on a revenue card. We're not going to go out to 2016 at this point. So I understand your question, but 2014 is as far as we're going to go right now. Here, yes, you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. Two questions, the first question is on CRESTOR and essentially the court case, which I believe will now start in late February. Is your planning for that to be a relatively short trial given the judge presiding on that case is due to retire towards the end of July or is there any &#x2013; can you paint a picture? Is there any precedent where maybe the judge will just hand down to someone else before the trial starts? What is your planning around that situation?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if I'm not mistaken, and it could be just a coincidence, you chose to report core EPS because you thought that would be a more representative number to give to the market to represent the business performance. If I look at core EPS and reported EPS, actual growth 24% on both counts, and I see outgrowth 23%. Is it about time to drop that or...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Core EPS is an important metric for how we manage the business. It looks quite closely at the cash operating performance of the business. It excludes restructuring and the less-even impact of restructuring. It removes the impact of the MedImmune and Merck acquisition and the intangibles associated with that, and obviously in the course of this year, there was a legal cost that went through. We think that for management purposes, core is a very important measure to drive the business. Clearly, reported is also a metric we do look at. I think the fact that they happen to be in line this year is coincidence rather than a fact that would cause us to change where we focus the business and where we provide guidance.</p>

          <p>Kevin Wilson from Citi. Two questions, one on restructuring. Simon, how much of the 1.9 billion would you expect to make it to EBIT and how much of that roughly do you expect to reinvest in order to drive the top line? And secondly, how do you motivate the organization when you're going to take 15% of the workforce who potentially are not going to be there, how do you get that done quickly and efficiently, so some sort of sense of the timeline when you will be able to say we now know who's not going to be here and who's going to be doing something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, I'll start with that one. We've had a restructuring program underway for the last couple of years, and I think the key from my perspective is to have strong leadership who can deliver the messages to people about why we are doing what we're doing and how we're going to go about doing it. And it's also been my experience, Kevin, that the more quickly we're able to do it, to identify where we're going to make these changes and who is impacted, the better off we are so people understand who's in and who's not going to be there. And so, we will work very quickly. We'll meet with our top 115 leaders almost immediately following this meeting to have our leadership discussion about what we need to do in the business. But starting today, actually, Anders' people and the discovery management team who are currently being led by Christer K&#xF6;hler, temporarily for the few months while we have the opening, are already meeting with people to start talking about what's going on. So you're absolutely right; it has an impact.</p>
          <p>We've seen it over the last couple of years, but we try to get people focused on making sure we know which projects we're trying to move forward, what the timelines are, what the resources required are and try to hold people accountable. And I think we saw actually in the R&amp;D organization this year some very good progress and milestones and accomplishments in hitting or exceeding some targets when we look pre-Phase IIb, just some of the things that have happened. It's the best year we've had in 10 for progressions, milestones, improvements in efficiency, et cetera.</p>
          <p>I think when we can be clear with people, and when we can focus them on the work that needs to be done, a lot more does happen, but I don't underestimate the impact this has on the organization, as I said before. We really don't take it lightly, but as we look on balance at what we need to do to move our business forward, we need to take some of these decisions, not so much for today, but for a few years from now when we recognize that we're going to be in a much different environment.</p>
          <p>Simon, do you want to take the <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The extent to which we reinvest a portion of the 1.9 back into this will depend, obviously, on the opportunities that we see as we go forward. Having said that, there are two areas where we will be making some reinvestments, and one is in the area of R&amp;D. So we explained that we're taking out about 3,500 positions are being impacted, although the net will be close to 1,800, and that's a reinvestment in capabilities and also in biologics. We will continue to make investments in our emerging markets, and you saw that to some extent, an early investment in that regard in the fourth quarter. So there will be some reinvestment. If I compare it to the first wave, I suspect it will be less reinvestment proportionally than you saw in the first wave.</p>

          <p>Good. There's an email question. Do you want to take that one, Simon? There was a question about the average risk adjustment factor for the risk adjusted revenues of 4 to 6 billion that you have in the 28 to 34.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; I wouldn't give a one single number on risk adjustment. I think what I would guide you to is to look at the opportunities that we have. It's very clear which have been launched and where we've got filings, which phase of development they're in, and the risk adjustment factors are very much consistent with what you'd find for equivalent therapeutic areas across our sector. So I would direct you to look at that.</p>

          <p>Michael Leacock from RBS. Just one question, if you don't mind.</p>
          <p>In terms of your strategic initiatives, can I just clarify that you mean when you say including branded generics that solely refers to the emerging markets business? And within that business, if that's correct, what skills do you currently have in that area? And what would your competitive advantage be to maybe use that as a driver of growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, yeah. That is focused on &#x2013; it's a market driven, or regionally driven strategy. It's not something that applies across all markets just because of the reimbursement systems and the recognition of where branded generics fit. Where they do, it is similar to the personal selling model that we currently have in place. I mean, it's promoting a product that's branded under the AstraZeneca umbrella, which is why I've said we will, where it makes sense for us to do it and it fits under our brand, we will do it. The core capabilities have more to do with marketing and selling.</p>
          <p>There are some differences, to be fair. Bruno has led a significant amount of work in this area to point out some of the differences in terms of how we make decisions on products to move more quickly when they're not responding, etcetera, than we would normally do with our branded products.</p>
          <p>But generally I think we're moving forward. We've got this going already in India. We've hired a couple hundred people. We've got, I think, some 10 or 20, maybe 30 projects, products out already, so, quite a bit's happened.</p>
          <p>Let me take Gbola's call, and then I'll come back to you, okay? Gbola on the telephone? You still there, Gbola? Going, going? Okay, back to you.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Just a few questions, please.</p>
          <p>First, as you're reviewed your dividend policy share buy-backs, just remind us of what you view as optimal balance sheet structure, given that your forecast leaving with you a healthy net cash position. Secondly, a very specific product question. On the third quarter call when you talked about a potential BRILINTA-aspirin relationship, was wondering if you could update us on any additional findings from that. And then finally, you've stratified your therapeutic categories with attractiveness in R&amp;D. Just wondered if you could give us some color on what you view as the most attractive in what you're doing and what you view as the least attractive. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Therapeutic areas. Okay. Fine. If I take BRILINTA first, as I said, we filed late last year and now have a PDUFA date in place and it's a big file with fantastic data coming forward. We also talked about lost time that there could be different reasons for these so-called not American cohort. Could be play of chance, it could be an association with aspirin, or it could be something else. We're exploring this with the executive committee and we're preparing for publishing those results. I don't want to go in details now because that would jeopardize potential publications. So you would just have to bear with us for a bit longer. With respect to the therapeutic areas, we still find all of them attractive. So what I tried to say was saying that we're still with the therapeutic areas, but within them, we make a consolidation of the disease areas within them. So you have to make a distinction between TA and BA. So the therapy areas are still good to us, but within them we would see a pruning of about 25% of the disease or disease areas we're in now would not be there, and we would focus on the remaining 75% and build on the strengths --.</p>

I think we are where we should be. I don't want to pick one over the other. I'd rather say you're in or you're out, and these ones are in.

        <plist>
          <p>We currently clearly have a very strong capital position as we go into 2010 with net funds of half a billion. And we do expect the group to continue to generate significant cash flow through our planning period, and we described the strategy and assumptions around reinvestment of that to drive the business going forward. And clearly that which is not invested in the business is available over time for meeting our debt repayment commitments but also providing distributions to our shareholders, both through a progressive dividend policy and share repurchases. I think it's too early in this planning period to predict the optimal capital structure for the end of the period. I think we've laid out very clearly the cash generation strategy and the focus on a progressive dividend policy and distributions to shareholders.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Three questions, please. You did a fantastic job in improving your working capital last year, bringing in over a billion dollars. Can you tell us what the opportunities will be over the next few years? I guess you've got a growing business in emerging markets. If that grows more strongly, what will that do in terms of both the normal ratios and the P&amp;L and in terms of working capital? Can you also tell us a little bit more, you mentioned a collaboration, more increased collaboration with payors. Is this going to take us down a sort of pay for performance route? And have you actually got any examples of things that you have done there, examples going forward? I'm particularly interested, I guess, in how you defend CRESTOR post Lipitor patent expiry, if there's anything that you can put in place there, CRESTOR being so important?</p>
          <p>One tiny little accounting question, I see in your cash flow that you've got a disposal of intangible assets with 270 odd million of income. Was there any profit associated with that? And if so, where would we find it in the P&amp;L? It's always easy to take costs out, it's just as important to take out profits, I guess. And a final thing, if I can push my luck, how would you differentiate your PARP inhibitor from the bi par one? Is there anything that is significantly different about your compound to theirs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Why don't I just take the payor question. I'll let Simon comment on working cap in the emerging markets and some of the impacts on that. And I'll let Anders comment on the PARP inhibitor.</p>
          <p>I think our view on the payor situation is when we take a look at the level of sophistication of payors, if you take a look in the U.S. and you pick up some of the companies like Medco or United Healthcare, who have these tremendous technology platforms that allow them to go in and look very differently at product utilization at some elements of what should or shouldn't be on formularies from their perspective. And we see this in a few other countries around the world about a capability that's developing, we recognize that we need to be in discussions with organizations like that and leadership like that.</p>
          <p>At the front end, in the Phase I, Phase II category, when we're looking at what are the differentials that we believe will matter to people who make the decisions about creating access through the paying, through being a payor, so. And while we have done some of this in the past, and it's been part of what we do, I think as we re-evaluated our strategy last year and decided to make these changes in the R&amp;D strategy, the second element of our strategy was to recognize how important it was to create more access through this. So there are some examples of things that have worked. I'll let Tony comment maybe on just differentiation between the CRESTOR and generic atorvastatin as an example in just a minute. But do you want to do the PARP inhibitor and just, I don't know what comments you want to make; it's hard to compare.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I think, as you say, David, it's hard to compare right now. I think we have to look upon it from two points of view. First, you have the target specific, would there be any differences. And then you have the compound specific. And I think as you can see now, we obviously going down a slightly different route, testing difference of aspects of the target versus the diseases. And I think we just have to wait until more data come forward. The compound specific is just too early to say, let's see when data come in. We are as interested as you are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, you want to make any comments either about generic atorva  or just other examples with payor that you think matter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you hit the high ones, David, as far as involving payors much earlier in the portfolio process. I think that's important for us. We also have had some examples where we've been working with them hand in glove to look at some real world data applications of our products, and I think that has brought some learnings to us. Relative to CRESTOR into the future, I would remind everyone that it's a very heavy, generic market, even today. And I believe the future for CRESTOR is very much dependent on what is driving its success today, and that is maintaining the very high ground relative to efficacy for that patient with multiple risk factors. When we maintain and compete in that space then we win. In fact we have seen CRESTOR be the only branded product to grow share today in this kind of generic environment. It's also the number one switch-to brand from generics. And so I would believe that moving forward the key to CRESTOR's success is reinforcing that very strong positioning with the high risk population. And therefore JUPITER becomes a critical piece of that puzzle moving forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Okay, good. Simon, over to you on working cap and on the disposal versus profits question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The disposal that you <mark type="inaudible" /> disposal. And typically we'd be taking profit on disposals through other income. And you'll see that that was an important contributor to other income this year on working capital. Thank you, we are pleased with the performance we're making in driving increase shortly in the cash conversion cycle in the business. On the specific areas of further opportunity in our platform of emerging markets, we think there's further opportunity to bring down inventory in our business. And that's about making the investments in information to link our supply chain globally and also the Lean program we're driving, so inventory is a big area of focus for us, and we see further opportunity. In payables the, there's a close link between our working capital program and our procurement program and getting the right balance between the terms that we agree with suppliers and the discounts that we get; so payment terms relative to discounts. And I think that one of the big areas of opportunity for us, having really brought a focus on working capital, is we're in a position to have those discussions with suppliers, and that's an ongoing process.</p>
          <p>In terms of the receivables, the emerging market, the receivables business, again, I think we've continued to deliver against the targets that we've set for ourselves. If you adjust the geographic mix, we've continued to improve our collection record. You're right, though, that the receivables will be a function of the business mix, although the slower paying markets are actually typically not in the emerging markets. And so we don't expect growth in our emerging markets to have material impact on our receivables. More generally, on the emerging markets business, if we look across that portfolio we see that as not only an opportunity for very strong growth but also it's profitable business for us and we're very pleased with the margin contribution that it brings. It is not as profitable as the more mature, Western markets, whether it be North America or one or two of our more profitable developed markets. Typically we didn't -if you index some of the portfolio, the most profitable are at about 100, our emerging markets as a portfolio averaging around about the sort of 70 level, but we're seeing that on an upward trend. And it's highly variable between different markets, but on an upward trend, and that's a function of the fact we're driving strong growth. We may be investing to drive that growth, but we've still got quite a lot of continued sort of operational leverage in those markets. So it's fast growing markets but it's also a profitable business for us as well.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Three questions, please. Just in terms of your guidance, you specifically state you don't anticipate any material M&amp;A, so therefore it just implies you have a significant cash pile building up. Is it safe to assume the most likely use of that are more material buy backs in the future? Or perhaps do we see it as a kind of backstop for acquisitions should the pipeline attrition be worse than you expect? Secondly, I just wondered if you could just comment quickly on the RSV market in the U.S. and whether you still see that as a source of growth in the future. And just lastly, you've commented on your ability to execute certain strong brand growth. But when do you think that we'll see more evidence of that with ONGLYZA particularly in the U.S.? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. I'll go to Tony in a minute on the RSV and on the performance of ONGLYZA, just to give a sense from his perspective what we've seen so far. On the guidance, and you know around no material M&amp;A I think we're just trying to put some planning assumptions around that allow you to see the way we look at things. I've been very clear in my comments that I think collaboration is a much more appropriate road for AstraZeneca to go down than consolidation. And so our &#x2013; we're looking at opportunities to acquire products, to acquire technologies or to enter into licensing agreements that allow us to add the value, the expertise, the knowledge that we bring to someone else's products that we think we can get more value from them than they might be able to get alone.</p>
          <p>So that's essentially the first call for cash in our business, which is to put it aside to make sure we're positioned to invest in our business where it is appropriate to do that, but we obviously have creditors through the debt that we do have. We've got dividend payments. We have a number of calls for cash through CapEx, etcetera. So the balance is where we run our business, and as Simon said earlier, when we have excess capital, we're going to return it to our shareholders. So it's not really a backstop for attrition, I think was the word you used. It's really something that we use from a planning perspective to make sure we're positioned to take opportunities to bring in late stage products, and you've seen us do that I guess four or five times over the course of the last six months. So that's the approach we take. Tony, would you like to comment about RSV in the U.S.? Is that a source of growth and maybe outside the U.S., where we did see growth, and what are the issues we're dealing with there as well as ONGLYZA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, David. The question is RSV an area of attractiveness for us? The answer is clearly yes. In addition to where we are today with Synagis, we look forward to having a new entrance with Motavizumab. We have seen strong growth outside the U.S. with Synagis and we equally look forward to the opportunity to bring Motavizumab there as well. Relative to the current performance, we have been challenged in the last days of this year, but we believe there there's a strong education effort that we still need to drive into the marketplace with Synagis because some shortfalls with the COID guidelines that came in. But nonetheless, we still look at this as a very good opportunity for us globally as well as locally in the U.S.</p>
          <p>On ONGLYZA, I would say, David, that we're off to a solid start. We have seen significant uptake in the DPP-4 new to patient class. The most recent data has been very encouraging as well. We're now approaching 13% of new DPP-4 patients to therapy, which I think is a very good signal for us. We've also seen an increase in the number of trial lists that are coming on board with ONGLYZA, and we also know that the rate of access continues to increase for ONGLYZA going into this year. So we feel very, very good about where we stand today, and I'll leave it to Bruno or Camilla, if you want to make any comments on rest of world ONGLYZA.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's early days. We can see good trial, as Tony said, trial lists. We have launched basically in Germany and the UK. So it's very early days but we're off to a very solid start outside the U.S. as well, so we will see. We believe that the DPP-4 class will expand and we will help to expand the class, but so far off to a good start but it's early days.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Okay, and I would just say on the RSV we're very disappointed in the COID guidelines, just to be very clear. They are in direct conflict with our label and it puts us in a tough position in the marketplace. Payors have, some payors have adopted, some have chosen not to because they believe that the label is what they should be guided by. So we're continuing to monitor and try to influence the situation. I'll take one more question because we're going to run out of time here in a minute, then we'll stay around afterwards for a few. Sir?</p>

          <p>Thanks. This Nick Turner from Mirabaud. Just thinking about RECENTIN and the HORIZON trials, to the best of my knowledge no targeted agent has shown a survival benefit, overall survival benefit when used on top of an Oxalinplatin-based chemotherapy regime in first line colorectal cancer. So if HORIZON II was to follow that trend, shall we say, and miss its, miss survival benefits in HORIZON II, does that nullify the HORIZON III trial? In other words, if you don't show a benefit, survival benefit over FOLFOX alone, then how will you interpret a benefit or a non-effect on top of Avastin in a FOLFOX or on a FOLFOX regime?</p>

And as we've said, as our revenue base transitions over the next few years with loss of exclusivity up against new product launches, we thought it would be helpful to provide these longer-term planning assumptions to give you a sense of where we see things going. As I said in my comments, I believe our strategy is very clear. We're an innovation-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We are, we believe there's significant value to be created, and it is the business that we know best. I think we're positioned well because we have the global footprint that I talked about. We've got very strong commercial capabilities.</p>
          <p>We've got a highly competitive supply chain which has delivered a lot of value to us. We've got a disciplined culture that we believe will reshape and help us adapt our cost base and the way we operate our business going forward so that we can be more competitive in the future. And we've got a core capability in the sciences, both in small molecules as well as biologics in the research and development area that we believe can bring products forward that will make a difference for patients and improve human health.</p>
          <p>We recognize that the choice of strategy like this brings risk with it. It's got a profile for risk and reward, though, and it's a profile we believe if we manage it prudently and patiently, it can create long-term value for society, and, at the same time, like-minded shareholders will recognize that we believe that society still needs, wants and will be willing to pay for medicines that are truly differentiated when we can apply scientific innovation to unmet medical need. And, in order to bring that to reality, we need to &#x2013; we recognize that there's significant stewardship we have of our shareholders' funds and that's why we undertake everything we do with the mindset of return on investment.</p>
          <p>Our leadership team will challenge the employees of AstraZeneca to make sure they align their activities around these value drivers, reducing the cost of inputs, driving productivity in our business through the development process or the supply chain or though making our marketed products more profitable. Everyone in AstraZeneca has to be charged with that kind of responsibility to make sure that our investments, in R&amp;D especially, but throughout our business, return more than the cost of capital while we continue to deliver meaningful medicines that really make a difference to help the patients throughout the world. That's what we're here to do.</p>
          <p>Before I thank you all for joining us, I just want to make one other point, which is Bruno Angelici, who is here with us, has announced that he's leaving AstraZeneca. He finished up his role as the leader of our rest of world business, which he took over in 2001. He's been with AstraZeneca for over 20 years. He's led our emerging market strategy. He's led I think our successes in Europe as well as some of that restructuring. He's been a tremendous advocate for AstraZeneca and supporter of me and a member of my management team. So I just wanted to let you all know we will miss Bruno. He's here if you want to come down and get your last shot at him before he doesn't come back to these anymore.</p>
          <p>And to let you all know, Tony Zook has taken the responsibility for our global commercial organization, so that will include all of Bruno's responsibility as well as our global marketing group as well. So that's one of our management changes. We're excited about it. We will miss Bruno, and we wish him well as he moves on to his next career. Thank you very much for your time and attention today.</p>
