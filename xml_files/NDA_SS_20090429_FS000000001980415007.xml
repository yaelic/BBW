          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Nordea International Telephone Conference. My name is Louise, I'll be your coordinator for today's conference. Through duration of the call, you will be on listen-only. As of the end of the call, you'll have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I will now hand it over to, Johan Ekwall, to begin today's conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. My name is, Johan Ekwall Mann, Head of Investor Relation. Warmly welcome to this telephone conference as said, but it's also a webcast teleconference. So you can follow this also on Nordea's website, nordea.com, where you will find all the slides.</p>
          <p>With me here in the room, I have Nordea's President and Group CEO, Christian Clausen, Nordea's CFO Fredrik Rystedt and Nordea's Chief Risk Officer, Carl-Johan Granvik. We will give some quick presentations, and then enter the Q&amp;A session. Christian, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello everybody. I would give a few introductory remarks, I'm sure you by now, have seen the numbers, so I will not go too deep into them but start on the first slide with the main message of today, we had a strong start of the year.</p>
          <p>We had revenues up 5%, cost down five, lending growth is 2% and loan losses are in line with our guidance at 54 basis points and risk-adjusted profit is up 21% on the quarter and then we have the strong capital base.</p>
          <p>In this particular quarter, we have many currency effect and Fredrik Rystedt will comment more on these in a short while. It is particularly interesting to see that we keep delivering our risk-adjusted profit target, which was set back in 2006, which was doubling in seven years and we were above the line in '07, a bit below in '08 and now we are ahead again. And this is, I think a very good result and we are very happy to see that that we are up 38% compared to a year ago.</p>
          <p>We had actually expected that, during this downturn would be a bit below the line and of course the coming quarters can also maybe make us come closer to the line again.</p>
          <p>We have redefined our growth forward during this economic crisis as middle of the road approach, we stay loyal to our growth strategy and our long-term vision, but we apply a middle of the road thinking. And the middle of the road is simply to say that in the middle of the downturn, where we have limited visibility, we want to avoid to drive into the ditches like several banks have actually done. So we want to stand in the middle of the road, we will focus on our core customers and selected new business possibilities with good customers, we will have &#x2013; make our risk management even more proactive and we are managing cost growth down and we are adjusting our growth initiative downwards and we are creating this core to one ratio of 10%, which we think is a very strong capital growth. So what we don't want to do is to end up in this situation where we have to close down growth initiatives, drastic cost-cutting, cut back on investing, cut back on balance sheet and so on, which clearly would have made us lose momentum and withdraw from customers. And on the other hand, we don't want to &#x2013; not to respond prudently.</p>
          <p>The main reasoning for the middle of the road approach is actually to keep our strong business momentum which comes back, it seems many quarters, actually several years and this momentum has been built and this situation result now in Q1 also and to keep that momentum is particularly important and that is the essence of the middle of the road.  In addition to the fact that we want to keep our strong position, so we can accelerate out of the crisis when economic visibility gets better and that's certainly not now.</p>
          <p>Cost risk and capital management has taken the lead. We are accelerating our efficiency programs, they're very visible, we get more efficient, we have much more customer meetings which are demonstrated by the fact that we had twice as many customer meetings per employee in Q1 this year as we had last year. We also generally right sizing in selected areas and staff reductions will happen during 2009. We are also still increasing a little in some selected areas. But as I said the risk &#x2013; the growth initiatives have been put more or less on hold.</p>
          <p>We're stepping on our risk management who have created workout teams in all the countries. We have a virtual workout teams with senior bankers and specialists taking more &#x2013; the larger and more specific cases. We have the path for taking over companies and collateral, we have identified external resources to handle specific problems. And the reason for all this is of course that we all know early action. This is by far both the customers and the bank's best interest when problems arise.</p>
          <p>So I think, the whole risk management part is progressing in a very orderly process, very structured process and I think we are quite confident on what we see and as you've heard today, so far in Q1 we are following this plan and we have very few surprises and most things are developing according to plan.</p>
          <p>And on capital, you all know we concluded the rights issue, which means that we have strengthened our capital position. Fredrik will mention more about this.</p>
          <p>My next slide is the one which shows our income development over the last three years, and I think it's an interesting slide showing that we have created this business momentum as the wheel is turning we are getting new customers; we are doing more business with our customers. We are gradually, organically growing and it has produced very good results. In this quarter in particular it's from the capital market area, but in general volumes are up and the momentum is high and we are getting new customers. And to see that in Q1 '09 over Q1 '06 actually we have a 500 million increase in our revenues is confirmed in my opinion.</p>
          <p>So we will stay loyal to our 2009 prices and that is our existing relationships to grow the share value with our customers, selectively acquire new customers which we're doing all the time and to make sure that credit and capital and risk management processes work well.</p>
          <p>With these comments, I will handover to Fredrik.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. I will take you through the result highlights and some capital issues. I will start with the results highlights. And as you've seen total income increased by 5% in comparison to Q4 and 16% in comparison to quarter one of last year. In particular, net gains and losses increased significantly by 81% in comparison to last year. But we also had a good development in net interest income.</p>
          <p>So the expenses decreased by 5% versus Q4 and as a consequence of this profit before loan losses increased by 17%. Despite higher loan losses, operating profit increased by 20% in comparison to Q4 and risk adjusted profit increased with 21%. Now, as Christian mentioned, there are a lot of currency impacts in Q1. And as a consequence it's a fairly, tricky comparison and you see slide 11; I will try to take you through that.</p>
          <p>Generally speaking, the end of period balance sheet rates are set and not are actually stronger than it was in Q4, while the opposite holds true for the average rate used in the income statement. So if we look at the development in comparable currencies and also excluding the non-recurring capital gain in Q4 that we had from NCSD, income increased by 9% compared to last year and 22% in comparison to Q1 of 2008.</p>
          <p>Total operating expenses were flat versus Q4, profit before loan losses therefore increased by 20% and operating also by 22%. So this gives you the highlights of the underlying performance is.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, you can see the reported volume growth numbers and also for your benefit in brackets, you will also see the growth numbers adjusted for FX or for comparable currencies. And as you can see, we continue to grow both for loans and deposits in comparison to Q1 of last year. But you can clearly also see that the growth rate is lower in Q1 than it was in Q4. Now, partly this is a consequence of a seasonably lower activity in Q1 in comparison to Q4. But we also see more modest levels in terms of demand from primarily our corporate customers on the back of the recession. We have also communicated an ambition as part of the middle road strategy that we will reduce the growth levels in Baltics and you can clearly see from this slide that that is taking place.</p>
          <p>If you turn to the next slide, you can see the total net interest income is stable at a very high level and despite &#x2013; that is despite fewer banking days in this quarter in comparison to the last. We considerably worth noting is 180 million of lower deposits income, which is a direct consequence of lower interest rate. In local currencies, net interest income increased by 3% and of course the major impact to that increase is improving lending margins that we have experienced in Q1.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, provides a bit of an overview on the most important variables impacting net interest income. As I stated in Q1, volume has not been a major contributor in comparison to Q4. Lending margins have continued to be positive when &#x2013; and you can also very clearly see that profit margins are under heavy pressure. The lower interest rates has also reduced income on our capital, which you can see in the line lower return on allocated capital on slide 14. And then, as I mentioned before, we also have considerably negative impact on FX.</p>
          <p>Just very quickly, on the next slide, the structural interest income risk you can see that we have a slightly higher interest or income risk for the up 100 which is we have increased our exposure there. But you can see that we are actually decreasing now the risk versus lower rates. And that actually has to do with the fact that in some markets interest rates cannot impact decline any more with 100 basis points.</p>
          <p>We turn to the next slide and quickly go through net fees and commission. You can see that in local currencies, net fee and commission is increasing by 2% and there are several factors that are moving in this quarter. Savings-related commissions are down by 11%, which has to do with several things. First of all, we have more fixed income products in comparison to equity, we have throughout the quarter lower average assets under management and we have fairly little activity among our customers in general and that is taking the savings-related commissions down.</p>
          <p>Lending is up by 16% and quarterly estimation there is the fact that we have been arranging many issues of corporate bonds for our customers so that market is clearly picking up. Payment commission down and this is to a large extent the seasonal impact and as you can see from the last point we have said similar payments to the commission for &#x2013; commission expenses for state programs and there is included a cost, a provision of six million related to the Swedish Stability fund.</p>
          <p>You can see from slide 17 that we have a stabilization of assets under management. The one trend that I would like to highlight there, we have an inflow of close to one billion in the first quarter. Interestingly enough we can see that there is also an in flow to the retail funds and it's likely that the lower interest rate environment is impacting the savings pattern of our retail customers. So, more appetite for these kind of products.</p>
          <p>If I turn to net gains and losses on slide 18, you can see that we had a 58% increase versus Q4 and 81% versus last year. And this is on the back of a record result in our market business area, capital market products that we had very high customer activity and it's also fair to say we had good and relatively predictable market environment. We are &#x2013; the actual majority of the profit generated is on the back of ordinary FX and fixed income products, which is the result of the willingness to &#x2013; for risk management from our customers. Treasury also had a very good result due to positioning for lower interest rates in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In summary, as you can see on slide 19, almost all customer areas continues to grow versus the quarter one of last year and the growth in the customer areas, the underlying growth we can say was 9%, almost 9%. Hence the total growth amounted to 16.2% and that includes a negative FX effect of 111 million total income.</p>
          <p>Quickly on the expense side, you can see that the cost development were unchanged, costs were unchanged in local currency and the cost income ratio improved significantly in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see the bridge towards Q1 of 2008. So all the, you can say ordinary cost items grew moderately with good developments in line with our plans for all those areas. And due to high profits in the capital market area that I talked about just recently, we had a slight increase of variable salaries in the quarter, as you can see on this slide.</p>
          <p>We also had higher pension cost as a result of lower discount rates and of course considerable FX effects that I happened &#x2013; we're talking about. The underlying cost increase if you want to adjust for this, is approximately 6.5%. In last time when we communicated the outlook for the full year, we disclosed that we are reducing the number of employees by 2% and as you can see on the next slide, 22, we have during first quarter reduced by 1%. So we are well in line with achieving our full-year target.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, you can see that in local currency profit before loan losses increased by 11%, which is a new record level for Nordea. Operating profit improved by 7% in comparison to Q4 and that is despite the higher loan losses that you have seen.</p>
          <p>We turn to the next slide, net income of course was impacted by these higher loan losses and we also had a higher tax rate as a consequence of the tax claim in the first quarter. Because of these two factors, return on equity was slightly down or slightly lower than in Q4, but stayed at a very healthy level and as you can see RaRoCar improved from the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to funding and capital and say a few words about this and you can see that on slide 25. Generally, it's fair to say that funding is functioning very well for Nordea. Short-term markets are generally very liquid then pricing also very attractive. Also in the long-term, the funding is well functioning for Nordea, we have issued during the first quarter 7.3 billion, which is more than in line with our funds. Of course, we can clearly say that funding spread for long-term issues remain high, although we see that funding markets gradually are improving in many ways.</p>
          <p>So if I turn a little quickly to the rights offering, it was a very successful outcome. We had a subscription level of 128% and as a consequence of course the underwriting guarantee was not utilized. 99% of the offer was subscribed with the subscription rights and the remaining 1% was allocated to those shareholders that had subscribed with subscription rights on a pro rata basis. And as you know, rights issue increased core capital with 2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Slides 27 shows that Nordea after the rights issue and of course also the reduction, the temporary reduction in dividend is one of the strongest capitalized bank in Europe in terms of core Tier 1 ratio. And just highlighting the fact that the two banks at the top to the very left of the chart are participating in the State Asset Protection Schemes may not that purposely fully comparable.</p>
          <p>On slide 21 you can see that the current capital ratios are clearly above Nordea's capital policy and core Tier 1 ratio was 10% including the rights issue and the Tier 1 ratio 10.9% and both of them are largely unchanged versus Q4. It's just worth noting that Nordea after the rights issue has a capital base that exceeds Pillar I requirements excluding transition rules with &#x20AC;8.2 billion.</p>
          <p>We're talking about risk-weighted assets. Risk weighted assets on the next slide.  Rated risk weighted assets excluding transition rules increased by 1.4% including migration of 1.2%. Market risk has decreased somewhat and operational risk increased to a similar amount, and average risk rates in the portfolio are largely unchanged in comparison to Q4.</p>
          <p>I would end my part of this presentation by just a few words on the customer areas in our Nordic Banking arena. On slide 31, you can see that lending increased by 9% in local currency year-on-year and of course with Norway and Sweden as the biggest contributors. Deposit growth was particularly strong in Sweden. Income wise the biggest contributor was Denmark and Norway and part of that strong performance in Norway is explained by lag effect related to administratively set rates, but it's still a good development also without that.</p>
          <p>Finland has had a weak development in comparison and that is entirely due to lower margins on the very substantial deposit base we have in Finland.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I'll lead to Carl-Johan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fredrik. And I will walk you through the credit portfolio and the loss deterioration that you've seen in the quarter. The background for my comments are illustrated on page 33, and we've have seen a weakening GDP growth out of four &#x2013; for all the four Nordic countries and also that will effect the credit policy going forward.</p>
          <p>We have however very good starting point. It's a very diversified portfolio with more or less four equal parts in the four Nordic countries. And also in terms of segments we are well diversified in terms of having one-third in the loan risk mortgage portfolio and little less than 58% in the corporate portfolio.</p>
          <p>Q1 saw net losses of 356 million or 54 basis points, very much in line with the level we saw in Q1. We saw however slightly lower gross provisions down to 407 from 476 and the same trend that we saw in the fourth quarter continued i.e. we saw basically provisions in the medium size and smaller companies not any big single individual losses. And in terms of geography we also saw the same thing continue i.e. the Danish operations having the highest losses 142 million out of which 12 is related to Danish guarantee schemes. Otherwise the other areas are pretty equally divided in terms of both actual and proportional losses.</p>
          <p>Impaired loans went up 33% now it's 1700 basis points of total lending, deducting the provisions we carry that means 68% net. And what is very typical for our impaired loans prevailed as well in Q1. I &#x2013; that 62% of the impaired loans are still performing indicating that we are identifying problems early on in the process and taking action making provisions and establishing the necessary workout things that we need in order to deal with the problems.</p>
          <p>The increase in the quarter stems largely from Finland and Denmark and then also from the Baltic countries. We continue to increase our collective allowances by 78 million in the quarter, meaning that the all in all carry 486 million in collective provisions the rest being individualized allowances that we have made throughout the years.</p>
          <p>On page 36, we have tried to give a picture about how we look at the portfolio, when we talk about the huge portfolio like we have a 274, it's of course very difficult to give a opinion about and take a stance to our outlook about roughly 50 basis points provisioning over the year.</p>
          <p>But the way we break the portfolio down in the low-risk portfolio, which extends 48% almost half, containing mortgage lending, residential real estate, telecom operators, financial institutions and public and health sector where we see very low provisioning needs also in a tough economic environment that we have today. Let's say five, 10 basis points.</p>
          <p>Then we have a medium-size, one-third of the portfolio, which is characterized as a normal banking portfolio of this typical industrial segments, which are present in our portfolio, telecom, metals/mining, media and so on. Let's say that is a average, 50 basis points loss. And that means that we have room for significantly higher provisioning into red part, into 19% special attention area to which we allocate the commercial real estate portfolio, even if we have seen very few problems today, but that is an area that maybe coming a bit later in this cycle.</p>
          <p>The Construction area within the shipping portfolio, drybulk and container area and then geographically, the Baltics and Russia. Of course it's difficult to say exactly how the various segments being put through, about this I hope will help anyway understand our thinking when we &#x2013; by evaluating this outlook.</p>
          <p>A few comments to some other areas with high attention, shipping and offshore being one of those. They have 4% of their loan portfolio. It's a very well diversified portfolio. We have applied proven business model for many, many years stemming from our Norwegian operations in Christiania bank in the old days. It's a very well collateralized portfolio. With the underweight in the areas where we have seen the biggest problems i.e. the bulk and container segment, where we have roughly 16% of our shipping portfolio.</p>
          <p>The fact that we have good collateralization made possible to act early on the problem cases prices and we have been seeing some successful restructuring going on during the last few months. Of course the rating migration is high particularly in this portfolio, actually highest of our portfolio as you can see on the lower left picture on page 37. But still the majority of the portfolio is still rated on an acceptable level.</p>
          <p>Private-equity funds is another attention area, 3% total portfolio roughly, very diversified only in Nordic names, it's roughly 100 portfolio companies there. Also senior debt &#x2013; 99% of the lending is related to senior debt. This is a portfolio where we have seen and going to see quite a few restructuring as this is regulated by tight covenants meaning as well the possibility to act early and try to find solutions. We have concluded quite a few restructurings already with acceptable outcomes to the banks with limited write-downs, but this is a work that is going on and certainly it will be high on the agenda throughout this period.</p>
          <p>The new European market, we have very clearly now moved attention there to risk management, growth is not high on the agenda, which you also see that new volumes are actually coming down. We still believe that we have a relatively strong portfolio also evidenced by the table on page 39 where we compare our past due loans to the market as provided from the Central Bank statistics, showing that our past dues are roughly half the market and that gives some comfort that we have maybe a portfolio which is somewhat of higher quality than the market as such.</p>
          <p>But still particularly Baltic provision, as Baltic portfolio gives us a challenge, we &#x2013; so annualized losses in the Q1 of 119 basis points out of which more than half actually were collective provisions increasing the overall provisioning. As you remember, we started collectively providing for this market already in &#x2013; at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>And all in all we today carry total allowances in this market of 160 million or 240 basis points covering 62% of the impaired loans now amounting to 256 million. 75% of these are in the form of collective allowances indicating that we have provisioning over the actual individual credits, where we see problems for the time being but we are preparing for tougher times.</p>
          <p>It's also worth looking at the picture we're indicating that maybe one reason why our portfolio show higher stability is that we have more exposure to sort of stable areas like the Nordic and international names breaking into countries and also to larger companies, which because they represent more stable interest structure and maybe the companies that are more stable and able to write-out the storms that we see there.</p>
          <p>If we look at the real estate portfolio, it's the biggest overall portfolio in our book but if you divide it into commercial and residential real estate, you can see that out of the total 35.5 billion, 44% is related to residential real estate including then state and municipality owned companies, tenant owned associations and social housing, which we consider to be very low risk.</p>
          <p>And although the risk is a big part is related to good companies with high ratings, 74% actually having rating corresponding to the investment grade or better. Also when we look at the country dimension here, we see that we have the biggest parts of the portfolio in Sweden and in Norway. These are typically quoted companies with a stable performance, diversified portfolios and given as well the very low interest rates that we see in the market today. We see that capacity to serve this gap in this portfolio is really good.</p>
          <p>Finally, on page 43, we are following now very closely on a monthly basis the changes in the portfolio in terms of migration i.e. changes in rating. We see slightly more downgrades and upgrades also in Q1 and &#x2013; but there's no dramatic change here and converted into the changing risk weighted assets, this migration that you see on the picture  corresponds to 1.2% growth in risk weighted assets for the period.</p>
          <p>With that I leave the conclusion to Christian again.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Dawes from Fox-Pitt Kelton. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Geoff Dawes from Fox-Pitt Kelton here. I've actually just got one question this time. And we've also seen a further drop in the coverage ratio down below 50%. I just wanted to get an idea of the collateral coverage on the non-performing loans that you've got booked. So if you could just give us an idea for all the past due loans what portion of that book has collateral against it, what the approximate loan to value is? And then also obviously quite early in the cycle for this, but were there have been restructions or recoveries what kind of valuations you're getting on those restructurings? Thank you, very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's a rather detailed question. And in fact I maybe not have all the answers, because this is also very much company-by-company statement that we do. It's true that the coverage ratio when you look at the statistics, it's showing slightly a decreasing level. But then because we do these on the individual assessment basis, it means that we give according to IFRS value to both the collateral as such, but also to the total cash flow that we foresee coming and that is particularly important as the majority of our provision is for performing loans. So that is &#x2013; that's why the loan-to-value is maybe the most important thing. It's equally important, is what kind of future cash flow do we see, because these are not dead bodies, these are working companies. And therefore, it's not really possible to give a sort of absolute value of that, where we have seen very good value are in the places in the shipping market, where we have executed on our collateral and been able to take ownership and sell on what's ships that we've had security with very outcome and while on the other hand set. So we don't &#x2013; we haven't had any cases to talk about into real estate market yet, so we cannot really say about this. We aim at having collateral &#x2013; right value to the collateral.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the more general restructions, I would say there was &#x2013; that the outcome of those have been according to plan i.e. the write-downs that the banks have been forced to take on some of the more public issues even have been in accordance with our expectations when we enter into the rescheduling process.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Per Gr&#xF6;nborg from Danske. Only one question related to Finland where we are now seeing net interest income coming quite severely down and profit before loan losses also coming down to a low at least over a quite a long period. Loan loss charges are coming off, I guess, Finland are the Nordic country there, because they are seeing the most severe recession. What are your thoughts on Finland, what are you able to do on margins or should we see additional pressure on profitability from the Finnish business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if I take the incomes size and Carl-Johan can talk a little about the losses. I think that Finland is the area where we have the biggest deposits base and the pressure in compression of the deposit margins hit Finland as expected. However, of course the solid deposit base is of a great value to the Group and it of course can always be argued what internal rates we put on that. So may be Finland has had a bit more than it should be. At the same time, Finland is a country which we can also see from our materials that had the slowest development in increasing corporate margins, that is very much for documentation and traditional reasons that is a slow process in Finland's increase in corporate margins but it's is ongoing and it will roll on as go by.  So we'll see recovery on that part and of course the deposit margins will very much relate to the development interest rates, which of course is going to stay low for a while. But on the other hand they will go up again when, as soon as the interest rates start changing in. So they actually hit on two sides. And Carl-Johan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the loss side, I think the level recorded in Q1 actually is the Nordea average. But as we say, we had slightly higher increase in the impaired loans in Finland. Again, most of them performing, indicating that some areas relating to the export industry or the construction industry had been now hit by the recession and therefore we have seen the reasons to increase provisions. And the outlook in terms of GDP growth are actually negative such has to be first and maybe most in Finland in the next three years. So obviously, we are following that area closely, but the above quoted portfolio again in Finland like in Sweden is to big companies with good possibilities or stayed even a prolonged recession. But some of the smaller tough contractors and underlying, we'll face some problems.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking into the upcoming second quarter, I assume that the impact of the low interest rates, you will see additional negative impact coming into the net interest income line. How long time will it take before you are able to counter that by raising your lending margins in Finland?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Finland will be lagging a bit here. We will have full quarters taking Q2 on the deposit margins. We also have continuous increases in lending margins. But in Finland these costs went up close in Q2, it's a faster development in the other countries as you have seen.</p>
          <p>So Finland will lag a little in these through the next few quarters and that's the reason why I today at the press meeting said that we have some lines, which are developing differently, with fixed and commission income so they &#x2013; it has actually stabilized and it might easily move up from here due to savings pattern. Fredrik mentioned the deposit margins will come down a bit more in Q2 and then stay there for a while and lending margins are up and net gains losses is of course very much transaction dependent. So these lines are very difficult to estimate quarter-by-quarter, but we can say in the full year we are still quite relaxed and think that our guidance will hold water based on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matti Ahokas from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken. And good afternoon. Actually on the same note as Per basically on the &#x2013; you were talking about the unprecedented decline in GDP in Finland and Sweden mainly. And you've done quite a lot of collective provisions in the Baltics way ahead like you pointed out. Don't you see that there would be a need to increase the collective allowances also in Finland and Sweden in the wake of this very significant GDP decline we're seeing? Or do you see a different provisioning policy in the different regions?</p>
          <p>Then the next question is regarding the margins, as Christian Clausen pointed out in the morning in the press conference that, the deposit margins are coming down but the lending margins are increasing. At what time, do you believe that the lending margins and the deposit margins would be or the average margin would be at the same level as let's say at the end of last year? How big is the time lag before these two meet? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the provisioning, I think it's fair to say that we had a better knowledge about our Finnish portfolio and Swedish portfolio meaning that we can identify the individual cases, which means that we don't &#x2013; actually don't need to sort of take a level increase in collateral &#x2013; or collected provisions. But also in this quarter as you saw we increased our collected provision with 78 million and a fair part of that is as well related to Finland and also Sweden. Even if sort of in relation the Baltic gets the higher part. So we feel we are on top of the &#x2013; on the situation and are able to manage this portfolio primarily through the individual provisions that we have bought to date. You see we have almost 500 million of collective provisions and as a fair part of that is also related to Finland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the margins, as I said is difficult to say but lending margins are ticking up month by month and that will continue. And since the volumes are bigger &#x2013; is somewhat bigger there. And we are talking about the timing issue between maybe Q2 and Q4. I don't know but it's very difficult. We have to put fees and commissions into the equation too because these patterns change quite a bit when interest rates come down to this. We saw that some years back also so we have to put all the lines into the equation and we will not give a forecast just saying that on the year we are still relaxed on our outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But your best guesstimate would be that it is during 2009 anyway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm implying that of course by saying that our outlook still stands on the income and risk adjusted profit, Matt.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, there. I have a few quick questions I think. It's &#x2013; on the page 18 in your quarterly reports under the item other, could you please just help me understand the comment related to net gains and losses there? And that wasn't &#x2013; yes, if you could help me with that. And also on page 26 in your quarterly report on the net gains and losses, customer areas and other had up to more than the 515 for the Group and I just hoping you could clarify the difference. And on slide 14 in your presentation the net interest income, reconciliation, the changed reconciliation. What is the other of 117 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Where's this?.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is in the presentation that you had for the conference call. And then on page 40 of your earnings release you have &#x2013; you say you have 50 billion of liabilities at fair value. And I was just wondering how much of that value change in those pass through the P&amp;L in the quarter. Four questions, I'm afraid, but that should be quick to answer. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think they are, I will give you a brief answer and then I maybe I could do the suggestion that all the details we can clarify on an individual call. But I will try and answer your questions. The other line on the 38 you were referring to is the combinations of two different things. First of all, it is Treasury, the profits in Treasury and the other one is related to Group elimination and other items.</p>
          <p>Now Group elimination has to do with, that we account for transactions on different lines. So typically you can see that on the group eliminations that we have a positive on net interest income and a negative on net gains and losses. So it's redistribution between lines. And we also have some minor corporate issues in there. So the Group functions and eliminations are just the net of those two. And the other questions were --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>On the page --.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let me see.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Yes, on page 18 in the quarterly report, the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Other market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's related to the 246 million gain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay, sorry. You don't have to do &#x2013; you can say we have an allocation model which is working in the sense that the profits generated in markets is allocated to the business areas. And of course that it has to do with &#x2013; a portion of that profit is not allocated. You can say between the customer areas and markets, there are fixed, more or less fixed margins you can say. But in a trading environment, with significant flows as we have seen during this quarter, we also generate results from the flows themselves. And that we don't capture with our allocation model so that stays within the market backbone as we refer to it.</p>
          <p>So you can say, all the profits in the market's operation is generally of course generated through customer operations. But our allocation model simply does not allocate that to the customer area in its entirety and that's why you see that remaining portion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I was more about the &#x2013; wondering about the explanation you say that it's due to good risk management and strong trading results in connection with managing risks inherent in customer transactions. And I just don't understand what that means. Is this a cash revenues that you generate? I was just wondering if you could help me understand what that actually means.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but it's I can --  it's a traditional flow trading operation. We have a huge market operation with more than 1,000 people on the trading floor. And in this quarter we had huge flows on FX and fixed income all the corporate volumes have raised themselves, and managing that risk hitting the trading floor is creating a profit and that profit is in not necessarily fully allocated to customers, the customer because of our allocation model. But the risk has not been increased during the quarter and its cash earnings, which have then just left non-allocated in markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it may be worth adding that the risk is actually been on slightly lower level than in Q4. The total bar is slightly lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And liabilities of fair value, 50 billion, how much did you actually pass through the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the details that we need to get back to you, Haakon. I don't think we have that here right now.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jan Wolter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Jan Wolter, Deutsche Bank. Can you hear me okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first question relates to the NPL formation. I wonder could you give us the NPL formation allowance geographically. I can see in your fact that you do have it on an industry by industry &#x2013; divided into industries but sorry if I missed that the geographical section would be good. And then if you could explain to me, if you have included past, those past due but not impaired in your NPL number. Just going back to the annual report and the data that we are giving there &#x2013; given there, it seems like the past due loans non-impaired, they are not included in the gross NPL number.</p>
          <p>So that was the two first questions, and the third is on trading. If we look at the split, most of the optic in the trading line comes from under customer groups. Would that be mainly financial institutions? And if yes, have you taken a significant amount of new mandate this quarter or is it just a reflection on higher volumes in the market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay on the NPL first, yes you're right, we don't include the impaired, which are where we see no risk whatsoever, they &#x2013; those we don't classify as the NPL, seeing that <mark type="inaudible" /> be late because they might have a state guarantee or a stimulus so no risk on that. Regarding the distribution on geography, no, we don't give that out at least not in the practice that we have for the time being. So we have not got that figure for late.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But like I said there is no great difference between the countries out because if you had begin the actual provisions you can make a regression analysis of that and that is more like the truth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the trading side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's also the same answer to the question as the 246 you are talking about and it's still the non-allocated in general. And this is our existing customers, this is our core customers we do business with, so it's not new customers and the customers into nominal traded and counterpart deposit ratio. So it's still the non-allocated part we are talking about, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just if you could clarify, when you say other customer groups under report, what kind of customers are that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'm looking in the quarterly report and if I --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> customer units or &#x2013; on page 18?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean we can take this off line. I'm on page 26, you say other customer operations. There we can see the net gains, losses on items at fair value is 296. If we look at those numbers on a quarterly basis the most of the up tick this quarter comes from that group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But that is the &#x2013; that is exactly the number we have discussed there. That is the unallocated result from the market's operation, very much related to the ordinary customer business executing customer orders from the corporate customers and from financial institutions. But this is the part of the result which is not entirely allocated to the customer responsible units.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. It's Per L&#xF6;fgren from Morgan Stanley. I have two questions. First of all, I wanted to ask you, I see that the balance sheet is off about 70% about the &#x2013; in the corporate sector from the previous quarter. And my question is just how have you managed to see the structural interest rate risk in the quarter. What is the underlying position for this hedge of the net interest being <mark type="inaudible" /> if any, if you are have any? And when does it rollout? Could you please explain that to me?</p>
          <p>My second question goes back to the reserve ratio again or allowances over impaired loans, this ratio is falling down in the quarter, I just wanted to ask you how much or how far down would the regulator allow you to go? Remind me of that if there's any threshold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can start with the first question. It's &#x2013; generally speaking this is more a consequence of the liquidity buffer that you see. We are maintaining that in the Treasury operation. So that is &#x2013; and you also see liquidity buffer increase, so we have increased holding, typically very liquid papers, typically short-term, so a year or less than that, and that is the main explanation to that increase. We also have part of &#x2013; of the off balance we also of course have the funding derivatives relating to our funding situation. But typically for the assets and liquidity buffer short-term papers during this year.</p>
          <p>There are some hedges but generally speaking we don't have too many hedges on the deposit side other than the liquidity buffers that we have been talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the provision, there were no &#x2013; there are no requirements from the states. I mean they follow of course closely overall everything that we are doing. And we are following IFRS in our accounting standards and we will continue to do so. So I think it's relatively correct that when you are in the middle of a crisis then you are more, I mean, you don't have extra provisions, you have exactly the ones that you need and we are happy to deliver and so on to authorities.</p>
