        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and welcome to the presentation of Scotiabank's Third Quarter Results. I'm Sean McGuckin, Chief Financial Officer. Rick Waugh, our CEO, will lead off with the highlights of the third quarter. Next, I'll go over the third quarter financial results including a review of business line performance. Rob Pitfield, our Chief Risk Officer, will then discuss credit quality and market risk. Rob will be followed by our business line heads, each of whom will provide an outlook for their business for the remainder of 2012. We will then be glad to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I'd like to refer you to Slide number two of our presentation, which contains Scotiabank's caution regarding forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Rick, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Sean. While we're pleased to announce our third quarter with very strong contributions from all our business lines, Scotiabank generated net income of C$2.05 billion. Earnings per share were C$1.69 for the quarter that included the C$0.53 gain from the sale of Scotia Plaza. But excluding this item, earnings per share increased 5% year-over-year and return on equity remained strong at 24.6%.</p>
          <p>Importantly, revenue was strong this quarter, growing by more than 11% excluding the real estate gain. And this performance this quarter demonstrates the diversification we always talk about in our business model, which continues to drive sustainable growth at high profitability levels.</p>
          <p>Now in light of weakening economic forecasts and continued global uncertainty, the Bank increased its collective allowance for credit losses on performing loans. This results in a coverage ratio among the highest of our peers. And this reserve is based on conservative provisioning methodology, which provides for the possibility of unidentified problems in our portfolios. And notwithstanding this general provision, the Bank's credit portfolios continue to perform well both in Canada and internationally and well within our expected ranges and risk appetite even under very stressed scenarios that we perform. And this is truly a reflection of our well recognized risk management throughout the whole Bank.</p>
          <p>Our industry-leading productivity ratio remained stable at 53.9%, again excluding that gain in real estate and expense management remains obviously an ongoing priority. Our capital ratios remain strong by international standards. Our tangible common equity ratio now exceeds 10%, a pre-crisis level, and has been achieved while making more than 20 strategic acquisitions, which have totaled over C$8 billion since the crisis began. This has been accomplished by very disciplined capital management and acquisition metrics as well as a very strong internal capital generation due to our consistently high return on equity.</p>
          <p>We are also currently within the Bank's target of common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III of our range of 7% to 7.5%, and this includes of course the strict regulatory definition of regulatory capital, which under Basel III isn't required until 2019.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to slide five. Our performance this quarter is a result as I've said of this diversification in our business model and strong contributions from each of our businesses. Corporate banking had a record year with very good asset and deposit growth, reinforced by disciplined expense control and lower provisions. Year-to-date revenues are up a solid 4.6% with net income up 16.5%, as a result of very good expense management, lower loan losses, continued focus on deposits, payments and Wealth Management product distribution, and of course, these numbers don't reflect the sale of our building which is recognized in the other category.</p>
          <p>International Banking continued its strong contributions to earnings this quarter as a result of its diversified loan and deposit growth. Year-to-date revenues are up strongly at 22%, net income was up 20% reflecting our investments in the higher growth markets in Latin American and Asia.</p>
          <p>In Global Wealth Management earnings this quarter were driven by strong insurance results and higher assets under management and assets under administration, notwithstanding the challenging financial markets.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date revenues increased 13%, net income up 19%, albeit due in part to one fewer quarter of DundeeWealth contribution in 2011 as well as some non-recurring expenses last year related to the DundeeWealth acquisition. But again, our numbers demonstrate the continued strength in both our Wealth Management and Insurance business.</p>
          <p>And finally, Global Banking and Markets had an excellent quarter across the diversified client-driven platform, particularly in the areas that we've been investing in recently, such as fixed income and the equities business. What was very encouraging was this growth was broadly based across several products, markets and geographies, and importantly in today's volatile markets, well within our conservative risk appetite.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date revenues and net income have both increased 8% and continue to show the strength of the diversification and focus on the relationship-driven products in markets where we're building up special and focused expertise.</p>
          <p>This was indeed a very satisfying quarter, and we anticipate achieving our full year 2012 financial objectives and well positioned for continued growth next year. And of course, I'm very pleased to reward our shareholders with our second dividend increase this year, a further indication of the quality and sustainability of our earnings and our strategy.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn now over to Sean.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rick. Slide seven shows our key financial performance metrics for the quarter. Earnings per share for the quarter, excluding the Scotia Plaza gain, were C$1.16, an increase of 5% from last year and up 1% over the second quarter. Looking at year-over-year changes, Q3 earnings benefited from the contribution from acquisitions, particularly Banco Colpatria, strong trading and insurance revenues, a lower effective tax rate and growth in transaction-based banking fees. Partly offsetting were higher provisions and an increase to the collective allowance on performing loans, lower underwriting and advisory fees and lower net gains on investment securities.</p>
          <p>Provision for credit losses was C$402 million this quarter, including C$100 million increase to the collective allowance on performing loans. Specific provisions were up C$22 million from last year, reflecting higher provisions in International Banking and Global Banking and Markets, partially offset by lower provisions in Canadian Banking.</p>
          <p>Moving to revenues on slide eight, revenues during the quarter were a record at just under C$5.6 billion, representing growth of 28% from last year. Even excluding the real estate gain this quarter, revenue growth was still strong, increasing 11% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase reflects higher net interest income, which increased due to the impact of acquisitions and organic asset growth. The core banking margin increased two basis points year-over-year, mainly from recent acquisitions with higher spread business, partly offset by lower spreads in Canadian Banking and higher volumes of lower yielding deposits with banks.</p>
          <p>Non-interest revenues increased 11% from last year, excluding the real estate gain, due to increased banking fees from credit cards and deposits, stronger capital markets revenue and the gain from the sale of a non-strategic leasing business, partly offset by lower net gains on investment securities. Quarter-over-quarter, net interest income increased 4% from solid asset growth and two additional days in the quarter, partly offset by a modest decline in the core banking margin. Non-interest revenues were flat quarter-over-quarter, as higher trading revenues, the gain on sale of a leasing business and two additional days in the quarter were mostly offset by a decline in Wealth Management and Investment Banking revenues, reduced income from associated corporations and lower net gains on investment securities.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide nine, non-interest expenses were up C$270 million or 11% from last year. Acquisitions accounted for C$138 million or over 50% of this increase. Underlying expense growth year-over-year was mainly due to higher staffing levels as well as an increase in performance-based compensation in line with the stronger operating performance. Compared to the prior quarter, expenses were up 2%, due in part to two additional days in the quarter. Year-to-date, operating leverage was positive 0.4% with each business line delivering positive operating leverage thus far. Expense management remains an ongoing priority and we are on track to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year as we have committed at the beginning of the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital on slide 10, you can see that the Bank continues to maintain a strong, high quality capital position. All key capital ratios increased this quarter due to strong levels of internally generated capital. The Tier 1 ratio rose to 12.6%, while the Bank's tangible common equity or TCE ratio climbed to over 10% at 10.2%.</p>
          <p>Our capital ratios remain strong by international standards. We will continue to prudently manage capital to support organic growth initiatives, selective acquisitions and evolving regulatory changes. Furthermore, as Rick mentioned, as of July 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III is now within our stated objective of 7% to 7.5% two quarters ahead of our Q1 2013 target.</p>
          <p>Turning to business line results, beginning on slide 11; Canadian Banking had a very strong performance again this quarter. Net income was C$521 million, up C$95 million or 22% from a year earlier. This quarter also included a C$32 million after-tax gain from the sale of a non-strategic leasing business.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth was solid with growth in net interest income and net fee and commission revenues up 3% and 4% respectively. Although the margin declined year-over-year by 7 basis points, net interest income was up as a result of strong asset and deposit growth. There is also improved credit performance with loan loss provisions down C$28 million.</p>
          <p>Expense control was also evident this quarter, but expenses only increasing slightly from last year. Quarter-over-quarter assets increased 2% mainly from continued growth in retail mortgages, consumer auto lending and commercial loans.</p>
          <p>Total revenue increased 7% due to strong asset and deposit growth, a gain on sale of the leasing business and two more days in the quarter, partly offset by two basis point decline in the margin. Provision for credit losses declined C$2 million to C$120 million due to lower provisions in retail. Expenses were up 3% compared to last quarter, reflecting the impact of two additional days in the quarter and higher marketing expenses.</p>
          <p>Moving to International Banking on slide 12; net income in the third quarter was C$442 million, up 29% from C$343 million a year ago, a large portion of the increase was due to the acquisition of Banco Colpatria in Colombia. Year-over-year, revenues increased 27% due to strong diversified loan and deposit growth, positive impact of acquisitions, wider margins in Peru and Asia and good underlying growth in fees across Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>Expenses were up 23% or C$176 million with more than two-thirds attributable to acquisitions. The remainder of the increase was mainly due to annual inflationary increases and to support business growth. Quarter-over-quarter, net income was down a modest 1% from a very strong second quarter, mainly from higher provisions for credit losses and higher expenses.</p>
          <p>Provisions for credit losses increased C$23 million from last quarter, primarily from higher retail provisions in Latin America as a result of recent acquisitions, asset growth and softening market conditions. Expenses were up 1% from the previous quarter, due to higher seasonal costs in Peru and Chile. Expense management remains an ongoing priority.</p>
          <p>ON slide 13; Global Wealth Management's net income for the quarter was C$284 million, which included a non-recurring C$12 million deferred tax charge, due to the Ontario tax rate freeze, lowering the contribution from our investment in CI Financial.</p>
          <p>Revenues increased 5% year-over-year driven by strong growth across insurance and most wealth businesses. Assets under management and assets under administration grew 4% and 2% respectively. Of the total revenue, approximately 84% was attributable to wealth management and 16% to the insurance businesses.</p>
          <p>Expenses were flat from the same quarter last year, due mainly to lower brokerage commissions, lower performance-based compensation and discretionary expense management. Quarter-over-quarter, net income declined by 5%, including the aforementioned non-recurring tax charge.</p>
          <p>Revenues declined 2% as lower brokerage and mutual fund revenues from weak financial markets in Canada were only partly offset by higher international wealth revenues. AUM remained unchanged and AUA declined by 1%. Expenses were down 3% reflecting lower volume-related expenses and performance-based compensation as well as good expense control.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 14; Global Banking and Markets recorded very strong net income of C$398 million, one of the best results on record. Year-over-year, revenues increased due to higher capital markets revenues in the fixed income and commodity businesses and solid asset growth, partly offset by lower underwriting and advisory fees.</p>
          <p>Provisions for credit losses remained very low, but were up C$7 million to C$15 million. Expenses were up 14% over last year, reflecting high performance-based compensation and technology costs as well as the impact of the Howard Weil acquisition.</p>
          <p>Quarter-over-quarter, net income increased 3% due to strong fixed income and FX revenues and a recovery of taxes, partly offset by modest increases in provisions for credit losses and expenses. Expenses increased 2% from last quarter, partly due to the full quarter impact of the acquisition of Howard Weil.</p>
          <p>I'll turn now to the Other segment on slide 15, which incorporates the results of group treasury, smaller operating units and certain corporate adjustments. The Other segment reported net gain of C$406 million this quarter. Segment's results included C$614 million after-tax gain on sale of Scotia Plaza and C$100 million increase to the collective allowance on performing loans.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for these two items, the net loss in the Other segment was C$134 million, unchanged from last quarter.</p>
          <p>This concludes my review of our financial results; I'll now turn it over to Rob who will discuss risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sean. The risk in our credit portfolios continues to be well managed. Our specific provisions for credit losses remain in line with expectations increasing by C$22 million year-over-year and C$38 million quarter-over-quarter to C$302 million. There was also an increase in the collective allowance on performing loans of C$100 million in light of the weaker global economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Our net impaired loan formations were C$365 million, an improvement from the prior quarter. Our exposures to certain European countries of concern; Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain are not significant and have declined from last quarter. Our market risk remained low and well controlled. Our average one-day all bank VaR was C$20 million versus C$18.3 million in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>There were five trading day losses in the third quarter compared to the one in the previous quarter. The five days of losses were all below C$3 million, the losses were well within the range predicted by VaR and our ongoing stress testing confirms the appropriateness of our risk appetite.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, you see the trend in provisions over the past five quarters as you can see, provisions have declined in the Canadian Banking portfolios year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, our Canadian retail portfolio remains extremely high quality with 93% of assets secured and relatively low exposure to unsecured loans and credit cards.</p>
          <p>International retail provisions increased C$35 million year-over-year, mainly due to our acquisitions in Uruguay and Colombia, higher retail provisions in Latin America as a result of asset growth and softening market conditions, partially offset by lower retail provisions in Mexico and the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>Quarter-over-quarter, increase reflects higher levels of provisioning in Colombia and Peru. International commercial provisions increased to C$17 million, due primarily to higher provisions in Latin America and Asia, partly offset by lower provisions in the Caribbean and Central America. Overall, commercial provisions remained relatively low.</p>
          <p>Global Banking and Markets had provisions for credit losses of C$15 million this quarter compared to provisions of C$8 million in the same period last year and recoveries of C$1 million in the prior quarter. The increase is a result of higher provisions in the United States related to two accounts.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 shows our Canadian Banking Residential Mortgage portfolio. Portfolio of residential retail mortgages is C$153 billion, of which C$139 billion is related to freehold properties and C$14 billion related to condominiums. As you can see from the slide, approximately 60% of the portfolio is insured, 40% uninsured. The uninsured portion has an average loan-to-value ratio of approximately 57%. We believe that the solid economic fundamentals and the new mortgage regulation changes will enable the Canadian market to remain healthy and balanced. The continued low interest rate environment and reasonable economic performance will allow consumers to manage debt levels well. Credit quality and performance of the portfolio remained strong. Our disciplined and consistent underwriting standards through all of our origination channels have resulted in extremely low loan losses and again have been stressed under many severe assumptions, which confirm our risk appetite.</p>
          <p>To summarize on slide 20, our asset quality remains strong with the retail and commercial portfolios performing as expected and our corporate portfolio is demonstrating continued strength. As we've articulated over the last several quarters, a combination of growth in portfolios and product mix will result in rising provisions, which we expect to be more than offset by increased interest margin. We expect Canadian retail provisions to remain stable. International retail provisions will grow in line with portfolio growth, product mix and a modest softening in economic conditions. We expect corporate and commercial provisions to remain modest.</p>
          <p>And with that, it concludes my remarks and I'll turn it over to Anatol.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rob. Canadian Banking had a record quarter with net income of C$521 million. Excluding a C$32 million gain on the sale of a leasing business, earnings of C$489 million were also a record with all of our businesses performing very well. We experienced solid growth in our key areas of focus: deposits, payments, and wealth management with double-digit account growth in credit cards and checking account and market share gain in deposits and mutual funds. Assets and deposits each have their strongest quarterly growth rate over the last six quarters. We remain disciplined on cost and continue to report positive year-to-date operating leverage.</p>
          <p>In retail, we expect to see continued asset growth albeit at a more moderate pace than in Q2 and Q3 of this year. We see volume growth coming primarily from residential mortgages, unsecured lines of credit and credit cards. In deposits, competition for regulatory qualifying liquidity remains strong. However, our Richness Is and Summer of SCENE campaigns have positioned us well for strong growth in personal core deposits.</p>
          <p>Small business continues to perform well with good operating leverage and strong deposit growth. Going forward, we'll continue to partner with our Global Transaction Banking partners to further growth as important deposit base. In automotive lending, we continue to perform very well as we've expanded our footprint by adding more manufacture and dealer relationships.</p>
          <p>Turning to Commercial Banking, we had a very strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth in assets and deposits. Our pipeline remains strong as we continue to focus on targeted initiatives in key industries and further leverage synergies between our Commercial Banking teams and our specialty teams including Global Transaction Banking and Global Banking and Markets.</p>
          <p>Retail delinquencies continue to improve and we expect PCLs to remain stable going into next year. Commercial PCLs have also stabilized but are at a very low levels and can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Cost containment has been excellent this year, but expenses are likely to increase somewhat in Q4 reflecting seasonal spending patterns. Earlier this year, we committed to positive operating leverage for the year and we fully expect to deliver on this commitment.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn it over to Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Anatol. After particularly strong second quarter, International Banking delivered solid results this quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we had a strong broad-based growth in commercial and retail loans and deposits. Compared to last quarter, growth moderated somewhat and we experienced some margin compression in Chile and Thailand. Apart from these factors, our outlook for the division remains stable for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to our three major regions, in Latin America, we continued to benefit from a well-diversified and growing platform. The region's earnings were up 3% on the quarter with a strong contribution from Mexico. Over the past year, our initiatives in Mexico have been driving a stronger performance and we expect this momentum to continue.</p>
          <p>We continue to be pleased with the solid earnings delivered in Colombia, although PCL levels will rise in line with new portfolio growth. We expect Peru to continue as a strong performer for us and in Chile, lending activity should continue to grow at market levels, with margin pressure continuing in the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect our LatAm region to finish the year with solid results.</p>
          <p>In the Caribbean and Central America, our performance was encouraging this quarter given the continuing headwinds faced by many Caribbean economies. Our retail business in the English Caribbean performed well with good growth in both loan volumes and deposits. In our Spanish Caribbean countries, our retail and commercial businesses performed as we expected. Our outlook calls for flat to modest growth overall in the region with some strong country performances most notably in Panama.</p>
          <p>In Asia, spreads have remained relatively attractive in our commercial portfolio and our lending pipeline remains solid. In Thailand, we had good asset growth, particularly in the auto lending segment, although we continue to manage through the aftereffects of the floods which include margin compression.</p>
          <p>On the Commercial Banking side, our lending pipeline remains solid and is up from last quarter. We expect this segment to continue performing well in Latin America, Mexico and Asia for the balance of the year. In Retail Banking, loan and deposit growth has been very strong year-over-year. In general, we expect current retail growth rates to continue for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Moving to expenses, we limited expense growth to 1% over last quarter and we will continue with our prudent approach to expense management. And finally, with respect to M&amp;A, we are pleased with the Credito Familiar transaction in Mexico. The Consumer and Micro Finance segment holds significant promise for us and we plan to leverage the great success we've had in Peru across other parts of Latin America. In Asia, we continue to make progress on regulatory matters in connection with closing our investment in the Bank of Guangzhou.</p>
          <p>In summary, International Banking had a solid quarter and we expect to finish 2012 in line with the expectations we had set out for the year.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Chris.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brian. Global Wealth Management generated good results in the quarter despite the persistent challenges facing the market. Underlying earnings are up 14% year-over-year with strong organic growth in both the wealth and insurance businesses. Global Transaction Banking, whose earnings are incorporated across the other business lines, also saw deposit base grow well. In our wealth distribution businesses, we continue to see growth. We are particularly pleased with the contribution from our international wealth businesses, coming in part from the acquisition of Colpatria in Colombia as well as some very strong earnings in our international pension businesses.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that our recently announced Colfondos acquisition will further increase our scale in this segment and the region overall. As we move forward, we will continue to pursue M&amp;A opportunities in international markets that fit our strategic direction and complement our International Banking business.</p>
          <p>With the introduction of our newly fully integrated website, we are pleased that Scotia iTRADE ranks number one in online discount brokerage services in Canada, according to Surviscor Online Discount Brokerage scorCard. We're very well-positioned to grow this business as an aspect of our full wealth offering.</p>
          <p>In the Asset Management business, we've got a very strong base of AUM and AUA to drive our top-line. Despite persistently weak markets, we gained market share for the quarter against the industry as a whole, both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. In addition, sales in Canadian mutual funds have maintained their momentum, as we remained second in the industry in total net sales year-to-date according the most recent IFIC data. Our focus on capturing both revenue and cost synergies from the acquisition of DundeeWealth remains a priority. We are nearing completion in our integration and we are extremely pleased with our progress. Overall, we're on track to achieve expected deal synergies sooner than originally expected.</p>
          <p>In terms of insurance, growth in insurance remains strong with international insurance demonstrating marked year-over-year gains, specifically in key markets like Mexico and Peru. Our multi-year strategy of leveraging the Bank's significant distribution networks is progressing well and we continue to experience improved cross-sell of insurance, particularly here in Canada. Global Transaction Banking was recognized by Global Finance magazine as the Best Corporate Internet Bank in North America 2012 for both Best Online Cash Management and Best Trade Finance Services for Global Transaction Banking. Our investment in CI continues to perform well and we're selectively expanding our mandates with them. Finally, expense management and generating positive operating leverage remains a key focus.</p>
          <p>In summary, we continue to monitor the economic and market environment closely, yet despite the ongoing pressure facing the markets, we believe our diversified business model will continue to deliver solid results for the balance of this year.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll pass it over to Mike.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. Global Banking and Markets had an excellent quarter. Consistent with the last quarter, strong results were achieved across our diversified product platform and geographic regions. Our recent investments in key businesses continued to incrementally contribute to our profitability. Our fixed income, equity and foreign exchange businesses all had strong results in the quarter, as did ScotiaMocatta, which did decline modestly after achieving two consecutive record quarters.</p>
          <p>Our lending and investment banking business continued to deliver solid results in the face of moderate market activity. Global Transaction Banking, which is responsible for global cash management products for our clients, continues to provide opportunities for cross-sell, particularly around deposit growth. The pipeline for investment banking and advisory revenues for the remaining of the year is reasonable strong. However, we continue to see some challenges for loan underwriting fees. Our corporate loan portfolio showed strong growth this quarter, particularly in the United States where we expect more moderate growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Loan spreads have remained stable over the past few quarters despite competitive pressures and we do not expect it to change significantly. The credit quality of our loan portfolio remains strong and we expect PCLs to remain modest. Average assets continue to show steady growth in support of our Global Capital Markets platform as we continue to actively manage our risk exposures and to optimize capital usage. Expense management remains a key priority and cost saving and efficiency initiatives will help us maintain our positive operating leverage and our strong productivity ratio.</p>
          <p>In summary, we had a strong quarter. The performance was solid across all of the business units. Our focus for the past few years has been to diversify our business across products and geographies and to strengthen the linkage of our products and services with the core clients and geographies of the Bank. Our objective in doing this is to minimize the volatility of GBM's earnings and therefore improve their quality. We feel quite positive about this quarter because the results suggest that we're seeing continued progress towards this objective. There are still headwinds that continue to make the wholesale business challenging. The market conditions continue to demand discipline and caution which is consistent with our risk appetite.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll hand it back to Sean.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about credit and the addition to the collective allowance this quarter. When I look at through the outlook by Canadian retail, stable; corporate and commercial, modest &#x2013; looks mostly coming from international retail where you mentioned growing in line with portfolio growth, modest softening and some product mix. So maybe can we spend a little bit more time on where the biggest areas of concern are coming from? And whether Colpatria credit is tracking along with expectations as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cheryl, this is Rob. The C$100 million to the collective is not related to the existing portfolio and its performance. It really stems from the fact that back in November we set up a cross-functional team to look at Europe and what might fall out of Europe, and we've done a series of stress tests over a long period of time now in various forms, and concluded that there's a possibility that there could be an impact of contagion and not contagion would have an impact on the various business lines. And given the fact that this is a good year, given the fact that it's a good performance by the Bank, this is one of those periods where we believed it was prudent to take a provision against that possible contagion, and that's all it is.</p>
          <p>As far as Colpatria, Colpatria's performance as far as PCLs is tracking according to our plan. It had a bit of a hiccup this last quarter because of credit cards. That is not expected to continue. It's a temporary situation. There's all sorts of effort against it. And we're pleased with that portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the color there. Maybe if I could ask one for Anatol as well. You mentioned credit card as an area of growth. One of your peers earlier today highlighted some softening in margins coming from the product as customer behavior is sort of changing and more balance is being paid down. Can you just give us some color on your positioning in the segment? Whether you're focusing more on high volume transactors or a customer segment that would be more likely to carry a balance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you see, and you see it also in our non-interest income, when you look at our portfolio and the growth that we've had in the credit card portfolio over the last two years, it has been in customers that use the credit card as a means by which they acquire and pay for their things. It's not so much a financing mechanism. So it's not &#x2013; when you look at the growth that we've had, it's new credit card sales to customers who will use it occasionally for financing, but they transact on it, and that has been part of our payment strategy and something we've been very successful at. So that's what I'm referring to the growth, that's what I'm talking about.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Cheryl, I &#x2013; it's Rick &#x2013; again, I just wanted to just add to Rob's comments, which I obviously totally agree with, but Scotia and those of you that follow us for a long time, we've always been aggressive on provisioning, and later on we take the recoveries. And dealing with the general, while we haven't got specifics, I mean, we all know what's happening in Europe and what have you and the mythology now puts us at the top end of our range, and I really view that as a position of strength for us going forward in almost any scenario. So, take them &#x2013; there is concern, but it's a position &#x2013; take them when you can, it's a position of strength and that's how we view it right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. For Brian Porter, please. So, Brian, business and government loans in International look flat to down sequentially on a Canadian dollar basis at any rate. That's the first time I've seen that in some time, so can you spend just a couple minutes walking us through about the loan growth trend in some of your key markets? And specifically, are you seeing any softening of the pipeline in the commercial side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Good question, Steve. I just remind everybody that in terms of asset growth year-over-year, our commercial book has grown 21% and our retail book has grown by 22%. So those are very good numbers and numbers we're proud of. The numbers were relatively flat on a commercial basis this quarter, and that's a function of two different markets, one being Asia where we saw our trade finance numbers decline by about C$0.5 billion. And that's a function &#x2013; trade finance, as you know, is relatively short-dated. We saw some competition from the Japanese banks at spreads where we didn't want to compete, so that business is amortized off.</p>
          <p>The other market would be Mexico where we're repositioning parts of our commercial portfolio. If you look at the banks down there, our exposure to states and municipalities would be the lowest of our peer group. We continue to deemphasize that business. That, with some pay-downs in Mexico was another C$0.5 billion. So that's C$1 billion of assets in the quarter on an average. If you look at it on a spot basis, we're actually up 2%. And as I said in my comments, our commercial pipeline remains very strong, we see good underlying growth in all our Latin American markets, Mexico included, Asia and &#x2013; so we feel very comfortable about our asset growth profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that noise in Mexico on the pay-downs, could we see that for a few more quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've been amortizing this portfolio down over time, Steve. The bulk of it is done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. While I have you then, a question on Peru. The numbers that you gave on Peru looked very strong in the first half, but dropped off a bit in Q3. Was there something credit related? Is there some noise there? Or maybe some seasonality we're not aware of? It doesn't look like currency to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say two things, is obviously we had a very strong Q2 in the whole division, and we benefited from strong commercial recoveries last quarter in Peru to the amount of C$10 million and in Asia to the amount of C$11 million. We obviously didn't have those recoveries this quarter, but the increase in PCLs, as Rob mentioned in Peru, is C$16 million, and that's a function of the asset growth we've seen in the portfolios across the board for a sustained period of time. We have tightened our underwriting standards on the higher risk part of the portfolio, and we're investing in collections on the back end. But again, if you look at the other banks in the region, you're going to see NPLs across the board increasing. We're performing as you'd expect very well against our peer group. So Peru, we're solid &#x2013; we're comfortable with the credit metrics in our book and we're operating within our risk profile and our risk appetite.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. If I could sneak in one last one probably for Mike Durland, fixed income trading I think it was a record number. Was there anything unusual in the C$183 million of rate and credit trading? Any material mark-to-markets we should be aware of? Or is this really just a function of some of the initiatives in your expanded business, particularly in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the latter. There was nothing, no unusual items whatsoever in that number. It was a good number, probably exceeded our own expectation a little bit. There was a lot of reason to believe the third quarter would have been a very challenging quarter, but the group performed very well. Toronto, London, New York, the new initiatives did very well, DCM business did very well. So it was broadly based across all of your businesses.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just talk a bit more about the International business here, and either Rob or Brian, can you clarify the modest softening of the credit outlook I guess in the International business? Where are you seeing that? And then more broadly, I'm not a China expert or anything, but there's an ongoing debate about the strength of that economy. I'm just wondering if you've started to see any impact on your business in some of the more export-driven countries, like Chile and Peru, especially whether it's affecting credit at all or any loan demand from the businesses? Has there kind of &#x2013; I hate to tie it to one factor, but if China GDP growth drops below 7%, is that something that worries you or anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A good question and a question we quite often get asked. I think if you look at Peru as an example and Peru's economy is driven by investment. There is going to be over C$50 billion of investment over the next five to 10 years in different mining and energy projects. So that is what is fueling along with some domestic consumption in Peru. A real turndown in the Asian economies would have some impact. But you know if you look at economic forecast across the board, including our own for Peru and Colombia next year, you're expecting 5%, 6% plus growth in these countries.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and the balance sheets of the countries, the fundamentals, the economic fundamentals of the countries remain intact and very strong. In terms of PCLs for the region, what I'd emphasize here is that with the acquisition in Colombia and the growth of our business in Peru, we've tweaked our asset mix in international retail somewhat. Our lead product is still mortgages and auto, but we're building out consumer finance and personal loans in these countries and the bottom-line is you get paid for the risk. The returns are very attractive. The margins in our retail book in Colombia, for instance, are through 10% and they'd be higher than that in Peru.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it really is mix, because I was hearing commentary about softening outlook and it's kind of mixing a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; I &#x2013; the question I got &#x2013; I was asked earlier is that there is a little bit of softening in credit profile across the board in these countries. You can see it in our competitors' NPLs and that's just a function of absolute asset growth over time. But from a Scotia perspective, again, we're comfortable with our risk profile. We're comfortable with our risk appetite. We've had good solid growth in these portfolios. We'd expect PCLs to uptick modestly from here, but again within our appetite.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a commentary here on the &#x2013; and maybe like for your disclosure, it might be helpful to put in some of the spot balances or currency-adjusted just to kind of get a better sense for &#x2013; because you referred to 2% quarter-over-quarter growth on the spot balance basis. It's kind of &#x2013; the average can play some games sometimes, right? So, it might give a better interpretation of what's going on in the business there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I just want to come back to the trading revenue question, and I hate to ask the question because there's never a good answer to it. But Mike, you mentioned business growth, but clearly the last three quarters, or certainly what you've done year-to-date is higher on an average basis than what you did in 2011. And is this really what it is, business growth? I mean, are you comfortable that the platform &#x2013; again without getting too bogged down in what the markets are doing, are you comfortable that the platform is kind of delivering what you would expect this year and that it's a reasonable run rate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're very happy with what the platform's delivering and three years ago, four years ago when we made these investments, obviously we're hopeful that the results would be the results that we've been seeing in the last two or three quarters. So we're very, very happy. Obviously, we continue to be pretty cautious as it relates to the current market conditions, which to me, is a good thing. I mean we're trying to run this business well within the low end of our risk appetite which we have. You saw the trading days. We only had five negative days this quarter. Our VaR numbers are very much in line with actually the last three or four year run rate probably in the low end of that and the results are showing the quality that we &#x2013; that was our objective in making the investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing that's been happening is &#x2013; certainly I have been watching it very closely &#x2013; is we're coming from a relatively small base, and of course, we have a great counterparty. So our on-boarding of clients, institutional clients and what have you in the rates business, the fixed income business is very, very good. As we know, some of the international banks are having some real difficulties both in their business models, their ability to take on perhaps more counterparty risk and of course the attractiveness of Scotiabank's counterparty risk relative to that. So we're into actually a very good spot on that and we're getting great client reaction about increasing our business with them, and so the P&amp;Ls are exceeding our expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And thanks for that. And just to follow up, or a point of clarification around the Basel III ratio. When you say that you are in the range, does that mean fully loaded for an IFRS phase-in? Does it include the planned acquisition in China and if you are in the range, is there a reason why you won't just give us the number now? I understood when you weren't in the range, but now if you are, why can't we just have the actual number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a few questions there. We are including IFRS and the eventual acquisition of Guangzhou. We are not giving our number now. The number will move around a bit up and down over the next couple of quarters; but again, we are in the range and we fully expect to be still in the range in Q1 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, another question for you on China. So I mean &#x2013; and Gabriel outlined the case for the potential of a hard landing or maybe a less soft landing. How does that impact how you're looking at Bank of Guangzhou? Is there any &#x2013; how concerned are you about balance sheet risk at Bank of Guangzhou &#x2013; credit losses specifically? And sum that all up with looking at your &#x2013; the acquisition price; anything in light of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Peter, the Bank was &#x2013; went through a transaction two-and-a-half years ago where the balance sheet was cleaned up and all the bad loans were taken off the balance sheet and new equity pumped into the Bank. We have &#x2013; we sent 22 Scotia bankers to Guangzhou in terms of due diligence. We went through all the loan files up and down and did extensive due diligence. On the enterprise, we are comfortable with the risk appetite of the Bank with one exception and one concentration of a loan, their underwriting practices. There weren't a lot of real estate loans to speak of in the Bank. So we were comfortable in terms of asset quality. We've looked at the quarterly statements of the Bank and are comfortable in terms of financial progress of the Bank and asset quality, and we'll do that once again before we close the Bank.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. A question for Brian Porter. Brian, could you just confirm to me the sort of aggregate or cumulative amount of capital that you've invested in acquisitions in your segment in the last four quarters? And I was wondering if there are carry-on costs after those acquisitions were made to get them kind of teed up and things like that and if those are just being run through the expense line in the division currently.</p>

          <p>Brad, I don't have that at my fingertips, so we'll come back to you offline. Away from Colpatria, which was a sizeable acquisition, which was $1 billion U.S., there's a few smaller ones I'd have to add on. So rather than speculate, I'll come back to you with a firm number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that would be helpful. Then one more question; with respect to the return that you're generating, which is just sub 12% right now, could you contrast that with other end market peer returns that you're aware of in sort of general terms in the markets you're in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think that it's important to &#x2013; we're building a business; we're acquiring businesses. And when you do that, you incur goodwill. So that's part of &#x2013; as I say, when you build an international business, you need capital, time, and patience. But if you look at our end market results, for example, in Peru this quarter, our ROE was 18.7%; in Mexico, it was 20%; in the English Caribbean 19%; in Chile it's a little lower, it's in single digits, and that's a function of the goodwill we incurred in Desarrollo. So our end market ROEs in most cases are within the pack of our peer group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brian just as a follow-on from that, your leverage in those markets, what would it be roughly in terms of assets to your capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be what you'd see here in Canada and I would stress that our capital levels &#x2013; as these countries gravitate towards Basel III, we're very well-positioned there. We're running at excess capital levels in most of our jurisdictions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is Sean. The leverage would be a bit lighter than what we have in Canada because it's loaded up for all the capital for the goodwill and the intangibles. So when you back that out it would be more in line with the bank, but when you include that then their leverage versus the equity employed would be a lot less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean 10 times would be a reasonable estimate for the leverage down there including the goodwill and the funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It'd probably be closer to 13% to 15%, thereabouts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>13 to 15 times assets to equity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We'll come back to you with a more accurate number than that, but that's the general range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Sumit Malhotra from Macquarie Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. First for Sean McGuckin on capital. If I heard you correctly, the 7% to 7.5% of which you're in the range right now fully embeds the impact of all acquisitions that have been announced but have not yet closed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And am I correct &#x2013; also correct in stating that the $1.6 billion in equity that you raised in February was essentially taking into account the impact of the same acquisitions that hadn't yet closed? In other words, you're not contemplating the need for further capital to stay within regulatory requirements for transactions that have been announced but not closed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good, nice and clear. Thanks for that. And then over to Brian on international; I think one of the reasons that there is some concern over the slowdown in asset growth this quarter is that I think we've seen Brazil, the largest economy in South America, where I know Scotia isn't overly active, but we've seen that country require some economic stimulus after the slowdown that's taken place.</p>
          <p>Are you seeing the impact of Brazil? I know we've talked about China and some further away regions, but is the impact of Brazil having &#x2013; causing you any concern in terms of what kind of growth you're going to see in the areas that have been stronger for you in international the last couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do I get to give a one-word answer too? Look I'd say that Brazil is a juggernaut as an economy. There's no question about it, but it's dangerous to look at all Latin America through the lens of Brazil, and that's why I made the comment I did about Peru earlier and the investment in these countries.</p>
          <p>Peru is a very unique country, on a different growth trajectory than Brazil. Chile has different fundamentals for a lot of different reasons. But that's why I stated that it's investment that's driving these economies and &#x2013; in the mining and energy sector and we'll continue to do so as the personal growth starts to kick in.</p>
          <p>So, if Peru is &#x2013; or if Brazil is growing at 2%, which it is, or 2.5%, I wouldn't confuse that with the outlook in the other countries where we're operating, where growth rates are pretty close to double, if not higher. So, the impact of Brazil on its neighbors, I don't think is significant in terms of economic development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'd just add one more thing on that business model. In those other countries, ex-Brazil, we really are a PNC Bank, we have branches. And so, while that we do get the foreign direct investment, the average age of these people and the growth rate into the formal economy is quite large. They're starting to buy furniture and appliances and cars and houses and we're branch-banking in those countries.</p>
          <p>Brazil, we're not branch-banking and so there's some different dynamics both &#x2013; in fact both our growth rates and our diversification and consumption in these countries, it's phenomenal when you go down to see it in the Colombia and Peru and the growth of the formal economy and the middle class and we Scotiabank benefit from that, because we're not just investment banking down there, we're banking the real economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly, Brian, I know you are not in the business of building our models for us, but when you think about your business, is international with some of the global headwinds you've talked about and we're seeing every day, is international from an asset growth perspective, as you think about 2013, still a double-digit growth type of profile? Or is it something more in the mid-single digits that you're thinking about going forward as you think about your 2013 plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at our asset growth last year and what we've obtained this year, even ex of the acquisition of Colpatria, I would phrase asset growth next year for low double-digits or high single-digits. So, look the economic trajectory of these countries that we're in remains intact and we're comfortable with the asset growth levels and targets that we've commented about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for your time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Michael Goldberg from Desjardins Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. First of all, I always think of setting reserves as a bit of an art as much as a science. So, simplistically, is there any reason why I can't think of the way this C$100 million strengthening took place as being we've got this big gain on the realization of Scotia Plaza, let's put C$100 million towards the collective and then we've got an additional amount, so we can tell people we're now above the 7% level on a common equity Tier 1 basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Sean. I don't think that's a fair way to look at it, maybe 10 years ago when the rules were different, but no &#x2013; we &#x2013; as you heard from Rob, we had looked at some of the contingent from Europe that could apply and bracing ourselves for potential some softening in the market conditions, but we thought it was great time to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Put it another way, Michael. If you are going to do it, after all the stress testing that you've done when would you do it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess when you have a nice gain there, it's not a bad time to do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly easier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It makes it easier. Okay. Another one, you seem to have more cautious outlook for International Banking. To what extent can we expect further penetration of wealth and insurance in those markets to offset the moderation in International Banking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, it's Chris Hodgson, I think at the &#x2013; some of the results that we actually posted this quarter supports the longer-term opportunities. So, for example, in insurance, if you look at the underlying results, particularly in Peru and Mexico, there has been strong growth in insurance and we actually expect that to continue into the future.</p>
          <p>In addition to that with the recent acquisition of Colpatria and now our purchase of Colfondos, we see an opportunity to expand our pension business. I think that's probably indicative of some of the things we want to do in wealth going forward in partnership with International Banking.</p>
          <p>We would likely have not entertained the acquisition of Colfondos had there not been a strong PNC presence in Colombia through Colpatria and there's actually a very strong relationship between the management of those organizations.</p>
          <p>So, in the region of Latin America, we see some good opportunity. The other thing is for the International Wealth businesses. On the advisory side, there we see some opportunity in again some of these key markets, particularly in Peru, Colombia and Mexico would be the sphere we're going to focus on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly, can you talk again about the possibility of more international businesses becoming available due to distress in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Michael. I can comment about that. It's Brian, is that &#x2013; as you know, and you've heard us comment before. We're always looking at acquisitions. Acquisitions have been a key part of the international strategy to build out our franchise. We continue to look at them and as you'd expect, in current economic conditions there are some businesses available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. We've got time for only two more calls and I ask the callers just to ask one question. Pick the best of all your questions for the sake of time. So next caller, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from John Reucassel from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One question. Mike Durland, the trade numbers are very good, I guess, and you talked about &#x2013; I think Rick talked about counterparty, but how tight are you keeping trading with your origination and credit providing to your clients? Or is this a trading business all unto itself?</p>
          <p>And then when you think about the loan growth, were those &#x2013; did you buy those loans in the marketplace or where do these loans come from? I think in the U.S. and Europe, I think you picked up C$5 billion of loans, if you could...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Steve handle the loan question. But as I've said in the past, we're a bank. We have customers all around the world. We've got relationships that we've nurtured for a long, long time and we've been very &#x2013; my focus over the four years has been to connect our product suite with those customers.</p>
          <p>In some cases, for example, in the fixed income space, we've had deep relationship with central banks. To provide liquidity needs to those central banks throughout the world we have on-boarded a lot of buy-side accounts, they trade cash instruments with us. Those relationships by and large have been on-boarded. That's been a large initiative for us. The majority of it when we talk about on-boarding, it's initiating a different product relationship with an existing relationship and that's been a very focused effort for us the past three or four years again.</p>
          <p>The other point I would make is that, our strategic plan we haven't deviated from at all for the last four years. We've been very focused on the things that we've been communicating; the fixed income, the commodity space, our prime brokerage offering which we've just launched, and we are very happy with the results and hopefully we can continue to sustain them. And I'll let Steve handle the question on loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So, in terms of loan growth we're seeing loan growth in Q3 in all our markets. It's not really much in the way of purchased loans, we saw a lot of that activity around calendar year-end, since then it's been modest. So, we're adding net new clients in all our markets and that's what's driving their loan growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But no &#x2013; no distressed or European banks looking to unload?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very little of that. As I say, the activity was around calendar year-end, it's been modest, muted since then. So, it's a steady stream of relatively immaterial numbers as we go weekly.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. One quick question for Brian Porter, it sort of goes along the lines of other questions, the organic growth year-over-year in retail and organic this quarter &#x2013; sorry retail and commercial loan growth in International this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our retail loan growth was 2% quarter-over-quarter. Commercial was down about 1% on an average basis and that's a function of the decline in loans in Mexico and Asia, I spoke about earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What I was thinking about was organic year-over-year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take out the Colpatria acquisition, our organic commercial loan growth is 14%, our retail loan growth is about 12%.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
