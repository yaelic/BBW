          <p>Good afternoon or good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by.  Welcome to the Emerson First Quarter 2008 Results Conference call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  This conference is being recorded today, February the 5th, 2008.</p>
          <p>Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available in Emerson's most recent annual report on form 10K as filed with the SEC.  In this call Emerson management will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about the company's performance and the reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained within a presentation that is posted in the Investor Relations area of Emerson's web site at www.emerson.com.  I will now turn to conference over to Mr. Chris Tucker.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Joshua.  I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Emerson; Walter Galvin, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Lynne Maxeiner, my replacement as Director of Investor Relations</p>
          <p>I am moving on to my next assignment as the Vice President of Finance for the White-Rodgers division of Emerson Climate Technologies.  Lynne has been with Emerson since 1997 and is coming to the IR role from Emerson's Leroy-Somer, part of the Industrial Automation business segment.  Lynne is going to review the first quarter results.  Lynne?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Chris.  Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter fiscal year 2008 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available in the Investor Relations section of Emerson's corporate website.  A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next three months. I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page 2 of the conference call slide presentation.</p>
          <p>First quarter sales were up 12% to 5.6 billion with increases in four of five business segments.  For the quarter we had underlying sales growth of 7% led by strong international growth.  Operating profit margin improved 60 basis points to 14.8% and earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $0.66, up 20% compared to the prior year quarter.  Operating cash flow in the quarter was 423 million and free cash flow was 296 million, an increase of 29% and 44%, respectively.</p>
          <p>The company's balance sheet remains strong, average days in the cash cycle improved to 66 days from 67 days.  Trade working capital as a percent of sales improved from 19.8% to 19.7% and operating cash flow to total debt remains solid at 64%.</p>
          <p>Next slide: an overview of the income statement.  Sales in the quarter were 5.637 billion, again up 12%.  The underlying sales growth was 7% and currency added 5 points of growth.  Operating profit was 832 million in the quarter or 14.8% of sales.  The 60 basis point improvement was driven primarily by cost reductions and buying leverage.</p>
          <p>Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were 522 million, up 17%.  Diluted average shares in the quarter were 796.5 million, which gets you to an EPS from continuing operations of $0.66, again up 20%.  We had a $43 million impact from the Brooks Instrument divestiture in the quarter which resulted in an additional $0.05 from discontinued operations. This brings the reported EPS to $0.71.</p>
          <p>On the next page you can see the underlying sales by major regions of the world.  First, in the United States, we had growth of 5%.  Total international was up 9% with Asia at 16%, Latin America up 10%, and Middle East/Other up 24%. That gets you to a total underlying sales number of plus 7%, currency adding 5 points, for a consolidated sales growth of plus 12%.</p>
          <p>Slide number 5 provides some additional income statement details.  Gross profit of 2.022 billion, or 35.9% of sales with cost reduction benefits driving the gross profit improvement.  SG&amp;A was 21.1% which brings you to an OP of 832 million, or 14.8% of sales.  Other deductions net were five million as we had 22 million in increased gains driven by the sale of the IMC joint venture.</p>
          <p>Interest in the quarter was 49 million which brings you to a pre-tax of 778 million, or 13.8% of sales.  Taxes in the quarter were 256 million for a tax rate of 32.8%.  The higher first quarter tax rate was driven by the sale of the IMC joint venture.  We still expect the tax rate to be approximately 32% for the year.</p>
          <p>The next page has the cash flow and balance sheet.  Operating cash flow was 423 million, up 29% in the quarter, driven by strong earnings performance.  Capital expenditures of 127 million get you to 296 million in free cash flow, up 44% versus prior year quarter.  Again, the strong cash flow to total debt ratio of 63.6%.  The trade working capital balances are at the bottom of the page, with the trade working capital as a percent to sales at 19.7%, an improvement of 10 basis points versus the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>On page 7 we'll discuss the business segment P&amp;L.  Business segment EBIT was 847 million, or 14.6% of sales.  The improvement was driven by cost reductions and buying leverage.  Price increases were offset by wage and material inflation.  Difference in accounting methods 53 million, up 5 million.  Interest expense was 49 million, down 9 million due to lower interest rates and strong cash generation, which gets you to a pre-tax line of 778 million, up 22%.</p>
          <p>Going through the individual businesses, first Process Management: sales here of 1.436 billion, up 18%.  Underlying sales were up 12%.  Currency added 5 points and acquisitions 1 point.  By geography the US was up 13%, Asia up 20%, Europe up 5%, and the Middle East up 28%.  EBIT dollars were 258 million, or 18% of sales.  Margin improvement was driven by leverage on increased sales and cost reduction benefits offsetting inflationary pressures. The acquisition of the Automation Group closed in December '07.  This acquisition brings high level project management, engineering solutions and systems integration capability.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Industrial Automation: sales in the quarter 1.125 billion, an increase of 13%. Underlying sales growth of 6% with currency adding another 7 points.  By geographic region US was up 5%, Asia up 15%, and Europe up 6%.  EBIT of 171 million or 15.2% of sales, a decline of 150 basis points versus prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>There was a decrease in funds received under the US Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, from 24 million in Q1 '07 to 3 million in Q1 '08 which had a negative 190 basis point impact.  Industrial infrastructure spending continues to be good as demonstrated by the solid sales growth across all businesses in Industrial Automation.</p>
          <p>Next chart: Network Power.  Sales in the quarter of 1.406 billion, up 17%, underlying sales growth of 12%, currency adding 4 points and acquisitions an additional point.  By major region, US was up 14%, Asia up 14%, and Europe up 2%.  EBIT dollars in the quarter, 180 million or 12.8% of sales, with volume leverage and cost reductions driving the margin improvement.  Strong order growth continued during the quarter and end markets remained favorable.  Also, the acquisition of Motorola's Embedded Communications Computing Business closed in the quarter.  More details are on the next slide.</p>
          <p>The transaction closed December 31st, 2007.  The expected financial impacts for '08 include sales of approximately 400 million, estimated dilution to earnings per share of $0.02 to $0.03 due to non-cash charges for amortization of intangibles, in-process R&amp;D and inventory write-off.  15 million of in-process R&amp;D costs were recorded in the first quarter 2008.  This business is a complementary fit with Emerson's embedded computing business and should be accretive to earnings per share in 2009.</p>
          <p>Next slide: Climate Technologies.  Sales in the quarter up 11% to 766 million.  Underlying growth of 7% and currency adding 4 points.  Geographically, the US was up 11%, Asia up 16% and Europe down 16%.  The decrease in Europe is primarily due to lower heat pump sales in Europe versus a high prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>EBIT in the quarter was 102 million or 13.4% of sales.  Volume leverage and cost reductions drove margin improvement, partially offset by negative mix. Price increases in the quarter were offset by material and other inflation. US growth is expected to moderate as we move through 2008 as housing is still soft.</p>
          <p>Next slide: Appliance and Tools.  Sales here were 1.049 billion for the quarter, down 4%, underlying growth down 4%, currency added 2 points and divestitures and acquisitions subtract 2 points. By geography, the US was down 6%, Europe was down 5% and Asia up 20%. EBIT was 136 million or 12.9% of sales. Good margin increase of 70 basis points driven by cost reduction activity and favorable margin impact from divestiture. Price increases were offset by commodity and other inflation. The professional tools business remains strong driven by non-residential demand and strength from Europe.</p>
          <p>Looking at the last chart, summary and outlook, we had a good start to the year with 7% underlying sales increase. Operating profit margin showed a strong improvement of 60 basis points, and good order trends, with 10 to 15% growth in the quarter. We expect full year underlying sales growth of 5 to 7%, reported sales growth of 9 to 11% and operating margin improvement of 40 to 60 basis points. That drives our expectation for full year earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of 2.95 to 3.05, an 11 to 15% growth including $0.02 to $0.03 dilution from the Motorola ECC acquisition. We also expect full year operating cash flow of 3.2 billion, with capital expenditures of approximately 800 million and free cash flow of 2.4 billion.</p>
          <p>We will review 2008 expectations and long-term initiatives at the annual investment community update this week in St Louis on Thursday and Friday, February 7th and 8th. So with that I will turn it over to David Farr.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lynne, and first off all I want to thank all participants for being here today. We're really looking forward to seeing all of you on Thursday and Friday;  this week we have, I believe an exciting program to present to you in our new auditorium and we're looking forward to seeing you, and I think it's an exciting opportunity for you all to see the strategies that we are working on today, and what we see unfolding here in the coming years.</p>
          <p>I also want to thank Chris, Chris Tucker has done an outstanding job, I really enjoyed working with Chris over the last two years. He will enjoy his next assignment, he will still be in St. Louis as the CFO of White-Rodgers, working for Mark Bulanda, who as some of you may know, ran strategic planning for me a couple of years back.  It's a great assignment for Chris, continue to develop him as a leader, which he already has a lot of leadership capability, so I'm looking forward to seeing him grow and develop.  He's done a great job except for this last 35 days, duly noted in his performance rating, that he's walking out from, you know, taking the stock from 58 down to 52 and it might take a couple of years for him to work that off.  But that's where he is right now and I wish him well.  You may see him Thursday, Friday, you may not, depending on what happens here the next couple of days.</p>
          <p>I'm also looking forward to working with Lynne.  It's a fun job to try to train investor relations people.  Walter knows.  He's been around a long time and we're looking forward to it.  Lynne's been with us quite some time, working with Jean-Paul Montupet in many different areas, including working at corporate.  She has a lot of good operating experience and she brings a different perspective to this job and we're all looking forward to another training, and not my last.  And I'm looking forward to that.</p>
          <p>We had a shareholders meeting today.  It was well attended.  We had a record voting at 89%.  That's a very high level:  89% of our shareholders voted today and we had a 97plus percent "yes" vote for all the directors, the four of us, including myself and Charlie and then also the KPMG.  So well attended, good vote and it came out quite nicely.  We also had a Board meeting for last night and today and talking about 2008 and then talking strategically where we're investing right now to take advantage of the global opportunities and potentially the disconnect in this marketplace that's going on right now.  So this company is financially very strong, we're very liquid.  We have been working hard on reposition the company and we are well positioned to take advantage of what unfolds here in the coming years.</p>
          <p>I also want to thank all the operating executives, including the corporate executives here, for the work they did this quarter.  It was a solid, excellent execution, especially in the strong capital businesses, they had a great quarter.  Did extremely well, both in underlying growth, margin and returns and cash. And even in the businesses where clearly we are in a recession, in appliance components and the residential tool businesses, they've executed in down sales to improve the profitability in the quarter and that is not easy to do.</p>
          <p>But we anticipated this last year.  We could see it coming.  It was not a surprise.  Nothing's surprising me right now, what's going on here in the US and from our standpoint, Pat Sly and Jim Lindemann have done a great job in a very challenging situation working with these people.  So I commend them.  It's always easy to grow, but these guys executed in a very tough market, so I appreciate that.</p>
          <p>As you have seen in the numbers, we have had an excellent underlying growth in the first quarter, of 7%.  Our three-month rolling average of orders have continued to be very solid, in the 10 to 15% range.  Underlying orders have continued to be obviously strong on the capital side and weaker in the consumer-related businesses.  But our global positioning, our right market segments truly have benefited this company in the last six months and will benefit this company here for the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
          <p>Our international sales are trending towards the 54% level and our emerging market sales are trending towards the 30 plus percent level for this year.  These are all very important investments that we've made as a corporation and continue to leverage and continue to do extremely well as we go forward here in 2008.</p>
          <p>As you saw from the operating profit margins, we executed on the restructurings and the cost reductions, the new product programs which are coming in at higher margins, the operating guys delivered and clearly you can see that in the margin performance we had in the first quarter. And we'll be talking about -- Thursday, Friday this week about delivering a 16 plus percent OP margin for 2008, getting back to that number that we decided to let go back in 2001 when we went through the major restructuring, repositioned the company.  We've climbed back and we feel very strongly this year that we will reach that 16 plus level and get back to those levels and moving forward for record levels.</p>
          <p>On the new product front, I was very pleased in the last three or four months that the new products are holding in, coming in and really helping us add more value for our customers and, clearly, as our customers get more value, we get more value and that is continuing to deliver the performance that we need as a company, one, to grow faster and deliver higher levels of profitability.  You cannot cost reduce yourself to success as we know. So new products are very important and they are doing well in that area.</p>
          <p>The other key area that we executed well in this quarter is acquisition integration.  We made several acquisitions the last couple of years, they are integrating well, we're getting the synergies both from the sales and the profitability and the cash, which is very good for us to see. And we are embarked upon another very important one, the Motorola Embedded Computing business which will be going through a very significant integration here in the next 12 plus months with Jay Geldmacher leading that. Jay will talk about that later this week in his presentation.</p>
          <p>But the first 30 days has gone well, we reported back to the Board today what's underway.  There's a lot of integration work to be done here but we feel very good and we have the track record to do it and so I feel good about where we stand with the first 30 days.  And I want to thank any of the Motorola Embedded Computing people out there, that are out there listening to this call, for joining us.  This is a great team and I'm looking forward to the value they're going to create for the Emerson shareholders as they work well with Jay's team across Astec and across our embedded computing business and power business and then across Emerson.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to Thursday and Friday, I am looking forward to setting the platform and the foundation of what I see as the economic view of 2008-2009.  My view of what's going on has not changed at all from what I've been talking about in the late fall or in November.  Clearly, we're dealing with an economic environment that in some places is very strong and in some places really weak.  It's changing and what you need to expect from Emerson is, and you will get from Emerson, is that we will execute, we will move rapidly to deliver what we need to deliver, on the restructuring front or the growth front or the new product front, to deliver the underlying growth that we see this year, which as we said, in the 5 to 7% range, and deliver sales in the 9 to 11% range for the consolidated company.</p>
          <p>As we look at our business today, our global position, our global team, how we're executing the first three months of the year, our order pace, the cash flow that we have right now, I feel very comfortable that we'll deliver that sales, the margin of over 6%, the ROTC trending north of 20, leading -- moving towards 21%, and the operating cash flow 3.2 billion range and 55 to 60% of that going back to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchase.  So there'll be more on that on Thursday.</p>
          <p>It's going to be myself talking Thursday afternoon.  I have Charlie Peters talking, Ed Monser, John Berra, Tom Bettcher, Jean-Paul Montupet, Ed Feeney, Jay Geldmacher talking about where we're taking this company to create value for our shareholders both in 2008 and 2010.  And hopefully our shareholders will show up and want to engage with us, but we feel very good about this company right now and we feel very good about where we're sitting on a global basis and look forward to working with everybody in the next Thursday-Friday time period to show why we feel so excited about the company.</p>
          <p>With that, I'm going to open the phone to take questions.  But I do want to remind you we will get into more details on Thursday and Friday, and particularly on economics.  I'm not interested in getting into a lot of details here without the opportunity to really debate it with you.  So I'm willing to talk about what's going on in the quarter and I'm looking forward to seeing you all on Thursday and Friday.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question is from Bob Cornell, Lehman Brothers.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  A couple of questions, Dave.  You said to lay off the macro comments but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See you Thursday, Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to talk about the quarter we just reported.  Did you see any sort of late fall-off in any of your businesses sort of the end of the quarter like, as suggested in the ISM data that came out today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, you know, you mentioned that in the process market you had some market penetration gains, maybe you could expand on that point a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've seen us invest quite significantly both on the systems and the solutions and instrumentation side. You're seeing us doing extremely well in the Middle East right now, a lot of oil and gas investment, and you're seeing us gain significantly right there. The investments we've been making are really paying off. To be honest, on a quarter-to-quarter basis to say here we've gained a significant level of market share is extremely hard to say. I just know the trends, I know what's going on in the industry, I see our sales, Bob, and I see what the industry trends are and so I feel comfortable saying that we've gained in the last couple, six or eight months, and to say specifically what quarter is hard to do.</p>
          <p>But we've seen very strong pace in oil and gas, the power marketplace and we have a very global network and I'm sure John will talk further about the wireless which has been introduced and has been well accepted and taken off. So you can't say, okay, this counts, this counts, this counts, but I'd say overall we're extremely strong at this point in time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Best of luck to Chris in his new position. He did a terrific job. With respect to Industrial Automation, Dave, we saw an acceleration in orders in December. Can you give us a sense of where the strength was, US versus international?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say -- I don't have the specific details of the orders here, I would say there had to be probably primarily international, Nicole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The business in the US did pretty well for the quarter, but I would say the orders are coming more from the international ranks, in particular around the power area. Based on the economics we'll be talking about later this week I would expect that the US business will be okay this year but will continue to be at a lower level than we see internationally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I guess with respect to total European sales I think you said they were up 1% in the quarter. Obviously Climate Tech was depressed by the heat pump. When you think about that sequentially versus the fourth quarter up 5% if you were to add back that anomaly in the first quarter, do you feel good at where Europe is? Is it pretty much in line with your expectations?</p>

          <p>I would &#x2013; I'm disappointed with how far the Climate Tech and the heat pump- related businesses dropped off in Europe.  It's pretty clear to us now, where we were having 25, 30% growth rates last year at this point in time, there was a lot of, I'd say, inventory being built.  There's a lot of market -- product being put in the channel.  And so, obviously, we're going to have to digest that right now.  I think it's going to take two or three quarters for us to do that.  My view right now, as I look at this out there, folks, is that I believe Europe will still be a higher underlying growth rate than the US this year, in my current view.  It will not be as far apart as last year, but I just think that our European businesses are still pretty good, except for the climate technology piece, and I feel we're okay this year in Europe even though we will be a lower growth rate.</p>
          <p>And I would say that one of the things that were going on -- the heat pump is -- last year there was a lot of tax incentives for the heat pumps in the marketplace.  They were pulled, and I think the Europeans are trying to sort out what they're going to do relative to incentivising the environmental -- more environmentally-friendly type of product.  It will come back, but I think it's going to take two or three quarters.  And comfortable -- I feel okay about the quarter in Europe.  I would have hoped it would have been more like 2 or 2.5% to be honest.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great.  And one last one, just you've talked about kind of being opportunistic in this market as we move forward.  Could you give us a sense on M&amp;A, what you're seeing out there, and what your view of the market is?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My view of the marketplace is, last year as we were talking about in EPG, I pretty much said that it was pretty weak for us.  As we've gone forward here now, and we look at the assets available, the assets going to be coming both from the &#x2013; that are gone private and the ones also from corporations looking to sell assets off, our opportunities are increasing. I would expect here for the next 12 or 18 months, you'll see companies like Emerson and other companies in the industrial space will be actively looking for companies.</p>
          <p>Things are not going to be bought cheap here.  You have to buy very carefully, but we have the unique opportunity right now as we've talked to our Board about picking up some selective assets, which have not been available for the last five or six years, and we're going to be going after that, and I would think that you'll see that both at our place and other companies at this point in time.  It's a good time for companies like Emerson.  Financial crises may be bothersome for people in New York or private equity firms, but as I look at them right now those are unique opportunities for good companies to attack and go get some things.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, a couple of questions on network power.  We saw the order trend.  Given the economic backdrop, Dave, how are you thinking about this business in the context of say the computing versus telecom side?  And I guess, part of the context of my question, if you look at the recession of '01, '02, I mean this business really struggled, so maybe you could frame it in the context of sort of what has changed in the mix since then and just how you're feeling about the outlook of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to talk quite a bit about that on Friday, both Ed Feeney and Jay Geldmacher will talk about that, but let me give you my two cents.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the 2000 time period, you'll probably remember we kept telling people that this thing is growing way out of line relative to the underlying growth rate. And what was going on is you saw a lot of the CLECs that were coming in, the private, you know the telecom guys, you saw a lot of these outsourcing data centers being built, you saw a huge bubble being built at that point in time, which then, obviously we got crushed as we came into late '01, into early '02 and '03.</p>
          <p>We have not seen and we'll show you this, we have not seen any emerging of a bubble created this time, not in the financial centers or any other places.  And you, you're seeing a lot of data processing investment going on around the world, it's broad, it's not, it's not focused on one market segment, and you'll see that as we show you the pieces, it's very diverse right now and it's -- and it's fairly steady.  So we look at a market space that we did not see an accelerating bubble being emerging here the last two or three years on the data side or the, or what we call the Liebert side, so we're very comfortable with that right now.  Now I also realize things cycle, but right now the cycle's good.</p>
          <p>On the telecom, we see investments going on at this point in time and we'll talk about that, but again it's not going to be fast, it's going to be fairly steady. I would see more the power, the reliable power investment being stronger growth than the data telecom side at this point in time, but there has been no bubble, we are watching this like a hawk. I mean, I still have scabs and scars on my, on my backside from what happened. Walt and I went through this in '01 and '02 and so we're watching it very closely right now. We do not see it at all, John, at this point in time, but we'll talk some time on that -- we'll spend some time on that on Thursday.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no, looking forward to it. And then just, you know, right now in the business, I think there is, you know there is some storms in China and there's maybe issues -- I know Chinese New Year has come up in the past sometimes for some of these tech companies.  Are either of those events going to be an issue insofar as the quarter we're in today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, I don't worry about quarter to quarter, you know me.  But I'm assuming that, we never do a good job forecasting, most companies forget about Chinese New Year, you know it comes every year.  I would say, you know, I haven't heard of any issues right now, the snowstorms clearly are causing problems in the short-term.  I would say that you will see, depends how fast they recover here in February, late February, early March.  Clearly we're going to be hurt by this because of the delivery and the movement of goods and services, so my gut tells me right now there will be a slight impact, but we won't be able to finalize that until we get out of the quarter.  It's not going to be, it's not going to be huge, but I'll bet you'll hear a lot of companies talking about it.  I haven't had any email coming back, Walter, have you had a lot of emails on this?  No, Walter's shaking his head.  That's how Walter is -- so I think we'll be okay.  But I'm sure there'll be something pops up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, on that last point, Dave, when you said you want to address the disconnect in the marketplace, are you, kind of &#x2013; is that along the lines of your stock versus your view of the fundamentals or is it also just kind of this whole frenzy that everyone is in about recession and just the macro environment in general.  You think everybody's just....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm more talking macro environment in general, Jeff. As you know, I always look for discontinuity, and I look for windows where people are panicking and you take advantage of that situation and go.  We are fundamentally very strong, as John just pointed out, and as you pointed out from a cash flow and a balance sheet standpoint.  And the industrial companies right now are very strong relative to the opportunities we can take -- go after because of our cash position, so I look at this as a way to invest in new products, a way to invest in maybe potential acquisitions, and to push forward right now where people maybe hesitate.</p>
          <p>And so, I -- from my standpoint, are we going to change fundamentally our structure relative to share repurchase? Not big time.  As I said to you, I gave the range of 55 to 60%. Now, would we go higher up to 62 or 63% by operational cash flow, from the standpoint of returning back to the shareholders? The answer is yes.  If I felt that we were not getting the opportunity to invest, we'll take that cash and give it back to the shareholders.  So, I just feel very good right now that we have the opportunity and the wingspan to go out and do something additional in this economic environment where people are getting a little bit nervous and pulling back.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, you called out power a little bit when you were talking about process.  Is there a clear shift beginning to take place in your activity from oil and gas towards power-gen, I'm sure oil and gas leads but is there is a little bit of different complexion and demand starting to take --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have seen a pretty good improvement in power.  We've had a good power.  I would say the power is going to be good for the next couple of years here.  I just came back from the Middle East.  I was there for four days, India four days, very good power demand, Asia, China is right now again back on power shortages.  The infrastructure in Eastern Europe and Western Europe is very weak right now in power.  They need investment.  Everywhere we go we see people investing in power right now because they need to for the next 5, 8 years.  So I would say the environment right now for power is very good, both for upgrade, to be honest, and also new capacity.  There is a lot of work going on right now in getting more out of installed base and that's where we play extremely well in our capabilities.  So I like the power market here for the next two or three years and we have a very good hand in power as you know.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave and Walter, can you just address pricing for a second?  Maybe what it was in the quarter and then in this environment of I guess weaker demand at least on the macro numbers is it your expectation that actually pricing may not offset raw materials this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm glad you could get off your conference call and talk to me, Mike, but right now the quarter is about 1%, 1% price, and as we look at our pricing, price-cost environment right now we are slightly green.  As you and I've talked about, I know the Fed is doing everything possible to keep the economy going from the standpoint and help it recover in late '08 going into '09.  And the consequences of that is going to be a little bit of inflation.  So I would expect us to see inflation and some material cost increases go forward.  As, one, as this economy starts going again and you see some of the material shortages continue to flow through,  I would expect material upward pressure is going to be there but it's not going to be extraordinary, Mike.  And so right now I feel comfortable in the price-cost but we are going to be very careful and watching this because it's, potentially in the second half of the year we may have to go back out and get a little bit more price to cover the cost.</p>

          <p>Quarter, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>11%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  11%.  See, that really helped us from that standpoint and it probably will help us again this quarter here.  On the capital side the pace of business has been pretty consistent in North America and so you look at the capital being the process area, the capital capacity and productivity areas, those businesses have trended pretty well in North America and we see a pretty good steady rate.  I would expect as the year goes forward, and we'll talk about this Thursday in North America, you will see our North America businesses slow down a little bit from the standpoint of where the cycle is and rely very much on our international base at that point in time.</p>
          <p>But right now the North America order pace driven by our capital guys and Climate is pretty solid, and obviously clearly the residential guys are really hurting at this point in time.  So I think the pace of business North America is expected, except for maybe Climate's a little bit better and I would have to say probably a little of that is because of inventory guessing from the standpoint what, where inventory was going to go so I feel pretty good about that.</p>

          <p>Still a hunch.  At this point in time, I believe our &#x2013; I just came back from like I said several big emerging markets and I'll be back over there next month.  I would say that emerging markets will continue to do well.  I would expect China to have a weaker year this year, strong first half, weaker second half. But all and all I still believe &#x2013; I look at Asia Pacific this year -- which will cross the 4 billion mark for us this time, first time -- will be up somewhere between 12 and 15%.</p>
          <p>China will clearly &#x2013; I think will be some uncertainty, it's just a hunch, we will watch it.  We're watching it very closely right now but I think we'll still be okay.  In our emerging market as you know sales we have very strong &#x2013; we do more business outside &#x2013; in Asia Pacific outside China than we do inside China and we also have very big middle East and Latin America and Eastern Europe. So we are really broad-based in this, which makes it a good thing for us in the standpoint of emerging markets.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Orders quality, meaning backing out the currency, looks to be the best in a long time: strong drop-off in the currency impact in the December orders from November.  So just wondering how that grabs you.  Any surprises or color within the segments?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They were. The long time, maybe six months, I would not say long time at six months if you call long time six months, I usually stick a little longer than that but it was good.  I would say the good part about it was our strength in Asia, and particular in Climate, and our strength in Climate and the industrial business is holding up here in the US and economics would say that they should hold up here for a couple more quarters.  So net, net, they've been bouncing pretty tightly here but it was a little bit better.  Not hugely surprising to me, it's good to see, it tells me we have a strong base for the second quarter and we should have pretty good momentum as we go into the second quarter so we'll see what happens here, but nothing real surprising.</p>

          <p>That business could potentially have a very good second half and it could be both Asia and our improvement in North America.  I do not expect Europe to do that.  But that business has become very global in some of the new products coming out.  I would -- the potential of that business would give us the upside that you're talking, your comments about supply. I think we pretty much know the process business where it's solid, and I pretty &#x2013; I have a good dial-in on industrial automation, I have a very good dial-in in the network power business from where it's sitting right now.  And I think the consumer-related business of appliance, components and tools I would not see a strong second half. Walter, any comments on that? Walter?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Scott. You going to be out here Thursday or are you going to be skiing somewhere?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, anyways, looking forward to it. I have a couple clean-up questions.  And forgive me if I spaced out during the non-prepared comments but looks like your receivables were up kind of 17% but your payables were up 12, sales were up 12.  What was the disconnect there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One reason on receivables going up more is you had a greater growth rate in our international businesses than our domestic business.  And that is just organically when we said that our underlying growth rate for the US was 5, the international was 9, total 7:  the international businesses carry higher receivables.  Additionally we picked up 5 points of growth because the currency difference year to year.  And that currency is obviously all international and that also hurt our receivable  position.  And so those would be the drivers.  We don't see any collection or other issues going on.  But it's just the mix of our business as the US slows we would see receivable days, just because of the mix, increasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, makes sense.  And on currency?  Do you guys still have hedges that are on or have they rolled off?  Do you have some of a constant hedging program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have a constant hedging program that we hedge the price-cost relationships, and we also hedge debt with forwards, and we also hedge with options on the translated impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also hedge major commodities, constantly rolling them out 18, 24 months.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>On pricing.  It's been a while and I know someone earlier asked about pricing.  And I know about a year or two ago you guys were putting together a pretty interesting initiative that I think Charlie was working on, working on kind of price maximization software, contract maximization.  I mean, you've seen a nice improvement in your margins, I mean, does this partially, I mean, you've seen some traction there or is that not working?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's working and where you really see it is on your new product effort as we introduce the value.  What we try to do is to create the values, you know talking to Charlie, and Charlie will talk more about this on Friday, the value pricing for a new product, make sure we are getting paid for our technology.  We are creating a lot of value for our customers and it is very important that we get our fair share of that value and that really comes into play is when we bring our new products out, they will come in at a higher profitability, that is a goal of ours.  I don't create technology to just create technology to just throw out the window, we create technology to get paid for it and that is where the big focus is on -- and the company's name is Vendavo that you are talking about.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's let Walt do some work here.  The OIOD, Walt, I mean where is that number going to be for the year, maybe give us some guidance. Other this quarter I think included the in process R&amp;D write-off, can you give us some color around where that is going to go for the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say we do not anticipate any additional gain like we had in the first quarter.  In the first quarter this year we identified that we had the gain on the sale of IMC and we also had some other gains that favorably impacted the OIOD, more income than expense.  As I look at the full year -- also this year restructuring was down from last year and the other thing that went the other way this year was also the dumping duties, the Byrd amendment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was that in OIOD? No, no that's in....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is in OIOD, yes.  We have been putting it there in OIOD because we thought it was temporary, we thought it would go away eventually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Which it did, and we have been disclosing it in OIOD for several years, but yes, it's in OIOD.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, go back to the question, as we try to model out this line over the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As the balance of the year, if I was to do a top level schedule for what I would expect the full year to be I would expect the one-time gains to be slight to about the same as this year to -- for the full year.  But I would expect, with the slowdown in the economy, that the restructuring might be a little higher. I would expect that with the acquisition of Motorola as of December 31st, the amortization of intangible would be higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>OIOD will be slightly higher this year than last year. Is that a fair statement?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it would be slightly higher &#x2013; that could have an impact of a few cents.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How about interest expense for the year assuming no further big deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That &#x2013; I'll turn to the &#x2013; number -- it would be pretty flat assuming no additional acquisitions, no additional divestitures and no &#x2013; the share buyback that we've outlined.</p>
