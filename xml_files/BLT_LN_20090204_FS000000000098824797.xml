          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to today's presentation of the BHP Billiton Interim Results for the period to December 31, 2008. My name is Marius Kloppers, Chief Executive Officer of BHP Billiton. I'm talking to you today here from Sydney. Alex Vanselow, our CFO, will be presenting from London. And to my left, I've got Marcus Randolph, who is the Chief Executive for our Ferrous Materials group.</p>
          <p>Before I begin today, I'd like to point you to the disclaimer and remind you that reading this disclaimer is important in relation to today's presentation.</p>
          <p>I'd like to start off today by giving you a brief overview of our results, before handing over to Alex, and Alex will take us through the more detailed aspects of our financial performance. Then, I'll give you some perspectives on the macro environment and how this is impacting, firstly, the industry, and also how it's impacting on us. And then, Alex and I will be very happy to take some questions.</p>
          <p>We go to our highlights. Let me, as usual, begin with safety. Over the period in question, we've maintained a good safety performance, as measured by what we call our lagging indicators, most notably, our total recordable injury frequency rate. However, we've still had four fatalities in the period. That means four families left without loved ones, and it goes without saying that any fatality is an unacceptable outcome. We continue to be committed towards getting to zero harm and ensuring that a safety culture is embedded across the entire group.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to results. There's no doubt that the last half year has been an interesting period and a challenging period for our industry. The very solid result, of which you will get a very clear view today during this presentation, demonstrates that our core strategy, unchanged over the better part of a decade of being focused on Tier-1 assets and diversification across markets, geographies and so on, is a very sustainable one.</p>
          <p>Our underlying EBITDA was up 25% to US$13.9 billion. Underlying EBIT was up 24% to US$11.9 billion. Attributable profit for the year before exceptional items was US$6.1 billion, up 2%. And as I say that, I should stress that Alex is going to take us through foreign exchange that has had a major non-cash impact on the tax line. And we'll give some clarity on that.</p>
          <p>You'll also recall that in our December quarterly production report, which we released on, I think, the 21st of January, we announced a number of actions. And as a result, our attributable profit post-exceptional items, Alex will talk about in more detail. But perhaps to reinforce at this early stage, we've said that where demand conditions are weak and we've got assets that are either in a position where they can't sell the output or where they are cash negative and set to remain so for some time, we have and we will continue to take action.</p>
          <p>In particular today, I'd like to point you to cash flow because we've already noted that they are quite in a period of high volatility &#x2013; with IFRS, they are &#x2013; there is a lot of non-cash items in our income. And therefore, I'd like to point us particularly today at cash flow.</p>
          <p>Cash flow remains &#x2013; from this diversified portfolio, remains extremely robust, increasing 74% to US$13.1 billion. More significantly than even this excellent result in &#x2013; given today's market conditions &#x2013; our balance sheet continues to place us in an absolutely unique position in this industry, and the strength of our balance sheet is illustrated by a net gearing level of below 10% at this stage.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share was up 3% to US$110.10 per share before exceptionals, and importantly, given our outlook, on which we will talk a little bit more during the course of this presentation, which is uncertain in the short and medium term outlook, we've announced today that we are maintaining our dividend for this period at the same level as the last period, at US$0.41 per share.</p>
          <p>So that's a very &#x2013; a dividend decision consistent with our outlook. But I want to note that this is a very significant, 41% increase on the comparable period last year. Obviously, for those shareholders which form a large portion of our shareholder base in London and in Australia that have seen those currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar in their local domestic currencies, that will be an even higher uplift.</p>
          <p>During the half year, we continued our successful track record on project execution. We, consistent with our commitment to invest throughout the cycle, sanctioned four projects during the half year, a very major one in Western Australia in iron ore and three in oil and gas.</p>
          <p>I want to emphasize that even in these changed conditions our strategy remains unchanged. We want to continue to invest in value-adding growth in a prudent and disciplined manner. Perhaps the only change is that, to an even greater extent than before, we want to focus on Tier-1 assets and brownfield expansions principally in our back yard. In the short-run, we also want to continue to maximize cash generation from our existing assets, and later on in this presentation, I will give you some more detail on our initiatives to do so.</p>
          <p>To emphasize upfront, we are extremely strongly positioned at this point in the cycle, well differentiated from others in our sector, and on that note, perhaps, let me hand over to Alex to take you through the details of our financial results, and then I'll say a few words again at the completion of that. Alex?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank, Marius, and good morning to everyone from a very cold night in London. I will now cover a number of key areas relating to our interim results, and I'll start with the top line financials, which Marius has just briefly touched on, and then move in to some of the exceptional items. I'll also give a brief overview of some of the actions we have taken to further strengthen our financial position.</p>
          <p>For the six months through 31 December 2008, we delivered a solid set of results under very challenging and rapidly changing economic conditions. Both underlying EBITDA and EBIT increased, reflecting our strong performance from our diversified portfolio of low cost, long life, and high quality assets.</p>
          <p>The key highlight undoubtedly is the strength of our balance sheet and our outstanding cash flow, both of which place us in a unique position in our industry. Net operating cash flow was a record of US$13.1 billion, resulting in a net gearing of just 9.5%. This was achieved through the consistent execution of our strategy, which has enabled us to continue to invest in value-creating growth in a prudent and disciplined manner, while at the same time delivering outstanding returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Marius will talk about our views on the market outlook a little later, but it is worth stressing a couple of points about the current market conditions. As the global economy continues to deteriorate, we are experiencing softening demand for all our products. Accordingly, we have taken a number of hard but prudent actions, with a focus on preserving and enhancing long-term shareholder value. These actions have included the board's decision not to proceed with the Rio Tinto offer. Projection adjustments in line with weaker demand, deferrals and withdrawal of low priority projects, and the suspension of cash negative operations, as Marius referred to.</p>
          <p>These have been the appropriate actions, taken at the right time, and in the face of a swift and severe downturn in the market. Of course, we will continue to take further actions, if necessary. We have always said that all our operations are continually under review, and this remains the case.</p>
          <p>The accounting impact of these actions to date are reported under exceptional items, and as a post tax exceptional loss of US$3.5 billion, which resulted in an attributable profit of US$2.6 billion. They include charges in relation to Ravensthorpe, Yabulu, Pinto Valley, project impairments and deferrals, and increased remediation of the provision for the Newcastle steelworks and costs associated with the Rio Tinto offer.</p>
          <p>The extreme range of economic conditions that led to these decisions also materially impacted at an operating level, and was both positive and negative. As we can see on the slide, the changes to underlying EBIT for most CSGs were affected in a material way. Some example is the 500% metallurgical coal, which was positive, and on the other hand, you have stainless steel materials that are 200% negative.</p>
          <p>The result again highlights the strength and quality of the BHP Billiton portfolio, with underlying EBIT margin for the period averaging 46%.</p>
          <p>Our Petroleum CSG delivered $2.7 billion underlying EBIT, an increase of 36%. This was driven by strong volume growth from a series of successful projects, but also stable operating cash cost and a higher realized price. However, EBIT for aluminum, base metals and stainless steel material CSGs -- the LME CSGs -- were all down significantly. In these three CSGs, the unprecedented fall in LME prices alone decreased underlying EBIT by US$4 billion. And for these CSGs, volume and cost efficiencies were impacted by great declines in production interruptions at Escondida, the furnace rebuild at the Kalgoorlie nickel smelter, and the mandatory reduction in power consumption in South African Aluminum Smelters.</p>
          <p>Our steel making commodities contributed US$8.5 billion to underlying EBIT. We benefited from higher realized prices, record iron ore shipments, and a favorable exchange rate. We have, however, been impacted by the weak steel market, especially in the last quarter of 2008, when we announce production adjustment both at Samancor and at Samarco. These weaker conditions will have a more pronounced impact in the second half of this financial year.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBIT of our Energy Coal business was up 287%, and this was due to mainly to higher realized prices.</p>
          <p>Significant price volatility had a material and immediate effect in the revenue line. Input costs have also been volatile, but with a delayed impact on cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>In our last result presentation, I highlighted that costs pressures in our industry had accelerated in the second half of the 2008 financial year. This has continued into the fiscal year 2009. During this half, cash cost increased by US$1.6 billion compared to the corresponding period. About 13% of this increase is structural. The remaining 87% is either costs that were deliberately incurred to maximize production, one-off incidents, or costs that were caused by the heated market early in the half-year.</p>
          <p>Represented in the graph, we have $298 million in one-off costs relating to Queensland coal flood recovery and the Kalgoorlie nickel furnace rebuild. We also can see 592 million of higher costs for fuel, energy, and input material such as coke, leach, and explosives. The benefits of the falling input prices would have a lagged effect on reducing costs, and we are starting to see some signs of easing input material prices.</p>
          <p>In an addition, labor and contracted cost increased by $368 million. Contracted charges increased because of both higher rates and increased activity. In certain cases, we deliberately incurred cost increased production at times of high price. We expect this cost to decrease and to reflect the supply-demand fundamentals as well as lower usage rates.</p>
          <p>High economic volatility also had an extraordinary impact on financials below the EBIT line. The tax charge, excluding exceptional items, was US$5.1 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and royalties, our underlying effective tax rate was 30.6%. The foreign exchange impact was approximately US$1.2 billion, and most of this is a non-cash foreign exchange revaluation on Australian deferred tax balances. Going forward, we expect our underlying effective tax rate, which is excluding royalty and foreign exchange, to be around 31 to 32%.</p>
          <p>Interest expense was in line with December 2007 half, and we achieved a lower average interest rate due to debt reduction and also to lower benchmark rates. Approximately, US$2 billion of debt is due to mature over the next 18 months, most of this being at subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities.</p>
          <p>So we have a situation where we have very low gearing, with debt maturity skewed towards the medium to long term, and higher margins from a diversified portfolio &#x2013; and this places BHP Billiton in a unique position to continue delivering shareholder value.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to show that our net operating cash flow, which is after the payment of interest and tax, was a record US$13.1 billion, which is up 74%. This is an excellent result, given the current market conditions. We achieved this through the disciplined execution of our strategy, which has enabled us to continue investing through the cycle and growing our business organically.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure for the half year was approximately US$6 billion. Our cash payment of $0.41 per share of dividend declared in August 2008 was about US$2.3 billion.</p>
          <p>As Marius mentioned earlier, we have maintained a dividend of US$0.41 per share, which is an outstanding achievement in the current economic environment. This is in line with our progressive dividend policy that seeks to maintain or increase the dividend, in U.S. dollar terms, which we regularly assess based on our expectations of future market outlook and investment opportunities. We are very well positioned but also alert to the fast changing and uncertain economic environment.</p>
          <p>I just wanted to take a little bit of time now to try to give you some more clarity about the issues that will impact underlying business performance over the next six months. This slide provides a summary of the production adjustments we have announced so far in response to this impressive downward deterioration in our markets. The indefinite suspension of the Ravensthorpe nickel operation and the cessation of mixed nickel cobalt hydroxide processing at the Yabulu refinery, the temporary suspension of two of the iron ore pellets plants at Samarco, the temporary reduction in Samarco Manganese production, the suspension of copper sulphide from the Pinto Valley mine, and reductions in metallurgical coal producing during the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>As we have flagged as well, we expect one-off costs of approximately US$500 million in the second half that are linked to the implementation of these decisions. As we have said, we will continue to take quick and decisive action as market conditions changes.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now hand you over to Marius, who will go through our views on the market outlook.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alex. Perhaps to highlight a few points. Six months ago, we started off this section of our presentation with a title &#x2013; a slide titled Short-Term Global Challenges exists. On thats slide, we noted that global economic activity was moderating, financial market instability and inflationary pressures were apparent, and we started, importantly, to see flow on effects of these to emerging economies. Like most observers, however, we did not foresee the speed of deterioration that we've now witnessed. It's unlike anything I have seen before, and it's unlike I think what most people have seen.</p>
          <p>To illustrate, this slide shows commodity prices over the six-month period between July and December. In just six months, across most of the main commodities that we produce, prices have gone down between 50 and 60%, and some of these commodities have suffered further declines of &#x2013; on the order of 10% or so since the beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>Today, weakness, uncertainty, and volatility in the outlook exist not only in the short-term but also in the medium-term. Demand for our products is being impacted globally. Because of this, we have noted the adjustments we've made in production, maintenance schedules and projects, and we will continue to review our projects, operations, and capital investments in the context of this fluid demand environment. Our view from six months has not changed in one regard, and that is that momentum and risk in our view is probably to the down side.</p>
          <p>Now, just as the world has been too optimistic about the extent of the deterioration that we would see, it's also been too optimistic about the medium-term impact and timing of the recovery. Growth forecasts continue to be revised downwards, and the turning point for any eventual recovery continues to be pushed out.</p>
          <p>Now just to illustrate, we put on this slide &#x2013; a consulting company called Global Insights -- and their predictions &#x2013; last five predictions for year-on-year growth -- forward global growth. As you can see, there has been a marked change or deterioration in their forecasts, particularly in the last two forecasts, and this picture would have been, in structure, no different, had I used the forecast from any other forecasting consultancy. Our sense, in talking to many market participants, is that, on a global basis, which constitutes the markets that we operate in, very few are prepared to give a view of when that turning point will occur.</p>
          <p>But let's talk about what it will take to improve, particularly with respect to our industry. We've spoken about China for a long time. Most in our industry have spoken about China for a long time. And most of us are aware that in terms of raw demand growth, China has outpaced any other country or region. For that reason, China will continue to be very, very important in our industry.</p>
          <p>But we cannot let ourselves forget that we operate in global markets. And demand or consumption outside China, as we show on this slide, still constitute the largest component of absolute consumption. This chart shows us that between 65 and 70% of most of the commodities that we produce are consumed in the global market, outside China, with an emphasis on OECD consumption.</p>
          <p>With only 30 to 35% of absolute commodity demand, China alone cannot be relied on to support overall global commodity demand. For global commodity markets to perform well, a synchronized improvement in both the OECD and China will be required.</p>
          <p>But let's take a look at China. On the short-term, destocking in China seems to be nearing completion, and we are starting to gain visibility of the underlying level of demand for the first time in many months. While growth clearly slowed in China over the last few months of 2008, China has not experienced some of the dimensions of collapse that other, more export-oriented economies in the region suffered.</p>
          <p>China has also largely avoided the credit and confidence collapse as seen in the West. China has got a government that has got the ability to boost infrastructural spending, and with the lack of household and corporate debt, and government debt, we would therefore expect China to be relatively more resilient than the West. But of course, standing in against these positives, China's economy has been impacted by the reduction of export demand.</p>
          <p>Over the longer term, and we continue to review this, our story for China is unchanged. It remains at a relatively early stage of its development. Its absolute intensity of use of many of the products that we produce remains low. And therefore, long term, our view is not really different to what we've said before.</p>
          <p>But let's take a look at how our industry has been impacted, as we take a look at all of these things that have impacted on our industry. This is a reasonably complex chart, so let me a take moment to explain what it means. Under Y-axis, the Y-axis represents return on capital, improving as you move up the scale. So it's an indicator of absolute asset strength higher up on the scale.</p>
          <p>The X-axis represents balance sheet strength, improving as you move from left to right. Each of the individual bubbles on the chart represents a company in the sector. And the size of the bubble is scaled to the enterprise value of the company. Just for reference, the bubble in the legend on the top right hand corner -- that shows that red bubble &#x2013; is scaled to about $10 billion.</p>
          <p>So what can we conclude from this? BHP Billiton is extremely well positioned, with both a quality set of assets and a quality balance sheet. The majority of other companies in our sector are going into this downturn in a condition of financial distress or weakness. The asset quality is also variable. Balance sheets are highly leveraged, and significant amounts of cash will be needed just to service ongoing debt commitments. Therefore, many of the companies in our sector have, unlike us, no option but to switch their focus from long-term value growth to short &#x2013; to managing in the short-term.</p>
          <p>And this change in focus will have an impact on future supply and fundamentals. In today's environment, for those companies preserving cash is crucial, as we've noted, and the industry, as a result of the stretched balance sheets, has promptly acted to minimize cash outflows. Production cuts have been made swiftly and severely across a spectrum of commodities in response to the downturn in demand. Particularly, with the view towards the long run, investment in new capacity is being deffered, with dramatic capital expenditure cuts announced globally and continuing to be announced.</p>
          <p>These production cuts, investment delays and cancellations of projects across the commodity spectrum will mean that the future capability of the supply side has been severely impacted. Those of us in the industry, like us, who can continue to invest throughout the cycle in readiness for eventual market recovery, and do not have to trade long-term optionality for short term expediency, will be perfectly positioned to grow market share and shareholder value when this business cycle upturn comes.</p>
          <p>So our long standing strategy has uniquely positioned us for the events that we are witnessing. While, on average, the industry has been facing funding pressures and deteriorating credit ratings, our strongly diversified cash flow and strong asset quality has allowed us to improve our gearing position.</p>
          <p>I particularly want to draw your attention to the 74% increase in net operating cash flow, the fact that our balance sheet has never been stronger, the fact that during the half, we reduced our gearing from 18% to below 10%, and that our interest cover stands at 87 times. In this market, there will be numerous opportunities to purchase assets more cheaply than in the past. Of course, very few of these assets will fit our unchanged strategy of a focus on Tier 1 assets. But if and when these opportunities arise, we have the capacity to act.</p>
          <p>But these opportunities are not mutually exclusive to growth in an organic way. We will continue to invest in value-adding growth throughout the cycle.</p>
          <p>And in addition to that long standing strategy of investing in our own business, keeping the balance sheet intact, and retaining surplus cash to our shareholders, the strength of our diversified cash flows has underpinned our ability to maintain our progressive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>However, being in this strong position does not mean immunity from the strong winds that are blowing. We continue to systemically and methodically review all aspects of our business. And in this regard, you have seen a number of production and project announcements, most recently on the 21 of January, in our production report, where we announced a number of sensible, prudent, and responsible measures.</p>
          <p>We will continue to tailor the production of our product, if we are unable to sell the products, or if any of our operations are cash negative and set to remain so. We've also, as I said before, refocused our capital spend, which has always had a high bias towards brownfield expansions in our backyard, to in an even more increased manner, reflect the focus on Tier-1 assets, brownfield expansions in the backyard. But I also want to emphasize here today that our business strategy is always to live within our means, and not only on the production side, but also on the capital side, we will continue to review and make adjustments necessary, consistent with the environment in which we operate.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we had a robust first half. Our production to date has been strong. The market outlook has been deteriorating, and together with the production adjustments that we've made already, will impact results over the balance of the year. We don't expect any relief in the short and medium term from uncertainty and volatility. The timing of any recovery is unclear. But while the global outlook is uncertain, I again want to emphasize the quality of our assets, the strength of our balance sheet, and the cash flow that is generated from this diversified portfolio, uniquely positioning us for when this business cycle turns. We will continue to, as we've done, act proactively and with a high degree of decisiveness, to preserve and grow shareholder value, ensuring that long-term value is not compromised.</p>
          <p>On that note, I would like to finish and take questions. Last year I embarrassed myself by addressing questions to London in the middle of the night. So today we will start here in Sydney. We will rotate to the phone. If you could address the questions to me in the first instance, please state you name, and I will pass them around to Alex as required.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Just a question really on the aluminum and nickel parts of your business and the strategy going forward. It seems that you're still investing in the alumina assets, though the aluminum business is obviously under a lot of stress. Your average price in the last half was $1.04 and is down to $0.60 odd now. I just wonder where you're going with that business in terms of &#x2013; are there any decision points coming up where you stop your expansions in alumina? And also in nickel with the removal of Ravensthorpe, just what is the strategy going forward for the Australian assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On those two businesses, nothing really new to talk about today. I think at this point we've taken the decisions that we thought we would take. Obviously, we're going to continue to review -- and we note that in aluminum that the price is continuing to decline, and in alumina, I think spot prices are in the order of $190 per ton. So we will continue to review. No immediate actions, nothing to do today. With respect to the nickel business &#x2013; and sorry, and we don't have any immediate decision points, Neil, coming up in our alumina portfolio. I should note that the Brazilian project is getting very close to completion in line with the dates that we've said before. On the nickel side, no &#x2013; equally, unfortunately &#x2013; nothing to add. With Ravensthorpe, indefinite suspension means exactly that. We do not see reopening that plant at this point in time. We don't have any material decision points coming up in the Nickel West business, which is the other business. Nor do we have anything to add on the Yabulu Refinery in today's terms.</p>
          <p>With respect to both of those products, we certainly notice some speculation about our commitment to various commodity products, and I'll take a lead from one of my predecessors in saying that the decision to exit an asset or make an asset decision is a relatively easy one. For businesses, it's a much more protracted and difficult decision. And we are committed to all of the products that we've got in our portfolio, including these two, including petroleum and all of the other products that we've got in our portfolio. We've no plans to exit any of those products at this point.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig Campbell, Morgan Stanley. Marius, just looking at the capital spend, it looks like it just ramped back a little bit from where it used to be. But with petroleum, in particular, you had spoken previously about spending up to maybe $1 billon on explorations. Just wondering if you can give some guidance on explorations spend for petroleum over the next year or two?</p>
          <p>Also in the results, Olympic Dam, recording some losses there &#x2013; just wondering if you can give us an update on how Olympic Dam is travailing, and where the studies are up to, and how you think that will progress?</p>
          <p>And then finally, just with the capital spend, commodity prices where they are, if I read the release correctly, I think you have about 3 billion of undrawn debt facilities at the minute? If you need to go beyond that, would you be willing to increase debt to keep your capital spend going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig, perhaps on the third one, I can comment first. Perhaps I'll also on the others, but Alex might have a contribution to make as well. We &#x2013; I made the comment of living within our means, very deliberately. And I made the comment about adjusting capital spend in line with the economic conditions, very deliberately as well.</p>
          <p>We would broadly &#x2013; and I'm not giving an absolute guidance here, but broadly we believe the cash that you generate from your ongoing business is the cash that you have available to spend on organic growth. And that's really what you've seen &#x2013; Alex, myself, other members of the team do. That's on the third point.</p>
          <p>On the first point, I don't think we've broken out the petroleum spend separately. We've given an update of what we expect to spend on brownfield, greenfield and petroleum spend in aggregate, and I think Alex, but you'll have to correct me here, that number is probably about $200 million lower than the guidance that we've given before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The guidance we gave before was around US700 million. We are looking between 600 and US700 million now. So it's about US100 million different.</p>

          <p>For petroleum and it will have some impact on the over &#x2013; one, as well. On ODX, nothing to add from the 21st of January. We've largely completed the initial phase of our study. We're into the filing of the EIS now. The timing of approvals is, certainly is, reasonably uncertain. And consistent with that, we are throttling back the burn rate on the project to reflect the completion of the phase of study and the waiting period on the EIS.</p>
          <p>Obviously, any eventual decision to invest or not invest will have to be taken on the balance of &#x2013; can we set up the project as we wanted? Is &#x2013; are customers available? What is the state of the world demand for the product, capital, and so on and so on? Again, to emphasize what we've said over the last year or year and a half, is that in our five year volume forecast that we've shown previously, we have not included anything from Olympic Dam.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Cheers. Firstly, just a question around &#x2013; clarification on the tax rate. Was that &#x2013; 31 to 32% &#x2013; I missed it, sorry &#x2013; was that inclusive or exclusive of the royalty impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's exclusive of royalties and exclusive of this deferred tax asset translation which comes as a non-cash adjustment, which can go up and down, obviously. And just to reflect on that a little bit more, Paul, and Alex might want to add. We've got US dollar functional currencies for all of our &#x2013; most of our asset base, which effectively means that what goes into most other companies' balance sheets, up and down, comes through our P&amp;L as a non-cash item. Alex, I don' know if you want to add anything to those comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are correct, Marius. The only thing I would add is that a large base &#x2013; a large part of our asset base is Australian dollar currency. And what you have is future depreciation, which is a tax asset impacted by the foreign exchange. So as the Australian dollar comes down, that asset diminishes in U.S. dollar value. As the Australian dollar increases, that asset increases in U.S. dollar value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So it's basically like a mark-to-market. So three &#x2013; summary three comments &#x2013; 31 to 32%, royalty is obviously price dependent. And then, that non-cash impact will go up and down, principally as the Australian dollar changes relative to the U.S. dollar, sort of on a mark-to-market basis, almost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And the next, more difficult question was, if you can you give us an update on what's going on at Atlantis? You're doing some more injection. I just want to get a sense of, do we take this as potentially fuel degradation, inability to kind of get the production out and ultimately inability to get the reserves out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't think it means any of those of things. But in order to give you a complete, sort of, technical picture of what we are doing there, why don't I ask Mike, who's on the teleconference, not visible here. But I think you should be able to here comments from him. Mike, are you there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marius, yes. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We can hear you fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are in the process of commencing the drilling of the water injectors in Atlantis. We will have the first well, hopefully, spudded in here in the next three or four months, have all the funding in place, have the rigs in place. And as you know, we've already pre-injected &#x2013; pre-invested, excuse me &#x2013; all of the facilities on-board the Atlantis vessel.</p>
          <p>So this was always contemplated as being an option, and we're in the process of executing it.  Our oil in place and all the other physical parameters that we measure are all exactly as we've hoped for. And we're very confident that this water injection will give us the reservoir drive it takes to recover the reserves that we have funded. But we're well in progress and off to the races on this piece.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you &#x2013; perhaps, just to complete picture, there is very positive. Obviously, there is some impact on the capital investment that you've got to make in the &#x2013; drilling the wells upfront. And then there's obviously some operational cost impact. But as I said on the media conference earlier, we are extremely pleased with our petroleum business, where that guidance of &#x2013; on a cash and non-cash basis, cumulatively, post-commissioning all of these new projects, we see costs below $20 a barrel. I mean, we remain extremely pleased with that business and the growth potential that lies ahead of us.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Marius. It's Brendan Harris from Macquarie. Interested in, obviously, outlook for the steel industry. And obviously, the difference in your approach between iron ore and met coal. Very different markets &#x2013; he iron ore market gives you the ability to send excess product, or almost deferrals, if you like, that you can move into that spot market. And interested in your approach in terms of how you'll address that.</p>
          <p>But more so, when you look at coking coal, you don't have that secondary option. And Japan's the number one player, if you like, for you, as a customer. I'm interested in how you see that developing? How you see the 10 to 15% production cut that you've announced in the context of cuts to steel production in Japan of sort of 30 plus percent? What options do you have? How worried should we be about your sales volumes for the second half versus that production guidance? Just any clarity you can offer? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Brendan, obviously, the business of forecasting is frought with dangers for us. But I think, just a few words on how we view these two markets differently.</p>
          <p>The iron ore market, as we've said, with this massive growth in Chinese domestic production, we've seen a cost curve, with people having different costs on that curve. It's also a market, therefore, where the market clears far more rapidly. As the third player in the industry, our explicit strategy is to sell every ton that we can produce. Because simply put, if we don't, an Indian high cost producer or a domestic Chinese producer will produce it, which doesn't create long-term value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>So we want to sell what we produce. And consistent with that, if you look at what we've said today, our sales volumes in the second half will, for iron ore, we hope, be equal to the first half. You've also seen that when everybody was talking about market clearing, sorry &#x2013; whether we would sell all of our products in the last quarter, we actually placed product.</p>
          <p>Now, with the way I see that market developing is that strong distinction between the benchmark price and the &#x2013; let's call it the market clearing price will blur. You'll have different contract structures, and you'll have blends of contracts and so on, which means that those prices will approach each other as we go forward. And we look forward towards a market that clears more on its fundamentals as we go forward, principally based on the fact that there's some swing capacity in the system, or that there is volume response in relation to the price.</p>
          <p>On the seaborne metallurgical coal market, it's a little different in that &#x2013; a different mix of customers. Therefore, any reduction in North Asia, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, in India, in Brazil and in Europe flows basically directly through absolute size of the coking coal market.</p>
          <p>And there is not the same differentiation of operating cost curves. Therefore, the volume response is different. And as the market leader, we have very little choice but to not produce product that people physically cannot put in their stockyards. I don't see that market structure changing over the next couple of years, Brendan.</p>
          <p>So, perhaps I can, just out of courtesy, take one or two three calls just from the phones. And then, I'll come back here to Sydney. If I may have the first call from the phones, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The first question is from David George from J.P. Morgan. Go ahead, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. The first thing is, with respect to your comments on Tier 1 assets, <mark type="inaudible" /> has always been considered one, but lately we've been seeing fairly poor operating performance, and we're going through a declining growth period. Is there still an operating guideline number at BHP, and if you could get your hands on more, would you be interested in buying it, and when will the operations pick up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the &#x2013; do we consider this is as a Tier 1 asset? Absolutely. I think Alex tipped his hand fairly decisively when he said a couple of weeks ago that we wouldn't mind owning more of it. I have nothing to add to those comments which were very well commented on at the time.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look at the operational performance of Escondida. We've got a SAG mill there that has had some issues. There's a number of these identical SAG mills in the world. All of them have got the same issues. And we are limping along until we can effect a complete repair. We haven't fixed the date of that repair, completely. But it'll be probably sometime in our next financial year, when we will repair that completely. And then, that asset which is &#x2013; that's probably had a &#x2013; I don't know, about a 15% or so production impact, that will revert to normal.</p>
          <p>I also have no update on the lower grade material, which Alex &#x2013; and you have to correct me here, we said it's about a two year period of mining lower grade. So in two years' time, we should have the grade back, and we should have the SAG mill repaired. And we should essentially resume the trajectory that we've had before.</p>
          <p>Alex, anything to add, there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The growth comes back from the lows of this year, next year, but not fully to where it was in 2008. So it's just a partial recovery, and then flat, from then on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But definitely it's a Tier-1 asset, and one where we've got new exploration discoveries, and we're going to continue to invest money there. Thanks, David.</p>

          <p>Hi, Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Marius. Could you ask Alex to just reconcile the EBITDA trend versus the underlying cash flow trend of the company over the last three half-year periods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is properly left to the CFO, I think. Alex, did you hear that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat it? I could barely hear it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you reconcile the trend on EBITDA, which is a cash flow proxy...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...to the actual cash flow. And let me just make one comment on that, as Alex goes in. Obviously, your cash flow is impacted by the size of your receivables, which &#x2013; and by the size of your investments, or work in process.</p>
          <p>So the &#x2013; when prices go up, as they've done, you dramatically expand the size of your balance sheet. Because even though your debtor's book remains at the same days, you're sucking in cash. And when prices moderate, that cash is released again, which we've seen here.</p>
          <p>Lease of those two effects, Alex, I don't know if you &#x2013; if there's anything else to comment on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's basically it, Marius. The key differential there between the EBITDA trend and the cash generation trend is the working capital. And one of the key features in this half-year was the accumulated balance from last year's iron ore price change. There was actually cash received this year. And that was to the tune of $1.8 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alex. And just as guidance, our days of receivables remain at about the same level as everybody in the industry. We kept very close eye on overdues and so on, and certainly the effort there required is bigger now than it was before. But we see very little change in the days. So that just scales with price, basically.</p>
          <p>May I have the question on the telephone? And then, I'll go back to Sydney after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So &#x2013; if I may take the next question from the audience here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi. It's Glen Wilcott at UBS. Just, couple of quick questions. Firstly, I think, if I remember correctly, Alex said 1.6 billion in costs increase in the half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's 13% structural?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wondering, given what we're seeing in the market, as a lot of other people have &#x2013; really ripping the cost out of their business. I mean, just wondering, looking at that &#x2013; of that 1.6, do you think you can rip a fair bit of it out, of the 80-odd percent that's not structural? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And then the second one is, just going back to the bulk markets. And at clearly, great prices last year, a complete reversal of where everyone had thought. Just wondering how &#x2013; I know you can't comment on the pricing outcomes, but I'm just wondering if you can give some sort of color on how things are progressing, given it is a very, very unique market right now? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Glen, I actually feel optimistic that what I would call &#x2013; that what we've called the non-structural costs, we're going to get out. The raw material trends within our input costs &#x2013; within the fact that we basically try and follow markets and don't try and cut through them, that will tend to divert. And that's &#x2013; I don't have the exact figures in my head like Alex, but let's call it $600 million out of the total &#x2013; caustic, pitch, coke and so on and so what.</p>
          <p>Then, the next piece that I would say is clearly one-off are the nickel furnace rebuild and the flood events in met coal. And then, the third piece that I &#x2013; that is clearly, directly production choice-related are where we put in contractors to open up the pits in met coal, in order to recover from the floods, but also to position for increased product. Because we don't run deferred stripping accounts, that all comes through the P&amp;L. And a lot of that is differential contractors that have got to be put in.</p>
          <p>Same in manganese. We trucked manganese in order to get it to market, when we could realize 80% or 90% margins in that product. Clearly, that has been wound down. So all of those structural things we think are going to come out. Less easy is wage moderation, some of the other costs, but the last bit that I would perhaps comment on is maintenance, sustaining CapEx and smaller projects. And you can rest assured that Alex and I and the Group chief executives have got a very jaundiced eye on that category of spend at the moment. And some of that is reflected in the overall capital spend that Alex &#x2013; because some of it goes into capital -- is already reflected in the capital spend that we've shown today.</p>
          <p>[pause] My apologies. On the bulks, I think there is a difference between iron ore and met coal, in that the cycle is probably more advanced for iron ore than it is for met coal. I mean, just quickly referring to one of the slides in your pack, which is the one that shows how much China consumes of specific commodities, you see that iron ore, on a worldwide basis is 50%, or close to it. And in met coal, obviously it's a lot less, a tiny little fraction. We've said that China destocking is essentially complete in iron ore, which means that the market-clearing price trading through the marginal cost has already happened. And it's now trended up to marginal cost, and the market is clearing, and I don't know today, but 10 or 15% below last year's contract price. In Met Coal, we haven't yet seen that destocking complete. People have continued to run their coking batteries in order to keep the heat and electricity and so on going. And those events still have to be manifested in a market where &#x2013; which is still trading above marginal cost of production. So in terms of pure volatility, I think that the outlook is probably different in those two industries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry, just going back to the cost, can you give us sort of an indicative number, what you think you can rip out of the business in, approximately?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we've got additional guidance at this point in time, again, but probably at our quarterly production report we will give as much updates as we can. I should also caveat that by saying that there are so many moving parts at the moment that getting a clear picture of how that is going to come through is probably quite difficult at this point in time.</p>

          <p>Given the weightiness in the market, should we expect to see any delay in the timing of those expansion programs that you've given us? And I guess secondly, following your decision to let the offer for Rio lapse last year, looking on the long-term basis, when the fundamentals of the market improve, do you still see unparalleled value that can be unlocked through a combination, taking into account any commentary by the EU?</p>

          <p>Okay. Olivia the &#x2013; we've got a series of projects, which we call RGP 5, RGP 6 and then quantum. RGP 5 to 205 million tons on a 100% basis. RGP 6 to mark us, what, 250, something like that. Yes. And then Quantum, Beyond. On RGP 5, which we've got the commitment, you should expect that we're going to try and bring that project on as quickly as we can, which is the only speed that Phil who runs the project team, say for the last 10 years, knows. No change there. Obviously, the ones beyond that, we haven't approved yet. So I don't want to give an update on that today.</p>
          <p>Sorry, Olivia, just remind me what the second part &#x2013; oh &#x2013; the assets remain the same assets that we've looked at. No further guidance to what we said at the time that our deal lapsed. While I don't want to talk about that too much today, we said that we didn't see from the EU perspective anything that wasn't manageable under normal conditions. We pointed more to divestment risk, low point in the cycle and so on. I would say that clearly, the synergies that the industry has been trying to achieve for the last, I don't know, 15, 20 years are still there.</p>

          <p>Marius, if I can go again. Brendan from Macquarie. We've seen an enormous amount of positioning in the LNG space. People come in to coal seam methane. The majors playing a big part, acquiring assets et cetera. We haven't heard much from BHP on LNG for some time. It is obviously an important part of your business, but you don't control it as such. What're you plans given that it is a core component of the LNG outlook for Asia particularly and your positive view on Asia in general longer-term?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I can answer the first part of the question definitively, and may ask Mike to make a few comments about what we are doing particularly out in Western Australia. Mike always describes in, I guess in gestures, the coal seam methane business as a [unusual sound] business and we are in the [unusual sound] business. [laughter] So that view is unchanged. We -- and then we view the coal seam methane business probably not as having the large low cost and so on. It is actually operationally quite an intricate business to pump in &#x2013; to drill, pump, and drain. Out west, we did have that announcement at Thebe but -- and we obviously have the joint ventures. You will have seen on our growth chart, we put that somewhere in the middle of the next decade, but Mike, perhaps any additional color there?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Marius, I think you've described our views on the coal seam, I guess, clearly not a &#x2013; not something that is at top of our list, not so I have to say that others don't have a good angle that they are taking, but it's just at our &#x2013; in our circumstances, we have things that we think are more robust and more certain. Our Western Australia gas is anchored right now with the large discovery at Scarborough. And then of course Thebe is an extension, another discovery, that's a 100% BHP Billiton some 31 kilometers away. We have active team working on this right now with SO. And we are working on the various options there and aggressively pursuing those and hopefully we'll have more to say about that in the near term. So very optimistic about bringing that forward and actively working it.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> Newspaper. I think this very good result comes from the contracted price with Japanese or Chinese steelmakers that were ordered &#x2013; the coals last year &#x2013; last April I think. And this time, I think the Chinese or Japanese steelmakers expect you to cut the price of their order of the coal that is coming this April. Do you think it's &#x2013; yeah, I think it's under the negotiation, but do you think it is able to cut the price of their order of coal?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course, I unfortunately can't give you price predictions, but I just want to point you at the comments that I made in response to Glen's question. I have nothing to add on the coal market to those comments. On the iron ore piece, just to reinforce the one comment that I did make, which is that we saw the price during the de-stocking cycle trade below the marginal cost of production, but the price, because the de-stocking cycle in iron ore is almost complete in China, you've seen a trade up to within not very far away prices were settled last time. And we regard this market clearing price, which is based on many, many, many transactions &#x2013; of the physical cargos &#x2013; as the best indicator of where the market is at that moment and I'd just like to point you at that.</p>

          <p>Lawrence Greg, LG Consulting. I have a question about carbon markets and carbon markets in three different jurisdictions in Australia. I am wondering what your investment activities might be in response to the recent developments out of Canberra, which has lead to a second range of developments, but also in the U.S., and I note that Exxon called for coal carbon taxes as opposed to carbon markets &#x2013; to decree that mechanism, so I am wondering if you can have some comments on those three jurisdictions and BHP's potential responses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Australian proposals or white paper, our comments are in the public domain. We don't have anything to add to that. We commented on how the period during which the energy content is determined, price period, pricing periods, and so on. We spoke about how coal mines are treated around the world, or where trend is and so on. But I don't have anything to add on that, and clearly we are in a period where it is not yet firm where we will end up. In the EU we're clearly have some exposure on &#x2013; small exposure on some of the North Sea and Irish Sea oil and gas activities, but I wouldn't describe that as material, and in the U.S. I think, while I am not an expert on that, but where it seems to me to be moving is a sector-by-sector approach, where some sectors might have carbon trading but it doesn't seem to me, while it is early days of the new administration, that it is moving towards a global &#x2013; sorry, a US wide economy approach. It seems to me that they're moving -- regulating buildings, regulating car efficiencies, and then taking up the generation sector and perhaps looking at stuff there. Lawrence, I actually, you know, reflecting on that answer is probably not that satisfactory, but that's probably the extent to which I could comment on it.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marius. Just one question, it hasn't been touched on it all. But I mean, given the current environment, I can understand you're trying to be conservative on your balance sheet, but capital management now, with gearing less than 10%. I know it's tough times, but you have got an exceptionally strong balance sheet now. What's this company's position now? You have got an outstanding buyback that you announced I think, what about eight months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our actions speak larger than words, and basically you should always take our actions that we take consistent with our outlook. And I've got an old banker as a Chairman, so between those two factors, I think that probably indicates that we probably -- always on the prudent side of where balance sheets are. At this stage, we've given no indication that we've got any intentions to restart that buyback. Clearly as this situation of &#x2013; as this business cycle unfolds, as it will, and it becomes more clear, our single-A return surplus cash is going to come into feature again, but not today. Alex, anything to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add, Marius, that we haven't changed the priorities in the way we manage cash. The first priority is to invest in the business and invest in long-term value. The second priority is to manage the balance sheet, and I think we have done a pretty good job at that. And then the third is to return value to shareholder &#x2013; return funds to shareholders, which buyback is one way of doing it. We have maintained the $0.41 dividend. And I think that in itself shows a great differentiation between us and the peer group.</p>

          <p>It's Karim Katra at Frang Independent. In the last couple of weeks, there has been a couple of reasonably large asset transactions in Brazil, Argentina, BHP's name wasn't against those. Do we take that those were assets that sort of don't fit your current state of mind or is it value that's really the issue there?</p>

          <p>It is difficult always for me to comment on any specific transaction because then I get chased down the line, what about this one, what about that one. So I wouldn't like to do that, but I would point at the Tier-1 export oriented nature of our business in this particular case.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was used in the audience extensively in the weeks of run-up to this, but please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In light of Ravensthorpe and then in light of your withdrawal from the Rio Tinto bid, as there been forensic analysis within BHP in terms of the decision-making, in terms of new projects and acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see how that question particularly relates to the Rio transaction. So I can answer that part first. We obviously have an investment process. Alex is the custodian of that investment process, as it pertains to Rio. The only thing that I want to point out is that it was our decision to lapse the bid, which is perhaps sometimes not commented on enough. You should take it as read that as we started that process, the duration, the risks, and so on, were analyzed, and we always knew what our options were as that process unfolded. I think that probably answers our approach to the Rio piece.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Ravensthorpe investment decision, I'm not going to go back to what I've said before. But reflect on perhaps the single line sentence that I've used to summarize -- that out of 44 projects that we've completed since the company was put together in its current form, that probably wasn't our best decision. But having said that, I also want to note that the nickel market has changed very dramatically over the last year and a half, two years -- new technologies, seaborne nickel ore as a new force in nickel, Chinese pig iron and rotary kiln producers capping the upside in nickel price. There have been dramatic changes on top of what assumptions were when that project was started. But certainly you should take it as an organization that always tries to learn from not only its own mistakes but also from the mistakes of others. It's taken all of the opportunity that it can in order to learn from the decision-making modes around that project.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I got cut off before. Quick question, on the old western mining assets, <mark type="inaudible" /> as you originally thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that there is no real change in that. We always knew what the western mining assets were. Corridor Sand is a minor piece of the equation. I wouldn't say that there has been any material outlook. If anything, if I reflect back on the Uranium market, probably the rate of reactor build is probably a little slower than I would have thought. But at the same time, I probably think that the awareness of greenhouse emissions and so on probably gives more upside going forward. So there's probably been a little bit of a change there.</p>

          <p>Marius, Craig Campbell at Morgan Stanley . Just to finish off. When you look at the base metals complex, most of the base metals are at a point where the industry as a whole is suffering, but you look at copper, while the copper price has come down a long way, that really hasn't impacted to the extent that you are seeing in aluminum, nickel, and zinc. And just wondering if you could offer some comments on why that might be the case, that copper hs held up relatively so well compared to other base metals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig, I obviously can't prove any causality here, but we did go into the cycle with very different stock conditions. We've commented on the fact before that the mines themselves, we haven't see any major investment in new copper mines -- big large copper mines -- where we have seen extensive investment in aluminum smelting capacity. And I think that those few factors definitely play a role here. The more interesting thing for us as we go forward, is to see how the interplay of copper being a very industrial metal plays with the supply conditions. But I have gone and look at historically what ratio copper and aluminum traded at. I think it's fair to say that aluminum technology, where it was more proprietary before, is now opened up and is reasonably available to anyone. So, if on balance aluminums fundamentals barriers to entry probably have decreased relative to copper, but apart from one period in the 80s where differentials between copper and aluminum were very modest, a $1,000 differential or so between the two was probably what you were looking at, and on balance you would probably expect that to be a little bit higher given the changes in the aluminum market. But I again I can't prove any of this. But that's how I think about it.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think, we might conclude here. Alex, thank you very much for staying up, and Mike, thank you very much for dialing in. And Marcus.</p>
          <p>Thank you all, ladies and gentlemen, for coming out here this morning and setting through these results with us. In conclusion, we're very proud of BHP Billiton as a company, of the options that we've got, and we hope to stand here in front of you in six months time and illustrate that to you once again. Thank you very much for coming.</p>
