          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Siemens' 2011 Second Quarter Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we begin, I would like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on page 2 of the Siemens' presentation.</p>
          <p>This conference call may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on the company's current expectations and certain assumptions and, therefore, are subject to certain risk and uncertainties. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mrs. Mariel von Drathen, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, madam.</p>

          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Siemens' Second Quarter Fiscal 2011 Conference Call. The earnings release, the flashlight and other documents were published this morning at 7 a.m. You can download them from our website. This morning's presentation is now online and this morning's call is being webcast via the IR website.</p>
          <p>Our President and CEO, Peter L&#xF6;scher, and our Chief Financial Officer, Joe Kaeser, are here this morning to review the Q2 results. After an introductory presentation from Peter, both Peter and Joe have time for Q&amp;A. Given the planned analyst call of another European capital goods company, I ask for your understanding that we'll have to close the call shortly before 11 o'clock. And with that, I would like to hand over to Peter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mariel, and welcome everybody to our Q2 Analyst Call. I will give you a brief update on Siemens' performance in the second quarter and our revised outlook for fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we again achieved outstanding broad-based order growth. Economic recovery in both the U.S. and Europe is ongoing, albeit on different levels within the various economies. Germany's export strength delivered a strong growth contribution to our businesses. And the main growth engines, though, are the emerging markets, such as China or India, among others.</p>
          <p>We closely watched the potential impact from uncertainties about the political development in North Africa and the Middle East, rising prices for commodities, sovereign debt worries in some European countries, and the increasingly critical view on the U.S. budget deficit, to react flexible if required and possible.</p>
          <p>Let me also give you a brief update on the situation in Japan. As we currently see it from the sourcing point of view, due to the complex structure of the supply network, there are some specific challenges in the supply chain, mostly in the components area, which are adequately addressed and monitored closely. Overall, we still cannot give a final assessment of the potential impact on Siemens' operations.</p>
          <p>Now, let me come to the highlights of the second quarter. New orders substantially increased by 27%, fueled by a broad-based growth in Industry and significant large order wins in Energy. Revenues were clearly up organically versus the prior year and also slightly, quarter-over-quarter. Overall, profitability held up well despite significant growth investments in research and development, engineering capacities and sales resources.</p>
          <p>After several quarters of strong free cash flow performance, we saw a weaker second quarter. This is mainly due to a build-up of net working capital associated with broad-based growth and lower customer pre-payments. In addition, the current period included cash outflows in connection with personnel-related expenses, such as the previously announced special employee bonus.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we took decisive steps in the second quarter to position the set-up and portfolio of the company for future growth. First, stronger entrepreneurial focus for Osram through an IPO in fall 2011. Osram drives the structural change in lighting market from a position of operational strength and improved portfolio through the Siteco acquisition.</p>
          <p>Second, portfolio activities that sharpen and strengthen our portfolio, such as the divestment of our stake in Areva NP, or the successful increase of our stake in Siemens India Limited from 55% to 75%, which will be cash effective in Q3. Third, we focus on the growth potential of Cities &amp; Infrastructure customers to meet their needs of sustainable development, and increasing their competitiveness by setting up a dedicated fourth sector.</p>
          <p>Strong execution and growth in our end markets leads us to favorable assessment of the development in profit from continuing operations. Therefore, we are updating our guidance for the year, which I will touch upon later. Let's look briefly at our key figures.</p>
          <p>I've already laid out the orders and revenue highlights, which lead to a very strong 1.17 book-to-bill ratio. Total sector profit included strong profit growth in Industry and Energy, as well as &#x20AC;1.5 billion gain from the Areva divestment. Healthcare showed a stable earnings performance.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Below (05:50) sectors was impacted by positive one-offs, such as the gain from the sale of our 49% stake in Krauss-Maffei Wegmann. And this translated into a more than doubled income from continuing operations and earnings per share performance.</p>
          <p>Looking at our backlog of &#x20AC;92 billion, we can take a lot of confidence into the second half of fiscal 2011. This is a record level, despite adverse currency effects. It was fueled by a strong demand in base orders, but also by several large order wins, mainly in the Energy sector, along the entire value chain.</p>
          <p>Fossil won a major component order of more than US$1 billion in Saudi Arabia for the Ras Az Zawr power plant. In this context, Fossil will also strengthen its footprint in the Middle East through a large investment in a new gas turbine manufacturing and service facility in Saudi Arabia.</p>
          <p>Renewables booked several large orders through large three-digit million euros offshore orders in Germany, such as DanTysk or Borkum Riffgrund. And Transmission, once again, proved our successful integrated Energy offering by winning the offshore grid connection for the SylWin cluster from TenneT. Siemens' largest order ever in Poland was won by Mobility selling 35 metro trains to the City of Warsaw.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, order growth was broad-based with double-digit increases across all regions, but with particular strength in emerging markets, which accounted for 36% of total orders in the second quarter. Also, Germany was clearly standing out due to strong industrial demand and large offshore wind orders. Revenues rose in all three regions, led by the Americas and above-average growth of 18% in China and 19% in India.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Industry sector, we saw a continued strong growth momentum, high capacity utilization and drop-through of profitability in our early cycle businesses, like Industry Automation and Motion Control. Economic indicators remain positive, and the impression of a very vibrant Hannover Fair gives us confidence also for the second half of the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Due to tougher comparables, we will see a moderation of growth rates in the short cycle businesses. Growth is also coming back in the later cycle businesses of Building Technologies, driven by energy efficiency solutions. Mobility, again, executed well on its current projects and has a strong sales funnel ahead. A major highlight is the principalization of Deutsche Bahn AG to purchase up to 300 ICx high-speed trains until 2030. And this would be the largest single order Siemens ever received.</p>
          <p>Another record is the all-time high quarterly order intake in the Energy sector. Underlying profitability in Fossil reached an extraordinary high level due to excellent project execution and a favorable business mix with high margin products and service businesses. These factors more than offset further project charges of &#x20AC;87 million related to the Olkiluoto 3 project. Profitability in Renewables is still held back by further investments in the international expansion of the Wind business in emerging markets and substantial expenses for the ongoing development of the Solar business.</p>
          <p>Transmission saw a good underlying profitability, excluding some charges associated with the optimization of its global manufacturing footprint. As expected, the investment and ramp-up costs for new technologies, such as Smart Grid applications, impact somewhat the profitability in the distribution division. Going forward, the Energy sector expects the pace of order intakes to slow in coming quarters, following several consecutive quarters of particularly high market demand.</p>
          <p>In the Healthcare sector, we recorded strong order growth in the region Asia and Australia. The overall revenue growth was led by a strong performance from the Imaging and Therapy business. Healthcare profit achieved a good earnings conversion almost to the prior-year level, which was strongly supported by pension curtailment gains.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look on our performance in the context of the One Siemens financial target systems after the first half of fiscal 2011. Our nominal revenue growth of 7.6% is slightly below the defined main competitor basket. All three sectors are clearly within the drop cycle EBITDA margin ranges through &#x2013; all three sectors are clearly within the through cycle EBITDA margin ranges, and prove a consistent delivery on profitability.</p>
          <p>Our ROCE performance of 33.3% is positively affected by the Areva disposal gain. But even without this effect, a ROCE of 23.6% for the first half of fiscal 2011 is clearly above the target range and shows our commitment to capital efficient growth. The capital structure has turned now into a positive 0.1 net debt over EBITDA multiple, reflecting the positive impact on cash following the Areva disposal. We will use this strong position to pursue all options to grow our business in a capital efficient way.</p>
          <p>Let me now come to the guidance update. Not surprisingly, given our strong operational performance to date, we have increased our expectations for the full fiscal year 2011. We expect organic order intake to show a significant increase compared to fiscal 2010, supported also by our already strong order backlog, we expect mid-single digit organic revenue growth.</p>
          <p>We further anticipate income from continuing operations to be at least &#x20AC;7.5 billion. And this outlook excludes effects that may arise from legal and regulatory matters, among other possible effects from an ongoing arbitration proceeding between Siemens and Areva SA. And with this, Joe and I are happy to take your questions on the Q2 performance and the outlook for the fiscal year 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. Operator, we would like to open the Q&amp;A session now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. We will start today's question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Andreas Willi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have three questions, please. The first one on your profitability in the Industry sector, you mentioned investments. We have seen quite a big step-up in Q2 versus Q1. What should we use as a run rate for the year in terms of higher sales, higher R&amp;D investments in the Industry sector, particularly in Industry Automation and Drive Technology?</p>
          <p>Second question, just following up on that, Building Technologies' profitability was quite weak. Maybe you could give us some indications there. And last question on the Renewables investment, you continue to push to build out your Wind business, you say, in emerging markets. We continue to see negative news in the industry from fierce competition, pricing and all of that. Maybe you could elaborate, why do you invest money into onshore wind? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Andreas, good morning. On the Industry sector, as far as the run rate is concerned is &#x2013; and this is general, too, for the company, still we do expect to have the OpEx development in 2011 still within the range I had given in the explanation for the 2011 outlook in November. There won't be any material adverse development there.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; to continue to invest into areas, which are close to revenue and bookings environment, that means Application Center and the likes, and it is also true on the R&amp;D, which has a clear focus on engineering. As far as the run &#x2013; concerned, I think if you kind of use about a 5% R&amp;D and about a 13% SG&amp;A run rate going forward, you'll be okay on the Industry sector.</p>
          <p>As far as Industrial Automation is concerned, first of all, even though I'm aware that the expectations in the market have been somewhat more demanding for Q2, we still should not forget that year-over-year we made quite a significant progress, with a huge drop to the bottom line. We expect that the year-over-year improvement to continue in Q3 in terms of margins in Industrial Automation, and also would not be too surprised if the underlying margins in Q3 would also then improve quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>So there is still some way to go there, but you should be aware of the fact that there's catch-up effect. Now, obviously we have always discussed when we were explaining this steep ramp-up of recovery, this recovery and supply chain <mark type="ph" /> ceiling (17:00) effect is over. And that also, of course, will in some way affect the mix outcome of the revenue structure, but then again, still operating in an improving environment, but it's going to decelerate.</p>
          <p>Now on BT, obviously it's not what we wanted. I think I mentioned BT has some potential, predominantly potential for improvement, especially in the low voltage area. There is a restructuring and improvement program ongoing. So, one should expect some recovery quarter-over-quarter and also year-over-year in the quarters to come, but don't expect miracles here also in the short term. That covers Industry and BT.</p>
          <p>And then on the Renewables investment, we clearly need to differentiate between the Wind and more sun &#x2013; Solar-related environment. We're still making good progress in the offshore environment. And if you look at the top-line development on bookings, and compare numbers in the industry, I think it's fair to say that Siemens is still making good progress in that segment.</p>
          <p>By the same token, you just have to recognize on the Wind business that this has been now moving from craftsmanship to industrialization. And we do see first signs of consolidation matters coming along that would also mean that, in the foreseeable future, the margins we had in the last year are not sustainable. But we still believe the margins we currently show in Q1 and Q2 have potential to improve over the quarters, <mark type="ph" /> definitely (18:55) in Q4 and ongoing.</p>
          <p>On the Solar matter, we just have to say that timing-wise, the Solar environment has been hit most by the austerity programs and the uncertainties, especially the economies which are close to the Sun Belt, and this is something we are currently suffering from that leads to an effect that currently the losses in Solar are higher than the revenues. And this is something we expect to continue for a while, and as far as I can tell that also that <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Suess, (19:30) who is taking over the sector, will certainly look into that and see how we move forward on the sector. So that pretty much I think covers the three topics here.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll now move to our next question. This comes from Mark Troman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Peter and Joe. It's Mark here from Bank of America. Just three questions, please.</p>
          <p>Firstly, one for Joe. Joe, could you explain as simply as you can, how Siemens is affected by FX, in particular the dollar-euro? I know it's a complicated subject, but if you give us some sort of guidelines how that might impact profits one way or another, or sensitivity of the dollar, that would be very helpful.</p>
          <p>Second question, could you just outline where you see the pricing situation across your businesses? Where you're seeing still pressure? Where you're seeing improvements, particularly in the context of raw material costs rising or potentially rising more?</p>
          <p>And finally, maybe one for Peter, if you could just go through the outlook for Healthcare and how you feel about that market. Performance looks to be solid and I guess likely to continue to be for some time. But in terms of order development, do you see ongoing positive trends or flattening out? Or what do you see in Healthcare? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Hi, Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>FX, as simply as possible, in the short term for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are fine. We have hedged most of the exposure to the dollar, which didn't really matter in Q2 and Q1, but it obviously will matter in &#x2013; with the $1.46 or $1.48 or whatever the numbers will be. So, just to give you some flavor, in the project business general, as you know, we hedge by the time the order is booked. So therefore, there is &#x2013; as a cumulative catch-up, there's zero exposure one way or the other.</p>
          <p>In the products business industry, for the remainder of the fiscal year, is basically &#x2013; the products business in Industry is hedged by close to 80%. at about $1.31, Energy product business at $1.35 in &#x2013; or actually $1.33 on average, on the products business. Fully &#x2013; and also Healthcare is fully hedged at $1.33 for the remainder of the fiscal year. So we took advantage from times that people thought there will be a one-to-one relation in 2011, and I believe we did a decent job here. So that's as quick as one can.</p>
          <p>And in the mid to long-term aspect, obviously as you know &#x2013; and you made that clear, a strong dollar is better for Siemens than a weak one. So, time &#x2013; we'll see how matters go over the quarters. And it's always difficult to measure and comment the strategic impact of how competitors would move in pricing, taking advantage of the dollar if they operate out of a U.S. dollar environment.</p>
          <p>So we take it as it comes quarter-over-quarter. And I think clearly, as Peter and I repeatedly said, our desire is to have a natural hedge by being close to where the customers are. And this is also why we invest into go-to-market expenses also, so that much to FX.</p>
          <p>Outline on pricing, may remember that when we explained our forecast for 2011, in November 2010 we said that pricing in total for the company would be about 3 to 3.5% points year-over-year. We do see some easing here, so that we would actually feel more comfortable to mark the lower end of that range as a safe bet going forward for the fiscal year. So, the ease mostly comes from the Industry sector in the short cycle environment. Obviously, there's strong demand and some market power. Energy is at, or actually slightly below, the pricing as compared to November. So overall, if you put a 2.8% to 3.0% price decline on your tag, you'll be okay.</p>
          <p>And as far as the market is concerned on the suppliers' side, we continue to make good progress in the design win environment, but the low hanging fruits, in terms of negotiation powers, are gone. So, we would expect &#x2013; still expect some adverse impact between the suppliers' markets and the customer markets. Remember I said about a billion difference year-over-year. I would say this is probably some like &#x20AC;800 million now, so slightly &#x2013; overall to put it together, overall slight improvement, but not a one-to-one conversion from the suppliers' into the sellers' environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mark, in terms of the Healthcare environment, I would foresee the U.S. on a growth trajectory. We are very satisfied with the share development, what we see there, China, now fast being the second biggest equipment market, so, the emerging economies, particularly China, very important on a growth mode.</p>
          <p>The most difficult market environment currently is in Europe, and not surprisingly, because obviously it is impacted by fiscal consolidation measures, what we see across governments. Pricing pressure continue in the same way, and therefore, the two or the three key success factors continue to be very relevant &#x2013; continuously to drive productivity for the business, what we have done since many, many quarters, invested in innovations, and expand your product portfolio more tailored towards the need also of emerging economies, and of a broader customer base.</p>
          <p>So having said this, the <mark type="ph" /> digs (26:23), if you remember, as we have communicated, the team is now executing against the plan, but we just need some patience, because there are &#x2013; we have communicated, no short-term fixes. But they are executing against it, and the business is basically implementing now the restructuring program, according &#x2013; as we have planned it. So, overall, the Healthcare environment continues to be a solid environment and a business sector which is probably currently below trend line &#x2013; what we have seen historically, but no major change in terms of the competitive dynamics.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I had two quick questions. The first one was in terms of Building Technologies. Obviously, you've had a tough quarter here and you're highlighting an acceleration in investment. And I take on board your comments of expecting an improvement going forward, but I think at the Industry Capital Markets Day a little while ago, you actually outlined quite a brave strategy that you had within this division, which was to look to innovate a much broader range of products and try to really accelerate the penetration of that division into more areas of commercial construction. And at the time, it seemed that you were looking for a major overhaul of the products and really quite a big push.</p>
          <p>Is the movement we've seen in margin here the cost of that? And is there sort of any kind of total value you can put on what that project would be and how long it would take? And the second question was just on Renewables. You made a comment there about opportunities for consolidation. I'm not quite sure if I heard you correctly, but was that suggesting that you were looking at a &#x2013; strategic opportunities in the Renewables division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the second one is quick. The answer is no, we do not really want to consolidate capacities, which are not used. I think we made that repeatedly clear and there is no plan for that. We usually do not comment on type of M&amp;A-related matters, but this one is so, I guess, important that it should be mentioned.</p>
          <p>What I meant with consolidation is that capacities have been rising quicker than a still increasing demand, and that now as the industry moves from a more hand-selected project environment into an industrial environment, and that means that we do expect consolidation in the market. And we do not intend to be an active consolidator by M&amp;A rather than organic growth.</p>
          <p>On the BT, obviously, there has been some costs here associated to the development, product development on &#x2013; towards energy efficiency. And also, we have to say that on a low voltage, we are not yet where we want to be, but the plans and the targets remain intact in an, actually, very positive market segment.</p>
          <p>Over the foundation of the four sectors, which says Cities &amp; Infrastructure, of course also we'll be very focused on energy efficiency. And what you've seen now in the first stage was a basically a lift-drop announcement that said there will be certain divisions in the new sector, but we obviously have not yet announced and disclosed that this will be here at the time and the new sector will also communicate it to the markets what the change element will be on that process lift-drop change in the foundation of the new sector. And you can be rest assured that the Building Technology matter and energy efficiency will play a major role in the reassessment and the refocusing of the market. So, that much to the energy efficiency focus of the company.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, morning. I had a couple of questions on Energy and one on strategy. On the Energy side, I sort of interpreted from the press release that you're now expecting the Energy orders to sort of fall back over the next couple of quarters from the &#x20AC;9 billion level, which is very high indeed. I guess what I wanted to understand, Joe, is are you signaling going back to the previous level of the last few quarters, i.e. around say &#x20AC;6 billion, or are you actually signaling a sort of weaker market than what we've actually seen in the last few quarters? So that was issue number one.</p>
          <p>Issue number two was on this phenomenal Fossil power margin, 24% underlying. What I was hoping to understand, where is that coming from? Is that due to the Service business? Is that due to particular projects? Could you just give a little &#x2013; a bit more color on how we got to 24%, and what we should think about in Fossil Power going forward?</p>
          <p>And then finally, I guess it's a more sensitive topic, acquisition strategy. Joe, I know you gave a press interview with the Financial Times, talking about acquisitions of up to several billion euros, and I think there was a lot of commentary in the market about whether several billion euros was a large acquisition or a bolt-on. Could you just sort of give us a sense of what, for Siemens, is a normal type bolt-on transaction? And what would be considered a large deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'd be happy to, Ben. On the acquisition strategy, at that time and the reaction in the markets actually, hindsight showed that this was necessary. The Financial Times interview was poised to basically clarify that if Siemens talks about bolt-on acquisitions, that could also be in the range &#x2013; in the low four digit range, okay, four-digit million range, and not just a couple of hundred million. And I believe the company that size should actually have that view in general. That does not mean that we execute on this, but it was just a clarification of what we have been talking about for quite some time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Joe. I'm being stupid. When you talk about four digit, is that four zeros? Or are you talking about billion-dollar transactions or $10-billion transactions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, four digit means &#x2013; four digit &#x2013; millions &#x2013; that means between a billion and, I don't know, $3 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Very clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Low &#x2013; low single-digit billion transactions would be considered also be bolt-on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And large, this is what Peter and I repeatedly said, large acquisitions in the area of what was <mark type="ph" /> video (33:49) at that time or other, are not meant to be that additive to company. We did anyway, we would explain it to the market why that made sense to begin with. So that <mark type="ph" /> formal (34:02) clarification on Energy.</p>
          <p>Obviously we are also very pleased and satisfied with the Energy market share development, obviously because this is a matter of market share. The market does not grow, or has not been growing in the first half of our fiscal year, as our bookings have grown. You've seen that in comparison to other numbers, which have been announced I believe. And we do not intend to lose market share in the second half of our fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>What we believe, though, is that the majority of orders had &#x2013; in terms of the timing, had been placed in the first half. So, we would actually see some ease of bookings for the second half, and we &#x2013; it remains our view that this is market and not a loss of market share or a loss of market power of our company.</p>
          <p>As far as the Fossil Power execution is concerned, the recipe here has clearly been an outstanding execution. Now that outstanding execution on the projects also help us to release contingencies, which have been obviously considered in the projects and are not needed. And that now goes on for some quarters, and we obviously are very pleased with that. That's the recipe. There's no other secret behind it. It's a very favorable execution.</p>
          <p>Now on the other hand, I would just caution to kind of add that &#x2013; and add that and add it up. This is a  &#x2013; we believe it's a &#x2013; as far as the new business is concerned, not the installed base business from Service and so on and so forth, we believe that this is industry benchmark on new business. And we would not feel compelled to see much room to grow that further. Because there is also a limit to our customers' business plans, which still need to be favorable, otherwise they wouldn't do the project. So I think if one assumes that to be peak margin, this is certainly something which people would be well advised.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But these contingencies that are being released, Joe, should we think of those in the, let's say, several tens of millions of euros in the next couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As I, Ben, as I said, I mean Fossil is outstanding in execution, outstanding in performance, given the percentage of install base. And if we assume moderate growth in revenues, based on a solid backlog, then I would be happy if the margin would be sustained over the quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We move to our next question, which comes from Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, good morning. I've got three questions, please. Firstly on Renewables, Joe, you commented that the previous margins were probably unsustainable. You used to have a 12% to 16% margin target for the Renewables business. Are you now saying you can't do a double-digit margin in future? Maybe you could help us understand exactly what you meant.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I'd like an update, please, on the timing for hitting your capital structure target. Since the capital structure target was set last year, you've had the proceeds from the Areva divestment. You've got some Osram RPO coming up later this year. Does this mean that the two to three-year timetable for achieving the capital structure target is being pushed back, or are you just going to have more capital to deploy in the same time period?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, if you could provide a bit more color on what's happening in Power Transmission. You've had very good order intake for the last couple quarters, and you've talked previously about strong &#x2013; rising competition, especially from the Chinese in that market. So, is the market turning? Is pricing power easing? Are the Chinese getting less aggressive? Could you maybe give us just some color on what's happening in that marketplace and why you're able to be so successful in winning orders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, if I try to step in with the first one, in terms of &#x2013; you're rightfully referring to a target margin, which is no longer valid. Because if you compare, because we have just added up the sector level. If you look into it, really, and this is valid today, as it probably was yesterday and it will be tomorrow. The offshore market environment is a better one, so we clearly anticipate that this is a very good environment, because there are higher entry barriers.</p>
          <p>But you can already look into current announcement of competitors who have mainly onshore businesses. There is no doubt that there is a double-digit market is &#x2013; you cannot expect for onshore businesses. So the mix of onshore/offshore will basically define how high the margins will be in different companies. And I think we are &#x2013; we continue to be benefiting from our mix, which is two-third, one-third, and therefore relatively speaking, we are outperforming also from an overall margin performance.</p>
          <p>But as Joe is highlighting, this is a business, which is in the early phase of maturing, of industrializing. And the competitive dynamics are clearly now driven also by the effect that capacity is higher than demand. So on a sustainable basis in &#x2013; you should not expect, and I do not believe, that this is a business, which can drive basically similar margins than we would have said for the Fossil business, which has a totally different entry barrier scenario relative to Wind.</p>
          <p>So, but having said all of this, the opportunity, what we see for this business is clearly, A, we have a very good install base. We continue to have a very favorable mix onshore/offshore, and it's also business, which is in the early cycle of serviceability relative to our other Energy businesses. So, you should expect from us, relatively speaking to our competitors in this business, healthy and good margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Peter, on the Transmission, we have booked good orders, and we believe we are &#x2013; we continue to be well positioned in the Transmission environment. One of the reasons being is that we win most of the connection orders, if and when wind parks are being placed. It's not natural that the grid connection and the wind park are being awarded within one contract, but there is a high connectivity for those two areas, and we continue to benefit from that service offering out of, if you want, one-shop shopping &#x2013; or one-stop shopping. And that has also been one of the major elements why we saw good order intakes and good growth for us in Transmission.</p>
          <p>As far as the traditional Transmission environment is concerned, this is obviously transformers, yeah, we did see strong local competition arising out of the whole programs at that time. We've seen some easing in pricing. The competitive environment is still strong, but the pricing has been easing. So, we're still face pricing pressure, but it's been easing over the quarters in the last two quarters.</p>
          <p>On capital structure target, there will not be a new target. We set out our One Siemens as an operating model on how we manage the company, and as a communication to the shareholders. By the same token, we said this capital structure of 0.5 to 1.0 net debt over EBITDA &#x2013; adjusted net debt over EBITDA, needs to be over a longer period of time, but we will &#x2013; we stand to the targets which we issued, and then when there is time to discuss the actions, then we will do so. But now we believe it's a bit too early to discuss those topics.</p>

          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll now move to our next question, which comes from Christel Monot from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Peter, Joe and Mariel. Have three questions please, and I'm going to come back quickly to what Ben said earlier. In terms of the orders in Energy, can you a bit more specific in terms of what you're expecting by &#x2013; for the different businesses when you talk about growth to moderate? If you could be a bit more specific, whether this going to come from Renewables, Fossil or Transmission, in particular.</p>
          <p>And second element, you're saying basically that you would be happy if margins were sustained over the next couple of quarters when you, I think, were referring to Fossil. I remember that in previous call, you were talking about a more realistic margin, somewhere around 17%. So are you actually talking about the fact that you think you're able to maintain a margin of both 20% for &#x2013; Q4?</p>
          <p>And the last question would be on &#x20AC;125 million charges for capacity adjustments that you booked in Q2. I see some from Transmission, but can you be a bit more specific on where the rest came from? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Christel. On the orders, obviously in Energy, this is mostly &#x2013; has mostly been about Fossil environment and this is also where the comments are related to. It's mostly on the traditional Energy environment where we expect the market to seasonally ease in terms of growth. But then again, the &#x2013; our view is we are not going to lose share in the market. So if the market saw a better than anticipated growth, then we certainly would claim our fair share in our current position as the target.</p>
          <p>We do believe that the order intake in Renewables will be active. There are a lot of projects out there. There has been some boost, especially in the funnel from recent developments, obviously in Japan and associated use in the society on a pretty much global base, but it may take time 'til we &#x2013; this will be converted into meaningful projects. But still, there should be some favorable tone in the funnel at least, notwithstanding that the margins may come to a more slower pace.</p>
          <p>In terms of Fossil, I believe it's &#x2013; thank you for asking that question, again. In terms of Fossil, so what I have on my records here is that we do have a margin of Q2 of obviously 80.7%, which was basically with the &#x20AC;1.520 billion gain on the Areva matter. But when I talk about being happy to sustain those margins, I was basically saying that I would be happy if we maintained a, let's say, 18% type of environment on a reported basis, and that would certainly be something I'd be happy with.</p>
          <p>And Peter said it could be dropping to 17%. That's why I said I would be happy if it was 18%. So I think to be serious again, an environment between 17% to 18%, it was some outstanding performance on projects, maybe a bit above, that's the levels we are currently operating at. And that's why this is our aspiration to maintain that level. But I would be very cautious about seeing incremental potential on the margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This was on the Fossil margin. If I try to draw you a picture, it was an all stars aligned quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think you said that in a previous quarter, which is the issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But look into what, Christel, just compare what our competitors are saying, and then I think then you -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. And quickly on charges from &#x20AC;125 million charges for capacity adjustment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we already said, the majority has been in the <mark type="ph" /> T&amp;D (47:53) environment, where we are realigning our geographic and global footprint. So all those charges, which are really very minor per division or per business unit, they add up to some meaningful number, but if you look at the incidences, it goes all across the company. It's too small to report them by division, because they are completely immaterial.</p>
          <p>All what we are saying is that even though we are still &#x2013; we on a growth agenda and we invest into SG&amp;A, predominately of course sales, and R&amp;D, we do not forget that there are topics which need to be solved in terms of global regional footprint. And this is &#x2013; was offered as a token to basically disclose that, we continue to work on optimizing our footprint and our productivity, while &#x2013; even though we are growing in the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, we're rapidly coming to the end of the Q&amp;A session. I think there's a couple of people still in the queue, so I'd ask maybe if you can just reduce the number of questions to maybe one, maximum two. And then we go to the next question, please, operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. We'll now move to our next question, which comes from Martin Prozesky from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Martin from Bernstein. Just two questions, please. On free cash flow, it was clearly much weaker in the quarter. Can you just give us a sense for, in which businesses this was kind of most pronounced? Was this due to more buffer stocks? And is this going to be a one-off adjustment? Will it reverse or how should we think about it going forward? And then on, just getting back to Fossil, in the medium term given the expansion you're doing in Saudi Arabia and North Carolina, are there new fixed costs we should expect to see in the Fossil Power division in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Martin. On Fossil again, we are extremely happy about the performance of the division. It has not always been that great, as you know, and because of the fact that this has been an outstanding merger, and because of the fact that we continue to invest into new locations here, we believe this is an optimal footprint. Out of several recent <mark type="ph" /> transmission the gas (50:14) environment in the United States, the Saudi Arabian market, obviously, where there was a 100% market share environment prior to our engagement.</p>
          <p>So those are all investments, which will foster growth, but also add some fixed costs along the line. And that's why we said we'd be happy if there was a sustainable margin in the environment of 17% to 18% going forward, with some upside and some downsides over the quarters. And I realize <mark type="ph" /> this much data as we can (50:47) because everything else would be just be the same in different words.</p>
          <p>On free cash flow, it should actually have come &#x2013; not come as a surprise. I've been flagging that for quite some time. We had outstanding cash conversion rates over the last quarters out of several reasons, which we have explained. We did see a material decrease of customer pre-payments, given the strengths on our orders. And that's been about &#x20AC;800 million to &#x20AC;900 million effect, already, of the total if you compare that year-over-year.</p>
          <p>So it doesn't catch us by surprise that free cash flow was relatively weak on the quarter. We should see some improvement again in Q3 and Q4, but way below last year's numbers. And as I say, it doesn't come as a surprise. We've been calculating that in our liquidity and other areas, as we move along, and obviously, you see &#x2013; if you just compare the financial disclosure, you see where the majority of the reduction of free cash flow has been by division.</p>

          <p>Especially like to draw your attention to the Capital Market Day centered around the emerging markets, which is going to take place end of June in Shanghai. And we are looking forward to meet you at these different occasions. I know there's still a couple of people who wanted to ask questions. The IR team is available throughout the day today. Please do give us a call and we'll help you with these ones. Thank you very much. Bye.</p>
