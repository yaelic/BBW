          <p>Good morning to everybody here in London and good evening to our various friends in Australia. I'm Jan du Plessis and it's my pleasure to welcome you to the Rio Tinto 2009 results presentation. Also of course welcome to those of you listening on our webcast.</p>
          <p>With me in London here today is our Chief Executive, Tom Albanese, whilst our CFO, Guy Elliott, joins us via video conference from Melbourne. Also with us in the audience here today we've got Jacynthe Corte, Chief Executive Rio Tinto Alcan, Bret Clayton, Chief Executive Copper and Diamonds and Preston Chiaro, Chief Executive Energy and Minerals. And they will be more than happy to talk to you afterwards after the presentation outside.</p>
          <p>Before we start the actual presentation I would like to say a few words about our four employees who have been arrested by the authorities in China. I am naturally personally concerned about them, but I want to stress that we will respect the Chinese legal process. I know this topic is of interest to all of you, but I hope you will appreciate that we cannot get into much detail on this topic today.</p>
          <p>The first six months of 2009 were challenging for the Group with a difficult economic backdrop and substantially lower commodity prices than we experienced for the most of 2008.</p>
          <p>This was particularly true of the first quarter of the year, before the general improvement in metal prices that we subsequently saw. These weaker trading conditions are reflected in our first half results with underlying earnings down 54% to $2.6 billion and EBITDA down 47% to $6.1 billion compared to the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>The Group continued to generate strong cash flows from operations throughout the period, reflecting the quality and competitive cost position of our assets. This is a result of our long-standing strategy to focus on the highest-quality Tier 1 assets in the mining sector. Net earnings fell 65% to $2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>During the period the Group took a number of important steps to deliver value for shareholders. To strengthen the balance sheet we raised $15.2 billion through rights issues in the U.K. and Australian markets. These were the first ever rights issues by a dual-listed company and they were very well supported by shareholders in both markets.</p>
          <p>The net proceeds of the equity issuances have been used to pay down Group debt. At the same time the Group announced the formation of a significant production joint venture with BHP Billiton in respect to both companies' iron ore assets in Western Australia. This would establish a unique combination capable of delivering great value for shareholders in years to come through the efficient development of a major resource province.</p>
          <p>In December 2008, the Group set an operating cost reduction target of $2.5 billion for 2010, and we remain on track to attain this with cost reductions of $0.8 billion during the first six months of this year. So far this year we've also announced total divestments of $3.7 billion and earlier this week we received a binding offer of just over $2 billion from Amcor for the majority of the Alcan packaging business.</p>
          <p>The proceeds from these divestments will contribute to the further strengthening of the Group's balance sheet. It is our intention to continue with our previously stated divestment program with a view to reshaping our portfolio and focusing our business on core strategic assets.</p>
          <p>Turning to the economic outlook 2009 is likely to be the first year since 1945 that the world economy as a whole has contracted. Consensus estimates are for global GDP to shrink by 1.5% on a purchasing power parity basis with an associated double percent &#x2013; double-digit percentage decline in metal demand. Demand conditions have been very weak in the OECD economies that still account for 50% of consumption of most commodities and where consumer demand and confidence have been greatly impacted by the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>This weakness has been offset to some degree by China where growth has responded to the aggressive easing in credit availability and an almost $600 billion fiscal stimulus announced in October 2008. It is apparent that the global demand could have been much worse were it not for aggressive fiscal and monetary responses by a number of governments around the world.</p>
          <p>China's recent growth is essentially domestically driven and is mostly related to commodity-intensive infrastructure development, reinforced by a solid recovery in the private housing market. Our expectation is for GDP growth in China to be in the seven to eight percentage points for this year and over 8% in 2010.</p>
          <p>As a result of this growth, as well as the build-up of inventory in expectation of future growth, Chinese imports of metals and minerals have been strong, raising the price of many of the Group's products. But China's export markets remain fragile and OECD demand conditions are likely to remain constrained in the medium term, increasing uncertainty about the sustainability of economic recovery at a global level.</p>
          <p>As usual our economist, Vivek Tulpule has produced a significant assessment of the economy and our markets and this available in your packs and also on our website.</p>
          <p>That's all from me for the moment. I'll hand you over to Tom.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jan and good morning and good evening. Let's start with safety. Safety is a core to Rio Tinto's businesses, both as a value and a key indicator of management performance. Since the start of the year we have suffered three fatalities at our managed operations. This was a marked improvement when compared to 2008, but it was still three fatalities too many.</p>
          <p>Following increase in 2008, which reflected an inclusion of the Alcan safety numbers, we did see a restoration of our year-on-year downward trajectory in lost time frequency rates and also all injury frequency rates, as we continue to drive safety improvement across the operations.</p>
          <p>At this point, I would like to also add a word or two about the employees who've been arrested in China. Our first priority for them is a duty of care to them and their families. And for that reason, we would not want to say or do anything, which could negatively affect them.</p>
          <p>We are pleased they have been treated well. They are in good health and that their families have legal teams in place. We do welcome the fact that the grounds for their arrest do not seem to be as serious as early reports had suggested. As Jan had said, we do respect China's legal processes and we believe it would not be appropriate for us to comment any further on this as it runs its course.</p>
          <p>Underlying earnings and EBITDA for the first half was approximately half due to the weak pricing environment in the first quarter, particularly for aluminum, as shown in the chart on the right of the slide.</p>
          <p>However, cash flow from operations were more resilient, falling 38% to US5.5 billion. Both these earnings and cash flow numbers include the benefit of divestment of the potash assets, which is included above the line as an exploration asset in line with our accounting policy.</p>
          <p>During the first half the Group took the necessary actions to reduce volumes where demand was particularly weak, such as in the minerals and the diamond business where the OECD economies are naturally focused on the demand, and in loss-making areas such as some of our aluminum businesses. Volumes in copper and iron ore however where prices recovered much more quickly were strong.</p>
          <p>We also took tough action to reduce costs including a head count reduction of approximately 16,000 full-time equivalent roles, both contractors and employees which is now largely complete. And this is 2,000 more than our previously guided target of 14,000. During a period of significant corporate activity the focus of the management has not deviated from the business of the business, as borne out by these cost-cutting measures.</p>
          <p>Turning now to iron ore. The Group's iron ore operations continue to run flat-out to meet strong demand growth in China. Chinese iron ore imports in July hit a record of 58 million tonnes as domestic production lost share to competitively priced imports.</p>
          <p>Although the iron ore market did soften early in 2009 with a lower benchmark settlement agreed with the major customers in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. It is worth recalling that this benchmark price is still the second-highest on record.</p>
          <p>We've not yet achieved a benchmark settlement for our Chinese customers. We do continue to make deliveries for them priced primarily on a provisional basis and this is in line with our settlements to other Asian customers.</p>
          <p>Demand for iron ore followed rising steel input and output in China during the half and this was driven particularly by investment in rail and other infrastructure, Sichuan earthquake reconstruction and increased rural housing construction.</p>
          <p>And as a result of this we have continued to run our operations at Pilbara at full capacity, achieving record production in the second quarter of 53 million tonnes on a 100% basis. Our current Pilbara run rate therefore is in excess of 200 million tonnes per year. Demand in other markets, particularly in Europe and North America was weak and this led to production curtailment to some extent in the iron ore company of Canada.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead to 2010, we do expect to see some recovery in western demand and this will reinforce the strong market conditions that we expect to see continue in China next year. That said we would expect the current higher spot prices would expect to be revitalizing some of the Chinese domestic supply.</p>
          <p>In early June we announced the formation of a major iron ore production joint venture in Western Australia with BHP. I'm personally very enthusiastic about the value this opportunity affords to shareholders and I'm staying close to the process as we move forward.</p>
          <p>The source of this value for shareholders lies in the efficient development of the world's greatest resource provinces; from the optimization of resource utilization and the current and planned infrastructure development. And we would estimate the potential synergies to be derived from the joint venture will total in excess of US$10 billion in net pricing value. The combination offers great competitive advantages to both companies in the form of scale of the mineralization available, for potential future development and the complementary nature of the respective infrastructure systems.</p>
          <p>Currently detailed arrangements are currently being drawn up with BHP Billiton and we're preparing a joint approach to the various regulatory authorities. And subject to regulatory approval we would aim to finalize the joint venture in mid 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning now to aluminum, Rio Tinto Alcan was impacted by very difficult trading conditions as a result of the dramatic decline in demand and prices in the first half of 2009. Two key sectors in aluminum consumption, transportation and construction were strongly hit by the economic crisis. Combined with heavy de-stocking the aluminum market faced its sharpest contraction in demand since 1975.</p>
          <p>These conditions did take their toll on earnings. Nevertheless excluding the impact of non-cash items which mainly related to exchange movements on the balance sheet flowing through the P&amp;L first half EBITDA was positive.</p>
          <p>Unit costs have declined during -- they've lagged the price decline and were partly masked by the adverse currency movements. Cash costs have declined 27% over the last 12 months. And we'd expect further cost declines to come in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>At the end of the second quarter, the EBITDA breakeven position was about $1,350 per tonne and trending downwards. We have been aggressive in making substantive production curtailments at our higher-cost operations and we'd expect the 42% of our smelting capacity sitting in the upper half of the industry cost curve will have been curtailed, divested or idled by the end of the year. And this is in line with or better than our peers.</p>
          <p>Announcements to date include 12% reduction in total smelting capacity, 6% in alumina capacity and approximately 26% reduction in bauxite production from our Weipa operations. And I should highlight that these numbers are net of any new production such as the successful ramp-up of the Sohar smelter in Oman, which is one of the most energy and greenhouse gas-efficient smelters in the world, not to mention one of the lowest-cost producers.</p>
          <p>The integration of the Alcan business continued to reap benefits with $483 million of end period synergies, 28% above target. Many of these savings have been achieved in procurement through our increased global scale and pooling of purchases leading to lower prices for key inputs such as coke, pitch and caustic, even more so than the normal indexes for these inputs would have otherwise suggested. We have provided a reconciliation of how these synergies appear on the Group earnings in the back of your handout.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, with production cutbacks, an end to de-stocking and potential recovery in the construction and automotive sectors the aluminum markets will gradually rebalance. In the short run physical availability may be tight as a result of stock financing deals in the current inventory but, of course, we recognize the market will need some time for the overhang of stocks and excess capacity to be fully absorbed before higher prices can be sustained.</p>
          <p>I do believe the cost reductions, led by a new Chief Executive of Rio Tinto Alcan, Jacynthe Cote who is with us today in the audience as Jan has mentioned, are truly transformational. They will position Rio Tinto Alcan to weather the current economic crisis and emerge stronger when conditions improve, as certainly we've been seeing them improve as we move into the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We have introduced four major initiatives across Rio Tinto Alcan to drive improvements in the business. And the first, as I've said, has been to curtail, divest or idle 42% of our smelting capacity that sits in the upper half of the cost curve. And this includes one of our smelters in Quebec that was shut down at the end of April and our 50% stake in the Ningxia smelter that was sold to the Chinese joint venture partner.</p>
          <p>We've not been laggards in doing our bit to restore the health of the industry but since our relative position is one of the strongest in the sector we do not believe it's in our interest to cut back production that is cash positive.</p>
          <p>The second initiative has been to establish cost-cutting exercises across the entire product group. At some facilities the economic slowdown provided opportunity for an intensive six sigma and value improvement process to explore all options at reducing manning and reducing costs and optimizing project CapEx and optimizing returns. CapEx is on track for a 30% reduction in full year 2009.</p>
          <p>As noted earlier, in achieving synergies we took advantage of great procurement opportunities in the bauxite and alumina businesses and, of course, in primary metal.</p>
          <p>Third, for those smelters that are at the mid-point of the cost curve and have been marginal at or below $1,500 LME, we've responded with a combination of curtailments, not replacing pots and leveraging some of our owned power sales back into the grid.</p>
          <p>And lastly, we have been cutting hard into our G&amp;A to drive efficiencies across the Group and cut duplication of roles, many of which came in from the combination of Rio Tinto Aluminum and Alcan.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about costs. Costs for major inputs such as coke, pitch and caustic, which have already decreased by about 20 to 40%, are expected to drop further in the second half of the year. I would note that a relatively low percentage of our total energy costs are linked to an LME-priced contract, only about 16%. So as we see aluminum prices recover as we have in the third quarter we will reap the benefits on our costs without necessarily the additional cost linkage to power.</p>
          <p>I'd say that all these initiatives are starting to bear fruit with our hot metal cash costs showing a decline of 27% in the third quarter of last year and alumina showing improvement of 25% for the same period. And, of course, this is despite the strengthening of the Australian and the Canadian dollars during the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>With the recent recovery of the alumina price over the past few months, we look forward to a period of rising prices concurrent with cost declines, which should see our margins steadily improving and rising back to a profitable situation.</p>
          <p>In our alumina business, we believe we have the best set of assets in the aluminum sector and sources of competitive advantage in the form of our massive Weipa bauxite resource and competitive refining in Australia matched with low-cost hydro position available to us in Canada and, of course, supported by a proprietary and industry-leading AP technology. And these assets will provide shareholder value over time.</p>
          <p>I do fully recognize that streamlining and reducing costs in our alumina business is a key objective and it's exactly what Jacynthe and her team have been doing.</p>
          <p>Moving on to copper. While copper earnings fell sharply year-on-year due to lower average prices during the half we have seen a strong recovery in the copper and the moly prices as the months have progressed. It's somewhat of a welcome surprise to see copper price of $2.80 per pound and most recently moly pricing touching $18 per pound at this point in the economic cycle. This price buoyancy does reflect the inelasticity of supply, tight physical markets and strong Chinese imports.</p>
          <p>And we do recognize that these Chinese imports may include an element of inventory build and sharp contraction in scrap availability is also an important factor.</p>
          <p>Operationally the Group benefited from improving grades at Kennecott and at Grasberg and higher recovery rates at Kennecott. And I was particularly pleased over the course of the half to see the improvement in the operational performance at Kennecott and the higher recovery rates that we're seeing at Kennecott Utah Copper. These concentrate recovery rates are running above expectations.</p>
          <p>Of course, at Escondida recoveries fell due to lower grades and reduced milling rates. We have seen the mill Laguna Seca recover actually ahead of expected during the month of August.</p>
          <p>In our diamond business, which relies heavily on U.S. consumption, demand and prices have continued to be under severe pressure from the global economic downturn. So we've had to take some decisions to curtail production, both at Diavik and at Argyle and slow the development of the Argyle underground development.</p>
          <p>Preston Chiaro of course is here today and he's pleased to be here noting that energy and minerals was our best-performing product group with earnings up strongly, both with the sale of potash, of course, but even excluding the sale of potash operations still performed well showing a 13% earnings improvement over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>For clarity on this slide, we've stripped out the impact of the divestment of earnings on the table in this slide.</p>
          <p>Although our traditional coal markets in Japan and Korea weakened in line with the general economic climate, this was mitigated by stronger Chinese import volumes, both for thermal and coking coal. ERA continued to benefit from stable long-term uranium markets as legacy contracts continue to be gradually replaced by newer contracts written in an environment of higher prices. Production is also up 11% due to improvement in the ore grade and plant utilization and the commencement of operations at the laterite processing facilities.</p>
          <p>Volumes in our minerals and iron and titanium businesses were heavily impacted by weaker OEC demand, particularly in the U.S. housing and the general auto sector. But during the period, I was pleased to see the first shipment of ilmenite from our new mine in Madagascar and the processing of the slag in our facilities in Canada during the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>So now, we've covered the operations, Guy will speak from Australia to talk about the financials. Over to you, Guy.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody here in Melbourne and Sydney and good morning to you in London. Let me start with as usual an analysis of our half year's earnings which we've set out in the waterfall chart that you'll be familiar with.</p>
          <p>First-half earnings were impacted by a severe decline in prices, which lowered earnings by $4.7 billion compared with the first half of 2008. Most of the variance was driven by lower prices for aluminum, iron ore and copper. These reduced earnings by 2.2, 1.3 and $1.1 billion respectively. And you'll find in the back of your charts a breakdown of the price variance as an appendix.</p>
          <p>Now, some of the price decline was mitigated by a general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which the Group incurs its costs, particularly the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. This resulted in a benefit to earnings of $894 million.</p>
          <p>Moving on to volumes, iron ore and copper actually experienced higher sales volumes, thanks to the completion of expansions in the Pilbara, and higher grades at Kennecott Utah Copper and Grasberg.</p>
          <p>However, these were more than offset by production cutbacks at Rio Tinto Alcan, Alcan Engineered Products, Rio Tinto Minerals and Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium, all in response to the economic downturn. Overall the earnings variance attributable to volumes was a decrease of $294 million and again, a breakdown of the volume variance is included as an appendix to the presentation.</p>
          <p>Now turning to costs, that $166 million impact of general inflation on earnings was more than offset by lower energy costs, which benefited earnings by $187 million. Lower cash costs boosted earnings by $252 million, which I'm going to return to in a minute.</p>
          <p>Evaluation work at many of our advanced projects has been scaled back. The central exploration budget has more than halved following prioritization of expenditure. These measures assisted earnings by $188 million compared with the first half of 2008. In addition, we divested some smaller exploration properties, improving earnings by $61 million.</p>
          <p>Back in January, we announced the divestment of our two undeveloped potash properties in Argentina and Canada to Vale. And in line with our policy, the gain on disposal of $797 million has been recognized within underlying earnings. These three items together bring us to the total exploration and evaluation variance of $1,046 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, higher non-cash and one-off costs lowered earnings by $210 million, all of which brings us to the first-half earnings numbers of $2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the cost variances in more detail, you can see from the chart in this slide that our total cash costs declined by $3.6 billion between the first half of last year and the first half of this year. However, this variance includes the benefits from weaker exchange rates, lower fuel costs, other price driven costs such as royalties, and of course, lower volumes.</p>
          <p>After stripping out these uncontrollable costs and removing the beneficial effect of lower volumes between the two periods, we reduced our pre-tax operating costs by $770 million. We're therefore well underway to meeting our target, which we set in December last year of reducing controllable operating costs by $2.5 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>This amount reflects a wide variety of cost reduction initiatives across the Group, in particular reduced employee and contractor numbers and lower spend on exploration and evaluation projects.</p>
          <p>In the earnings waterfall chart, which is of course presented on a post-tax basis, the $770 million of cash costs savings that I've been talking about are mostly reflected in the $252 million cash cost variance and the $188 million exploration and evaluation variance that I referred to on the earlier chart.</p>
          <p>So as I just demonstrated, we've made considerable progress so far this year in meeting our operating cost reduction target. In head count terms, we've already exceeded our 14,000 head count reduction target by nearly 2,000 roles encompassing both contractors and employees.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, exploration and evaluation costs have been deferred and scaled back considerably -- this generated just under $190 million of post-tax cost savings compared with the first half of 2008. And as Tom explained earlier, we expect to see further cost savings in the second half of the year from lower input costs, particularly in our aluminum business.</p>
          <p>Another of our commitments was to reduce capital expenditure for 2009 from $9 billion to $4 billion. Now I should stress that this target was set back in December when the world was a much more uncertain place. The intention was always to adjust expenditure to market conditions while maintaining our growth options. So we did cut our first half capital expenditure by 22% to $2.8 billion. And we now expect capital expenditure for the full year to be around $5 billion.</p>
          <p>In the light of the improving economic climate, we're currently reviewing our capital plans for 2010. It's possible that the outcome of this review will be higher expenditure than the $2.5 billion sustaining capital expenditure level that we previously guided. And we'll provide more information about our capital spending plans at our investor's seminar in October.</p>
          <p>The success of our rights issues in July has meant that our net debt decreased by $14.8 billion after the balance sheet date that's being reported today. And back in April, we successfully priced $3.5 billion of fixed rate five and 10 year bonds enabling us to term out some of the shorter term debt.</p>
          <p>The rights issues proceeds were used in their entirety to pay down Group debt. Facility A and most of Facility B of the Alcan debt were repaid and in fact the remaining balance on Facility B has since been fully paid down. Adjusting the 30th of June net debt for the rights issue proceeds the Group's gearing has declined to 42% compared with 67% at the end of June. The ratio of our net debt to underlying EBITDA stands at 1.4 times, comfortably below the sole covenant in the Alcan facility agreement of 4.5 times.</p>
          <p>Our undrawn facilities and cash now stand at $10.5 billion. This comprises $2.4 billion available under Facility B following a $7.6 billion prepayment from the rights issue proceeds, then $5 billion on Facility C plus $2.3 billion of bilateral bank facilities and just under $1 billion of cash.</p>
          <p>The rating agencies have taken note of the positive impact the rights issues have had on our financial risk profile, our stronger liquidity and our lower leverage. So in July Standard &amp; Poor's raised its long and short-term credit rating from BBB/A3 to BBB+/A2 with a stable outlook. And credit markets have eased back with our five-year CDS now trading at approximately 170 basis points.</p>
          <p>So all in all the rights issues have been a resounding success and it's recapitalized our balance sheet and provided much greater financial flexibility going forward. I should add that the numbers in this slide do not include proceeds from divestments announced, but not yet completed.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the divestments in more detail. This week we announced the receipt of a binding offer of just over $2 billion from Amcor for the majority of the Alcan Packaging business. This is expected to close within the next six months and is evidence of further progress in our divestment program.</p>
          <p>We've made significant advances with the divestment program this year with $3.7 billion of divestments announced to-date, adding to the $3 billion of asset sales in 2008. Of this amount just under $1 billion completed during the first half that is the undeveloped potash assets and the Ningxia aluminum smelter in China. The Corumb&#xE1;, Jacobs Ranch and Alcan Food Packaging Americas divestments are expected to complete in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Last week we also announced the Form S-1 filing with the SEC in the United States for Cloud Peak Energy's proposed initial public offering. This is part of our divestment strategy for the Rio Tinto Energy America assets. And all these proceeds will further transform our balance sheet and provide additional financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>I've been pleased with the progress that's been made with the Alcan downstream businesses in the first half of this year. As I've said, since the end of June we've announced the divestment of Food Americas to Bemis for $1.2 billion and on Monday we announced the binding offer from Amcor for the majority of Alcan Packaging. The beauty division is to be sold separately and a process to do that is now underway.</p>
          <p>In our half year numbers we recognized a further impairment of Alcan Packaging of just over $500 million to reflect these realizable values. Given its reasonably defensive qualities, the trading performance of the packaging business has proved to be resilient.</p>
          <p>Turning though to Alcan Engineered Products, the situation is more challenging given the markets it serves. The business traded at a lost in the first half but it's recently seen some improvement. We've classified its results in other operations in our earnings release to reflect management reporting lines. And we continue to review our options with regard to engineered products.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the dividend, when we announced the rights issues on 5th of June, we also announced that the 2009 interim dividend would not be paid. We do expect to make a 2009 final dividend payment subject to satisfactory trading results, progress on divestments and prevailing market conditions.</p>
          <p>We also expect that the total cash dividend for the 2010 financial year will be at least equal to the total cash dividend payment made in respect of 2008 of $1.75 billion. Of course this will be distributed across a larger number of issued shares. And from that point on we're committed to the resumption of a progressive dividend over the longer term.</p>
          <p>Now back to you Tom.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Guy. In 2009 total capital expenditure is expected to be $5 billion of which approximately 2.7 billion is dedicated to development projects. In light of the current environment we're keeping a tight control on costs and are prioritizing our capital expenditures to focus on just the highest-quality projects. Elsewhere we seek to spend just sufficient amounts to keep our growth options in place for when market conditions improve.</p>
          <p>In the Pilbara our first priority will be to expand our mine capacity to 220 million tons per year to be able to align our production with our infrastructure capacity. And beyond that we continue to study the option of expanding capacity to 320 million tons per year. On projects reaching completion, we're making good progress on Clermont and expect to see first production in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>At Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia the investment agreement has been debated by the National Security Council and has now been transferred to parliament which opened up and is currently in special session as we speak.</p>
          <p>At Simandou we continue the 2009 work program on the southern lease where we sought -- secure over the entire lease. We're continuing again -- most of our resources are in that southern lease but we will continue to work with the government on the northern lease. We believe that the northern lease we have clear legal entitlement. So, of course, it's important to maintain the flow of future high-quality projects and we're maintaining a commitment to exploration, albeit at reduced levels, as a key long-term method to generating future tier-1 assets.</p>
          <p>It is very easy at a time like this to focus not only on the near term challenges and current market conditions. However these will pass and in the longer term the fundamental drivers or developing world industrialization and urbanization will cause our markets to grow rapidly.</p>
          <p>There's a great scope for substantial increases in demand for all of our products. And here that shows some projected scenarios just for aluminum demand. Our central case is for aluminum demand to grow by just over 4% over the next few decades. This represents the equivalent of one Saguenay system every nine months. This story will be repeated in all the commodities we produce. In iron ore demand growth will require an entire new Pilbara of both BHP Billiton and Rio's capacity every five years. In copper demand growth will require a new Escondida every year.</p>
          <p>This will be a challenge for the supply side as we keep up with this pace of growth, particularly as worldwide tens of billions of dollars of total project capital has been deferred this year by the industry since the start of the downturn. The long-run investment case for the sector, particularly those with asset lives capable of spanning this entire period, continues to be very attractive.</p>
          <p>So if I can summarize. Although lower, our first-half earnings were resilient in the face of challenging market conditions, reflecting the quality of our assets. There is evidence of recovery in China but the constraints of weak OECD demand will still take some time to abate. However we do expect to see the global economy stabilize and strengthen in the second half. Following our recapitalization, as Guy described, we have greater financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>I've set some priorities for the Group. First, drive operational improvements and cost reductions to improve our competitive position. Clearly turning around aluminum's performance is a key to this. Second, to complete the value-creating iron ore joint venture with BHP Billiton. And third, to pursue and deliver on our divestment program.</p>
          <p>From a more personal perspective I'm also committed to building our relationship with China which is of great importance to Rio Tinto. The past 18 months have been a challenging time for everyone at Rio Tinto and it's been critical for management to demonstrate leadership throughout the organization. I've been meeting with most of the MDs and will do so over the next few weeks and having numerous employee interactions all over the world. Part of settling back to the business of the business is ensuring all of us are aligned with a common set of objectives.</p>
          <p>I do believe the entire organization has performed exceptionally well in maintaining the focus on the business and delivering great operational performance at a challenging time. And I'm quite proud of how all of our people have persevered over the past 18 months. We do have a great team, great assets and a clear strategy, all of which deliver value to shareholders over time.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me hand it back to Jan for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Rob Clifford, Deutsche Bank. Two questions. Just firstly on your iron ore statement and the settlement of fixed pricing effectively for the rest of the year. At face value it appears you're taking the lower of either the benchmark or spot into China, whichever they choose. Have you any comments on that? And does that mean that you're getting some recovery of the defaulted contracts in the first half? And the second question is around aluminum. You talked about taking a bigger part in the future with the AP technology but we're seeing significant production coming out -- new production in the next 18 months, a lot of it gammy. The Chinese appear to have a significant competitor which looks to be a lot cheaper, if not quite as efficient. How do you think you stack up as a technology supplier in aluminum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rob. I'll take both of those. First of all on iron ore, during the first part of the year, particularly before the Japanese steel mill settlements, you had quite a gap between the spot prices and last year's settlement. And we did see quite a bit going into the spot markets at that time. And I think at this point we would be seeing -- again of course the Japanese, the Korean, the other non-Chinese business going into those long-term contracts. The bulk of the -- a large amount of the Chinese material going into the provisional pricing under those contracts. I recognize there's been an exceptional period of rising and falling prices in this period of time and again we've been selling to spot during low points. But last year remember we were selling to spot when spot prices were higher than the contracts. So I think it does depend on where you are at different market conditions. We're very mindful of the dynamics and the changing evolution of the iron ore markets but we continue to see most of the customers seeing some value to a benchmark type system, certainly the Japanese steel mills, the Korean steel mills have said there's value to that. And again the Chinese steel mills are taking all of the product that they can get at these particular prices.</p>
          <p>We do -- our provisional prices are at a number equivalent to the Japanese steel mill price and we do think that that reflects the supply and demand pricing condition at that time. Over the past just couple of days, past week or so you've seen spot prices dropping a bit. And to some extent that reflects the fact that steel prices have dropped off a bit, it reflects the fact they're probably coming out of the Indian monsoon -- people are expecting coming out of the Indian monsoon season. And I think we are seeing that supply reaction you would expect from domestic iron ore in China. So I think you are seeing the typical volatility, both up and down you'll see in those spot prices. And in the meantime we will continue to deliver to those provisional pricing to the Chinese customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you expect they will continue to pay that provisional price if the spot price drops below it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again we have seen I think for a good portion of the year while we've had those provisional pricing effect large volumes going to provisional pricing. I think on aluminum, again I'd like to just talk a bit about the technology but Jacynthe, with the benefit of you being here and you've got quite a bit of exposure over the AP technology, if you can say something about the AP technology compared to the Chinese technology. And while you're getting set up with a mike I just want to comment that of course I see from a corporate perspective an important place for innovation and research and development on a long-term strategy of any company we've had to cut our cloth according to our means this year so Jacynthe and the team have had to take some difficult decisions like we've done in exploration and other parts of the business to reduce costs in line with the economy. But again we do see the items like innovation, R&amp;D and exploration, these are long-term games that you can't just turn them up and you can't turn them off and then expect to get results at the end of the day. Jacynthe, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe a few words and without getting too technical, the AP50 brings about from a full economy cost about 15% improvement from the previous generation, the AP3X. So when we look at the full economy costs again comparing to the Chinese technology it provides not only full economy cost advantage but environmental advantage, clearly energy efficiency. And looking forward in the world that will be electricity under pressure for costs and in an environment which will be even more constrained for CO2 the AP50 technology brings tremendous advantage. And not only because of where it is now, where the level it is running now, but specially for what it provides a further platform to implement our drained cathode and eventually even further down the road the inner <mark type="indiscernible" />. But the drained cathode is running a plant test and it offers a benefit potential and a potential benefit of 15% to 20% energy efficiency. So beyond the AP50 what is critical about the AP50 is not only that current improvement but it's the platform it gives for the further breakthrough technologies.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jacynthe. I just want to add that on the AP we have the demonstration plant in construction at the Saguenay and like our other projects we've had to significantly slow down the capital cost to bring down our overall capital spending.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it is Nick <mark type="indiscernible" /> from Brewin Dolphin. Just wondering if you could talk a bit about debt capacity. How has the downturn changed your ability to raise debt going forward, what will the cost be and how are you going to think about debt in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, are you going to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nick. Look, I mentioned the rating that we have recently been upgraded by the agencies. And in the long run we want to see a higher rating than that because we think it will give us greater flexibility going forward. But at the moment we're seeing actually progressively more and more liquidity returning to markets. And I mentioned the level of our CDS. I think that clearly capacity is greater and it is especially there -- it is especially so because we have done so much to repair our balance sheet through the rights issue and also through these asset sales. So I think that -- I won't give you a number because I think we always want to balance the question of what we're going to do with that extra debt. But I think that we've just been in a place which was over-geared and we've taken very decisive action in the last 18 months and especially in the last six months to totally transform that. That is -- the transformation of the balance sheet has been a very important element in this result. And I think that clearly debt capacity is significantly higher than the present level, subject though to this longer-term objective of a single A rating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just follow up. What -- how are you going to sort of think about the maximum, about peak debt levels in terms of relative to history? Do you see it going back to a net debt to EBITDA -- ever going back to a net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 or -- and not necessarily around numbers but just -- I'm just trying to think about investments going forward and where you can get to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't really think about it like that. The way in which we think about it is to compare what the best use of our capital might be with the available liquidity that we have. And as I've said, we think that there is some value in the flexibility of a strong rating. We don't have a target gearing ratio, we don't have a target cover ratio. And the Board constantly thinks about this question every year as we draw up our financing plan. I think for the moment our focus is a cautious one, as Tom has described. We nevertheless are in a much more flexible position to make investments as we go forward.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jason Fairclough from Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch. Two questions if I may. I think they're probably both for Guy actually. First just on the carrying value of Alcan, are you comfortable with the balance sheet values there or is it possible that we still see some more write-downs coming through on Alcan? And second, just a question on tax. Could you give us some maybe a feel for the tax impacts of all these divestments? In particular I'm interested in the equalization payment that's going to come from BHP Billiton for the iron ore JV? But then also on the Alcan divestments are there tax impacts on those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dealing first with the holding -- the carrying value of Rio Tinto Alcan. This is something that we review of course like we review all our assets where goodwill is concerned regularly. We did that most recently in February and that led to the very large impairment that we took in February. We have not seen any triggering event that leads us to suppose that we need to look at that yet but because goodwill is involved we will look at it again later in the year as we will all the other goodwill areas and any other asset where there is a triggering event, either to make an impairment or to reverse an impairment. We have just taken an impairment in these numbers here as we foreshadowed on the packaging business of around $0.5 billion. Of course it's possible that we will take further impairments somewhere in the business, as it is every year. But do bear in mind that this is not something where we're marking our assets to market. We are taking a long-term view of the value of our businesses. And looking back over the last few years I can see cases where we did take impairments and then pretty soon afterwards had to reverse those impairments.</p>
          <p>And that was an experience which was not -- it was a salutary experience. As to the question of tax on the divestments, first dealing with the BHP joint venture, but that is progressing well, as Tom said. The basis upon which we are entering into this is that we pay no tax on any of that. This is not a taxable transaction. As to the Alcan divestments, the packaging divestment, part of this impairment reflects the fact that we will have to pay some tax, thanks to the structuring of the packaging disposals that we anticipate. And in fact many of our disposals will have a tax charge, although that was not the case with the ones that we completed in the first half of this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ephrem Ravi from Morgan Stanley. Two questions. Firstly on the proposed IPO of the North American business. Do you have a timeline in terms of by when you would like to get it done and what would be the -- what is the proposed Rio Tinto holding in the company after the proposed IPO? The second is on the diamonds business. The production shutdown at Argyle and Diavik obviously has kind of taken off a lot of volumes. I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense of the operating leverage given the significant drop-off in volume or is it something similar to what De Beers has seen in terms of cost per karat remaining same on a 50% lower volume.</p>

          <p>Guy, why don't you first deal with the Cloud Peak question and then Tom can pick up the question on diamonds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you'll understand in relation to Cloud Peak that we are in a quiet period and there is a very limited amount to what we can say. But what we have not said is how much of the business we're selling. We have given an indication of the proceeds of $500 million but that doesn't necessarily indicate either what the ultimate price of or percentage of or proceeds from the offering will be. On the timeline, we're getting on with this expeditiously I would say but I won't give a date at which we're likely to enter the market because of course that partly depends on market conditions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'd just want to comment on diamonds. Up until this year there had been a steady build of diamond inventories by the diamonteers and the various middle points of the supply chain. And I think that that stock actually has had to have been brought down before we see some rebalancing of pricing and supply -- and supply/demand. That certainly our production cuts will help others -will help in this period of time, but first and foremost you've got to see that stock of diamonteers come down quite a bit. And I think ultimately what we've got to really see is the consumer come back into the diamond market and although we've seen some of the white goods, the traditional engagement stones market beginning to pick up it still remains -- ultimately the ultimate discretionary expenditure and I'd hope to see as the U.S. economy pick up you see some more of those markets. And we want to be there with that. But I'd say at this time, it's probably a better position to reduce our production and wait for that.</p>

          <p>Hello, Lawrence Greg <mark type="ph" /> from <mark type="indiscernible" /> Proprietary Limited. I would like to ask a question about the Pilbara joint venture. I'm just wondering, if the authorities, the regulatory authorities were to block this Pilbara joint venture, are there substantial cost savings that could be attainable on a third part services-sharing basis with BHP Billiton please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll take that question. Yes, I certainly would not want to speculate on any outcome. I would say that we are working side-by-side with our counterparts at BHP Billiton. We plan a joint approach to the various regulatory bodies. Of course, we've got to go through the full documentation of definitive agreements before we can put that in place, but I'd say we're having those early stage formative discussions as we speak.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Tim Gerrard from Austock. Just one question. You mentioned about Tier 1 assets and how you'd like to continue to even refocus more on those. Can you just give us a refresher, something a little bit extra on the current definition of Tier 1? And bearing in mind, the answers of that how quickly could you look at disposing of things which are not Tier 1, presumably Palabora or Northparkes or diamonds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, if I may start on that but I'll ask Guy to follow up on that. Tim, there's probably certainly more than one definition of Tier 1assets. You've got to look at a combination of where it sits on the cost curve, generally we'd expect it to be first or second quartile, what is the long-term -- are these long-term resources, are they expandable resources. Even if they're not in the first or second quartile is there something about those resources that could cause you if your changes in technology or scale or something else to bring them into that particular area. And that really would be where our strategy's been focused around.</p>
          <p>And certainly over the past two years, we've identified a number of our assets which were definably not Tier 1assets that we put into the slate for potential disposal. And again, I think that if you look at what Guy's just spoken about we're -- we said two years ago $10 billion, we've certainly been affected by the weak economic conditions. But the deals completed, deals, transactions announced and the binding offer from Amcor total about 8.6 and as Guy said we still have more to do.</p>
          <p>We will always look at our portfolio as we always have looked at our portfolio and test that against the Tier 1 definition as we go forward. But Guy, if there's anything else you want to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that on the Tier 1 thing, one should not just look at where an asset is today, but ask the question by what means could it be transformed. And that could be by combining it with some neighboring asset. And that's exactly what we did of course in the growth that led to both the Rio Tinto Energy America to the Coal and Allied business and it is what we did with the acquisition of North and it's what we're trying to do with the BHP joint venture.</p>
          <p>And so there are some of those, where the beginnings -- it's certainly not true in iron ore, but it may be true in the others, where the beginnings were actually quite modest, but by combination they became very much more significant assets.</p>
          <p>And you can also change the business by investment or by other means. So one should look at the resource position and its capability to change. And we've got some great assets and great resources within Rio Tinto. But we've got to constantly clean out those that don't have all of those attributes and couldn't have them or where the difficulty in obtaining those attributes is too great. And so that's what led us to the last list of assets for disposal which you know of and where we're quite advanced in selling those businesses, as Tom said, for good prices.</p>
          <p>It's not necessarily the best time right now to sell assets. But having said that, the last 18 months has been the worst time to be trying to do that, and we've actually done quite well in the assets that we've sold, I would say. So I think that there's some element of the -- some interesting thinking in your question and it is one that we constantly debate ourselves.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, just one last point, just as Guy said, this is an evolving subject. 10 years ago, there's very few people who would have said Kennecott was a first-Tier asset. It was in the fourth quartile. People felt it had a short life. It had been over-capitalized. It was in the middle of an urban area. Challenges, challenges, challenges.</p>
          <p>Through a combination, I think, of some good work on the ground, through some definition of additional resources and optionality, and again, I think we did see the benefit of a markup in terms of some of the byproducts and bringing down its net cost. Most would consider that very much a Tier 1 asset. So these things do change overtime. Part of it is change in the market, but part of it is what we, as a Company, what management can do to make that change.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Clarke Wilkins from Citi. Just a question on iron ore. If you look at the run rate in the Pilbara at the moment, as you said, you're running basically at capacity. How quickly could you sort of restart some of the growth options there, given with the joint venture with BHP, if it does fall over, you may effectively be capping out at the 200 -- 220 million tonne capacity rate and effectively giving up market share, given the lead time for some of the projects up in the Pilbara?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Clarke. I'll take that. Again, as we've said, our mining capacity is about 200 million tonnes per year. Our infrastructure capacity is about 220 million tonnes per year, particularly on the successful completion ahead of time of the Cape Lambert last project.</p>
          <p>First and foremost, and we've recently sanctioned this with the iron ore team, would be to bring the mining capacity up to 220 million tonnes per year. And as we've said, we'll reserve, in tight capital conditions, spending of capital for those highest value projects, obviously matching mining capacity with process -- with shipping capacity is a high-value opportunity. So Sam and the team are underway with that as we speak. And that's a series of individual projects, mining projects, and some sort of infrastructure balancing projects to get that going.</p>
          <p>There are, as we talked about, opportunities to -- and the best opportunity really is the next expansion of Cape Lambert. And we've said that that's 100 million tonnes. And there maybe a couple of different pathways to get to that. It may not be just a single shot for that. And over the past six months, we've taken the opportunity, even though we've slowed down some of the projects. We have asked Sam's team and the engineers to look for ways to -- alternative ways to reduce capital, to reduce spending. We've seen capital indexes dropping in the Pilbara and looking for those optimal opportunities. And we will continue with that work. But I'd say first priority is to get our mining capacity matching our infrastructure capacity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Brendan Harris from Macquarie. I just wanted to talk about Simandou and get some thoughts there. It sort of seems to me as though you might actually be almost snookered. You're obviously battling to try and retain the license, but I assume if you do you'll be forced or willing to develop it quite quickly. On the flip side, if you lose it, I'm sure someone else will do that. At the same time, you've got significant invested capital in the Pilbara that's continuing to generate fantastic returns. How does it impact your decision-making, not knowing exactly what the outcome is for Simandou and the tonnages that you or someone else might actually bring to market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brendan. We spend quite a bit of time with Simandou. We've put a new Managing Director on the ground who has had a lot of experience in a prior career in Guinea. I just want to remind you that we have -- there's two leases in Simandou. There's really the northern track and the southern track. The resources that we've reported on a joint basis have been in the southern track. And there's really no question. Nobody's really been talking about whether the situation of southern track. The question has been on the northern track where we have been doing some exploratory work, but not at yet a sufficient stage to call resources or to define anything. So at this time what we are doing is we are focusing our drilling, our evaluation efforts, albeit at lower levels given market conditions, on the southern track while we're engaged with the government on the northern track. And I think that's appropriate in these circumstances. It's -- we certainly recognize, as we've long said, the quality of the ore at Simandou, it's a very high grade, low impurities. But, as we all know, it's a long way from the coast, requires quite a bit of capital for real infrastructure, and again, port facilities. Ultimately, we'll have to continue to develop and refine the resources, the mine planning, but create the economic and the business case for that ultimate infrastructure build to the coast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think -- thank you, Tom. I think we should go across to Guy in Melbourne. Guy, do you have some questions there? We're short of sound at the moment in Melbourne.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Neil Goodwill from Goldman Sachs, JBWere. Just three quick questions. Firstly, you mentioned your costs in aluminum by the end of the period were down to 1,350 per tonne and you expect costs to be lower in the second half. Could you give some indication of just how much flow you're talking about there? Are you talking about like 10% to come off yet or just some indication of that? And second question relates to iron ore. You seem to indicate that you were selling most of your tonnes on provisional prices at the moment, if I heard you correctly. Does that mean &#x2013; I mean basically you're not participating in the higher spot prices at all, and how do you see that progressing over the next year? And thirdly, just in terms of the 16,000 people that have left the Company, have they gone with asset sales or what capabilities, I guess, have you lost in losing those people? Just give me some idea of what they're actually doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. If I may, Neil, I'll start off with the iron ore question and the people question, and then I'll say a little bit about aluminum. But I think given that Jacynthe's here, and I've really been very pleased with what she's been doing in cost cutting in the first half, I'd like maybe if she could say a few words on what we're continuing to do, without giving, of course, any forward guidance in the second half. I think first of all, on iron ore, it has been an unusual year, everyone would recognize, on the pricing environment. We've gone beyond the stage that, I think, any of us can, in recent or even historic memory, can say the iron ore prices being unresolved. And I think it is appropriate to be selling on a provisional basis in this period of time. I do think that it reflects the fact that the benchmark is under a lot of pressure, and we'll see how it evolves going forward in the future. Ultimately, I do think that the customer will need to drive that, and we'll see how the customer drives that. From my own perspective, I don't see an acceptable solution where a customer can see the benchmark being option. The benchmark needs to be something that is a contractual relationship that is there for a transaction, independent of where the spot market would be. And certainly from our own perspective, we're watching the developments as they take place this year, with quite a bit of interest. And Sam and Sam's team are actively thinking about that very question, although I would say that, at this stage, the bulk of the activity would be delivering to our long-term customers on that provisional basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of people, this 16,000 represent people that are basically leaving the business through either contracts -- contractors being taken off or redundancies. This would not take into account people that are leaving the business through sales efforts. Whenever anyone, mining industry or any other sector, has to go through redundancies, it is a difficult thing. There's not only the personal question involved, but you've also got to deal with the loss of capabilities. And I do believe the systems and the organizations work very closely to ensure that it's being done both fairly, but in a way where we don't lose those capabilities and we have the ability to respond as we see the markets respond. But certainly, over the past couple of years, as markets were continuing to rise, we probably put on reflection, more people on, whether it's at an operating level or administrative levels than we would have had. And certainly we all recognize as part of the synergies that we would have expected with the Alcan transaction that people reductions would have been a natural expectation to achieve that 1.1 billion of after tax synergies. So I'd say these reductions are a combination of all of those. A good portion of these reductions wouldn't be affecting the operating bottom line because they were associated with capital projects. So as we brought capital cost down, you would see those come down, particularly on the contractor side. But again, we would be looking at, to the extent we are seeing projects coming back online, we would be bringing in contractors accordingly, but again, as we've said, only to those highest value projects. Maybe Jacynthe, if you can talk about aluminum costs and what we've done in the first half and your sense in the second half.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom. I will not repeat, I mean, what Tom mentioned in his presentation, but your question referring more to the next half. You've seen the chart on the raw materials. We had a lag effect, and we had to roll through our inventories. So you've seen we've been putting some forward looking continued cost improvement in the presentation, so that's one. SG&amp;A we've been driving very hard. There's still some of the cost to fall through the second half. And from &#x2013; I mean, what we've presented was not a cost result, was our breakeven EBITDA position, what's going to be also the trend in the second half of the year. We had very low sales of bauxite, very low sales of value-added product compared to the year before. We do see signs of market recovery which should also give some positive impact. All that is said with a lot of prudence versus currency, versus market conditions, I mean, but clearly from a raw material position, this is a robust position we are. And we've been negotiating price. And we do see that as very firm and solid in our bottom line in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Neil, just one last thing on cost again, because I do want to say that Jacynthe's been absolutely committed to cost reduction. She and I have spent a lot of time reinforcing the point that even though we're seeing prices improving quite a bit in the third quarter, frankly improving more than most would have expected in the third quarter, by no means can that be any excuse to take the pressure off cost reductions as we go into the second half.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig Campbell, Morgan Stanley. I have a couple of questions for you. With respect to the performance of Rossing through the half just gone, it seems to be quite weak and rather at odds with the strong performance out of ERA. Just wondering if you could run through what's really impacted that divergence and if there's anything there that we could expect to be ongoing. And with regard the Engineered Products, you said you have a number of options available. Just wondering if you could put more color around what those options are. Do you look to split off in smaller segments for an asset sale, or is the option that you're going to have to hold onto it for a few more years before you can realize an asset sale there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, do you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe if I can start with Uranium and Rossing, and then I'm going to turn it over to Preston for that, and then EP can be covered by Guy. I visited ERA just a few weeks ago and I saw the operational improvement there. I was quite impressed with what was going on there. And Preston, as Chief Executive of Energy, had been just visiting Rossing last week, so I think it's probably appropriate for Preston to talk a bit about what we are doing at Rossing and the difference in performance between Rossing and ERA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom. Rossing was affected by a number of issues. One is the timing of shipments to customers. We've had a couple of shipments that were scheduled early in the year that have now been deferred to later in the year. So we should see the pick up in revenue from that before the end of this year. The other issue at Rossing is that a lot of the consumable items are based on contractual terms that were set during -- when the economy was in much better shape. And we entered, for example, into long-term asset supply contracts. And those contracts will take some time to roll through so that we can start to see the benefit of lower prices on input cost at Rossing. The other issue at Rossing is that we have a heavy stripping burden ahead of us to expose ore, which is now present very deep in the pit. And so we had some increased stripping costs earlier in the year as well. Those costs will continue through the rest of the year. So we do expect in the second half of the year to, as I said, see the rest of those contract sales come through and that should pick up earnings quite considerably in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Preston. Guy, are you picking up the question on EP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me do that, Jan. It is true Engineered Products is having a very tough time. I think if you look in volumetric terms, it must be one of the hardest hit, if not the hardest hit of all our businesses within Rio Tinto, certainly in some of its divisions. The number of options we've been looking at carefully, as during this very difficult period. And one thing that we have concluded is that we should attempt to sell the business in pieces, having been unable to find any buyer who would pass cash to us for the whole business. A problem which by the way was shared by most other businesses last year. So for that reason we are actively engaged in sales of pieces, but they may or may not come about. We may not be able to find a sensible outcome to those. So, we need to look at other creative solutions, but let me assure you that it's absolutely not part of my plan that we hold this for a few more years. The reason being that this business good though it is, and it is a very good business, although under pressure at the moment. Is not we are not really the best parent for this business and we would prefer to deploy the capital somewhere else. But I can tell you we're taking terrific measures to put this business into a better place and that's -- we're taking very severe plant closures and redundancies on a scale, which is one of the most extensive in the whole Group.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Rob Craigie from FW Holst &amp; Co. I'd just like to, perhaps a question to Tom, confirm my understanding of your answer to a question from Neil in relation to iron ore pricing. I note that you've said that 50% of volumes in the first half were sold on a spot market basis. And I thought you said that the bulk of the sales currently are based on provisional pricing related to provisional benchmark. Can you confirm whether my understanding is correct, in other words, that perhaps you're not selling as much on a spot basis currently, as you did on average through the June half. And I know that the 50% of the sales in the first half on a spot basis, presumably that's across your total sales. But perhaps you can confirm that too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Rob. Just to again say that the -- and we've said 50% of business in the first half would have been on all sales would have been to spot. At present, as we've said, the large proportion of the current business is being done on provisional pricing, that provisional pricing being priced off the -- basically the Japanese settlements.</p>

          <p>No, it was a number for the whole half, encompassing as I said a number of things in the area of cost reduction, such as arising from people reductions, and also from the exploration and evaluation that I highlighted. There were also some other items. But you can't make a conclusion about the run rate. I would just draw your attention to the fact that this builds confidence towards the 2.5 target that we gave back in December.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Des Kilalea from RBC. Two questions. The first is can you tell us progress on Bunder? And then the other is a structural issue. You had, I presume, an opportunity to get more of Coal &amp; Allied. You had sort of small, you have minorities in certain other assets. Can you give certain idea what your strategy is for these non-wholly owned public assets?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may start on Bunder, but I think Preston if you want to talk about Coal &amp; Allied, you may. And I think that's -- just use that as a basis for talking about the strategy on these -- on those businesses that would not be wholly owned by Rio Tinto. Well, Bunder, just for those that aren't aware would be the diamond prospect in India. We have slowed down the activity, as you would expect in these current conditions. I mean if we're shutting down diamond production, if we're slowing down the Argyle development, what we're doing in Bunder would be consistent and complementary with that. There has been some lower-level work on the ground. I think we have some heavy mineral sampling that we'll be undertaking. It is really the first of the diamondiferous kimberlites discovered in India. And I think down the road it may be part of our diamond strategy. But I would say, at present diamonds like EP is one of the toughest performers in this particular market. And we're running that project accordingly. But I think Preston, if you want to talk a bit about Coal &amp; Allied. Thanks.</p>

          <p>It's Nick Hatch from ING. A couple of questions on CapEx and on the disposal program. First of all the additional $1 billion of CapEx for this year, can you give some sort of flavor of where that's being allocated? Secondly, you mentioned that you may reconsider increasing 2010 CapEx. Could you perhaps highlight what projects are looking the most attractive? I know you talked about Western Australian iron ore just now. And then in terms of the disposal program, you've got some residual mining assets that are on the list. Any news there? And lastly, would there be any potential to spin off on an IPO the aluminum Engineered Products business perhaps not in today's economic environment, but is that a realistic option?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I will perhaps take the two capital questions and then maybe Guy's best for the disposal and the IPO question. We had flagged back in December $4 billion, mainly sustaining capital recognizing some of the projects were coming down. But you may recall back in February, we talked about three projects that we saw value in continuing with being Yarwun 2, being Clermont and being Kestrel. And although we have slowed down those projects, particularly Yarwun 2 in this market, we have continued with those projects in this period. That's been on the basis, as Guy had said, of testing for the higher value projects. That's not to say that those projects aren't continually under review and they're not continued to be testing, but what we said back in February about those particular projects and the benefits of testing of those would have been reflective of the increase from 4 billion to 5 billion. And again, in this market where coal, particularly -- metallurgic coal, but also thermal coal quite a bit in demand. I think Clermont, as it replaces Blair Athol, and the Kestrel project, as it replaces the current mining faces of Kestrel do make quite a bit of sense. I visited both Clermont and Kestrel over the past month or so. And they are basically redefining those projects for these current market conditions. But they would be in that definition of near-term value. They are the types of projects that we want to keep looking at as we go forward. As we look at 2010, we are testing -- we're doing two things, first of all looking again at bringing all the sustaining capital down as low as we possibly can, keeping each of the business unit leaders working to bring down their capital, being mindful of process safety, being mindful of asset integrity, but bringing down sustaining capital down as low as we possibly can, keeping each of the business unit leaders working to bring down their capital, being mindful of process safety, being mindful of asset integrity, but bringing down sustaining capital. And the discussion we would have said earlier, that there should be a bringing down of sustaining capital to a lower level than 2009, would be relevant for 2010.</p>
          <p>But I still want to continue to look for those projects that bring high, definable, near-term value into the picture as again, the balance sheets improve through some of these organic opportunities, as Guy said, testing highest value to CapEx type of ratios as we go forward. A good example would be bringing the mining capacity in Pilbara in line with the processing capacity. If you've got a large capital base already built up and it takes a relatively smaller amount of capital to give you a kick in production, generally that's a pretty efficient use of capital.</p>
          <p>We'll look at other projects, I think, one in the copper area. We turned off E48 at Northparkes. That's one we'll look at as we study going forward. That's not that big in the scheme of things. But again, it has a high return in the context of the capital going forward. Down the road, we'll have to be looking again at greenfield type things. But in this environment, I would say that these types of brownfield step ups actually make quite a bit of sense.</p>
          <p>Of course, if we're successful with an investment agreement with Oyu Tolgoi, and we've made some good progress just even over the past few weeks, I would see us working with Ivanhoe and bringing that into its early construction makes a lot of sense in this particular market. I think Guy now on residual mining assets and EP.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the asset sales, you know what the list is, Nick, of assets that we originally slated for sale. And that's been supplemented on one or two occasions by new assets that have been put forward. And it's also, in one case, Borax, we have withdrawn an asset from sale. But the ones where we have not withdrawn, you can assume that a process of some kind has been carried out, is maybe underway. I'm not going to go into the detail of any particular asset sale.</p>
          <p>As regards the possibility of spins and IPOs and things like that, well, we've got a long history of using, from time-to-time, the public market, if that looks as if it's a better idea than using other forms of crystallizing value in an asset, or part of an asset. And the most recent example, of course, is Cloud Peak. But it's important to be creative in doing these disposals. And I think that we've shown that, and I think we will continue to show that as we look forward to the remaining disposals that we'd like to make.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Peter Davey from Ambrian. My question really is over the last difficult 18 months, what has the Group learned, if anything, from this period? I wonder if you might be able to share that with us.</p>
          <p>And then just a quick one, just to follow on an earlier question on the iron ore, the &#x2013; if for any reason that the joint venture with BHP, as proposed, does get blocked, is there any contingency plan that might allow for, say, swapping of assets, project, resources that might better align the two businesses if they stay separate?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, I think just from a personal perspective, over the last 18 months, as you rightly said no shortage of corporate activity. Some of it was what we initiated. Some of it had been initiated by others. And we have to be mindful of the fact that any company can go through that at any point in time.</p>
          <p>It has been a challenging time. But for my own personal reflections on this, a key part of it is about leadership. And we've got a large organization. We have 10s of thousands of people that all have to do their jobs. You have a very, very small percentage of that business that's actually working on those corporate activities.</p>
          <p>The majority of the people have to still go to work every single day, they still have to stay safe, they still have to deliver their production, they still have to deliver their costs, and they still have to do it as effectively and efficiently as possible.</p>
          <p>We've got to run a large, complex business. And we've got to deliver the results, which I believe we have been delivering over these 18 months. We've been giving the production. We've been getting the costs. And we've been doing it in a way that is safe and respectful of stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Right now, I look forward, and Jan and I have talked about this, as we move into the second half, we have the ability to entirely focus on the business of the business. And again, we have a great organization and people are &#x2013; you can say that they're a bit tired. They don't necessarily like seeing their names in the newspaper all the time. But they recognize, we have to look forward.</p>
          <p>Once we get out of this financial &#x2013; global financial crisis, the demand will recover. If anything, we're going to see some repeat of the period from 2003 to 2007 as basically that demand reemerges. And some of the supply response that had been kicked in place, had been curtailed in this period, has got to be scrambling to kick back into place.</p>
          <p>Now, it's very, very important that the organization, the leadership team, the management are all absolutely aligned with what we need to do as a Company and keep driving the business forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I add to that, Tom that the fact is that in the last 18 months we've certainly done one or two things which, with the benefit of hindsight, we would have preferred not to have done or perhaps not done quite in the same manner or possibly at the same price, of course.</p>
          <p>But I can tell you this, and I say this is sort of the newcomer to this organization, that the mood and the change &#x2013; the change in atmosphere in the organization since early June is virtually tangible. And I think the whole of Rio Tinto today, and I'm not talking about Tom and the Executives sitting in front here, I'm talking about people a few layers down the organization, I think there is a tremendous desire to just get on with rebuilding the business to continue to look for value as we take the Company forward.</p>
          <p>And that's not to suggest that we didn't make some mistakes in the last two years. But frankly, people are tired about the last two years. They want to look forward. And so I think this organization today is just a much, much better place than it was in the past 18 months to two years. And we're all very pleased about that. And I think this guy next to me is more pleased than anybody that he can actually go back to being a Chief Executive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I do want to just &#x2013; the one on the iron ore joint venture, if I may, Peter, I think what we should be entirely focused on, both ourselves and BHP Billiton is completing the iron ore production joint venture. I don't really want &#x2013; well, I don't think we need to speculate on the what ifs because we have a good relationship. We have lots of individual work streams. We have work streams on the administrative, getting the final definitive agreements, work streams on working together with the regulators, work streams on ultimately what the integration plans will be. They are very closely aligned. They are both equally committed to getting this thing done. And that's exactly what we should be doing. This is not the time to speculate on the -- what ifs. This is the time to just get on with getting this joint venture completed.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Tobias Woerner from MF Global. Just one question quickly, and apologies if it has been touched upon. I came a little bit late. It's with regard to aluminum. And aluminum, we have, most of us probably in this room have real price chart going back about 110 years. And this metal has never, ever delivered. And you've given some reasons in the past why it could have its day in the sun, so to speak. And I understand those. But have you reassessed post the latest credit crunch and the adjustment in capacities in this industry, what the long-term drivers of this metal are and whether there is a change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, do you want to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to make a comment on that, but again we have our Chief Economist, Vivek, here. I'd like maybe if Vivek could say a few words on that. Clearly aluminum, like any other, is going to be affected by supply and demand. You've got to really test where the supply will be coming from, where the demand will be coming from. I think aluminum is different from copper in that you don't have the same scarcity of the bauxite resources you'd have for the copper resource. Where aluminum would be different from copper, as another example, would be the fact that you can increase capacity by putting capital into it, which is actually a negative one compared to copper. But the positive one compared to copper or some other metal is it's incredibly energy intensive. So you've got to take a view on energy. Is the energy -- is the world going to be in energy surplus or the world going to be energy short in the future, completely independent of the question of supply and demand of bauxite or the availability of capital into the sector. And my own view hasn't really changed in the energy space over the past two years. Certainly over the past 18 months we've seen a move from energy -- electricity deficits to electricity surpluses.</p>
          <p>But at that permanent situation, I suspect not. I think as we look forward, as the economy recovers, you're going to see again moving into that energy deficit environment, and that's even before you start to put the overlay of carbon pricing, which ultimately will play into the picture. Ultimately those lower carbon sources of electricity feeding aluminum will be beneficial. These are long-term views. But again, and we've got to survive the short-term, obviously that's why we've got to do everything we can on cutting costs, which is exactly what Jacynthe and her team are doing. But from a long-term perspective, the view on energy hasn't changed that much. But Vivek, if you want to say anything, quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think Tom has actually covered the main points. Long run, we expect significant energy deficits to prevail in countries where currently aluminum is produced most expensively, not <mark type="ph" /> only in China. We expect the RMB to appreciate eventually, once the current global financial crisis is past, and that will affect Chinese costs positively, and therefore prices. And ultimately we don't see the global problems associated with electricity going away. Clearly, we've seen the world's greatest recession in several decades, and it's not surprising that prices of metals have come off in particular of aluminum. But Tom has discussed the long-run picture, and that really hasn't changed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. It's Glyn Lawcock with UBS. Jan, I just thought, given you're here, maybe you've talked a bit about the company and what's happening at the company level, but could you talk a little bit about what your priorities are and perhaps what changes, if any, you're thinking from a board perspective? And then secondly, just a question as well about China and volume. I'm just wondering if you could provide me with some comfort that you're not experiencing any ill effects on your volume front due to the employee events in China. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, you can pick up the iron ore question in a moment. Glyn, look, from my perspective, first of all, given that I've been Chairman for all of four months, I think in the period of four months, the organization has indeed already seen quite significant change through the various announcements in early June, so when we announced firstly the iron ore joint venture, together with the $15 billion right issue. And I think that whilst I don't want us to sound remotely complacent I do think that in a strange way what this organization at the moment does not need is considerable change, because I think this organization has gone through a difficult time in the last two years. This organization for the most part wants to go back to some stability to continue to do the things which I know the Executives needs to do. With regard to the Board, I think that I -- I think it's an important point to make that if we look back at the things that we're all aware of over the last 18 months to two years, I recognize that sometimes there's an inclination for people to hold one or two specific Executives responsible for all those decisions. Of course, ultimately, I've got to tell you, the buck stops with the Board. And as Chairman of the Board, I tell you, the buck stops with the Board. And therefore I think possibly people will expect me to bring in one or two additional Directors onto the board in the course of the next year.</p>
          <p>That will certainly be my plan. We've got some excellent people on our Board, but I also think I've always been a great fan of regularly bringing corporate people onto a Board. In my previous role at British American Tobacco, where I will be standing down in two months' time, I have, in the five and a half years I was there, on a regular basis, every year, brought in one or two additional people. So I've always been a great believer in regular fresh thinking at the level of the Board. And I think that's all I really want to say for the moment. I say again, I think that this organization is in a much better place today than it was some time back. And I now want to give the Executives the time and the space that are required to get on with running the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Glyn, just talking about the volumes into China, and I'll just talk about iron ore and quickly coal, and anything else we're selling on a day-to-day or monthly scheduling basis, we have seen no effect on the volumes. We continue to sell full volumes. We're at full capacity in our iron ore business, and our coal business is running really at full capacity, to the extent that we're not meeting the demand and because it's lower demand in the traditional Japanese and other Asian markets. We're selling those additional tonnes into China.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, in that case, it's been one hour 45 minutes, so maybe it's time to close. Can I just conclude by saying to all of you, not just here in London, but also in Australia, thank you very much for joining us? And we look forward to talking to you again in about five months' time. Thank you.</p>
