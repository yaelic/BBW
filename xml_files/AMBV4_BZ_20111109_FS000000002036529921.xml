          <p>Good afternoon, and thank you for waiting. We would like to welcome everyone to Ambev's Third Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call.</p>
          <p>Today with us, we have Mr. Jo&#xE3;o Castro Neves, CEO for Ambev; and Mr. Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the safe harbor of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Ambev's management and on information currently available to the company.

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Maureen, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to be with you today to discuss our 2011 third quarter results.</p>
          <p>Before I start, I just would like to remind you that, as usual, the <mark type="ph" /> prospective (1:54) changes discussed during this call are both organic and normalized in nature.</p>
          <p>Normalized figures refer to performance measurements, before special items, and special items are either income or expenses, which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the company. As normalized figures are non-GAAP measures, we disclose our consolidated profit, EPS, EBIT and EBITDA on a fully reported basis in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>I will start the call by sharing a brief overview of the quarter, and then Jo&#xE3;o will provide you some overview of our results in Brazil, HILA-ex, Quinsa and Canada. I'll close by providing more specifics regarding the third quarter financials.</p>
          <p>Turning to the results. During the third quarter, our consolidated EBITDA was close to R$3 billion, which represents a 13.5% organic increase when compared to the third quarter of 2010, while our margins expanded 110 basis points to 46.3%. Our Brazil EBITDA increased by 13.3% in the quarter supported by a 9.9% revenue growth and EBITDA margin increasing by 150 basis points to 49%. Our Latin America South operation delivered during the quarter volume growth of 2.3%, while growing EBITDA by almost 25%.</p>
          <p>In Canada, beer volumes were almost flat and our margins increased by 190 basis points, mainly due to lower costs year-over-year. As a result, our EBITDA increased by 6.2%. Normalized profit reached at R$1.65 billion in the quarter, which was 9.5% lower than last year's same period and normalized earnings per share declined by 9.9% in the quarter. I'll comment further on profit at the end of this call.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand it over to Jo&#xE3;o as we start to look a little deeper into the results of each of our operations. Jo&#xE3;o?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jamel, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone.</p>
          <p>Starting with the industry evolution in Brazil even facing a tough comparison against the third quarter of 2010. Beer industry volume growth has improved. In the other business, HILA-ex and Latin America South, the industry was also positive, driven mainly by economic recovery, while Canadian industry is still recovering at a lower pace.</p>
          <p>Going deeper into Brazil, our beer volume growth was 1.7% in the quarter, impacted by a better industry and a 69.6% average market share in the third quarter, which is our second best ever market share for the beer business. And it represents a 150 basis points increase since the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Our beer net revenues per hectoliter in Brazil increased by 8.4 this quarter mainly as a result of price increases and a higher rate of direct distribution. Of course, partially offset by higher taxes, mainly the excise federal one.</p>
          <p>Our innovations are sequentially increased in their share and helping to drive both market share and brand preference gains. Today, they represent already more than 10% of our total sales, and we are pleased with the performance of Antarctica Sub Zero and Skol 360. Both liquids have helped the mother brand to rejuvenate by bringing them new attributes.</p>
          <p>We also introduced a new Brahma can in S&#xE3;o Paulo, the Copa&#xE7;o. The Copa&#xE7;o has a removable lid, which provides a much larger than normal opening and is designed to give the consumer the experience of drinking from a glass but with the convenience of a can.</p>
          <p>We'll keep our focus in the premium beer. Stella Artois now growing at the rate of more than 200% in 2011, driven by significant growth in brand equity and better execution.</p>
          <p>We also launched a Budweiser in four presentations initially, the 600-ml returnable glass bottle, the 12-ounce longneck bottle, the aluminum bottle and the 350-ml cans.</p>
          <p>Bud sales in the first two months have exceeded expectations, and although they will not be significant for 2011 results, we expect Bud to play an important role going forward to help the segment to grow ahead of the mainstream beers. We keep the investment capacity expansion and flexibility for our plants in order to guarantee our nation-wide rollout for some of our innovations.</p>
          <p>Now, talking about our cost of goods sold. Brazil beer cost of goods sold per hectoliter was up by 4.1% in the quarter as we were negatively affected by higher packaging and raw material cost, partly offset by better currency hedges and an easier comparison due to the import of aluminum cans in 2010.</p>
          <p>Beer SG&amp;A, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by 6% in the period as a result of higher distribution and marketing expenses as well as general inflation, partially offset by our cost initiatives and lower admin expenses. Our capacity expansion year-to-date has already reduced the extra impact of the logistic costs, and we expect the new Pernambuco brewery we just start operating to help even more our results in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Normalized beer EBITDA finished the quarter with a 14.8% growth versus same period last year, and EBITDA margin expanded by almost 200 basis points.</p>
          <p>Moving to CSD and non-alcoholic, non-carbonated business. Our volumes in Brazil delivered a 6.4% growth in the quarter as a result of industry consolidation and industry conditions. And 70 basis points of market share gains is a result of strong investments behind our brands and the new returnable glass bottle from <mark type="ph" /> GuaranaTask (7:25).</p>
          <p>Net revenues per hectoliter is back to positive growth of 1.3% in the quarter as a result of price increase, which was partially offset by excise tax increase and a negative mix. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased organically by 2.4% due to better currency hedges and particularly better sugar hedges for this quarter, partially offset by higher packaging costs.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A excluding depreciation and amortization increased by 15.6% in the period, mainly as a result of phasing of commercial investments and higher logistics costs, partially offset by lower administrative expenses and cost initiatives.</p>
          <p>We're able to deliver a 6.1% EBITDA growth, driven by a 7.7% revenue growth, partially offset by a 70-basis-points margin contraction.</p>
          <p>Turning to HILA-ex, volume increased strongly by 12.6% in the period, mainly as a result of industry recovery in the region and market share gains in some countries. However, we delivered negative organic EBITDA growth of R$6.2 million, mainly because of higher logistics cost and general inflation.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Latin America South, we achieved a 24.7% EBITDA growth as a result of strong revenue management and volume performance. We are enjoying market growth mainly in Argentina and Chile. Our market share has remained stable in the region, and we continue to focus on the strong support to our mainstream brands and innovations in the beer business.</p>
          <p>As examples, we launched nationwide Quilmes Bajo Cero and the non-alcoholic variety Quilmes Lieber. We also launched Brahma widemouth in Argentina and Pace&#xF1;a Black in Bolivia, among others.</p>
          <p>We heavily supported our main brands in the region through strong communication and our robust innovation pipeline. Our beer net revenues per hectoliter grew as a result of price increase in line with inflation and effective trade spend management aimed at maximizing our  top line. The premium segment continued growing with Stella Artois' strong performance being an important source for volume and profitability growth in Argentina.</p>
          <p>Our soft drinks business increased its volume by 1.7% due to a slight market growth, but also influenced by the Twister brand launched in Argentina, a non-carbonated flavored water. Price increases were introduced in the industry to offset severe cost pressure. We will continue to focusing on revenue management initiatives and innovations to keep recovering our margins.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost and expenses, we continue to experience higher cost of raw materials, labor and inflation. We're suffering increases in beer commodities and packaging materials. Cost increases in soft drinks included sugar, PET, juices and others. We keep working hard on implementing cost-cutting initiatives to overcome these cost pressures and maintain our margins.</p>
          <p>In spite of this cost pressure, we have been able to deliver double-digit EBITDA growth in Latin America South in both beer and soft drinks, as a result of strong revenue performance and continuous efforts to achieve higher efficiency levels. In summary, LAS once more delivered solid EBITDA growth and strengthened further our brands as we continue lead the way in the premium segment whilst strongly supporting our mainstream brands.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Canada. Labatt had a strong third quarter with 1.7% growth in net revenues and 6.2% growth in EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2010, mainly as a result of better industry performance, price and strategy, and strong fixed cost management.</p>
          <p>The Canadian beer industry was roughly flat versus the third quarter of 2010, continuing the trend showed in the second quarter. We continue to invest behind Budweiser and hockey, Canada's most popular sport, as well as in the new marketing campaigns for Bud Light and Keef, all of which are showing promising results. We have also increased our reports (sic) [support] (11:02) behind our value brands to get our fair share of the segment.</p>
          <p>Increased brand health and positive share momentum generated by these campaigns plus our disciplined price strategy have almost increased our net revenue per hectoliter by 1.8% versus the third quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>COGS decreased by 2.9% versus last year, while SG&amp;A, excluding depreciation, decreased by 2.7% in the quarter due to the timing of our marketing investments and saving in distribution.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we continue to work on maximizing our market share and profitability equation in Canada. We'll also look for opportunity to increase price across selected markets to offset any effect from the current inflationary environment in Canada, while we continue to execute against our new focus brand campaigns and Budweiser and hockey to strength our positive momentum in brand health and market share.</p>
          <p>We mentioned the overall business, I want to wrap-up by saying we're pleased with our consolidated results to-date, we prepared ourselves for a tough year volume-wise and we're able to take advantage of better industry performance this quarter through pricing strategy and cost management initiatives, among others. We delivered 13.5% EBITDA growth this quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking into the different business. In Brazil beer, we expect to deliver the best margin expansion for 2011 in the fourth quarter as we have an easier comp due to the highest impact of 2010 imported cans and logistics costs in the same period of last year. In soft drinks, we'll focus on top line growth through our innovation rollouts to improve our market position while working on revenue management to protect our profitability.</p>
          <p>In LAS, we again delivered solid EBITDA growth, and strengthen even further our brands, as well as continue to lead the way in the premier segment as well as investing in our mainstream beers.</p>
          <p>In Canada, industry volume trend has improved, and we will keep investing further in our focused brands to drive top line growth, and pursuing further cost savings opportunities.</p>
          <p>Finally, HILA-ex, we continue to grow volumes ahead of the industry and remain on track to deliver our long-term strategy in the region.</p>
          <p>Finally, I want to thank our people, our most valuable asset, their ownership culture and sense of urgency were key in delivering these results year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to go back to Nelson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jo&#xE3;o.</p>
          <p>In this final section, I would like to guide you through the main items between the normalized EBIT of R$2.6 billion, and profit of R$1.65 billion, as disclosed on page three of our release. Our net finance results were R$306 million negative, which is R$354 million worse than last year. This is mainly explained due to unrealized foreign exchange translation losses on intercompany payables and loans following the BRL depreciation.</p>
          <p>This impact is economically offset by the foreign exchange translation gains on offshore companies reporting in dollars and in Canadian dollars that are registered directly into shareholders' equity.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate in Q3 2011 was 26.7% compared to Q3 2010 rate of 22%. And this increase was due to a difficult comparison with third quarter 2010 because of one-off tax benefits we had last year.</p>
          <p>The year-to-date decrease in the effective rate is mainly due to an increase in tax incentives and other tax adjustments. We expect to deliver an effective rate for the full year pretty much in line with last year.</p>
          <p>Our next cash position was around R$1.3 billion in the third quarter compared to net cash position of R$200 million at the end of the end of December 2010. And during the third quarter 2011, we announced R$2.35 billion in dividends and interest on capital to be paid on November 18th.</p>
          <p>Finally, we remain committed to our CapEx plan particularly in Brazil where we invested R$2.1 billion year-to-date as we do see it critical to seize the growth opportunity in beer industry moving forward.</p>
          <p>I would now hand it back to the operator and open up for questions. Maureen, could you please help us?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] The first question is from Alan Alanis from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much, and congratulations for the results. I have a couple of questions. The first one is more of a technical question regarding these losses, these FX losses. Could you give us a little bit more color regarding the nature or the amount and the amount of these intercompany payables I assume there are with ABI?</p>
          <p>And after you do that if you could remind us the comparative economics of the import brands of ABI in Brazil, which as you mentioned, 200% growth in Stella Artois and Budweiser are ahead of plan. How does the profitability of these brands compare with your local brands? Or what is the agreement that you have there with ABI?</p>
          <p>That would be my first question and I have one follow-up after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Alan. Thank you. It's Nelson here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all with regards to the FX losses, we are only talking here, of course, about intercompany transactions within ABI &#x2013; sorry, within Ambev &#x2013; but it's ABI as you mentioned. So we've seen Ambev, we have pretty much exposures in our intercompany transactions with Canada and Argentina and also in dollar terms within companies in the group.</p>
          <p>So, in that sense the total amount of these intercompany transactions were equivalent to around $1 billion in terms of exposure. And this exposure breakdown is pretty much about 10% to pesos Argentines, 40% to Canadian dollars and 50% in dollar, which is related to our malting plants, where the functional currency is dollar.</p>
          <p>So if you think of a normal FX rate variation, these wouldn't be significant in our result. So just for you to have an idea of the methodology, we are talking about, if you take R$0.10 per dollar FX rate change a year, which would be around 5% if you can consider asset devaluation or depreciation. This would imply less than R$25 million of non-cash financial result impact in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The problem is in Q3, because of the extreme volatility we had in the financial markets, we had a R$0.30 per dollar &#x2013; which is around 20% <mark type="ph" /> of the allowed (18:19) depreciation just in three months. So that's what explains this impact on our financial result, which again, is a non-cash impact, as the negative impact in our financial result is offset &#x2013; or there is an &#x2013; automatically linked to an equivalent impact, which is taken directly to our balance sheet <mark type="ph" /> ICTA (18:46) on our shareholders' equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the second &#x2013; on second part of your question, it does &#x2013; as I said, it doesn't refer to anything in terms of our transactions with ABI.</p>
          <p>But specifically on the import brands we have, like Stella Artois and now Budweiser, of course, whether they have more of a premium positioning. So we have a higher price to consumer. But for us premium positions are not only about premium price but also premium markup and premium EBITDA contribution. So the EBITDA contribution of these brands into our bottom line is higher than what we get with our mainstream, local brands, owned brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear. Very useful. One last follow-up but for Jo&#xE3;o. We &#x2013; I don't know Jo&#xE3;o if you saw a report we put out recently regarding the cans versus glass growth of beer consumption in Brazil. And we've talked with different industry participants and everybody seems to agree that the vast majority of the beer consumption in Brazil in the last five year has been coming more via cans rather than glasses. What are the strategic implications for your business going forward? And are you addressing this and also gaining share in cans via the innovations? But I would be interesting to listen to your thoughts in terms of how do you see the Brazilian beer industry evolving specifically from a packaging standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yes, of course, indeed, we know, we saw the report. I think in terms of direction, it's of course correct. I think the intensity doesn't necessarily reflect the intensity of our own numbers. Of course you have the best mix of the industry, but we know of some of the other players, we have a view that, especially the one that was sold now, has a more of a returnable mix rather than a one-way mix. And then the other two are much more geared towards cans.</p>
          <p>I think there's been a direction to this, not again to the intensity that the report reflects, in our own opinion. But given that we agree with the direction we decided to focus a lot in the past two years, in making the returnable presentation more accessible to our consumers. So you are seeing this about &#x2013; with the liter, you are seeing some of this in a way with the pitstops in the off trade so that we can give the consumer that goes to the off trade the chance again to go back to returnables.</p>
          <p>One thing that helps us in some manner &#x2013; and you are very familiar with this example &#x2013; is Coke has also been doing this now for eight years in the soft drinks, putting back in the marketplace the 1-liter, the 1.25-liter, the <mark type="ph" /> PRBs (21:50). So you are seeing a growth initially, especially in the off-trade, one to four checkouts, okay. But then you're starting to see some of that also in the off-trade five-plus checkouts.</p>
          <p>So by doing that, I think, during 2011, that the slope of the curve has changed for sure for Ambev. But because Ambev is an important participation in the mix of the industry has also changed the slope &#x2013; so &#x2013; towards a more healthy curve, if you want, for the next few years.</p>
          <p>So our goal as a leader is to provide consumers, which we think they want, and we are seeing that in other beverages, occasions. We think that's happening. The trends are there and to a certain extent we can impact that shift by offering them in occasions and in price points what we think may be more convenient for them.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Jo&#xE3;o and everybody. My question's about your second last statement in your comment, in your press release, you're basically saying that your EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter is going to be year-on-year even better than during the third quarter. And I guess, looking at last year's fourth quarter the volume comment is understandable, you have much easier comps. But in terms of your SG&amp;A last year, had been down year-on-year et cetera. So are we &#x2013; is this &#x2013; how comfortable are you with making this statement at this point? And is it based on a price increase, which we haven't really heard confirmation of when and by how much you raised prices in October or whether you waited until &#x2013; or you're going to wait until Christmas, et cetera? But any color on how you're going to achieve this given the essentially tough SG&amp;A comparison that you have versus last year? That would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi, Jose, it's Nelson here. Let me start the answer and then I think Jo&#xE3;o can also add on it. But on everything that we control of course it's much easier to make a forecast and for sure you already mentioned the fact that we have an easier comp with regard to volumes, since last year for the full year we grew more than 10% our beer volumes, for instance, and our last quarter we just grew between &#x2013; around 3.5%.</p>
          <p>And on top of that as you mentioned, there are two important elements. One is the easy comps we have on COGS because of mainly the impact of the imported cans we had last year. For you to have an idea, around 75% of the negative impact of the imported cans we had in 2010 was in Q4. So that of course something that we know is an easy comp, so we have full control of that. So that's going to be an important driver for the EBITDA growth. As well as the fact that our logistic costs that had increases last year and we still saw this, especially in the first half of this year, it's getting better quarter-after-quarter. In Q3, it was already better and now in Q4 those also going to be better given all the footprint enhancement that we have in our current scenario, right.</p>
          <p>So these are two things that are under control, such as cost related internal size, easy comps. So that's the first thing that they give us the confidence to go or to have a better result than the one you already had in Q3. And by the way, it's not different from what you've been kind of guiding since the beginning of the year, even when we think of our COGS per hectoliter indication, we said COGS per hectoliter being line the completion for the full year. And you know that in the first half, we're growing high-single digit. So of course for the balance of the year to be much lower that we stick to our guidance.</p>
          <p>I think that's not &#x2013; on the cost side, I think you can comment on the top line about, well, what give us confidence on the Q4 result.</p>

          <p>To be quite honest I think Jamel covered most of this. I think we have the lot of things "coming against us." Fourth quarter last year such as the logistics cost, the imported cans on the VAC, so VAC under pressure, VLC under pressure, volume deceleration also in the fourth quarter. So it was a combined bag of issues. Expected, but they made the comp easier, so I guess we also mention that at the end of the &#x2013; [pause]</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That was an amusing comment Jose. Okay. Now I was about to say this, but then I changed my mind, so luckily the call was cut off. Given I have some more time to think about this, no, I mean, I was just saying that everything was sort of against and now everything's sort of in favor. And I was about to say that also at the end of the first half, we mentioned that we expected a better second half. We had the best quarter of the year in the third quarter and we expect to continue to be that way because all the cost inputs from VAC to a VLC standpoint are coming better. Plans are coming to fruition as the fourth quarter starts.</p>
          <p>And the volume has &#x2013; in the third quarter that has picking up. Some of that trend should &#x2013; we hope that to be in place. If just the volume continues to be there even in the same time that we saw it, given that everything else is a better off just by maintaining that we should be in a much better position and that's why we said &#x2013; we feel that both in terms of EBITDA growth and margin expansion especially, we should be okay in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>Okay. Great. And if I can have a quick follow-up &#x2013; saw Bloomberg recently saying that you prepaid your 8.75% notes due 2013, any plans to refinance those or just taking that altogether, the cash, and leaving the balance sheet as is for now?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jose. It's Nelson, indeed that's one &#x2013; let's say &#x2013; step as part of our overall capital structure management. You see that in Q3 &#x2013; between Q3 and Q2 right, I mean, our gross debt was pretty much flat. For Q4, we expect something like this because of course &#x2013; we are prepaying this debt, this notes you mentioned, we also have been new funds that we are raising for instance, BNDES loans to support our CapEx investments. So pretty much, we expect that growth debt and to say pretty much where it is by the end of this quarter as well.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. First is a historic question actually. Can you remind us when in 2010 in the fourth quarter your started raising prices and when you wrapped that up, I remember it was very early &#x2013; unusually early, and I can't remember if it was all wrapped up kind of by the first week of October or what. Can you remind us on that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Celso, I mean we don't like to get into that &#x2013; on the specific data too much there, but in general, we moved price in the fourth quarter. It's true that it was slightly sooner last year and one of the reasons to be slightly sooner, you remember that during 2009, 2010 we were pretty much for the whole time very close to capacity.</p>
          <p>And one of the reasons for anticipating a little bit was somewhat due to the capacity we also had postponed launch of some new packages and new brands because of that, to focus on what we already had. And given that we don't have that issue any longer we went back to the more traditional movement during the fourth quarter. So it's happening as we speak. It's different back-by-back, region-by-region, but it's happening during the fourth quarter, in line with our long-term strategy of being in line with the inflation to find the right mix between per capita growth and maintaining the sort of profitability that we aim and look for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but just since it's an historical question, not really a current question &#x2013; my understanding was that last year was done as much as a month to month-and-a-half earlier, is that a fair assumption or not &#x2013; just so I can have a sense of profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I think the historic level, by answering the question, I mean, therefore I mean we maintained the historical behavior of being consistent with prices in line with inflation during the fourth quarter and, you are right, I would say more towards the month than a month-and-a-half, as you mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fine. That's helpful. Thank you. Just &#x2013; it really just helps with context, and some other revenue drivers. On the soft drink side, if I could ask another question please, you had mentioned I think over the &#x2013; on the early part of the year the assumption was COGS per hectoliter for Brazil beverages roughly in line with inflation along with the long-term goals, with Brazil beers slightly better and soft drinks slightly worse than in line with inflation?</p>
          <p>And then I think you revised that, maybe in the last quarter or a few months ago, with soft drinks doing a little bit better and therefore in line with inflation in it. So I was quite a little bit surprised with this quarter's COGS per hectoliter. Should we be thinking maybe now about even an upside of risk or benefit that COGS per hectoliter for soft drinks could also be below inflation for the year along with beer? Is that possible or is there something I am missing for the fourth quarter in terms of comparability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Celso, it's Nelson here. I think you properly picked up the devolution of our expectation of the COGS per hectoliter for soft drinks. I mean in the beginning of the year we did &#x2013; we had a more conservative view especially because in soft drinks as you know, we have less of an ability to hedge our exposures in commodities, particularly in PET, which I'm not able to have different strong beer where we pretty much had the important things like malt, aluminum &#x2013; for the aluminum cans in dollar, and CSD do have a less of predictability in this rate. So what we saw in the course of the year especially on PET, rate is that the commodity price was going down of course it started to benefit from that.</p>
          <p>Particularly in Q3, that's the only element, we have to watch out that we have even favorable hedges on sugar we had &#x2013; if you look at the commodity curve, we didn't have a window there for a sugar price really down somewhere in Q3 last year and of course it took advantage of that and given our hedging policy locked, even sugar at a lower price than the previous year. So we had the less, it was one-time benefiting sugar hedges, which not only be the case in Q4, so we should have for the full year CSD for sure in Q4. We should have COGS without the same benefit we had in Q3. But again, and you take everything year-to-date, it could have done to something slightly below inflation in soft drinks and the overall Brazil COGS growing in line with inflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Within soft drinks, can you give us &#x2013; dimensionalize for us maybe the returnability impact on COGS, i.e. low expenses potentially associated with returnable bottles? What percent of your volumes now are returnables in soft drinks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it seems small, because it has not really taken a big sales &#x2013; sorry, it has not taken a big impact in our COGS. What really drives the impact that is of course dollar-wide currency, PET and sugar. And of course, we have lows and upsides when we have a quarter of higher volumes where everyday we dilute of the fixed cost and the other way around, when <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:59) didn't help us. So, the returnable mix impact is still very, very small in soft drinks.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. My question relates to what you expect or how you're thinking about industry growth in Brazil for beer, I guess next year as you always have been mentioning that the minimum wage increase, and talking about opportunities in the North and Northeast of Brazil, just curious cycling some easier comps, looking into next year, but also looking at your growth rates in 2010. Curious how you're thinking about either for you or the industry what type of growth should we expect to see flow through?</p>
          <p>And similarly on the pricing side, I know you're not specific about your pricing initiatives, but how do we think about your actions this year, should we expect anything next year with respect to tax increases something that's going to affect, I guess that volume price mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Lauren. Well, first of all, I'll just mention that we like to stake most of our beliefs and whether sort of guidance we give as we progress towards the end of the year in the announcement of the fourth quarter results. So I'll be a little bit open on the specifics giving our guiding policy.</p>
          <p>So for the extent that I can mention, I think from the pricing standpoint and the prices standpoint is always a very important lever. I think 2011 was a very good year in terms of showing that we can make choices, okay. We went for more growth from a volume perspective and then maybe somewhat less price, but in both cases, achieving important or significant EBITDA growth. And 2011 was somewhat the opposite, where pricing discipline and pricing initiatives as well as cost management was the main lever in terms of top line growth.</p>
          <p>I think on an overall comment, potentially 2012 has everything to be a good mix of price management, so maybe not 2010, maybe not 2011, so maybe somewhere in the middle. And the same thing goes for volume. So one thing of course we will talk to, to the next and what should be a potential positive addition to this is the growth of the premium segment which we didn't focus so much during 2009 and 2010. That combination of us not focusing but also the consumer with less disposable money in their pockets; they were looking for different situations. We are seeing that change towards 2012 which is in line with our own internal objectives of growing the premium segment. So if we can have a more balanced price and volume equation for 2012 and add on top of that this premium focus based on a very strong premium strategy, and we are seeing some of those results already in the third and will probably &#x2013; most probably see in the fourth quarter, get us excited with the perspectives for 2012.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; so that's pricing a little bit of volume and you actually mentioned some of the things that make us motivated for the future. I mean, in the short-term &#x2013; I'm talking about 2012, not the Olympics and the World Cup and things like this. We see our strategy in the North East North, the NANO region, the NANO strategy working &#x2013; I mean gaining share, volume growing above average, some of the programs in terms of liquid innovation, package innovation, but also new news in terms of events and trade programs. There is a nice combination that is working for us in the North East, North region that will continue for sure for 2012. That combined with an overall impact of the minimal wage increase put us on a chance of having a good momentum back in 2012 in terms of volume which, again, may give us good options for us to exercise now not from a micro perspective, but from a market perspective &#x2013; from an external to internal situation. So that's a sort of as candid and as open that I can be about pricing and volume perspective given our guiding policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful and also if I could just ask, InBev actually made a comment this morning or answered a question with respect to the Budweiser launch in Brazil and how it's going, so just curious to get your read on that and expectations for carrying that through next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think Brito mentioned some of the early &#x2013; very early impression, which we can only really give an early impression in terms of the volume and then re-ordering that was mentioned.</p>
          <p>From our end, the perspective is, as from Alan's questions, I mean premium brands will mean premium mark up and that's already happened in the marketplace. So we are happy with a result. I mean it took us more than a year &#x2013; year and a half to put the brand in the marketplace. It's what's worked. I mean we localized or topicalized if you want our value base brand approach to Brazil. With the great times are coming we are saying it does slightly change, because I mean great times are coming to Brazil in terms of World Cup in terms of Olympics. So it's a good way to position, very good test and initial acceptance in terms of the liquid, we were the first ones to simultaneously launch in Brazil also the new visual brand identity, which is a much more modern and fills a lot in the Brazilian consumer research, so very good link with the consumers from a liquid standpoint. We saw that in the research and are seeing that in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Form a emotional standpoint, yet to be seen but the initial reactions were positive so I mean I think it was a good thing that we took the right time to rightly position and the good thing is now it gives us a very strong portfolio from a premium perspective with Original, Bohemia, Stella and Bud. I mean we feel very good about that combination with different positionings not really overlapping too much so we are excited about the current situation, the current volume but even more what we think it can do to us during 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First I wanted to ask today &#x2013; during the ABI's conference call there were some comments on cash allocation maybe looking into next year as ABI reaches their leverage target. And those comments were in the order of ideas of trying to prioritize maybe whether they would first give dividends or share buybacks or emphasizing to any kind of further M&amp;A. Could you perhaps help us understand at the Ambev level if you can prioritize maybe those cash allocation decisions similarly? And secondly I have a question on soft drinks which I'll make next.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure. Hi, Antonio, it's Nelson. Well, in terms of our use of cash of course our priority is to invest in good business opportunities and we have been doing this. I think the best example is what we have been doing in terms of increasing capacity and then increasing CapEx in Brazil. But of course even after that we've been generating a strong free cash flow, which we have been consistently paying out. And if we look into the last year, it's a very consistent track record of dividend yields around pretty much the same level between 5%, 5.5%.</p>
          <p>And then I'm including here, which is our primary source of returning cash to shareholders, which is the interest on capital, given its tax advantage here in Brazil, that's what they want to always do first and prioritize to the limit. And on top of that we normally complement with dividends. According to our bylaws, we always pay minimum 35% of our net profit. Of course, we have been doing much more than this, and this is pretty much the sort of, let's say, behavior we have been &#x2013; or how we have been tackling our excess cash if you will. So of course difficult to speculate for the future but we don't expect any change for that moving on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's useful, thanks. And secondly, I was wondering if you could help us understand a little bit the dynamics of the market share gains that you've posted on soft drinks in Brazil recently. Perhaps, could you help us understand how much on a per channel basis these gains are coming from? I understand the introduction of returnable bottles has been very important and it's mostly focused on the modern trade. So perhaps, if you could help us understand if you are also seeing these kind of gains in the traditional channel, that would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Antonia, this is Jo&#xE3;o. I think what we said in the beginning of the year is given that we had what we think was a successful strategy in implementing innovation, putting to the marketplace a healthy pipeline of innovation that we had both in terms of liquid innovation and package innovation.</p>
          <p>We're learning a lot also what we saw in other markets, but also even in Brazil in the soft drinks scenario either from ourselves or from competitors, we're able to reflect that in the beer strategy on a successful manner. Growth in 2009, 2010, options in 2011, we thought it was time for us to sort of also put in the marketplace, a healthy pipeline that were developing soft drinks, to make &#x2013; to change our position in the game so that we could be not just &#x2013; we have more options in terms of exercising our market position. In order to do that, we thought it was important to develop a combination of also liquid and packaging innovation.</p>
          <p>So we mentioned about introduction of Guaran&#xE1;, one liter bottle in the beginning of the year, but we also mentioned about the new fruit H2OH! that we launched, about the <mark type="ph" /> Citrus (47:10) product that we launched, about Fusion. So I mean we put a lot of new products in the marketplace. We're very, very happy with some of them. And they are an important part of the game here.</p>
          <p>And also the revamp, also, if you want or the right new CBD positioning also for the Pepsi brand.</p>
          <p>So the result so far, you're right. I mean, as you start those launches, the off-trade has a much more important place in the soft drink segment than in the beer segment, so this is more than 50% of the market. So any launch has to be successful in that segment to last. You are seeing the liter returnable in some of the cities &#x2013; and starts to focus in the beginning always in the off-trade, but more on the one to four checkouts, very successful.</p>
          <p>So I would say most of the things we did, they are able &#x2013; with the combination of Guaran&#xE1; one liter having reached its all-time share on overall, but especially in the Guaran&#xE1; segment, not just because of the liter bottle, but we have reached all the best preference and brand health indicators for the Guaran&#xE1; Antarctica brand ever we saw.</p>
          <p>So that combination of a much healthier, much younger brand being supported by new packaging and then the overall portfolio being supported by new brands. That was a very powerful combination that worked for us in the third quarter, both in terms of share, which was in a way, one of the main initiatives or one of the main strategies for 2011, but protecting the profitability. So that's sort of the combination.</p>
          <p>We think there is more to do even in the off-trade, even before focusing on the trading, on the routes. We actually are doing slightly better. We had an objective of also growing on the on-trade. We actually reached that objective sooner then we expected. But we think there is a lot more to do on the off-trade and continue to change, but at a lower base the situation on the traditional and on the on-trade.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jo&#xE3;o. Hi, Nelson. My question is regarding the Pernambuco plant. Basically how is it doing? In the ABI release, they mentioned some delays in the startup due to some <mark type="ph" /> heavy rains came. (49:43) Can you confirm that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, indeed we had some delay on the go-live of the plant. The fact is we lost pretty much one month &#x2013; a little bit more than this, according to our original plan. But the good news is that we already started the production <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:03) the ramp-up period, which was &#x2013; which is also a period where we have lower productivity, less volume coming out of the lines.</p>
          <p>But it's an important step for us, thinking of what Jo&#xE3;o just mentioned, in terms of our focus in the North and Northeast region. There we have been pretty much increasing capacity in four plants. Important investments we did in the last 18 months, plus this brand new brewery in Pernambuco. So we are really, I would say, equipped to deliver on our plan moving on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you confirm when you started the plan &#x2013; the Pernambuco plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We started this month, beginning this month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also you mentioned some SG&amp;A &#x2013; extra SG&amp;A expenses due to the delay. Can you also confirm that and maybe give us some color on the amount of it &#x2013; on the extent of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have an impact, of course, due to the delay of the plant. It's going to be one of the most important plants for us and &#x2013; in our footprint.</p>
          <p>And of course, given there's uneven growth that we've been talking, right, for a while about this here in Brazil, right? Our footprint is not yet optimal to cope with this uneven growth in the North and Northeast regions. And we incurred extra logistic cost.</p>
          <p>That was still the case in Q3. It's fair to say. Of course, it has been worst in the past, if you look into our SG&amp;A in the way we have been reporting this on a quarterly basis. We have been always saying that we expect to have a much better footprint that we &#x2013; especially from this fourth quarter onwards.</p>
          <p>But it was much better than Q3. I think we're going to be in a &#x2013; I'll say close to an ideal situation as we start 2012. But in the end, it meant some extra cost on our SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>The good news is that we have been working also all the levers, right, that we have at our hands. And we took an important, let's say, approach to our fixed cost, right in the beginning of the year, when we saw a soft industry, top-line not growing as fast as we wanted. And I think to preserve profitability, and I think we have been successful in this, we took the right cost reduction measures.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we have SG&amp;A totally under control, and we saw margin expansion in this quarter. I think it was even above the market expectation, given everything that's going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very clear. And regarding, lastly, the tax benefit in &#x2013; by investing in the regions, is it fair to assume that we could expect a lower ETR going forward because of the launch of the new brand? Or are you already being benefited by the plant, even though you haven't &#x2013; before starting to operate it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the &#x2013; we have &#x2013; every time we invest in this region, we always discuss and can get fiscal benefits based on the VAT <mark type="ph" /> LAS be (53:15) on the &#x2013; on some income tax incentives in the region. So of course as we invest &#x2013; or as we have been investing more in this region, this of course will flow into our effective tax rate.</p>
          <p>And that's why, for instance, it has been indicated that the &#x2013; for the full year, we should have an effective tax rate around 21%, 22%. Against, let's say, a weighted average corporate tax rate of 32%, 33%. So that's also a part of the equation.</p>
          <p>Of course, in there, there are also the benefits of the interest on capital payment that I mentioned and other tax benefits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Nelson, I got that. But by the fact that you're starting to operate the plant just this month, does that &#x2013; would make any change in your tax benefit in the region or not? It's just a matter of the fact that you're investing in the region? You see what I mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no change. There was a very &#x2013; a small delay and there is no impact on the overall number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Your next question is from Gustavo Oliveira, UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jo&#xE3;o and Nelson. Good afternoon, everyone. I have first a question on the beer growth in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Were you actually positively surprised by the growth we saw in the industry in the third quarter? Knowing that in the second quarter actually, the industry was pretty weak, and your volumes in the second quarter were very weak. And most of the Brazilian consumer companies are reporting weak growth in the third quarter or a deceleration. Were you positively surprised to see that?</p>
          <p>And within that same question, what has been the trend in growth month-over-month in the third quarter? Were you seeing an acceleration or a deceleration in growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. What happened this year and has happened in other years, we're usually few &#x2013; or one of the first ones to feel the pressure of, let's say, some sort of a slowdown in the economy.</p>
          <p>So I think we mentioned in the first quarter, we were one of the first companies to mention that volumes were slowing. Everyone was surprised. And then you saw in the second and in the third, a lot of other sectors in the industry also slowing down.</p>
          <p>So usually, we are the first ones to feel that there is a slowdown, but we're also usually the first ones to feel that there is a pickup. Okay? So I think that's why you saw us maybe with a tougher volume &#x2013; from a volume perspective, with a tougher situation in the first quarter and then getting better as we progressed toward the third.</p>
          <p>And I think when you look at the Central Bank's strategy of the interest rate cuts, I think it was a combination of global economy slowdown worries, but also trying to, once again, give some momentum to the Brazilian economy. And we started to &#x2013; saw that already in the third quarter. I think that's basically it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the growth trajectory actually is accelerating during the quarter, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're not mentioning anything about the fourth quarter in specific, but just trying to give you a trend. We saw the slowdown before everybody else, and then we're seeing this pickup maybe before some other sectors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Within that context, you mentioned that you had a CapEx of R$2.5 billion for Brazil in 2011. You already invested R$2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Do you think that you would anticipate CapEx from 2012 into the fourth quarter already? And therefore your CapEx &#x2013; your real &#x2013; actual CapEx is going to be higher than your original guidance? Or does it make sense to do that? Or most of your CapEx for the year is really done and you don't have to accelerate CapEx in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as you said, it was important for us to &#x2013; in our &#x2013; in case of our CapEx. to make the investment as early as possible in the course of the year, so that we can get ready for Q4 when it really counts.</p>
          <p>So it's very difficult for us to speed up investments in Q4, because when you have the breweries fully focused on production to deliver the volume required in Q4. And given seasonalities, it's a stronger quarter for us. So, so far, we are pretty much tracking or trading in line with the plans for the R$2.5 billion, full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last question, again back to the Brazilian soft drinks business. If I understood well from the previous questions, in the fourth quarter, the cost per hectoliter is going to be a little bit heavier than it was in the third quarter. And in the third quarter you didn't have any operating leverage.</p>
          <p>Should we expect another margin contraction in the fourth quarter on the EBITDA level? And perhaps if you could help us understand also in the third quarter why you didn't have operating leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the third quarter, you mentioned about the operational leverage. Well, the main reason in the third quarter where we saw the margin contraction was mainly because of SG&amp;A growth. And that was part of it, linked to the volume growth.</p>
          <p>But the main reason was phasing of our commercial investments. And if you see, our SG&amp;A in Q3 increased around <mark type="ph" /> 15% (59:07) but then Q2, it was down by <mark type="ph" /> 16% (59:08) SG&amp;A cash, right?</p>
          <p>So the major reason why we saw in Q3 a margin contraction was very good gross profit, let's say, or gross margin expansion, but some tough comparison &#x2013; or some tough comps in terms of phasing of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:24). So if you look year-to-date, the effect of course is not there.</p>
          <p>For Q4, we should have, as I said, our worst performance in terms of gross margin expansion because cost per hectoliter should grow instead of the decline we had. But then it should have extended more into a normal level. So although we are not giving any specific guidance on margins, on Q4 numbers, I think the overall trends we saw year-to-date <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:57) in soft drinks should remain for the balance of the year.</p>
