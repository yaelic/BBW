          <p>Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to the FEMSA's Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded and all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Company, we will open the conference up for questions-and-answers after the presentation.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, management may discuss certain forward-looking statements concerning FEMSA's future performance and should be considered as good faith estimates made by the Company. These forward-looking statements reflect management expectations and are based upon current available data. Actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties, which can materially impact the Company's actual performance.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would now turn the conference over to Javier Astaburuaga, FEMSA's CFO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everyone. Welcome to FEMSA's third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Antonio Fern&#xE1;ndez and Juan Fonseca, as always, join me today.</p>
          <p>Before we begin our discussion of FEMSA's third quarter performance, let me begin by briefly addressing a topic that is on everyone's mind these days. As you all know on October 1, we published a press release that reads as follows. In relation to recent press reports, FEMSA confirms that it is in discussion with several parties to explore opportunities involving its beer business. However, there can be no assurance that such discussions will lead to any definitive agreement. This statement continues to reflect our position regarding this matter for which we currently have no further comments. And even though we understand your great interest, we would appreciate it if you refrain from asking questions on this subject during the question-and-answer session. Thank you all.</p>
          <p>Moving on with the purpose of this call, let me begin by saying that we're encouraged by our results for the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2009, particularly in light of the challenging economic situation. Even when taking into account a sluggish business environment and GDP contractions that reached the high single digits in Mexico, our results continue to show a remarkable resilience.</p>
          <p>Once again, we faced foreign exchange headwind across most operations, and we continue to deal with the high cost for many important raw materials given that some of our hedges are still in place at high price levels, particularly in our beer business.</p>
          <p>However, Brazilian volume performance and robust pricing combined with sustained expense containment initiatives across our integrated platform allow us to deliver a strong set of results.</p>
          <p>In terms of business highlights for the quarter, Coca-Cola FEMSA delivered strong numbers driven by solid volume growth in sparkling beverages in our Mexican operations, still beverages across our markets, and the further integration of the Brisa water business in Colombia.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, FEMSA Comercio delivered margin expansion at both the gross and operating levels as we continue to improve our market coverage, our value proposition and in doing so, strengthen our competitive position.</p>
          <p>At FEMSA Cerveza, we again note the resilient consumer trends in Mexico, as volumes grew moderately in spite of robust pricing and a still depressed economic environment. On that front, we continued to see a stark difference in the performance between the still sluggish manufacturing-heavy Northern Mexican markets and the Central Mexican markets.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, we successfully continue to implement our expense containment initiatives across our beer operations and we are reaping the results as operating expenses grew only about 60% of total revenue growth. In terms of FEMSA's consolidated results for the quarter, operating income increased 27% during the third, and below the operating line were recorded a smaller impact from foreign exchange losses than recent years &#x2013; in different recent quarters. As a result, net majority income increased 25% compared to the same period of 2008.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet front, our position continues to strengthen driven by cash flow generation in all of our operations, particularly in Coca-Cola FEMSA. As of September 30, our net debt-to-EBITDA coverage stood at only 0.7 times, with close to 90% of our debt denominated in local currencies, mostly Mexican pesos. And in terms of debt maturities, we have refinanced all our remaining 2009 maturities and have only minor maturities coming up in 2010 and '11.</p>
          <p>Now let me elaborate on the results of each operation briefly, starting with FEMSA Cerveza. In terms of consolidated volume during the quarter, we were able to deliver growth of 1.3% due to a strong increase in our export market and moderate growth in our Mexican market. While we again saw a small decrease in our Brazilian operation, the trend continues to improve relative to our performance of the first half of the year in that market.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, significant economy and unemployment-driven headwinds continued putting pressure on our beer business. Yet, we're very encouraged by our moderate volume growth in such an adverse environment. And while we realize that our growth has underperformed that of the industry in recent months, we feel firmly relieved. The reasons for these are not structural, but are rather largely driven by both the upsizing strategy being rolled out by our competitor, as well as by the regional underperformance of consumer demand in our Northern markets versus that of Central Mexico.</p>
          <p>According to our estimates, the volume shifts, driven by our competitor's current upsizing campaign should taper off during the first quarter of next year as the numbers become comparable in the second.</p>
          <p>In our exports, volumes increased 12% over a very strong 10% growth in the same quarter of 2008, outperforming the U.S. beer import category by a significant margin. According to the Beer Institute, our brands are outperforming the end category by 14 percentage points year-to-date, as of the end of August. During the third quarter, our average price in dollars rose almost 7%, mainly driven by price increases in Tecate and by positive brand mix shifts from Tecate to Dos Equis.</p>
          <p>And in Brazil, volumes contracted by 3.9%, lapping a tough comparison of 8% volume growth in the third quarter of 2008. This contraction shows an improving trend over the first and second quarters as we have tweaked our mix of pricing and volume, and our expectation is to return to a more balanced revenue growth equation going forward. Summing up, total revenue increased 30% during the third quarter for our beer business.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, raw materials pressure persisted as we anticipated in previous conference calls. COGS per hectoliter increased a little under 15%, continuing the trend from previous quarters and reflecting the depreciation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real as applied to our foreign currency costs, combined with significant brand pressure on higher aluminum prices across our brewing operations.</p>
          <p>However, as was the case in the first half of the year, we were able to partially mitigate the impact of the depreciation through dollar forwards we contracted at attractive levels for a portion of our dollar requirements. Gross profit increased 10% for the quarter, but gross margin contracted by 120 basis points.</p>
          <p>At the operating expense level, once again, we saw selling expenses grow, remaining below revenue growth. Even as we continued to increase marketing spending in the U.S., particularly behind Dos Equis, achieving a sustained level of brand awareness and volume momentum for the brand.</p>
          <p>As we had anticipated and discussed in our previous conference call three months ago, some incremental marketing expenses were scheduled for the second half of the year, and as a result, the growth in selling expenses during the third quarter was higher than that of the first semester.</p>
          <p>In spite of these, our aggressive rationalization efforts allow us to more than offset the pressure coming at the gross profit level and expand our operating margin by 70 basis points. Income from operations at FEMSA Cerveza, in the end, posted a solid increase of almost 20% for the quarter. Let me take a moment to reflect the water beer operators have achieved thus far this year, we can't help, but be encouraged by the numbers.</p>
          <p>Nine months into what will go down as one of the worst years in recent macroeconomic records, particularly in Mexico and the U.S. facing high commodity prices and unfavorable foreign exchange, we are seeing only a minor volume contraction, revenue and operating income growth approaching double-digits and a stable operating margin.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead of the fourth quarter, we will be lapping price increases in both Mexico and the U.S. and therefore should benefit a bit less from pricing than we have thus far this year and we should have a smaller impact from foreign exchange, both in our costs as well as in our U.S. revenues, as we lapped the period of most significant shifts in the value of the Mexican peso late last year. And we will continue, definitely continue the deployment of our marketing strategy across markets as originally planned.</p>
          <p>For 2010, we anticipate a combination of factors, although still at high level of uncertainty on the development of a number of warrants. We expect to see moderate GDP growth in Mexico. However, we believe unemployment level will remain high, particularly in Northern Mexico with its consequent effect on the demand for our products.</p>
          <p>We should see lower prices for grains across our markets and for aluminum in Brazil, which will help to partially offset foreign exchange headwinds and potential incremental taxation in Mexico. And we definitely plan to maintain our rationalization efforts as we continue to strengthen our brands and our competitive position in every one of our markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to our soft drink business, Coca-Cola FEMSA delivered yet another quarter of solid double-digit revenue and EBIT growth on the back of strong organic growth driven by both pricing and volumes, particularly for sparkling beverages in Mexico and still beverages across all of our operations.</p>
          <p>We continued to see pressure on the gross margin, largely driven by the effect of the depreciation of local currencies as applied to our U.S. dollar-denominated raw materials versus 2008 levels, higher sweetener costs and higher cost of concentrates in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Operating income increased 24% while our operating margin contracted by 100 basis points. If you were unable to participate in Coca-Cola FEMSA's conference call yesterday, you can access the replay over the webcast for additional details on the results.</p>
          <p>And finally, at FEMSA Comercio, same-store sales were up close to 3% in the quarter, reflecting higher traffic with the average ticket remaining stable. As was the case in the first half of the year, even though we already lapped the introduction of prepaid electronic air-time, consumers that used to purchase typical air-time cards continued to shift to electronic purchases, such that we still see some of the distortion that has been present in our numbers for several quarters, although the impact is significantly lower with each quarter that goes by.</p>
          <p>As a result, for comparability purposes, if we booked the full amount of the electronic recharges as opposed to only the margin, average ticket per store would have grown in the low-single-digits.</p>
          <p>In terms of store base expansion, our long-standing efforts to flatten the curve of store openings more evenly throughout the year resulted in also adding 183 net new stores during the third quarter, not quite as many as last year, but well on pace to exceed our objective of more than 800 new stores for the year.</p>
          <p>On the innovation front, we are pleased to inform that for the first time ever, our consumers can now pay for their extra purchases with credit or debit cards across our entire store base, which should help drive incremental traffic on average ticket going forward.</p>
          <p>On the operational front, revenues increased close to 15% during the quarter. Gross margin improved 180 basis points, driven by more effective collaboration and execution with our key suppliers and partners, as well as by a positive mix effect from the growth of higher margin categories.</p>
          <p>To a lesser extent, the change in the way we book prepaid cellular air-time continued to benefit also our gross margin. Operating expenses increased only 12%, slightly below our revenues, an improvement over recent trends driven by efficiencies achieved at the store level, which more than compensated for the new store openings. Hence, operating margin expanded by a robust 230 basis points to reach 8.8% of revenues.</p>
          <p>And so now, I would now like to open the call for questions, reminding you again to please refrain from asking those about the subject of the recent press reports. Operator?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Vanessa Quiroga with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the call. I was wondering if you could give us as much details as possible with regards to what were the drivers of the efficiency gains in SG&amp;A that you achieved at FEMSA Cerveza? And if those strategies already include lower spending in exclusive points of sales, or if that is going to be something that we will see in the coming quarters on top of the savings that you have already achieved? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Vanessa. The main drivers for the efficiency has been, as I have discussed in the past, I would say, a consequence of efforts directed at &#x2013; looking at a much better way to implement better ways to serve different kind of customers. As we have stated in the past, in the early stages of implementing the business model, which is in place today, we tended to go very broadly in terms of using service levels to most of the customers to very, very, I would say, at the same &#x2013; basically at the same level for most of them. And in the past, I would say, 18 months, we have been implementing a number of different ways to serve different customers that is using much more telesales than just going with a face visit to the customer. We have been also adapting frequency of visits to a number of customers as well.</p>
          <p>So I would say the main driver has been efficiency driven by better ways to segment and serve in a differentiated way our customer base. I would say that the second driver for savings in SG&amp;A there has been rationalization of structures, which we've put in place in the past to master the new business model and business practices. And when you progress in time, you start, I would say, beating the learning curve. So we have been reducing the span break for some of our commercial organization within the country, changing from a number of organization on a market-by-market basis to basically, I would say, reducing those by 30% in the past couple of years, that on a regional basis for the whole country as well as for a zone basis for markets which are more regional or even local.</p>
          <p>So, also head count rationalization driven mostly by commercial organizations is also a fundamental source of efficiency. And of course, we continue to increase productivity in our breweries finding better ways to both gain flexibility on how we brew our beers across the six breweries on the country saving on freight and also bringing productivity up basically year in and year out. So, those would be basically the main source of, I'd say, savings on SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>The fourth component, which goes directly to your second question is, we think that also we have found ways in better building the value proposition that we have for different segments of customers. So, the amount that we are now putting in place for some segments of customers, we are optimizing some of that cost base, not I'd say, losing track in terms of the performance that we are having in those customers, but by better serving them and by better tailoring the value proposition and by that I mean the commercial margin and the support we give to a number of customers that have been also been an additional source of savings for the company as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of spending on exclusives, I'd say that we are basically continuing what we have been doing in the past, which is a combination of, I'd say, focusing our resources on those customers that we think are going to be the winners for the long-term, because of the scale, their location or the capabilities of those customers and the strategic importance that it has for all depending on the region and on the places at which these customers are located. But we are not increasing, either in a substantial manner, our resources allocated to exclusive accounts. And &#x2013; but I wouldn't say the opposite as well that we are optimizing significantly also the amounts dedicated to exclusive accounts.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And it looks like we'll take our next question from Tom&#xE1;s Lajous with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen and thank you for the call. I have two quick questions actually. The first one is if you can talk about your margins in Brazil and Mexico. The difference between those two segments and within Cerveza and the sustainability of this going forward? And the second is just if you have any take on not regarding you, but just most generally dramatically in the world of beer consolidation, if you think Heineken is coming to the mat, if you think Modelo is going to be taken out by ABI shortly, any comments would be helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Tom&#xE1;s. We think &#x2013; I'd say &#x2013; I'd speak differently over Mexico and Brazil because of a number of reasons, but the first one being of course, our competitive position and development of our strategy are in very different timeframes. But in Mexico as I said, we have had, I think, a fairly good 2009 considering the challenges we've been facing on the different fronts that I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>My guess is that going forward, we will still continue to face significantly challenges, both on the growth profile of the market, on the competitive dynamics, and of course, next year, we will suffer a lot from now having the full impact of foreign exchange, which we have, I'd say, navigated very well during this year because of decisions we took in 2008. But all in all, I'm optimistic that because of now having some of the benefits of lower commodity prices, particularly in grains in Mexico, not yet on aluminum because of the hedges that we have discussed lengthly in the past year.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, I feel optimistic about maintaining margins going forward. And in terms of Brazil, I'd say, it will depend a lot on the competitive dynamics. But in Brazil, I think that we will have not only the benefit of the now much cheaper grains that we have secured for basically 2010, but as well for the aluminum prices that we're going to get, because in the case of Brazil as we have expressed to you in the past, we did not have a long-term hedge in place.</p>
          <p>So, we're going to have the benefits of that. And &#x2013; so, I feel a little bit more optimistic in terms of margins for the case of Brazil. But still in Brazil, we are at the phase in which we are still prioritizing volume growth and value, brand equity building as opposed to delivering a net of incremental financial returns for the short-term. So, we will be willing to commit again a number of the benefits that we will have in Brazil, going back to the business. That would not imply a deterioration of the margins, but not necessarily also an improving on the margins.</p>
          <p>On your second question, I really cannot really share a lot of &#x2013; anything we think regarding that subject <mark type="inaudible" />. And I wouldn't like to speculate on anybody's other thinking or doing for the coming future. So I would basically skip your second question, Tom&#xE1;s, and I'm sure you will understand why. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I certainly do. Fair enough. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Lauren Torres with HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. My question is on the &#x2013; on your beer business in Mexico and in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that your growth underperformed the industry and it's not necessarily structural, but it's more reflective of what your competitor's doing. So, I'm curious hearing your remarks about next year and expecting further challenges in Mexico. Do you feel that you need to resort, I guess, to similar activities, be it by package or by pricing to stay competitive or you could kind of hold ground, which is &#x2013; it appears to be what you've done so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Lauren. I would say that so far, we are very, very carefully monitoring a number of variables for us to make decisions on this front and I would say that the decisions that we will be taking going forward will have to do a lot with the evolution of these variables. These variables being basically distribution first, velocity of our brands within the account, brand equity, evolution and performance, and I would say also as well as brand equity, I would say a little bit more of the insights that we get from consumers when we go and ask what do they think about the category and the brand and the packages.</p>
          <p>I cannot say today that we will do &#x2013; what we will do going into next year. What I can confirm to you is that we're expecting that this phenomena that has taken place during 2009 will phase out during 2010. And I would say that the rest will be a consequence of, again, these variables, us considering they are still on a healthy pace and that will determine our future actions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would add to that. This is Juan, Lauren. We're also referring to the very significant underperformance of the North vis-&#xE0;-vis the center of the country in terms of what transpired year-to-date. I think if we go into 2010, of course, nobody has a crystal ball. We don't know when the U.S. economy is actually going to pick up steam. But we do know that when that happens the North of Mexico stands to benefit very fast and very seriously.</p>
          <p>So, depending on what your own view is of when the U.S. get going again, we should be in for a period of better, better demand trends as more people go back to their jobs in the maquiladoras along the border.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Antonio Gonz&#xE1;lez with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone Thanks for the call. I have two questions, if I may. First on CapEx, I think you have got around 50% of your total CapEx this quarter, which I think is high end historical standards. Could you give us some color on how much are you cutting down for each of the other two divisions? And specifically on FEMSA, how much of these cut down in CapEx is related to investments at the point-of-sale versus production or orders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Antonio. I would rack it in three. As you are clearly seeing, we have not reduced our investment in OXXO at all, because we are basically, hopefully ending the year with even a higher number of stores opened in '09 as opposed to '08. So basically, OXXO is investing at basically the same pace we were doing in 2008 and that also includes not also the new opening of stores but also opening of distribution centers and technology investments in the new point-of-sale system that we will start rolling out next year.</p>
          <p>In the case of Coca-Cola FEMSA, I would say that we have also not slow down significantly the CapEx for the year as opposed to 2008, as compared to the beer business. And you see that the volume growth for Coca-Cola FEMSA, both in sparkling and non-carbonated beverages are still very, very strong, that living by Coca-Cola brand as a matter of fact. So, we have a number of expansions, the capacity-driven CapEx in Coca-Cola FEMSA, which accounts for maybe more than 50% of the total CapEx that we are putting in place.</p>
          <p>And in the case of beer, I would say that most of the reduction has come also from the manufacturing side, because again volume performance both in Mexico and in Brazil, you know that we have excess capacity as a matter of fact. We have very good facilities, so we have also been doing, I would say more, I would say, efforts in trying to reduce our CapEx for the short term for some of the non-urgent or no-relevant investments that we can basically put forward a little bit. And we have reduced but the smaller component of reduction coming from support that we are putting to the marketplace.</p>
          <p>We have been, in the past, discussing that we have, I would say executed, I mean strategy, which we have been, I would say, putting some specific resources to select the customers to allow us to have a much more say in how those customers are presenting to consumers the beer proposition. And we're slowing down that &#x2013; we're slowing those kind of investments for the year as opposed to previous year. That will be basically the most important component of point of sale investment, but the rest I would say that we are not reducing significant &#x2013; in a significant way for investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, if I may on Cerveza in Brazil, I think your price for fiscal year in reais is around 4% below the peak we saw during the first quarter of this year. Yet, as you mentioned in your opening remarks, volumes are still somewhat weak. Could you walk us through what kind of price adjustments you did in the last couple of quarters, perhaps which brands and regions were affected the most? And also which portion of these G&amp;A improvement we saw for FEMSA Cerveza this quarter is related to lower marketing expenses, specifically in Brazil?</p>

          <p>Sure. Let me comment first on the quarter-by-quarter basis. If you recall, we started increasing prices fourth quarter, and the first quarter of this year was a significant increase when measured as opposed to the previous first quarter of 2008 with an increase of around 18%. Second quarter was only eight. Third quarter was basically, I would say, flat against third quarter of '08, but sequentially it showed a reduction of around 3%.</p>
          <p>So, all of these has to do a lot with, again the pricing dynamics that have been present in the Brazilian market. And the reduction sequentially, the reduction has been basically driven by some of our, I would say, both pricing actions on everyday price on very few and selected brands and package in selected regions, in which the gap that has &#x2013; that was created in the past couple of quarters was so big that we thought the right thing to do was to basically compress that gap, still keeping some of that gap in our favor, but not keeping so a substantial gap that was hurting our volume performance so much. And in some others and the majority of the price reduction, I think, has come from PepsiCo activities more in a &#x2013; in the way of promotional activities, on the release that as time progresses and the economy gets better, but also us, some of our competitors benefit both on hedging, on FX and on raw materials goes away that we will have a much more benign price environment going forward.</p>
          <p>I wouldn't highlight a single decision of reducing price across regions and brand packages as the way that we have been managing pricing in the past two months. But as I said, doing it on a market-by-market basis and looking at basically because we're basically followers and we are number three, in some cases number two, in some cases even number four in the different regions, we're basically pricing our products based on the price point of our competitors' brands and the brand equity we possess on each of those brands and the performance of our brand equity among time. So that's basically the way we've been driving these in the past months, Antonio.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi, Javier, hi, Jos&#xE9;. Thank you for taking the call. My question has to do also with pricing in Brazil with a slightly different angle. I mean, we're still seeing a gap of over 30 plus percent with price per hectoliter versus the leader, versus AmBev there. And the question is going forward, now that you're taking back pricing, I understand that you're not taking it across the board nationally but by region but what role does the bottlers play in this strategy going forward? And what should we expect in terms of that gap? Is it really going to get closer or is it going to maintain or continue expanding like we've seen this year?</p>
          <p>And the follow-up to that question is what lessons are you getting in your work with the bottlers in Brazil and the work that you're doing with your pilot program with Coca-Cola FEMSA in Mexico? And where would you like to take that pilot program going forward, Javier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The first one, Alan, is &#x2013; I think it's going to be about &#x2013; you reflected very well on what the difference on pricing of the leader against us is in Brazil. And that that is basically a consequence of basically AmBev having, I would say, a lonely position on the mainstream of the market with basically three brands and I mean not having a challenger in that arena and being very successful also on the super-premium and playing, I would say, very, very limited role in the value segment. And I would say that the gap of our average price per hectoliter against the leader will be a function of a number of things.</p>
          <p>First is that if we continue to do a good job on the super-premium segment with the offerings of the local brand we have, basically with Xingu, one of the premium brands in Brazil, still a small one but growing like hell, Heineken of course having a very, very successful performance for the last three years since we've bought the business, and of course, our import also offering from Mexico in the sense of Dos Equis. That will have to do a lot with improvement in our price per hectoliter. And of course, we are also developing a much more, I would say, the winning proposition for the near premium or the near mainstream segment basically with reinforcing Kaiser in some of its relevant markets in which we're basically, as we have been saying, trying to close the gaps accordingly to the brand equity building that we are now experimenting, and of course, trying to go as much as we can from the value segment, which basically we occupy that place with Bavaria Cl&#xE1;ssica, and which will still play a significant role because it's an important part of our volume and it's a profitable brand. Not as profitable as Kaiser and, or as Sol or as Heineken definitely, but profitable still.</p>
          <p>So I would say that going forward, that will be, I would say, the key determinants. We don't foresee and it is not in our business plan ambition of the future in which we are going to be able to basically match the volume and pricing mix of the leader of the industry, and we do not have to in order to have a viable, sustainable and profitable business for Brazil. So anything that we can close of that gap of 30%, it will be good for us and it will trickle down basically to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>On the other part of, on the comment &#x2013; you just mentioned, if I understood correctly that some of the pilot tests we were doing in Mexico.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What learning's we can take from Brazil that we eventually apply in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say a lot. I would say a lot. I would say that the main one it's &#x2013; I would say similar to the learning's that we have started to get from the Mexican beer market, which is all starts with consumers, but all flows through the channels. So the better we understand both, the better we can design the way we can address consumer needs and customer needs in a proper way. And I would say that some of the learning's are pretty much skewed to some, I would say, collaboration in terms of sharing of information on the channel performance and what customers value the most are some of them, and specifically, in Mexico of course, we have the advantage of having OXXO. So it's a different learning that we cannot have as good as in Mexico &#x2013; I mean as in Brazil as the one we have in Mexico.</p>
          <p>But all in all, I would say that the best we understand consumer needs and customer needs, you know as well and you know for sure that we are very, very focused on process and enabling processes through technology and that we also pride ourselves also to be, I would say, consistent and determined for building brands for the long term. So, I would say that the sharing of experiences and the &#x2013; I would say, exchanging of executives is going to be still the most important thing that we value in terms of having this integrated platform of beer and soft drinks within FEMSA and of course with the complement of OXXO.</p>
          <p>So in a general sense, I would say that that's basically the things that we value the most, and we have said this in the past a lot of times when we are asked about integration initiatives or possibilities regarding markets such as Mexico. And we said, guys, the keyword here is learning, sharing of experiences, collaboration, not definitely integration. And that's basically where we are focusing our efforts.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I also wanted to ask a question about beer. When you were talking in your opening remarks, it seems like you're setting an expectation to flat margins in 2010, and it's &#x2013; I guess it's a bit early to be talking about expectations for '10. And I think given the fact that you've made it through the first nine months of &#x2013; as you say the worst crisis in Mexican &#x2013; well in recent Mexican history, with flat margins, it's interesting that you're being more cautious. And I understand your comments on the exchange rate, but I would have guessed that you would be a bit more positive into 2010. So, are you seeing something different that's changing your mind versus the strong numbers we're seeing? And if you do see a more aggressive environment or I guess even with the current environment in Mexico, are there additional rationalization efforts you will put in place for 2010 to protect the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Javier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you defined it well in terms of being cautiously optimistic because I think we still have a number of some &#x2013; uncertainties on the environment. I would say that a &#x2013; if the U.S. economy, I would say, moves ahead and pulls Northern Mexico, that will be great for us to start with. I think that if our political system comes with a, I would say, balanced solution for the decisions they are about to take in terms of how to deal with deficits for financial taxes in Mexico, also that can be a very significant factor for our company as well.</p>
          <p>If that creates, I would say, the proper environment for Mexico, for, I would say, the currency performance into next year as well as some other emerging markets are being favored even including 2009 in the appreciation of their currencies, that could be also very, very helpful. And all in all, I would say &#x2013; I would say those three would be, and all of three are basically environment-driven kind of variables. I would feel more optimistic with less caution on my comments, but I'm being cautioned because I really do not have a good sense of how these three components or variables would evolve going forward.</p>
          <p>And it is clear that because of the economic structure of our business we're going to face strong headwinds if the peso remains to be above 34 pesos per dollar into 2010. Because as we've said, because of the natural hedge of our exports and the forwards that we brought in 2008, we hedge ourselves basically more than two-thirds of our deficit in currency for 2009. And we won't have that into next year.</p>
          <p>And so that would be a very important impact on our economic structure. So if you combine that that would basically wipe away most of the benefits of &#x2013; if not all &#x2013; of the benefits that we will have for getting now cheaper grains and lower aluminum cost for Brazil. And still I would say succession and GDP growth for the U.S. and what happens for Northern Mexico will come up to be the defining variables.</p>
          <p>I don't think that the competitive dynamics in Mexico is one area of concern for us. We still are seeing our brands performing well. We don't have a problem in distribution, as I have said.</p>
          <p>We still have a number of rationalization areas that we can tap in, some of them just because a consequence of some of the initiatives we put in place in '09 having some effect into 2008 and '10 because of the time that we roll them out. And of course, we'll put some initiatives also in place in order to protect our margins definitely into 2010. And that's why I'm being, again, cautiously optimistic by being able to maintain margins into 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And if I could just ask two very specific questions. On beer, you mentioned exclusivities are stable, but we're seeing the amortization on the income statement go up 24% in the quarter and 14% for the year. So if you could just help us understand what's driving that? And then also, is there any way you could give us a breakdown or a rough sense of what was the magnitude of the drivers that you mentioned of gross margin improvement? You mentioned better supplier negotiation, you mentioned higher sales of higher margin products. And you mentioned, to a lesser extent, the phone card switch. Is there any way you could give us a sense of what's driving most of that gross margin expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On the first one, it's the increase in the quarter. And if you look at the full year, on terms of <mark type="inaudible" /> not driven by incremental spending or volume sold through exclusive or tight house accounts, but more for provisions of a more slowing, moving of volumes within those tight accounts. So in some of the contracts we have, most and the huge majority of our contracts that go &#x2013; that are negotiated on a volume basis. So those are not negotiated on a time &#x2013; on a limited time. But we are in slower volume environment.</p>
          <p>We are, in some contracts, now having to amortize at a certain rate based on time as opposed to volume and that is creating an incremental &#x2013; an increase on the amortization.</p>
          <p>And the second is that some of the tight accounts, under a very stressed economic environment, are having difficult, so we are also on a very conservative approach. We're increasing our uncollectible accounts as well to protect against potential future problems of some of those customers.</p>
          <p>And then we also think, the majority of the margin expansion is coming basically from having a &#x2013; I would say &#x2013; incremental promotional activities within workshop which are basically being presented to us by suppliers. You can imagine then in these kind of economic environment, most of the suppliers are trying to protect volumes, and in some cases they are willing to put forward some incremental incentives to move products within the stores, that will be the reason number one. But significantly also followed are mostly &#x2013; even as the first reason that we are being able to increase on a significant way, the volume of the high gross margin categories as opposed to the low gross margin categories.</p>
          <p>And that will leave us a distant, very distant third place, the effect of the air-time charge as opposed to the prepaid phone cards as the main drivers of the margin expansion at least at the gross level <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Couple of my questions were answered, but I guess going back to the question that Tom&#xE1;s was asking about the difference in profitability between Mexico and Brazil beer. I guess, I would just ask, was the Brazilian operation still in the red in terms of EBITDA during the quarter? And do you still expect it to hover near zero for the year? And then going back to your earlier statement of saying that you would have less gross margin pressure but that you would have to reinvest some of that.</p>
          <p>How much is going to be left in terms of operating income growth or EBITDA growth for Kaiser in 2010? How much of an increase in EBITDA would we expect in that business given the scenario you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jos&#xE9;. We are still black, I mean we're still making positive numbers on EBITDA, both for the quarter &#x2013; both, also for year-to-date, and we expect also to be positive in EBITDA for the year as a whole in 2009, even though we are, again, facing a very challenging environment there. And we think that going into 2010, as I said, that will continue to be the trend. In 2009, we have been &#x2013; I would say, more selective in terms of increase in marketing expenses. We have reduced, not in a significant way, but we have reduced some of those, but most of them leaving or having &#x2013; the main rationale behind those reductions having to do with the efforts that we did in the past couple of years to both launch and position Sol brand in Brazil.</p>
          <p>So the main reduction in Brazil in 2009 in marketing expenses has come from basically realizing that now we are in a situation in which we made most of the efforts to present the Sol brand to Brazilians and to basically position the brand in minds of consumer, in the segments of consumers that we wanted to do in the previous couple of years.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we would like to take into advantage that we will have now better pricing for both grains and aluminum that we think will have a favorable pricing environment into 2010 from an industry-wide perspective. And we would like to, again increase investment in marketing to continue building the brand equity that is still needed in that business for the long run, but still maintaining the financial discipline of having still positive EBITDA. So I wouldn't guide you to put in whatever model you want to run on Brazil that neither we are running big numbers on an EBIT basis in the red or not putting blood numbers on the EBITDA that we're achieving for both 2009 and also for 2010 as well. But, yes, that we're having the comfort that we will hopefully and wisely invest a little bit above in 2010 behind that branch what we have been investing in 2009.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Would you be able to comment on having gotten OXXO in terms of distribution of your beer brands in Mexico? So in a sense that how much of your beer is distributed through OXXO and what sort of common distribution element do they share, if you could comment on that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. OXXO basically sells about 13% of the beer that our beer business sells here in Mexico. Regionally it's only basically present in Mexico with basically stores in Columbia. We're entering that country basically this year, this quarter. And it's about 13% of the beer sales and it's a very important channel of distribution not only because of 13 being an important number for the beer business but it's also a very important channel for us to again understand consumer insights, price elasticity, what works well in terms of promotional activity, what goes well with beer.</p>
          <p>It helps a lot to bring price disciplines to the market because it's basically the place that people referred to and is the more memorable price in the minds of consumer comes basically from OXXO. It's a showcase for developing our brand equity in some of the places in which we do not form a very good market position. So all in all, it's a very important of course, component. It's a very good business on a standalone basis for FEMSA as well. But it works pretty nicely both with beer and Coca-Cola as well. So we think it's a nice <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks everybody. I wanted to go back just to the beer operations and just get a better feeling for as we end the year and look into early 2010 on the raw materials side. Specifically, we understand that we've got the aluminum hedges that to the extent that they roll off together with what you will be setting up for your growing input cost and such, when do we see really cost relief begin in the beer &#x2013; with the beer assets, because that seems to be something that's changing a little bit since the beginning of the year? And if you could kind of map that out for us, that would be great?</p>
          <p>And I guess the second thing is you talk about the outlook for Brazil and the notion of being a follower and such and I think, one of the things that strikes me is in the discussions &#x2013; one of the biggest elements in the Brazilian beer industry has of course been the rollout of the one liter package and obviously the investments implied with that vis-&#xE0;-vis the glass bottle and such, is something that that requires even perhaps some negotiation with the other brewers. And I mean, what is your thinking on that as we kind of come into these peak selling months over the summer in Brazil. What are your thoughts on doing and launching a one-liter glass bottle in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Alex. On the first one, as I said we're going to have, I would say, a good degree of relief on COGS per hectoliter in Brazil next year, driven by basically stable on average exchange rate on reais against the dollar. A lower price of grains, which we have basically secured most of our purchasing needs for 2010 and from lower aluminum because we did not have hedges in place for 2010. So Brazil, again we will have a lot of the relief in 2010, if not all, a lot of it.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, it's a very different story. We have still the hedges in place for aluminum so we won't get any relief and we will have relief from grains, but we will face the headwinds from foreign exchange. Hopefully, those headwinds are, I would say, not as big and that depends a lot on again the macro conditions of Mexico as a country. So, in Mexico we think we are going to have a challenging 2010 &#x2013; 2010 year as well. Going into 2011, we will now start to have relief, I think, from from both, hopefully foreign exchange and definitely from aluminum hedges, as they start to phase out by mid 2011. So on the first question that will be basically my comment.</p>
          <p>On the second one, still, I would say the strategies and the, I would say, the penetration of the strategies regarding the one liter in Brazil from the liter are still in the phase in which they are &#x2013; I wouldn't say a pilot test. With these still in the phase of being very sure what that is for bulk both in terms of the dynamics of competition in Brazil, basically for southern Brazil at this stage and on the financial front for the liter as well.</p>
          <p>We have not done anything in the marketplace so far. We have a number of strategies that we can pursue going forward that we are ready to deploy &#x2013; maybe for the first quarter of next year. And of course I cannot comment a lot on that, but be sure that as I would say that some of those strategies that may imply at some point of time reacting on packages that goes to the one leader presentation. The possibility of doing that in a concerted way with some of the other breweries locally in Brazil is one of the possibilities for sure. So that's basically as much as I would like to comment on that because of the sensitivity of the issue and I'm sure you'll understand that, Alex.</p>

So it's an overall view of how we're supposed to look at this?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Drew I'd love to help you but really I can't. I really had said that at the beginning, we cannot really disclose anything related to what you just said. So I will need to excuse in not answering your question. And hopefully being able to provide you with some more meat on this issue going forward, but not at this juncture. So, excuse me for not being able to answer anything of what you are asking.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what I can say to you is that as everything we do in the company, we're basically thinking all the time on a long-term shareholder value creation. So that is basically what's guiding our thinking when we are saying that we are exploring opportunities.</p>

          <p>And we will take our next question from Robert Ford with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for taking my question, Javier. I had a question with respect to OXXO, I was very impressed with the EBITDA margin of 11.1% in the quarter. And I was wondering if you can comment a little bit with respect to OXXO's value proposition? How it measures up relative to rival <mark type="inaudible" /> or C store channels? And where you see the opportunities to really maintaining or even improve traffic. I understand you've got kind of an opening price point strategy with staples. And I was hoping you can comment on some of the opportunities that you see to again drive traffic maybe maintain or improve margins despite the economic slowdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Bob. Thanks for the questions. I mean, that we are very enthusiastic as well for the results on OXXO. You guys see basically the result of all the efforts that the people that run OXXO do. Which basically translate into a P&amp;L and a cash flow and a balance sheet we report to you on a quarterly basis. But I'd say that the essence of your question is basically what keeps these guys busy all the time, which is basically improving the value proposition for consumers.</p>
          <p>And I would say that the good thing here is that from our standpoint of view also has been, not only I would say improving its value proposition as opposed to other, I would say, retailers in Mexico. And the proof of that being our performance in same-store sales as compared with some others here as well. But I'd say that in a sense OXXO has come to be part of the everyday life of a number of Mexicans all across the country. Because this is basically &#x2013; I mean when you look at every one of the more than now 7,000 OXXO stores bringing more than 800 people on a daily basis. You have to realize that we are basically solving problems and satisfying needs for all those customers.</p>
          <p>We are very much focused and we have been expressing here in the past on improving the value proposition. And we have been, I would say, very much focused on basically three or four categories, fast food being one of them. We have been improving a lot our offering. We have been doing rollouts of new propositions basically here in Northeastern Mexico with dairy products and with fast foods, prepared fresh on a day-by-day basis. We have been taking into &#x2013; now into our advantage that we have now ten distribution centers all across the country, and we think that those distribution centers will be fundamentally improving even- even better our fast food offerings.</p>
          <p>Of course the services offering and solving people's problem in terms of paying their bills in OXXO and now being able to pay with credit cards, we think it's going to play a fundamental role. The features that we are put in place to facilitate consumers, not only to pay in with debit or credit cards, without having to sign and using some of the rewards programs that they have with the banks and camaraderie's. The bank that we are working with, all of those elements are basically things that are reminding people that it's not only a place of having an OXXO near where I work or live, but it also is helping me solving my problems in a very efficient and friendly manner.</p>
          <p>So we are very pleased with the value proposition. We are still very, very pleased also as well, going to another part of your question, on the quality of the openings that we have been getting. You know that we measure our &#x2013; the efficiency of the site location to open stores and we are basically at all time highs, and that has a lot to do with <mark type="inaudible" /> cycle of people having confidence on the brand and we're delivering on the brand, on value proposition that we are promising consumers. So we think we are going to keep &#x2013; that we are going to be able to keep the opening up of stores, hopefully opening more stores every year as compared to the previous one. And so all in all I think things are working very well for OXXO in all the manners.</p>

          <p>I think this is very, very, very early, but we just had our Board meeting yesterday, and a Board member asked the same question and I think that's wisely a lot of <mark type="inaudible" /> it's very early. So I will &#x2013; I wouldn't dare myself to give you an answer, if we avoided to give that one to our Board members also. Excuse us for not commenting that because it's been basically weak. So whatever I tell you, I'm sure I'm going to be wrong. So I'd rather excuse myself also.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Javier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Carlos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Javier, Ed? If your need for integration of beer and soft drinks have changed, and as your levers for managing the relationship with Coke have changed. Is it really optimal in your mind still to have Coke's equity position at the KOS level rather than a <mark type="inaudible" /> level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is Carlos. I think the venture was born on a fundamental belief that we could, both the Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola FEMSA work on a very aligned, I would say a joint venture structure. And I think that as you look back and see the value of the Coca-Cola FEMSA and then consequently FEMSA has been able to create, that's I think the right thing to do.</p>
          <p>And going forward, we think the same way. We think that Coca-Cola has a very clear position on the field in terms of the beverages in which they are willing to participate. We agree with them that there are a number of opportunities to expand the presence of these new categories in non-carbonated. We're still looking at Coca-Cola brand growing in one of the highest per capita countries in the word such as Mexico growing mid single-digits.</p>
          <p>So I think we have a tremendous business, a tremendous partner in Coca-Cola FEMSA, and then I don't see any reason of that changing going forward. We're committed to the business and committed to the partnership, and we think the right place for us of being, I would say, partnering with the Coca-Cola Company is basically at the Coca-Cola FEMSA level.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Can you give us a sense of &#x2013; how you think about the excess capacity you have in Brazil? I think it's about 10 million hectoliters. Have you considered &#x2013; would you consider now the potential for contract brewing for third parties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Celso. No, no, we don't think that's the case. We think that according to our business plan we will need that capacity. And we have proved that in the past three years, '08, '09 has been a very different one. And we tend to be believe that we understand why, and we are making the modifications to our strategy that will allow us to continue growing. But if we look at, I mean, we basically are selling close to 2 million hectos more than we've got, previous we're acquiring in the business. And even though we have a large excess capacity, we've reviewed, when we bought the business and we do that every year as well, if there are opportunities to temporarily either rationalize our capacity or to have a better use of that capacity for things like one you're asking and the answer has been straight no for both. So we don't have any plans for the foreseeable next years to do that, Celso.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Javier. Could you please talk a little bit about possible effect on the deferred taxes for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean on the deferred taxes because of changes in the consolidation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what I can say is that, if a law is approved the way it is, as we have stated publicly that through the private organizations that have been very bravely outspoken on these, that we think, first, that it won't be the proper thing to do in terms of certainty. We don't think that the, I would say the legal element that the changes, creates are not contested in the judicial system in Mexico as well. And also that I don't think that people have a very material impact on the position of FEMSA, but having said that, I think that we will need to wait and we are still positively thinking that the Senate will basically bring down the initiative that was presented by the Lower House.</p>
