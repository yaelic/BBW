      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to Telstra's Results for the Full Year 2011.</p>
          <p>My name is Ben Spincer, Director of Investor Relations at Telstra. In a moment, I will hand over to David and John to run you through the results. After David and John have said some words to you, we will obviously take some questions both from my phone here in Melbourne and also from the phone lines.</p>
          <p>I'll hand over to Telstra's CEO, David Thodey. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ben, and let me add my welcome to the full year results. It's great to have you here.</p>
          <p>I should quickly welcome a number of other people that are on webcast because we now are a multimedia company. Those watching T-Box Channel 409 and, of course, on BigPond News, which welcomes you as well. And I should quickly say this is an auspicious day for two reasons. Firstly, it is John's final results presentation, and John, I was just sort of saying before I think this is your 28th results briefing, 43 years in the company. So be kind to him when he gets up there. It's &#x2013; the second thing, it's an auspicious day too, because on Tuesday it was the 30th anniversary of when we introduced mobiles into Australia and we did it with a press release. But what an incredible story that's been, and we'll talk a little bit about that this morning. And of course, John was there when mobiles were introduced into Australia, so it's great.</p>
          <p>Okay. So we're going to follow pretty much the same format we normally do. I'm going to give you sort of the highlights of the business and then, really focusing on looking at how strategy is starting to deliver results, because at the end of the day strategy without results doesn't mean a whole lot. Then John is going to come up and take you through all the financial details, which are really important. There is a quite bit in them for this result. And then I'd like to come back at the end and try and give you a bit of sense of where we are at with NBN. I'm hoping that next year I don't have to talk about NBN, but, at least this year, I still do.</p>
          <p>So, let's get on to the results. Look, I do need to say from the very beginning. Look we're very pleased with the results, especially the second half. The momentum in the business was strong. Revenue grew 0.7% for the full year, which is good, but in the second half we grew 1.8%, and that's just been very gratifying for the whole company.</p>
          <p>While we still &#x2013; as we forecast, the EBITDA declined 6.4% for the full year, however second half, up 0.7%. So, what we're seeing as the revenue flows through as we're managing our costs, a strong second half performance. And, of course, we've generated $5.5 billion of free cash. So, we'll take you through the detail of that. That's ahead of guidance and, in fact, we are ahead of guidance on all those metrics. So, really a set of solid results and I do just want to pause for a moment. It's not normal in results, but I want to thank all the Telstra staff, the senior team . Look, as you know, we've had a lot of work to do and we've still got lot of work ahead of us, but it's starting to pay results and we are really pleased with that. So, my colleagues and to all Telstra staff, thank you.</p>
          <p>So as I said, John's going to take you through the results in more detail because always there's a lot of detail around what's really going underneath the business. But let me now turn to just some of the highlights from the business. It was a year ago when we came here and we said we're going to invest a significant amount of money to get momentum back in the business, to grow our customer base, increase market share, and very importantly, to simplify the business, and that was a big call.</p>
          <p>And the second thing we said was we're really going to try to focus on our customers. Again, it's the beginning of the journey, but we think that we have really made some progress on it. So look, the key highlights as I sit back from the business that I'm very pleased about. Firstly our price points are simpler. I think we are becoming easier to do business with. I didn't say easy, but easier to do business with, and that's very important in dealing with our customers. And I think the way we're constructing our offers, there's good value for our customers while we still manage the core financials.</p>
          <p>We're seeing very strong customer growth. In fact, in the end, it exceeded our own expectations. I'll come on to that in a moment, but 2 million mobile subscribers across our domestic and our Hong Kong business is a truly outstanding result. So, we're very pleased with that.</p>
          <p>Also, in terms of the productivity, we've realized $622 million of productivity improvement from all the work that Robert Nason and the team and, in fact, the whole of the company has done in terms of the first year of the simplification process. And, of course, what we've seen is some of those benefits have flown through into the second half results.</p>
          <p>So, customer service, fourth one. I'd say that some &#x2013; more of our customers are starting to see the results. We want more of them to see a real difference, but we're starting &#x2013; our customers are starting to say, hey, things are improving. I'll take you through some of that in a moment. And then, of course, we did finalize the NBN Definitive Agreements and we're now really looking forward to getting that to shareholders to give them the opportunity to vote on that in October, and more about that later on.</p>
          <p>So, I think you can see from the top line results that the strategy is starting to take traction. It's starting to deliver results. So, our focus on customer satisfaction, customers in our 1, 2 and 3; always critically important. Secondly, about growing our customer base, really important; simplifying the business so we can do things better, faster in a more responsive way for our customers, and then also looking where we can find new areas of growth. So, what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to give you a quick update on each of those areas so you get a sense, at least from my perspective, about what we're seeing in the business.</p>
          <p>So, let's talk about customer satisfaction. Now, two years we've started on this journey to really change Telstra, and that's both culturally, it's about process redesign, it's about our focus, and you've got to do them all together. And, it's about making this company faster and simpler to do business with. And as I said, well, I think we are seeing some early signs that these changes are starting to work. Obviously, you look at that and you say, well, one thing is how your customers feel about you but what are the actual results. The deactivation rates are a tremendous result. We have seen some of the lowest deactivation rates that I can remember in the business since I've been here. And when we survey our customers, and we do survey over 2,500 every month, they are saying things are improving, and that's really gratifying, in every segment of the market.</p>
          <p>And we made a number of, what I would call, significant customer-focused changes in the organization last year. We set up the new Telstra Digital division, which is really very important, because this is all about interacting with our customers differently.</p>
          <p>A very interesting statistic that even though we have grown our customer base significantly this year, interesting &#x2013; the number of calls into our call centers has actually gone down. That means our customers are interacting differently, and they're still coming &#x2013; ringing for sales. That's &#x2013; so, we're reducing the number of service calls per customer and that's very, very important. And we think more of them are going online.</p>
          <p>We launched these Freedom Connect mobile plans. Now, we launched many plans during the year, but these were a great <mark type="ph" /> testament of a simpler (8:00) model business plan, and also it had paperless bill and direct debit. Really important changes. And we've sold 320,000 of those new plans. That means the market is really picking those up.</p>
          <p>Also, as you would have seen, we announced during the year that the LTE mobile network, we would roll it out this year. On Monday, we put out 2,000 of the dongles to business customers and will have a commercial launch later this month. So that's been really gratifying. The engineering guys are working hard to make that network really one of the world's best.</p>
          <p>Also, as you know, we have changed the way we are serving our customers with 24/7 call centers. We've done that. We are doing field calls in the weekend with nets growing and customers saying hey, come to see us in the weekend. And very interesting, we've gone to 24 hour support on social networking sites. We're seeing a lot of customers going to social networking sites, and now we got people 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, just monitoring those sites, so we can respond to customers.</p>
          <p>These are real changes in how the whole business is operating. So we're very committed to improving customer satisfaction. And while we're very pleased with the progress we're making, we do know, and I want to stress, there's still a lot of opportunities to do even better as we go forward.</p>
          <p>As I said, customer growth is critically important to us, and I show this chart every quarter. And the real message here is that the fourth quarter growth continued. And that was very important as we came through the year that we didn't see the fourth quarter drop off.</p>
          <p>As you see there, 378,000 new mobile customers in the fourth quarter, which brought us to just on 1.7 million for the year domestically. 92,000 new bundles were sold in the fourth quarter. That's over 650,000 for the full year, and remember, bundles are really important because customers sign up for two-year contract. And then 203,000 new mobile broadband customers in the quarter and 914,000 for the full year.</p>
          <p>They are really impressive numbers. But also, you're starting to see a change in the way people are using broadband services and this is -we see great future for this business.</p>
          <p>But, net growth has got to translate into revenue and profit growth because it's not sustainable to keep just growing your customer base. You got to get real results coming out. So, as you would have seen, mobiles growth, 10.7%, and fixed broadband at 1.4%. You've got to compare that to last year, where it was far less. So really encouraging, good customer growth and also now starting to see in the second half flowing through into good top line growth. And John will take you through the margins as well, which are really important.</p>
          <p>Okay, our simplification efforts, really important, because this is where we're really trying to drive out a different way of running the business. And this is all about driving out real, sustainable net reductions in terms of our operating costs over time. We are redesigning over 300 processes at 27 projects and, as you can imagine, that takes a lot of effort to get going.</p>
          <p>Importantly, simplifying the business has resulted in a very important decline. When we look at labor and productivity, we look at labor and labor substitution because, remember, we do outsourcing. So when you look at the results of the full year, and you'll see that labor has gone up, but if you look at it by quarter, you have seen this progressive decline as we have moved through the year as we try to simplify the processes, and we are able to get real productivity improvements.</p>
          <p>So what we're doing with those improvements, some of it's going to the bottom line, some of it we are reinvesting in new parts of the business. As you know, we're reinvesting in the Network Applications and Services business, which is a very people-intensive business. So we've been able to invest there. We have also been able to support the Sensis digital strategy which is very important,  this three-year transformation. And then we've setup Telstra Digital and now we've got the new Telstra Applications and Ventures Group, which we're setting up, which is a whole new way that we are going to be competing in the NBN world.</p>
          <p>So the program we work is very simple. It's simplified process that allows us to take costs out of the business to serve our customers better. We've got to do all three. And we have got to continue with this focus. I think it's every day, every week, every year for the future because it's just the way we want to do our business. So great progress in that area but still a lot more to be done. We all see great opportunity to do even more as we move forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of the growth businesses, let me now turn to those. Remember, there's three of them; Network Application and Services, Media, and International. I just want to briefly touch on how each one of these are going.</p>
          <p>Now, Network Applications and Services, just, I want to restate. What is it? Well, it is about outsourcing of networks from large customers where we take over the whole of the operation. It's about cloud computing, so when we take over the computing capability in the business and we put it on a shared infrastructure.</p>
          <p>It's about things like systems integration, when you rollout unified communications or you're putting in a video conferencing solution, you need someone to come and wrap everything together and integrate it to a solution. That's a very different business to just selling carriage, but it's very related.</p>
          <p>So that's what Network Applications is. It's quite simple but a very different business model because you need methodology, you need very experienced people, and you need to manage every project for profitability, as well.</p>
          <p>We're seeing great progress there. It's now a billion dollar business and it grew revenue at 10.7% and the profitability improved. The net sales pipeline is very strong as we come into the year and that sets us up well because many of these big contracts are very large and they're 10 year contracts, eight year contracts and if you get those then you get good sustainable revenues moving forward.</p>
          <p>And we also made a number of significant announcements during the year. Remember, we said, $800 million into cloud computing. That's a significant investment and that's over a five year period, but we're already well on the way and I think we're being recognized as well as one of the best cloud computing suppliers in Australia, and even throughout Asia.</p>
          <p>We launched a very important product in the small and medium business, which is called Digital business. Now, it hasn't got a lot of headlines, but it's very, very different, because it works off the IP network and it gives an integrated voice and broadband integrated solution for the small and medium business that is easy to use, easy to implement and we support it and it's a different pricing model. This is all about being ready for an NBN world. We can offer the product now and its NBN ready as soon as you put it in. Very important. So, we're already on the way to being ready to compete in the NBN world.</p>
          <p>And then, late in the year, we did the acquisition of iVision which is a video conferencing business. It was pretty small, because we're really buying capability that will allow us to integrate high definition video conferencing both in business, but that will very quickly move into the consumer home market. So, and then you're going to get the integration between business and the home in terms of how education and health services are delivered. So, this was a very strategic capability acquisition. So, all that and now we are looking at the Application &amp; Ventures Group that Dean is going to lead which is going to look at investing in new applications that will enable us to really compete in this NBN world with a differentiated cloud offering across industry verticals and horizontals. So, some really good progress there.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of International, I've been very &#x2013; well, tried be very clear on this. We want to drive value from Asia. We have got presence across Europe and in the United States but it's really in Asia where we really believe our strength is and, as I keep saying, we've been in Asia for 65 years. It's not like this is new. We do about $1.5 billion in international. It's not like this is just a new add on to the business. But I'm very pleased with the progress we have had. We brought the Reach asset, remember that was the old OTC, back into Telstra and it was a good, good way of bringing it back in and now gives us great access into Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines and that's where we need to go, where there is real growth economies and population growth is going well. So that's very important for us as we go forward. But remember it's not just about cable networks, it's about adding value around those communication networks.</p>
          <p>Also, CSL, I'm delighted to say, returned to a very strong growth profile. They had, in local currency, 19% growth, which is tremendous. Their services growth is running at 7% so I'm very pleased about the CSL results and that's been a business that we've had to really work hard at over the last few years.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of the China digital media assets, as you know we did the SouFun sale earlier in the year. I do want to just say that we are &#x2013; we are reviewing all these assets. I want to make sure that they're going to really deliver value. So, we have that portfolio under review at the moment. Okay, so last area is the media portfolio. Remember, in media portfolio we put there Sensis, BigPond, FOXTEL and of course the T-Box IP TV. So, let me just give you a quick update on how we're traveling there.</p>
          <p>So first the IPTV. We've been pleasantly surprised about the response to IPTV and T-Box. 190,000 units were sold during the year. It's been very interesting looking at the video-on-demand or download of those movies. We've now got a library around about 2,400 to 2,500 but there's been 1.8 million, 1.8 million movies downloaded since we had the product. It's a very interesting change in the way people are watching movies and we think, like Netflix in the U.S., we have a good market opportunity as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Also, we've entered into strategic partnerships with all the major movie studios and so we think we're well positioned there. We also announced FOXTEL Services on the T-Box so we've got 30 FOXTEL channels and within just the first few weeks we had a thousand people sign up on FOXTEL Channels on the T-Box, so that's been great. And of course, FOXTEL has also had a strong year. They continue to do very well. Revenue growth of 6%. EBITDA is up 15%.</p>
          <p>Now, I should quickly mention Austar. As you know, we're going through the process with ACCC and we're working closely with FOXTEL. We do really want to exercise this to its final conclusion and we really support FOXTEL in this acquisition.</p>
          <p>In terms of BigPond, we've had a strong year in BigPond. The number of actual visitors to the BigPond online and mobile sites has gone up and it's all about getting eyeballs to those sites. And our content deal with AFL will also allow us to provide AFL matches live on mobiles and tablets connected to the Next G network and also on FOXTEL via T-Box. So you can see getting content we have to put through multiple channels is very important in terms of our ongoing strategy. Then lastly, let me talk about Sensis, which is really important and I know that at the half and then we announced just a change in that business and then Bruce did a very fulsome explanation of our strategy.</p>
          <p>As you know, we are transitioning this business to digital media, sort of a local digital media company and we are on the way. For the full year, as we did guide to you, revenue decline was 6.4% and EBITDA was 9.4% and this is really the shift from print to online. However, it is a three-year transformation and we've tried to lay out to you how we think that's going to go and we are really only a few months into the sales cycle. Remember, we run the sales cycle <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:46). We get out there but we are seeing some very positive indicators as we are seeing the market reaction to the product. Firstly, the new packages have been really received well.</p>
          <p>The small and medium business, they wanted to be educated and they want to know someone who can them move into an online world. So we've been very strong there. The sign up rate, interestingly, and revenue per customer on what we call the value packages, which is a mixture of print and digital, have been very well received and the revenue per customer has been higher than we had anticipated. Because that's offsetted by the print decline, so we just got to work that different business model as it goes forward. In the second half of fiscal 2011, digital revenues grew by 12.8%. So you can see &#x2013; remember it was only 0.2% in the first half, really strong result in the second half. So, it still early days, a lot of work to be done and I think if Bruce were up here he'd say, look, some early signs, I'm not declaring victory but we got some really positive indicators here as we move forward. And I'm really confident as the board and I went through and spent some time with the whole of the Sensis team in the last few days, we're seeing good strategy, the product offering is good and now it's about execution. And that's going to take time because it's a real different business model as we move forward. So, so far so good, but more work to be done.</p>
          <p>I want to put this chart up just very briefly. This was a chart I showed you last year to try to give you some sense about what would be the lead indicators in terms of how our strategy is playing out. As you'll see up there on the chart, all of it going pretty well except for customer service. We've still got, in terms of our aspirations, while it's improving, we're not quite where we want to be. The number of complaints coming through is still a little bit higher than we wanted. We want to manage those. Not that &#x2013; but I have a different view. Complaint's good because I see there is an opportunity, an opportunity to fix and to win the customer heart in some way.</p>
          <p>However, we don't want the same level of complaints. Also, I think that there is more work we can do in terms of getting this net promoter score and net satisfaction index score really up where we need to get it. But all the other areas going well. As you can see, the revenue from business growth area is already at 19%. We may have to review that target. We may be able to push that harder.</p>
          <p>Okay, let me finish up before I hand it over to John with the guidance for next year. So, for 2012 fiscal year, we see momentum continuing through. So, our forecast, despite the market uncertainties, is that we will have low single-digit growth to both revenue and EBITDA flowing through.</p>
          <p>CapEx will continue to be around 14% of sales because we've still got some investments to do in terms of building out our capability, especially in &#x2013; as we get ready for NBN. Cash, and John will take you through, still at 4.5% to 5% and John will just give you an explanation of that because even though we're just a little bit over 5%, there are just some puts and takes on that line. I will say again, as we've said before, we are committed to pay a dividend of $0.28 per share, fully franked, as we go into the year.</p>
          <p>And in terms of capital management, I want to say again, the board is committed to reviewing our capital management strategy, but we said we have to get through NBN and then see how that plays out and then we'll come and talk to you about what we were doing.</p>
          <p>But I do want to add just one more proviso. Obviously, it is subject to what the global financial conditions will be, as you'd expect, and they going through a bit of change a the moment.</p>
          <p>A couple of last points. NBN is not expected to have a material impact on Telstra's financial results in fiscal year '12 but it will contribute to sustainable cash flow generation for Telstra in the medium term.</p>
          <p>So with that, John, let me get you up for your last set of financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David, and good morning everyone. It's great to be here today to take you through a strong set of results and particularly because they're the &#x2013; last one I'll be doing.</p>
          <p>First, I'll take you through the K-reported numbers. You've seen I believe already from David, but on the top line, sales revenue grew 0.7% to $25 billion in fiscal year 2011, including 1.8% in the second half, as the strong growth in our customer base started to come through in the revenue line. Following the strategic OpEx initiatives this financial year, operating expenses did increase by 6.8% or $970 million to $15.2 billion. EBITDA was down 6.4%, or $696 million, to $10.15 billion with margins contracting by 3 percentage points to 40.6%. Importantly in the second half, EBITDA was positive growing 0.7% as we translated as our strategic initiatives into the bottom line benefits. EBIT fell 12.4% or $809 million to $5.7 billion, with the decline in the second half just 1.6%. And profit after tax and minorities fell 16.8%, or $652 million, to $3.2 billion. Free cash flow was $5.5 billion, and declined due to lower EBITDA following the strategic initiatives. And excluding the process from the sale of SouFun and other small assets, free cash flow was $5.2 billion.</p>
          <p>And we have maintained our final fully franked ordinary dividend at $0.14 per share bringing the total for the fiscal year to $0.28. Our dividend continues, importantly, to be covered by free cash flow. On a guidance basis, so that's adjusting for some ACCC fixed line pricing changes and the impact of natural disasters, sales revenue actually grew by 1%, so real underlying performance there. Adjusting for the impairments of Octave and L Mobile and the cost of natural disasters and the impact of the Reg. change OpEx was up 6.4%, and so on a guidance basis, EBITDA declined 6%. We've not adjusted the results for FX impacts, but if we did, sales this year would increase by $161 million or another 0.6% on the revenue growth line.</p>
          <p>So, let's just take a look at product revenues. In terms of the product revenues, this slide gives you an overview of the puts and takes that have occurred during the year. The growth in mobiles, as you can see from the slide more than offset the PSTN headwind, or decline. Mobile revenues increased by $783 million or 10.7% to nearly $8.1 billion, as our strategy of retaining and growing that customer base led to the addition, as you heard David say, of 1.66 million new customers in Australia this year.</p>
          <p>The PSTN revenues, as you see can see from the slide, declined by 7.9%, or $462 million, as the usage levels continue to fall in line with global trends and the continuing trend to move to social networks and mobile, of course. The retail fixed broadband revenues increased 1.4%, though declines in wholesale broadband offset this. IP, access, and data revenues were flattish with a 16.2% increase, importantly in new technology, in the IP access. But it was offset by declines in the all legacy data products and Network Applications and Services, as David said, grew at 10.7%, or $111 million, while Sensis revenue did decline by $122 million, or 6.4%.</p>
          <p>I'm delighted, actually, to be able to talk about how well the strategic initiatives have delivered on the financial outcomes. And this slide highlights some of those key outcomes. Firstly, solid sales revenue growth in each of our three retail business units, a 6 percentage point increase in mobile EBITDA margins from the first half to the second half. And I remember many of you remarking about the 29% that we had at the half. We know, we're now back up to the 35% EBITDA margins.</p>
          <p>Continued growth in the Mobiles revenue with growth in the second half of the fiscal year at 11.4%. So that momentum, and the revenue coming from the higher customer base starting to flow through. Market share gains of 3 percentage points in Mobiles and 1 percentage point in Fixed Retail Broadband. So, all that performance in the areas that I've just discussed, really does bodes well for the future and the momentum into the fiscal year 2012.</p>
          <p>I just want to visit the <mark type="ph" /> part (31:00), not all 44 years of my career but last year, we told you &#x2013; or I told you that we intended to invest around $1 billion. That was a sort of approximation that we were talking about at this time last year to improve customer service and to grow and retain our customers and simplify our business and core processes and invest in new revenue streams. Fundamentally, that was the strategy and that's where we're investing money.</p>
          <p>Let me just now close the loop on those investments. You can see during the financial year, our OpEx increased by $970 million, so close to the approximate $1 billion that I was talking about. And this included a $670 million increase in mobile directly variable costs and network payments and $159 million increase in the new products area, so investing in our new product growth. Goods and services totaled an increase of $823 million and I said that that will be around $650 million.</p>
          <p>But as I told you in February, so as we move through the fiscal year '11, the DVCs came in a bit more above our initial expectations. However, the benefits, in terms of customer retention and growth, is clear. We did add 1.66 million domestic mobile customers, 365,000 T-Boxes and T-Hubs, and 659,000 bundled customers, much more than we expected. And as I said at the half year announcement, we kept the momentum going and we said we would absorb that within that around a $1 billion investment and we did, and remained within our guidance. So, I think that's very important. We said we &#x2013; what we would do back at the half, and we did it.</p>
          <p>Let me just move on to ARPU trends, because these are important, as well, to the top line. I want to just update you on those. And as I said, again in February at the results briefing, we have seen a modest decline in ARPUs across Mobile and Fixed Broadband, as the customers do move to our more competitively priced offerings. This is in line with our expectations and is more than offset by our customer growth.</p>
          <p>In Mobile Handheld postpaid, the impact of growth in capped plans was partly offset by the growth in smartphone penetration. And there is also an impact from MRO plans on this ARPU but that's more obviously a non-cash accounting impact. In postpaid, ARPU declines have also been driven by the growth in prepaid capped plans. But while in mobile broadband, the ongoing trend of ARPU decline is driven by price competition but also the increase in prepaid penetration in mobile broadband with tablets, etcetera.</p>
          <p>I want to again highlight that the mix in bundles, so the net mix in bundles, is revenue accretive. This is due to the new customers acquired and existing customers taking an additional product, and, of course, reduced churn as existing customers accept multi-product discounts. On churn, the activation rate for postpaid handheld mobiles, as you saw from David's slide, has fallen nearly &#x2013; from 12.4% to 8.8%.</p>
          <p>Now let me talk about some of the margins and I've already alluded to the Mobile margin but this, of course, is a critical measure for us to track our progress with our strategy. It's not just about revenue growth, it's also about EBITDA improvement. You see the Mobiles EBITDA margins declined in the first half because we invested quite heavily in the first half to retain and grow the customer base. However, that level of spending tailed off and so Mobile EBITDA margins returned in the second half to last year's levels of 35%. And you can see for the full year there, Mobile EBITDA margins were 32%, which is a solid result given the investment we made in the customer base. The Fixed Internet margins remains subdued due to the impact of some of the regulatory changes on pricing, but also the ARPU reduced because of our own competitive retail offerings in the market. As the cost base went up, as we had data allowances, it does introduce more cost into the company, of course.</p>
          <p>The PSTN margins remained relatively stable with the decline in revenue and ARPU offset by continued tight cost control. And IP, Access, and Data margins were also stable as customers continue to migrate to IP access, products from the old data legacy networks. And Sensis margins bounced back in the second half, albeit on a reduced revenue base.</p>
          <p>Let me just touch on the retail segments here because this is also important. All three retail segments had solid top line growth this financial year, and that's a great performance. Telstra Consumer and Country Wide sales revenue grew 3.6% as the strategic initiatives delivered strong growth in the customer base, including adding 0.5 million postpaid mobile customers and 160,000 fixed retail broadband customers. And in Consumer, total mobile revenue grew 12.9%, while prepaid mobile revenue share grew by several percentage points. From a profitability perspective, as I said last August, operating contribution margins bounced back in the second half to 56%, as the growth in the customer base in the first half translated into revenues in the second half.</p>
          <p>Telstra business revenue increased by 1.8%, with a growth in mobile offsetting the headwinds from PSTN declines and during the year mobile ARPUs have held up well in spite of some price rebalancing that took place for business customers. Telstra Business' revenue from IP Access and Network Applications and Services reached $300 million this year. And in recent months, the Digital Business product suite was launched to give small to medium enterprises access to unified communications. In addition to being a great set of products, the Digital Business product suite makes us NBN-ready in the SME space.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Telstra Enterprise and Government sales revenue also increased by 1.8% with mobile services revenue growth in that segment growing 11.8% and IP access growth of 14.8%. We've increased our focus in Enterprise and Government on network applications and service, and we announced we would invest more than $800 million in cloud computing over the next five years to support the growing demand for cloud services.</p>
          <p>So let's get into OpEx and it's important to explain the 6.8% operational expense increase in the year, some of it I've already talked about in terms of DVCs, but the &#x2013; it did increase $970 million to $15.2 billion. So in terms of the way we traditionally report expenses, labor, goods and services, I'll take you through those categories in a moment. But firstly, I want to explain the increase in the context of expenses incurred as a result of some of the one-off things that have happened in the year, the costs related to growth and &#x2013; which have been offset by some productivity benefits. You'll recognize that $622 million that David spoke about there. I just want to say that doesn't include avoided costs by the way, those are net costs. So, we've also, in our productivity programs, we've avoided some costs that may otherwise have occurred as well. You'll recall I said that a productivity dividend would come in the second half of fiscal year '11 and then flow through into fiscal year '12. And you'll recall I said mostly the first half in the fiscal year just gone was about getting the initiatives in to place and then second half's been about implementation, with more implementation to go.</p>
          <p>During the year, we generated productivity benefits of $622 million, as the simplification program delivered tangible results, and these benefits have been reinvested into the business to actually retain and grow our customer base and improve the things that we do to increase customer satisfaction. And this will invest in our long-term growth in the business. And as reported today, these investments are delivering.</p>
          <p>So, let me get to the traditional view of expenses. Labor expenses increased by 5.9% or $270 million, to $3.9 billion. Among factors contributing to the increases were some one-offs including incremental staff incentive plans of $93 million, that's of the far left of the chart there, and which accrued after targets were hit. So, as you heard David said, we've had good performance in increasing customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>We had some additional Labor costs associated with the natural disasters, Queensland and in New Zealand as well. We've also incurred an increase in costs due to wage inflation and other price-related factors of $123 million. You can see on the slide but we have reduced our staff numbers.</p>
          <p>And as you saw in David's slide pack regarding simplification, our domestic labor and labor substitution expenses fell through the year on a normalized basis. So at the start of the year we had to put some staff and to do some particularly things with relation to customer satisfaction, and as the productivity program and simplification cut in, that started to decline, and that's what reflected in David's slide on a quarter-by-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>With respect to Goods and Services costs, they increased 15.4%, or $823 million, primarily due to our strategy to retain and grow the customer base, so mostly directly variable cost. Cost of goods sold increased $568 million to $2.6 billion, including $426 million of mobile cost of goods sold and $71 million in other cost of good sold such as T-Boxes and T-Hubs.</p>
          <p>An increasing penetration of smartphones lifted the blended subscriber acquisition and <mark type="ph" /> rate (42:35) contracting costs by 34.7% to $212 from $157 and this investment in COGS generated more than 2 million new mobile customers in Australia and Hong Kong and the 365,000 T-Boxes and T-Hubs customers.</p>
          <p>Part of the higher COGS cost was offset by an increase of more than $300 million in mobile hardware revenue. So obviously, as we sell the handsets, the revenue comes through. We also expect ongoing additional revenues from the larger mobile base in terms of service revenue as we go forward.</p>
          <p>While talking about mobile variable costs, let me, perhaps, pre-empt a question that may come later. We did introduce zero MRO plans, so zero Mobile Repayment Options, planned in December and we have calculated that the EBITDA benefit in the half has been less than $100 million. And the zero MRO has improved mobile EBITDA margins in the second half by around 1%.</p>
          <p>Network payments increased by $135 million, or 7.5% to $1.9 billion, as our larger mobile customer base incurred higher terminating volumes as traffic was terminated on other networks. Service fees increased by nearly $100 million, with the primary driver being the corresponding increase in Pay TV revenue growth and our FOXTEL in our bundles is an important offer and it is very much a churn mitigate.</p>
          <p>So our other expense category, Service Contracts and Other Agreements sort of dominates this category. It did increase 3.7% due to the investments in some of the strategic initiatives early in the year, as I alluded to. For example, amongst the current initiatives to improve customer satisfaction were improvements to the Telstra Online portal and more after our service options for our customers with 24/7 service and weekend visits by technicians.</p>
          <p>General &amp; Administration costs fell by 3%, or $28 million, and the key driver was a $50 million reductions in IT costs due to renegotiated licenses and lower leasing arrangements. And bad and Doubtful Debts declined 7.9%,  which is a great result. We invested heavily in credit management and implemented a series of initiatives to minimize bad debts, and these have included some early intervention of overdue accounts by proactively engaging with our customers and some more sophisticated credit assessments in our front of house.</p>
          <p>So cash &#x2013; cash and accrued CapEx. Free cash flow was $5.5 billion this year, which included $324 million cash proceeds from the sale of assets of which SouFun was the largest. And as I indicated to you at the half, the free cash flow was weighted towards the second half, as you can see by the coloring on the above in the slide, and the timing is because of the CapEx cycle, our incentive payments to staff, and some other cyclical factors.</p>
          <p>Importantly for investors, free cash flow levels continue to comfortably cover the current dividend and interest commitments. In respect of CapEx, accrued operating CapEx was $3.4 billion, down $1.8 million -1.8% sorry, and $61 million. The biggest driver of the decline was 20%, or $146 million decline in what we call the business improvement CapEx driven by a lot of spend on IT projects as we still come down off of our transformation program.</p>
          <p>Just the impact on NBN, just quickly. As we said the impact of NBN and our financials won't be significant in fiscal year '12. And I want to help you to start thinking about the impact of NBN on our financials in coming years. In addition to our usual reporting, we intend to provide extra information to help you model and track the progress of our agreements with NBN. So as NBN is rolled out, there will be additional reporting lines for physicals, revenues and expenses.</p>
          <p>On our revenues side, we plan to report separately for key items including disconnections to NBN and infrastructure payments. And on the expense side, there will be NBN access costs and some additional remediation and ongoing maintenance costs that we will report. And we also plan to update you on key physicals such as the number of PSTN disconnected and the NBN access lines taken by Telstra customers. And of course, we will continue to report the legacy fiscal such as PSTN, and ULL lines, and LSS, and so on. In our results announcement next February, we hope to give you more detail on the additional reporting we plan to have going forward.</p>
          <p>So, back to the guidance that David had up before and a bit of an explanation. Over the next fiscal year, we expect a positive momentum from the strategy we're on to continue. We expect both revenue growth and EBITDA growth to be in the low single-digits. CapEx to sales will continue to be around 14% of sales and the reason for that is that we do have to make some investments in being NBN-ready in terms of our interface with NBN but also taking some good product to market to encourage people to stay with us or come over to us in terms of our NBN offerings.</p>
          <p>And free cash flow guidance is for between $4.5 billion and $5 billion. As always, and this is an important point, this free cash flow guidance does anticipate $500 million of investing capital spend. In fiscal year '11 we only spent $40 million, which clearly did contribute to our strong free cash flow result in fiscal year '11.</p>
          <p>As announced last November, it is also the board's intention to maintain a $0.28 fully franked dividend for fiscal 2012, of course subject to the normal process of declaration and no unexpected material events. And the NBN, as I said, not expected to impact this guidance at all. But I do want you to note that we have moved to a total revenue guidance measure. It's previously been sales revenue. And there is nothing sinister in this, but given that, going forward, much of the income from NBN arrangements will be booked as Other Revenue and not Sales Revenue, so the decommissioning part of the revenue received, we have made the change, you see, so that in future years we can capture that in our guidance and you can understand what's going on.</p>
          <p>So thank you for that, and I will just turn it back to David to wrap up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Great set of results, and thanks for your presentation. Okay.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to do just at the end here is just to give you bit of a sense of where we are at with NBN and then we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>As you know, we have signed definitive agreements both with the government and NBN Co., and that was done in June. And we also submitted the structural separation undertaking with the ACCC, which was done a few weeks ago. I mean these have actually been really important milestones to get behind us and have taken a lot of work right across the company to get that done, and looking forward, we are now working on this expansion memorandum to get to our shareholders so you can understand the transaction and the basis for the board's recommendation to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>It has really been a &#x2013; I can't stress this enough &#x2013; a critical few months for us. I mean it's a lot of work to get this thing done. And submitting the structural separation undertaking working with the ACCC in that process was really important. We did it very differently than the way we've done it before. So now we're currently focused on working with the ACCC to get the approval and get these EM's out so that we hopefully can get it to shareholders at the 18th of October, at the AGM.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to do is just focus on what we think the three high level real benefits are to this transaction. And I'm not going <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:02) because as you would expect that will be in EM. So firstly, the agreement should provide a better financial outcome as compared to alternatives for the company and it will really contribute to sustainable free cash flow over that medium term and that is a very important consideration.</p>
          <p>Secondly, getting to a more stable regulatory environment is very important. If we can get to a more stable regulatory environment it allows us to get on and focus on the business and our customers. And that is a very important thing to Telstra. And then looking at it from my perspective, having more strategic flexibility in what we do with cash and where we go to, is a real positive for us and it allows us as I've said before, to focus on growth opportunities and how we simplify the business, I do want to also to stress that we have to be conscious about what protections we've got in the future. I've mentioned these before and it's important just to mention them again.</p>
          <p>Remember, we get this long-term contractual commitment from NBN Co. for structure; and remember, at any point should there be any changes, we have protection for that going forward. That's the first one. We've talked about the rollout termination payment of up to $500 million, now that's in the event that NBN ceases its rollout &#x2013; after it's got to 20% of the 93% of premises in Australia. So that only kicks at that 20% level.</p>
          <p>And also, it was a very important right that John negotiated. Remember, that we can continue to operate the copper network, the fixed-line business, in areas where the NBN fiber access does not go to. So, we call this the natural hedge, because that's very important to us, and you've got to factor that into your consideration.</p>
          <p>So, it's important to remember as you think about this transaction, that at the moment, this is legislated government policy. And NBN Co. is now an operating business. It's commenced it's rollout of NBN and it's already started to provide services in a small number of areas, trial areas.</p>
          <p>We are obliged to assess our options against presumption of alternative policies. We have to look at what's in front of us today or we can't assume NBN is not going to be built as planned. We can only look at the alternatives in light of current legislation and provide maximum flexibility in light of any potential changes in the future, and that's the way we have looked at this transaction.</p>
          <p>What I do also want to just touch on is we have already doing a lot of work about our preparedness in terms of each of &#x2013; go-to-market segments.</p>
          <p>But we'll be talking through more of this in Investor Day but let me just quickly touch on each of the four key areas and just give you some sense about what we think the implications will be. In Telstra Consumer and Country Wide, obviously NBN <mark type="ph" /> residences (55:22) will make a change in how we provide fixed services to our customers. But we also offer a lot more to our customer than just fixed broadband services, with our world leading mobile network but also NBN is going to provide us with the opportunity to further build product innovation into our offering go-to-market and that's what we expect we're going to work on at the moment and of course the bundling services will be very important around content and things like that.</p>
          <p>In Telstra Business, we've already talked about the wonderful Digital Business product and we're going to start to build out that product now because that is the way of the world to move to IP networks and an integrated service, and that would have happened with NBN or without NBN. And you go quite across the world, it's just a matter of the timing of when it happens and how you get there financially.</p>
          <p>In terms of Enterprise and Government, the truth is that many of our Enterprise and Government customers today already use fiber. So the impact on the Enterprise and Government sector is probably more upside than downside and we see great opportunities going forward.</p>
          <p>Of course, Telstra Wholesale, it will have a significant impact on those revenues because we have provided wholesale services across the copper access network and of course they will be disconnected over time. However, all the infrastructure payments from NBN will also flow into Wholesale, so there is some balancing effect as we move forward.</p>
          <p>So, that's just an important set of considerations, we'll take you through more at Investor Day, but I want you to know that we're already working diligently in each of those market segments.</p>
          <p>So let's just briefly touch on the structural separation undertaking in the migration plan that we submitted to the ACCC. In our undertakings, we have really tried to make a genuine attempt to take notice of the concerns raised by the industry and ACCC. So this issue is really an attempt to address some of these concerns and the points raised in the ministerial instruments. This is a substandard proposal and we have really spent a lot of time trying to think through how we could put something that would be acceptable to the ACCC and the industry but also not drive a lot of change within the company except than how we are really more transparent and provide more equivalents. So a few points to note. This is a very important point. We have not been asked to functionally separate and we are &#x2013; but we are committed to providing equivalents and transparency. They are very, very different things very, very different.</p>
          <p>In terms of our interim equivalents and transparency there are seven key areas that we've &#x2013; you see on the chart behind me that we think really do make a substantive difference and they're not window dressing. They are real, real offerings of change. So we're working closely with ACCC with a view of obtaining acceptance to the structural separation undertaking before the AGM. However, I've got to be clear, if the ACCC has not given approval for this issue, which as you know, is a condition precedent, we may still take the decision for this transaction to our shareholders at the AGM, but the commencement of the agreement will still be subject to gaining the necessary approvals from the ACCC. So we're trying to balance this as we go through because there is a still a lot of work to be done.</p>
          <p>Okay, so let's try to wrap up now. So I want to leave you really what I think are the key messages from both John's and my presentation. It's great to have exceeded guidance. It's a really pleasing result for us. We have basically done what we said we're going to do.</p>
          <p>The customer growth achieved in the year is now translating into financial benefits and we returned to EBITDA growth in the second half, which is great, and we see that momentum continuing through into next year.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me now ask John to come join me on the stage and we will be pleased to take your questions. So..</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks <mark type="inaudible" />. First question, Ian Martin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian Martin, Royal Bank of Scotland. First of all, congratulations, John, on your contributions now for 43 years and it's good to see you going out on a recovery note. I've got two questions. First relating to the guidance. I think we based upon an extrapolation of the recovery in the second half. But of course consumer confidence was improving through that period and it's more or less evaporated in the month since then. So I wonder whether you've taken that consumer situation into account, and to what extent, if the wider economic situation deteriorates further, does that become an unexpected event that might lead to a decline in the guidance, and particularly, the board's view about the dividend for the next year? First question.</p>
          <p>Second question, John's indicated the financial impact at the EBITDA level of the change in wholesale prices, comes out at about $14 million, I think, in EBITDA for the second half. Presumably, that's going to grow as contracts unwind or are completed. Several hundred million dollars in value. You know when you look at the way the ACCC <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:01:01), it looks a very arbitrary assessment about the value of the network and so almost a welfare transfer from Telstra shareholders to other companies, some of whom have returns on invested capital several times higher than Telstra's. Given that, and that you're such a long way apart in value and that that issue affects the value of the natural hedge, have you got an obligation to challenge that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And let me try to take the first one. I'll let John touch on the second and I will add a bit of comments at the end. First, in terms of the guidance, yeah, we are very conscious of consumer confidence at the moment. It's definitely taken a bit of a battering, but when you look at our business and the customer volume going through, and the increased change of cap plans and the way data, our dependency on usage is getting less. So, there is sort of a bit of a natural protection. Now, of course, with bad debt at the other end and there's some things we have to consider in there. But we feel pretty comfortable with the guidance as it is. It's prudent. I don't think we have overstretched ourselves and I think that's probably the right place to be in. So, yes it's picked up. Usage on the fixed line network is down, but it's been going down, mobile usage continues to be pretty strong even the last few weeks, so it's interesting, is the use of mobile a discretionary expense item anymore, is another interesting question. The use of the Internet is still very strong and enterprise business and business are pretty strong. Small and medium business we have seen a little bit of pain in the small and medium business markets. So, we've just got to watch that as we go forward. But overall, Ian, I think the guidance is prudent and okay. So we feel pretty comfortable.</p>
          <p>John, do you want to talk about the wholesale and valuation and I will give you a few general comments on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, and just on the economy and the economic, I mean we have assumed a fairly conservative consumer outlook and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:03:02) pay outlook, but &#x2013; obviously we haven't assumed a catastrophic event, and so we have been, as David has called it, prudent. I'd say it's conservative.</p>
          <p>With respect to the wholesale and the impact this year in flow-through, we've already factored in how the price reductions for fixed line will flow through into the year and you're right, it's much bigger than forty in this fiscal year but we have factored that through into our guidance. But not factored any further change that the ACCC may deliver, you talk about their consideration now is based on a return on asset model and we believe that that will deliver to us a lot more copper price stability going forward.</p>

          <p>Are you in a situation where you've got to rely on that natural hedge that copper is used for longer? That that approach would be robust?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because it's still going to be the same asset base that &#x2013; calculation, right? Now, I can't predict a change of mind by the ACCC, but I can deal with the facts that is that return on asset base and that asset base calculation will continue and that's the basis of their assumption going forward. And that it will bring us copper price stability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And that's where I was going to go to too. I mean the &#x2013; this model that ACCC. We've spent a lot of time with them on that and we seem to have got to a point of agreement of how they approach it. We understand it. So that's been &#x2013; and then the other one that's sitting out there is the mobile terminating access rates and up, down, and so we've still got work to do there, but that will not be for a while. So the copper base actually probably has a little bit more stability than we have had in previous years, but we need to watch it carefully.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Richard Eary with UBS. Just three questions. Just looking at the return to growth in the second half and stepping back to the investors day last year when you put a slide up there with trying to project EBITDA back to where you were in FY '10. Does this result give you still comfort around actually hitting those targets in FY '13 or are those targets moved? That would be the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is in terms of actually looking at the mobile subscriber base of 1.6 million, I think if you look at the postpaid it's sort of nearly 10% new growth of the base. Could you give us a feel in terms of actually how much the base is been re-contracted through the last 12 months and a view in terms of gross additions, not just in terms of net additions. And then the last thing this is, if you can give us a clue in terms of, actually, you mentioned $0.5 billion of additional investment CapEx within the guidance. Can you just explain on that and whether that was going to include any sort of pension top ups that may be necessary given the current market conditions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me do one and two. Have you got the numbers on one and three, and have you got the number two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me go to the first one. Look, we have given no guidance on full year '13 as you know, Richard, but yes, we see the recovery is what we want it to be. But we have given no guidance there, so I &#x2013; obviously the investment was to get a return, not to do anything about that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the CapEx, now that's just straight investment CapEx. The top-up is handled separately so that's just what we have assigned in terms of M&amp;A activity. And we again &#x2013; I mean, we are not &#x2013; and just like this year we will acquire new capability where appropriate. We put through all our M&amp;A activities through a lot of <mark type="ph" /> services (107:46) in terms of what it means to buy back shares or what return on equity would be. We do all that. And so we're pretty disciplined in that area. But we are putting aside because we have got to keep building the business going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Normally we don't speak to gross numbers. But just to give you a shape of our churn, we had a 35% reduction in postpaid churn in the year and that's the largest <mark type="ph" /> reshape (1:09:09) pure net acquisition and re-contracting, which is a really positive statement. As we started the year, we were probably acquiring one new customer probably for every five new re-contracts. Ratios probably now it sits at 1 to 1.5 so that all the work we're doing with customer services, and servicing issues we haven't seen the need to aggressively re-contract customers and affords us the right to actually grow new customers at a higher rate that we would normally do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But just within that is that if you look at the DVC growth this year, if the re-contracting is now started to come in DVC growth, depending on basically what the customer growth shouldn't necessary grow to a level that we're seeing this year or has an opportunity to contract.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's an element of rebalancing the portfolio. We had an aggressive acquisition year this year, we won't have the same level of acquisition in FY '12 and we need to take care of the 2 million customers that we just acquired, so that's the strategy going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Christian Guerra from Goldman Sachs. Firstly &#x2013; congratulations on the results. And I have three questions for you. Firstly, on that change in accounting policy in mobiles the benefit you said was about $100 million to the EBITDA line which is a little bit more than I was expecting I must admit. Can you talk about what that means for FY '12 EBITDA. Secondly on your mobiles business, a phenomenal result in the second half. You actually did better net adds in the second half versus the first half and yet the <mark type="ph" /> cokes (1:10:40) were lower in the second half, so I'd like to understand what you're thinking in terms of the competitive environment over the next 12 months. And my other question is on your expectations for labor cost growth in FY '12? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, MRO I'll leave to John, but the only comment I'll make on the MRO, we want to &#x2013; MRO is not just a financial way of handling mobile acquisition and re-contracting. Customers have different needs, so we're going to continue with a mix of subsidy in MRO and balance that out going forward. It's not one or the other. We've going to continue with the mix. So, but John will take you through the MRO numbers.</p>
          <p>In terms of the outlook for mobiles, look, I think it's going to be pretty competitive going forward, but so far we have, it's been a pretty rational environment. Obviously, I think it's no secret that Vodafone has had a tough time of it, and therefore we'll be conscious to try to eat back some of the customers they've missed, but I mean, no longer going to postpaid plans so it's going to take a while for that to work through. But I think that we've got a great network and we are well positioned but it will be competitive. But I don't think it's going to be an all out price war. I'd be really disappointed if that's the case.</p>
          <p>Okay. In terms of labor going through to next year, I'll let John also give you a little bit more color on the actual numbers, but we've been managing that very tightly labor and labor substitution because that's really what we've got to look at going forward. It's really about how we can drive the simplification programs out but we've also got normal CPI increases in there etcetera. So, John you can maybe take them through that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. On the MRO and so we all know what we're talking about here. The zero MRO is where the subsidy of the handset is taken to the revenue line, spread over hardware and services revenue, and over the life of the contract. So that's what MRO does. By the way, we have still many MRO plans where the customer does repay the cost of the handset and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:03) MRO , so we have a series of plans.</p>
          <p>And, but we have restricted the MRO zero plans to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:12) and on $59 plan, Gordon, so on the $59 plan in this year it started off on a lower plan, we moved it up to a higher plan and ended on a restricted <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:22). So, to answer your question, the impact will be slightly higher because you've got a bit of a flow through of the whole year, fiscal year 2011, but remember, as Gordon just said we will have fewer net adds in fiscal year '12 initially. So, slightly higher but...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as an impact on the EBITDA, right? Because, remember in the first half of this year we had just subsidies, second half of &#x2013; from December we have MRO zero that took it up to the revenue line. So and what you are really doing, you're splitting the subsidy over two years instead of one. That' s the effect of it right? Your subsidy's taken in the revenue line but instead of only one year it's taken over two. So then, it's not materially higher.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With labor, we'll continue -redundancy is going to increase a little bit and because, as we continue our productivity program, there will be still a number of staff leave the company. But we've got to also &#x2013; so, in labor dollars, your total labor expense there is redundancy and so it increases about 50, 60 or so. And we've got to calculate the 4% labor increase so you probably see a marginal increase in labor costs because of those two things; higher redundancy and a 4% wage increase.</p>

          <p>We have one last question here in Melbourne and we'll go to the phone lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah David, Tony Wilson, Evans &amp; Partners. Could you just take us through the revenue proposition at census for a customer that is thinking about migrating from the print product to just the digital product. It might be nice to think that the print product is going to be around for many more decades, but I think the reality is that's not going to be the case, it's all going to be migrate. And I ask the question in the context of revenues declining $110 million in the year and EBIT declining $140 million, I just wonder if we are on that precipice at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll get Bruce to add a little bit more but I don't think anyone is under any illusions about the print product will continue to decline. We will try to keep it going as long as we possibly can, but it's just a reality we see in every other market around the world. Bruce and the team have done an outstanding job to keep it going a little bit longer and generate a lot of good cash for the company. But as you move from print to digital it's a very different proposition and what is different to anyone else out there we can offer you print and digital at the same time which is this value pack. So what we try to do is to add digital in to the pack, probably about the similar way <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:16:35) and then we transition them to the digital world. But we are not planning for print revenues to stabilize. We think the declines are going to continue. What we've got to now do is to work on this new model. And of course, with digital, you charge every month rather than on an annual basis and that's a real difference as well. So, we have got a lot of work to do because it is a very different business model. Companies around the world have been through this transition and have come out as a really online digital business, quite strong EBITDA and very strong multiples. So it's a very &#x2013; it's a different business model and we think we can get back to there. So Bruce, why don't you make a few comments because I think it's better to come from Bruce because he's out there every day talking to real customers about what's really happening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that sums it up pretty well, David. Well, it is a process, which I described I think in February or March, briefly, where we're seeing the revenue change from just purely print into this digital world. It's a three-year transition. We're about three or four months into that.</p>
          <p>And I've got to say, the early signs are the existing customer base are moving more quickly into the digital packages. They're liking that proposition.</p>
          <p>So we are seeing early signs of print revenue just continuing on that constant decline that we've seen for the last couple of years. That will be, I think, as we said, three years until we get that cross-over point and we get the digital revenue growth offsetting the print decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that effectively mean we should be assuming ongoing revenue declines similar to what we've seen in the last 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. Yeah. You should.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And similarly EBIT declines as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly. You should. And if you want to look at where we want to get to, look at <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:18:31) or any other &#x2013; yeah. So &#x2013; and that's sort of probably a couple of years ahead of us, a year to two years ahead of us.</p>
          <p>And if we can stay to this local digital media advertising to small and medium business, if we can get that transition right &#x2013; but the models change. The EBITDA margins actually remain pretty much the same, and then valuations are something different that you guys can worry about.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much guys. Just three quick questions. If I can just press on directories first. At the census strategies day you indicated mid-single digit revenue declines through FY '12 and FY '13. And I just wonder, in the context of rapidly declining consumer confidence trends, to what extent you're still comfortable with this? I know that you've just said continuing the same run rate but this seems difficult given consumer confidence.</p>
          <p>Then on mobile, obviously competition increasing into FY '12. Will we see mobile EBITDA margins expand? Or are you prepared to increase your marketing spend again there to defend your share? And then, finally, just on tax, have you got any update on the tax ruling from the ITI with regards to treatment of NBN cash flows? I'm assuming they're mainly coming through the P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let John talk to you on the tax one. On the directories and the consumer confidence, look, we are out there at the moment. It's changed a bit in the last week, but we are feeling pretty comfortable where we are at. But I'll let Bruce comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, the customers we are serving, they're not all discretionary suppliers. If you're having a wedding and you want a marquee, or if you need your plumbing fixed, a lot of these things have to happen, irrespective of consumer confidence.</p>
          <p>And we're also not seeing the small business sector as a whole decreasing its advertising budget. Yes, it's profitability has been going down for the last three years. And so, they're being very cautious. And they're moving quite aggressively from traditional media &#x2013; not just print, but TV, radio all the traditional media &#x2013; into the digital world. That's where the opportunity is.</p>
          <p>So we feel quite comfortable that there will be ups and downs and spurts and so on through that three year period. But I think the guidance is about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And while consumer confidence is down, Australia is still a great country in terms of the businesses and the economy has got lots going for it.</p>
          <p>Now I understand confidence is down. We've got global markets sort of mainly driven by Europe, that &#x2013; and that does impact. But it's about what's discretionary, what's not. So we are watching it closely, but we feel pretty comfortable where we're at.</p>
          <p>In terms of mobile and competition, we are &#x2013; look, as we have always had in our mobiles business, it's &#x2013; we are still driving differentiation on it, we're still building out, our coverage proposition is second to none, we're moving through the LTE and that's giving great differentiation and it does take a long time for people to catch up when you've built that sort of enormous capital investment in a very large network. So we have a very strong proposition.</p>
          <p>The feedback from customers who have come back to Telstra is very positive. We do a lot of surveying and they're saying I've forgotten how good it is to be on the Telstra network. And so yes, we think that we deserve a premium, but we're very conscious of driving adequate returns from that investment as well. We do not plan to give up share, but we're not going to lose share and get away on one side and we're just going to manage it carefully. So we want &#x2013; I mean we're all about EBITDA growth and we'll manage that mix as we go forward and it always has been our strategy and will continue to be. We will continue to drive for excellence in that mobile network even as we've got a lot of people come across we had to do a lot in managing different cells as you got customers coming on to one cell and making sure the performance is right so <mark type="ph" /> Brendan and his team (01:22:52). We look at every cell to make sure it's a great experience and some times we are bit months behind but we catch up but we are not going to allow that differentiation to get away on us. So we're going to stand to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:23:04) on that one. Do you want to talk about tax?</p>

          <p>Yeah, the only difference in what you said is that we may. We just got &#x2013; we have got to work through this to see how far they get through this period, but what I'm really seeing is that we are considering that as we got because we think we got to keep the momentum going here, otherwise it's just going to get too complicated. So, what I said, we may consider doing that so as we're going through the EM process looking at the options but we have not, the board's not made their final decision but I want you to know that there is that option. Now, of course, what we need to make sure is that we sort shareholder approval that they have, you will have enough confidence that we would &#x2013; whatever we negotiate with ACCC subsequently is in line with what we've put into this issue. Obviously you can't guarantee that because there's lot of back and forth, but under what constraints would we put. So yeah that's what we're saying because we don't want to run an AGM and then we might be calling an EGM two weeks later so that'll be crazy. So we're just trying to work this thing through. The ACCC is going to go through their process. We respect that, but we want to help them come to the conclusion as quickly as possible.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. I had two questions. First of all just looking at the NAS product line, half of the growth in that seems to be coming from the NBN construction activity. I was wondering if you could talk about what sort of contracts you have in place to drive the top line in NAS on next year around the NBN. That's the first question. And the second one is on mobile handsets subsidies. The number of handset subsidies for the half year looks like it's about $175 million. That's well below what you've done historically. My understanding was that the MRO was contributing at the ARPU level, not at the OpEx level. If you can just explain what's the expected trend in the handset costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me take the NAS one. In the NAS, we recognized Network Construction business with some of the NBN but our confidence going forward is not based on any NBN construction work at all. It's more based around the contracts we've signed in the last four months. So to me we continue to do unique build for the BHP, Rio &#x2013; is all in there too; not just NBN. NBN we did Brunswick, but that was pretty much about it. So it's not significant. More of our growth is coming from taking over the management of complex networks with our large customers, putting our IP telephony managed services in small and medium businesses. That's where the growth will be in the future. And on the MRO do you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll just explain a couple of things Sameer, I guess there was $490 million increase year-on-year on subscriber acquisition and re-contracting costs. $136 million of it came from volume and $354 million from rights so what I mean by right is the mix change in smartphones and a few are Sim only but you were asking a question about subsidies in MRO comparisons. The actual increase in subsidized volumes in fiscal year 2010 was 35% growth and in fiscal year 2011 25% growth. So the actual subsidized volume went down but MRO volume went up. MRO volume in fiscal year 2010 was only 11% and fiscal year 2011, 31.7%, so  given the treatment of MRO zero and so on, that's why you're seeing subsidies changing in volume and dollars. So, it's a mix change in what's subsidized and what's on MRO.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a couple from me. Just firstly, on the mobile margins again, just that 35% in the second half is that a number that you see sort of sustainable going forward? It's my first one, and secondly, just if you can talk a little bit about CapEx for LTE. I guess you are starting to spend a bit now but what do you thinking that's going to be over the whole roll out and over what sort of what timeframe will we see LTE CapEx coming through?. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>LTE CapEx is in all existing numbers. We've already &#x2013; it was spent in full year &#x2013; in fiscal year '11, but we will build it out and what we will do is move HSPA+ further out and we'll build out to LTE so it just within the envelope, no big lumpy amounts. What you should, though, be aware of is we do think about spectrum and we're doing LTE on 1800 Mhz. We've got the spectrum stuff coming in..</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>'13, so that's the one that is the lumpy one that you need to be aware of and have we actually said how much we think? No. So you can work out how much you think that will cost. So &#x2013; do you want to handle the first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mobile EBITDA margins. We said that we expected to improve margins and so the full year is 32% and second we finished with 35% on the quarter. We expect to able to maintain that sort of margin level and the reason we do is that we are as people move to data and there's a lot of data over the network nowadays. One of the reasons we've gone to LTE early and quickly to drive the cost of delivering data across mobile networks down, in order that we can increase allowances and maintain those sort of margins. So our expectation, and if you look around the world, mobile operators are up around that sort of level and we think we can maintain that level of mobile margins.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning and thanks for your time. John, enjoy every minute of your well-deserved retirement. Just first question on the FY '12 guidance. Just looking at your run rate on the cost in the second half, it strikes me that just based on your FY '12 guidance that basically still assumes about 6% sort of OpEx growth in FY '12, which is well ahead of your current run-rate. So you are doing better than that at the moment. So, I'm just wondering, the degree of conservativism built into that guidance particularly on the cost side? Second question, just on the capital management side, you got $2.6 billion of cash sitting on your balance sheet.</p>
          <p>You are probably generating about $1 billion in excess free cash flow above your current dividend payment. I'm just trying to, without preempting the decision of the board obviously, but just so I can get a sense of the quantum of capital management you'd be thinking about or the range and also how does franking comes into the picture and more broadly on capital management. Do you also think about de-gearing the balance sheet ahead of this sort of migration during the migration to NBN or what are the sort of considerations let's say on a two, three year view that you'd be putting into this decision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably all of the above. Look I'm sorry if we &#x2013; you're sort of &#x2013; questions in the area. I mean very good questions, in fact, that plus many other questions are we trying to think through about how to really prudently and appropriately manage capital. Now, also now trying to look at what market's going to do over the next two years and what our debt we've got to raise. So we got a lot of considerations. We've got to get through NBN first.</p>
          <p>Look you know that we've always had a policy around fully franked dividend. That's where we want to be, we've got to look at that. We know that dividends are very important to our shareholder base but we think that we'll have some options going forward. All of the above are being considered and we'll, at the right time, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:33:21) we'll come and give you our thinking. I want you to know that it is a very actively discussed item at the moment.</p>
          <p>John, do you want to add anything more on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well your first point about expense growth. I'm not too sure how you calculated your 6%, but I can assure you that expense growth will not be that high in this fiscal year. And so let me just put that to rest.</p>
          <p>With respect to a dividend payment, the board has committed to the $0.28 in the fiscal year '11 and fiscal year '12, and that it'd be fully franked. I've said on a number of occasions that in the year just gone and the year we are now in, fiscal year '12, that franking credits will be tight. And it will be the case, I expect, the tax paid in this fiscal year to be very similar level to the tax paid in the fiscal year just gone. And tax paid generates a franking credit. And therefore the $0.28 can be franked, again, keeping a very tight watch over the franking credits.</p>
          <p>But capital management, all your capital management questions are a matter for the board's consideration post NBN. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But clearly you should be confident that we are looking at every, every possible dimension and factor during this whole capital management. And if you have any ideas, give them to Ben.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. I think we have four more questions from the phones speaker, I think. <mark type="ph" /> Justin (1:35:10) are you next?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Justin. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, guys. Just a couple of questions. First on the fixed internet business. I wondering if you can just talk about what happened in the fourth quarter. I mean, obviously subs declined. And whether that was are you taking your foot off the accelerator in terms of pricing or what the dynamics there is?</p>
          <p>And second to that, in terms of the margin profile and what we should expect in FY '12. Obviously, EBITDA margins came down quite significantly.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just where your priorities lies with FOXTEL and getting a deal done. Would you prioritize owning FOXTEL and aggressively bundling it with your fixed line products over potentially supporting a FOXTEL Austar deal, which could inevitably see you creating your single biggest competitor, if they are enabled to offer broadband and telephony services themselves? So just a comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll answer the second one. John do you want to take Justin through the anomaly we had in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Justin, in the fourth quarter of the physicals for Fixed Broadband or Fixed Internet, we did cancel 65,000 customer or SIOs due to the &#x2013; given the fact they weren't paying customers. So we <mark type="ph" /> pried up (1:36:59) our base.</p>
          <p>And so if we hadn't done that, we would have &#x2013; instead of the 158,000, we would have had a gain of 223,000. So it is a bit of an aberration in the data. So don't take the fourth quarter performance as the underlying performance in Fixed Broadband. Should look at the first three quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you want to comment on the margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the margin profile, Fixed Broadband, the margins come under pressure because of the amount of allowances used and so on. But again, we're looking at the cost base of delivering <mark type="ph" /> data via services (1:37:50) over the fixed line network, and again, we're trying to maintain our margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, FOXTEL. I think it's important, Justin, you understand how we think about FOXTEL.</p>
          <p>FOXTEL is a premium content provider using a pay TV model, primarily on cable and satellite. Therefore, our 50% ownership of that is really important, and the way we offer that to our customer is we use a bundle, which in &#x2013; bundles have proven very helpful for us in reducing churn. And now I think we've got how many &#x2013; what's that number of FOXTEL customers on bundles? I think it's a little bit over 0.5 million or so. Really important. Is that 1 million? That's 0.5 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, total bundles is over 1 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, now I am thinking about the FOXTEL bundle. So that's first thing.</p>
          <p>When you think about T-Box or the IPTV transfer, remember what we have done is we are taking 30 of the FOXTEL channels and basically distributing them through an IP service. So what -you are just using a different distribution technology to get that same content out, and we use a subscription model.</p>
          <p>So both of them will co-exist, but I do not see them as competitive. There are some other options with IPTV that you don't get in satellite and in cable because you can go interactive. IP is an in interactive experience, so as you use that technology, you can do interactive ad business, you pop them up when you want to.  So you can do both a pay TV model and an advertising model, and that creates &#x2013; that's why <mark type="ph" /> FOXTEL has IP Junior (01:39:21). Also, we sourced a lot of the movie content from FOXTEL. So we think this is a collaborative partnership with different distribution technologies.</p>
          <p>Remember ,we do FOXTEL on mobiles, which is another distribution alternative, and when we did the IFL rights, FOXTEL led and we came along. So, I think that we see this as a complementary type of approach and we are going to continue to do that as we go forward.</p>
          <p>You asked me the question, would I do more with FOXTEL? Well, I suppose the question is the price and what's the price? But obviously we look at all alternatives, but today we are very pleased with the partnerships we have and <mark type="ph" /> we work well with years and consolidate (01:40:00) and we are going to continue on that model. But we will look at all options as we go forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Congratulations on the results. Two questions from me. Firstly, in terms of guidance. Just looking at your second half EBITDA growth of 0.7%, should we take that as a rough indication of momentum for FY '12 or do you think there is opportunity to increase that growth? And if you could just give us your thoughts around the key risks and opportunities that will put you towards the upper and lower end of that guidance range.</p>
          <p>My second question is on mobile ARPU. Still seeing aggressive declines in wireless broadband ARPU, down 28% in the second half. Just want to get your thoughts in terms of where you see that ARPU stabilizing and when? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, I guide to low single digits and I suppose you can interpret that how you want to.</p>
          <p>Look, I think that that's a good platform from which to launch for the next year. Is that right, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's the &#x2013; so look we obviously want to do as well as we possibly can but we're not giving specific guidance.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of the key risks for next year, well look, as with all these things, we are concerned about the markets. Consumer confidence I think we've talked about. Ian asked a question earlier on, though we are not seeing any real pull through on that at the moment.</p>
          <p>We are concerned about and thinking about competition and pricing. What's going to happen in pricing. But the early signs for the last three months has been pretty reasonable.</p>
          <p>And I think that &#x2013; I'm sure there will be some sharpening of pencils in certain areas, but remember, this is all about targeting the right segments you want to go after, and really being considerate about how you can differentiate their offerings. So I see that as a ongoing challenge.</p>
          <p>I think for the industry, the bigger challenge here is the expectation of customers on unlimited data plans. It is not sustainable, and it is not good for the industry. And as voice calling goes to IP, how you manage that transition and move from access to usage.</p>
          <p>Now the big challenges of the industry around the world is really focused on. You've seen the U.S. go to unlimited plans, but they're all coming back now to more, I think, sensible approach.</p>
          <p>You saw in Holland, a disruptive play with &#x2013; on SMS. Free SMS. But it was only for a year before you start to have to pay for it. And you've seen us respond with all included SMS to try to get ahead of some of these things. So we look at disruptive plays where someone can come into the market and just start to completely change the model.</p>
          <p>Obviously, you've got Microsoft going with Skype. You got Vonage. So how's that's going to play out and what's the true impact. So we're already starting to look at different pricing models to cover that off now. That's why access pricing and all included usage is very important as we move forward. So we see many challenges, but we do think we're starting to see some options going forward to manage this, and so we can hold our returns at an acceptable level.</p>
          <p>Wireless broadband ARPU has declined. Well, yes that has been the challenge in the industry. What I think I'd bring you back to is &#x2013; what you've got to look at is actually the profitability of that revenue stream. And John alluded to why we went to LTE. LTE was not just a price play it was a unit cost play, because LTE manages that data on the wireless network far more efficiently, and therefore it allows &#x2013; gives us some options going forward.</p>
          <p>I would like to see ARPUs start to stabilize in the wireless broadband market, but we need to remain to be competitive, and we are not going to just let that sort of get away on us. So I'm not giving a prediction on that because it's really a matter of really how the competition plays out. So it's very important market for us.</p>
          <p>Do you want to add anything that, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, just have to be a little bit careful with this year because, yeah certainly, there was a move to prepaid, which caused the ARPU to decline. But we did stop charging for excess usage, and that's also had an impact. So that one will flow into fiscal year '12, but nevertheless, it's still pressure on prepaid ARPUs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and of course, that's all tied up with the &#x2013; making sure &#x2013; bill shock and trying to look at the customer experience. So we do some throttling back and then hopefully the customers says, hey, I want more, give me a bigger plan. We're trying to make it easier for the customer to upgrade. So a lot of different models going on here at the same time.</p>
          <p>So that's it, Ben.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, and thanks John, and David for your time this morning, and well done on a good result. Couple of questions from me.</p>
          <p>The first one, just looking at prepaid handsets, it looks like you lost 22,000 sequentially. Obviously, you've talked in the past about that being a focus area, so if we can just get some comment on that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on DVCs, perhaps putting this one to bed, but if you can just talk about both volume and SAC expectations in terms of FY '12. I guess included within that is the mix of devices.</p>
          <p>And then the third one, just on the infamous asterisks in the guidance. You talked about the FAD but can you just clarify what you are assuming around the exempt exchanges review that's currently going on. Thanks for those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to ask Gordon because prepaid was one of the must-win battles, and actually the story is very strong. But I'll let Gordon take you through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in terms of prepaid, looking at the consumer business with a 6.4% year-on-year growth in prepaid. Predominantly, that was driven by an improvement in ARPU.</p>
          <p>So as you know, half way through the year we haven't launched cap plans into the marketplace. We launched caps plans which represented about 50% of the addressable market and we have really aggressively grown that market and we've seen the ARPU grow.</p>
          <p>In the second half of the year, what we have seen is quite a significant decline in the overall prepaid market as a whole, as we have seen many customers shifting to postpaid and moving towards higher end smartphones and wanting to shift to a postpaid offering.</p>
          <p>And if you look across the industry and a number of results from our competitors, you'll see where we had a net positive development in our overall prepaid base across the board, our other competitors had a decline, had quite a significant decline in prepaid. So that's driven about a 2.5%-plus revenue share gain for us in prepaid. So we are pretty happy with the overall performance in the year.</p>
          <p>There has been some softening in the second half as it relates to some fraudulent activity. As an industry, we are taking action on fraudulent activity on the base, which required us to remove a number of customers from our business, second half. And again that's the theme across many of our competitors here in Australia as well. So that's really why you've seen in the second half, a slight softening as we've taken action to tighten some of those controls across the base.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right. If I could just, I mean ARPUs are up year-to-year, but yes, we are very diligent about &#x2013; I mean we talk about unique users on prepaid, so we will disconnect customers if the handset is not being used. And so I think from what I have seen the numbers in the market, I think we're doing pretty well actually. We would have picked up share in the year, but there is some softness in that market, as people move across to postpaid and going forward.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of &#x2013; I'll let John handle DVCs. The FADs in the forward-looking forecast. The exempt exchange. The exempt review note, we've not prepared, but we feel pretty comfortable where things are at the moment. So we'll wait and see what happens I suppose.</p>
          <p>But John, do you want to look at the answer -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean the &#x2013; I think we're about 47% smartphone penetration now, certainly in consumer, anyway. And so smartphone, there is still a lot of room to move in smartphone increasing. So DVCs will continue to be under pressure, but I don't expect much growth in the whole category of DVCs in fiscal year '12.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we should just mention that the cost of the handsets, obviously, has gone up with the mix change and we're very conscious of that, and we are very enthusiastic about having good competition in the smartphone market going forward.  So we'll be working hard to see that happen.</p>

          <p>Think we have the last question from Mark McDonnell please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our last question for today is from Mark McDonnell from BBY. Please go ahead, Mark.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, and reiterating congratulations on the good turnaround in the second half, gents.</p>
          <p>My question, David, is about the NBN. And I'd like to go to your remarks where you talked about legislative government policy. Of course, government policy typically goes some distance beyond the legislation, and in the case of the NBN, I think that's certainly the case.</p>
          <p>But my question is this. Has Telstra received any written legal advice or opinion around the range of options that could be considered by shareholders, with respect to the forms of structural separation that could be implemented that would be consistent with the legislation?</p>
          <p>Now I ask this question in the context that, again, as recently as last week, the Shadow Minister for Communication set out an alternate form of structural separation that is not involved a deal with the NBN. And I therefore want to understand whether Telstra considers that it is under some legal constraint in offering that as an alternative to shareholders. And if so, if you do have such advice, could you outline what the legal reasons are, either now, or in the proposed explanatory memorandum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There is quite a bit in there, Mark, and I want to try to give you strong a sense as I possibly can.</p>
          <p>Firstly, currently the NBN and also the <mark type="ph" /> lease environment (01:52:19) is law, passed by the Senate. And even should there be a change of government, it would have to go through the Senate for a fundamental change, which will have to be approved by the Senate, and you know the Senate structure with the Greens. It will be what it is.</p>
          <p>So I think it's very important to understand that scenario because that means that while there are options should there be a change of government in two years time, actually a change of legislation would be quite a lot longer further forward, that's number one.</p>
          <p>In terms of different structural separation options, since I've been in the company and I've been here 10 years, I think I've seen more legal advice on options that I care really to recall now. But I understand that your question is specifically to the EM, but I want to be clear. We've had a lot of reviews done on different separation constructs that have all fit into all the modeling we have done. Now, in terms of the EM and the consideration of those alternatives, it is implied because it is says that we have looked at the best next best alternative.</p>
          <p>John do you want to add anything else to that because, I mean, we can talk some offline Mark but I don't &#x2013; I think that's the scenario where &#x2013; I can only deal with the reality I have in front of me and I don't have any options and shareholders &#x2013; I mean I've got a deal &#x2013; if the law changes I've got to decide which way I go. And as much as the Shadow Minister may have options, they are not really relevant to me until <mark type="ph" /> the in party (01:54:13) the law passed. That's the problem. John, do you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll just add that we have looked at various separation options, including functional separation, legal separation, but in the context of there being an NBN because there is one and it's legislated. It's not appropriate, we believe to look at separation options assuming a different outcome, when we don't know if there will be one. We can only deal with the legislated policy of this government today, but we have looked at the various separation scenarios in the light of that legislation and that policy and to try to retain as much flexibility for the company and our shareholders, should something change in the future. And that, therein lies the quandary, because otherwise I'm really boxing a clown, and that's the problem. So Mark, I can &#x2013; as you know we're available to talk but I think that sort of gives us the position.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for coming. Guys it's nice to finish up the year, especially on a day like this when the markets are all over the place. So we have exceeded guidance and I think we've set a good platform we're delivering on what we said we would do and lots of opportunity going forward to keep the momentum going and we're very committed doing that as we go forward. So, thanks for your time. Good to see you.</p>
