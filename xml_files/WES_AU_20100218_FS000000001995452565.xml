      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning and/or afternoon everyone, depending where you are and thank you for joining this teleconference on the First Half Results for Wesfarmers. I'm joined in Perth by Terry Bowen who is the Group Finance Director, Ian McLeod, Managing Director of Coles, John Gillam, Managing Director of the Home Improvement and Office Supplies division, Launa Inman, Managing Director of Target, Guy Russo, Managing Director of Kmart, Rob Scott, the Managing Director of Insurance and Stewart Butel, who is the Managing Director of our Resources division. And each of those people will be going through their divisional performance and then available for questions.</p>
          <p>We're going to try and get through our presentation fairly efficiently, so we're leaving as much time as we can for questions, and if I could ask you to do your bits when you're asking questions to try and keep them brief and succinct and maybe not too many at one time, hopefully we can answer those in an efficient way as well and do it efficiently.</p>
          <p>I'll just make a few comments on the Group performance, so I'm now on slide four. And we are pleased with the first half result of profit after tax of $879 million particularly when you consider that there was in excess of &#x2013; the Resources division this time last year reported half year results of 664 million of EBIT versus two this year. So with that drop off in the Resources division, I think we're seeing the benefits of the diversification that the Group has in the performance.</p>
          <p>Group EBIT was down 11%, although I think importantly without the Resources impact we are up 44%, and EBIT in the retail divisions was up 23%. I think very importantly, operating cash flow was again strong, and up 18% on the same time last year at over $2 billion. Our earnings per share down 26%, that's primarily because of the 330 million shares we issued in our equity issue last year. And the Board has felt confident enough in the cash flows, the free cash in the Group and the outlook to increase the interim dividend by 10% to $0.55 per share fully franked.</p>
          <p>Just going to slide five and some comments on some of the businesses, the Coles turnaround is very much on track, with pleasing sales increase, pleasing comp sales growth for the half and EBIT increasing at 13%. And Ian will talk about the initiatives that are going on in Coles to build a sustainable and stronger business. The Resources, we've talked about the earnings fall, but there's some good things going on in Resources, including commencing the expansion at Curragh. We've had good production and that division has marginally increased its sales forecast for the full year. Costs are well controlled and obviously the outlook is pretty good.</p>
          <p>Very strong performance from Bunnings and Target, and we're delighted with the turnaround in Kmart. And the industrial divisions have had a much better half generally, as has Insurance. Even though the Insurance reported number is lower, that's really related to primarily a reduction in interest rates affecting its investment income and also provisions for withdrawing from builders warranty insurance.</p>
          <p>Where we set out to turn around the Coles Group of businesses, we see that that turnaround is very much on track. There's a lot more work to do to extract further value from the businesses, but we're generally pretty pleased with where we're at. And across the board, the Wesfarmers businesses are generally in pretty good shape at the moment and running fairly well.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to talk about the performance slides, slides six and seven. I've mentioned earnings per share on slide eight, which is obviously significantly impacted by the weighted average number of shares on issue. I've talked about cash flow on slide nine, and then slide 10 just gives you by division, the performance by each division and return on capital. And then pleasingly, return on capital in a number of the divisions is improving, and we're about improving the absolute return on capital in each of our businesses.</p>
          <p>And then finally on slide 11, as I said earlier, we did the Coles acquisition to create value for our shareholders, and indeed all our stakeholders. And I think it's worth noting some of the things that we've done. In terms of the structure of the businesses, we've moved away from the centralized structure and replaced them with the autonomous divisions. And we're really seeing the benefits in each of the businesses, from having their own supply chain structured to each businesses needs. The same with the IT functions, the same with the human resource functions and importantly, I think, and we talk about it later on this slide, we are seeing that translating to improved cultures at each of the businesses.</p>
          <p>We've invested heavily in the management teams at Coles, Kmart and Officeworks. But equally importantly, in all of our businesses we continue to invest in management teams. And as far as the old Coles businesses are concerned, Launa's done a significant amount at Target over the last couple of years to strengthen that team as well. We have lean and efficient divisional offices, and I think the decision to retain Kmart is now proving to have been a good decision for our shareholders as we will create the value for, in that business for our own shareholders.</p>
          <p>In terms of business improvements, as I've said, cultural change is underway. A lot of customer focus, a lot of focus back into the stores in our businesses. A lot of change is occurring in the merchandising offers, and I think our promotional programs and in-store execution is much better, as is our store standards and service, although we all realize there's a lot more we can do on those things. We are reinvesting and will reinvest in our networks, but we will be prudent the way we utilize capital to do that, always with a view on making a return to our shareholders. We are exiting underperforming stores and product lines and the like.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, the supply chain restructuring is progressing well. We've invested heavily in building better relationships and stronger relationships with our suppliers, and we have over the last 18 months or so seen some significant working capital release and there's more to come. And of course, ultimately that's leading to a lift in earnings in the business and in their value. So, so far so good, but it's early days still and a lot further to go.</p>
          <p>So I'll now hand over to Ian McLeod who will run us through the Coles division.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Richard. Our half year results for Coles demonstrate that our five-year turnaround strategy remains on track. When I first arrived at Coles just over 18 months ago, customer comment on our stores was pretty damning. The stores were regarded as unclean and untidy, fresh product was of poor quality, trolleys and equipment was old and under-maintained and long check-out queues were the norm.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, supermarket prices generally could not be trusted. I said then there were no magic bullets, no single aspect that could stand out as demonstrating that the turnaround was progressing well, but it would be a collection of change that would begin to make a difference. Since then, we've delivered change on a number of fronts. We've invested in better service, particularly at the check-out, replaced outdated equipment including trolleys and tills, improved supply chain efficiency; product availability is improved, higher quality standards and also lower prices to provide better customer value.</p>
          <p>The commitment of our store management should also not be underestimated. They are working harder for our customers than ever before, including twice as many weekends, and I'd like to thank them for that. Customers have recognized the collective impact of these changes, and as a result, are shopping with us more frequently, which is reflected in our positive sales performance this half. We are pleased that our concerted effort has been positively received by customers, but we are under no illusion that delivering consistently well through Phase 2 of our turnaround will be a tougher challenge.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 13 to discuss the first half results in more detail. I believe our numbers demonstrate strong performances in each of food, liquor, and Coles Express. We've been able to deliver a healthy food and liquor headline sales of 7.1% as well as comparable sales growth of 6% in the first half. The second quarter performance was particularly encouraging as we cycled stronger comparators as well as deflation in this period. I'm also pleased that Coles Express continued to grow total shop sales by 6.6%. Coles Express also grew comparable sales by 4.8% in the half despite strong comparators thereto. Our desire to invest in value is bringing more customers to Coles, but not at the expense of profit, with trading EBIT growing faster than sales at 13%.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows the second quarter performance in more detail. The second quarter numbers show that we maintained strong growth through the first half, with comparable food and liquor sales of 5.9% compared with 6.1% in the first quarter. As mentioned earlier, this was despite cycling stronger comparable sales as well as experiencing almost 1% deflation through delivering better value to customers. We've been rewarded with higher customer transactions within our supermarkets and solid transaction growth in our liquor business also. We saw customer transactions peak over 13 million a week in our supermarkets during a very successful Christmas trading period, our highest to date. We have now experienced five consecutive quarters of improved volume growth.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 provides some indication of how this has been achieved. John Durkan and his merchandise team has spent significant time and effort in improving the quality of our fresh food, resulting in a stronger customer response and sales participation. Work has also been done to increase speed to shelf through the supply chain by sourcing more product locally. Sales are also higher this Christmas as a result of our Feed the Family campaign, with celebrity master chef Curtis Stone, and our commitment to lower prices resonated well with customers.</p>
          <p>We put much effort into improving our range and quality of Coles brand products, including fresh free range turkey for the first time, and the A Current Affair TV program judged the Coles 2009 Christmas pudding the best in Australia. Most importantly, we received a similar ringing endorsement from Launa Inman and her family who had fed back that the 2008 Christmas pudding was not up to scratch, and I take my colleagues feedback very seriously. Unfortunately, Mr. Bowen was too busy enjoying the liquor bargains at 1st Choice so he didn't even notice.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 shows that renewal has also been an important part of our turnaround and that the renewal is far more than merely physical change. It includes IT and supply chain transformation, people change and improved productivity and service as we continue to renew the business. As I said earlier, Stuart Machin and his operations team are focused on improved efficiency in our stores and better store standards to improve customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Now that the physical changes in our supply chain are broadly complete, a series of programs have been introduced to leverage our new network. We have improved productivity and store service with delivery times falling by up to 18 hours per store. These stores have shown the greatest benefit in achieving improved availability and reduced inventory. Easy ordering is now live in over 40 stores and we have learned valuable lessons that will streamline wider implementation. We are on track to roll out approximately 200 stores across the fleet by the end of the financial year.</p>
          <p>Store managers and their teams have also maintained consistently higher store and service standards focusing on shorter queues at peak times, improved availability and cleanliness, something our customers have noticed. Self scan check-outs have been introduced into nearly 70 stores across the country and we will continue to roll out where this is appropriate. We have also invested in the better store network for our customers. We have over 40 renewal stores on the ground where we're continuing to refine concepts that we can plug and play across our network in the next few years.</p>
          <p>Similar strategies have also been driving our liquor turnaround in slide 17. Tony Leon and the liquor team have done a very good job of delivering growth in an extremely competitive market. Our liquor turnaround is based on a much clearer multi-brand strategy, more effective marketing and improved store network and store standards. 1st Choice has been investing in a big box format and driving volume through a strong value focus, we currently have over 70 1st Choice stores on the ground and we'll continue to grow the network.</p>
          <p>Higher volumes through better priced deals across each of the three brands is reinforcing their value positioning. The liquor team is also very focused on driving operational improvements including simplification with supply arrangements and better store standards. Ongoing refurbishments and additional liquor stores are planned as we continue to improve network coverage. We have also seen improvements in Coles Express which is shown in slide 18.</p>
          <p>Coles Express has been growing fuel volumes on the back of lower fuel prices and the roll out of E10 ethanol blend sites in New South Wales and Queensland. Convenience sales were boosted by successful house-brand multi-save deals and product essentials as well as value promotions in key categories, including cold drinks and confectionary, as well as a focus on strong customer service. In recognition of its high service standards, Coles Express won the Convenience Store Retailer of the Year Award for the second year in a row.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the outlook on slide 19. We are pleased with our turnaround progress to date but the job is far from over, something that we are well aware of. Economic activity in Australia is improving but the global economy is still fragile. While there are signs that domestic activity is picking up, further interest rate increases could potentially affect consumer behavior. Consumers remain value-focused and there is a growing competition amongst retailers to grow sales and improve returns. We are seeing energy costs rise substantially above the rate of inflation and improvements in energy and people productivity are being &#x2013; plans to improve energy and people productivity are being developed to mitigate against these rising costs.</p>
          <p>I believe that through the hard work and effort put in by the Coles team members across Australia we've put in place solid foundations for future growth. Today's numbers give comfort that the turnaround is on track but the task ahead will be our most challenging before we can be confident delivering consistently well.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to John Gillam who will take you through results for Home Improvement and Office Supplies. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Ian. If I can take you to slide 23, I'll comment firstly on the Bunnings headline results. Bunnings performed well on the first half with overall trading revenue growth of 13.1% driving a 16% uplift in trading earnings. Our net margin strengthened to 12.4. Taking into account property activities, overall earnings grew 14.1% and I note that we sold no properties in the first half. We maintained high levels of activity investing in new stores and land banking sites for future expansion. This is a very busy area for us and what we are achieving is exciting for our longer term prospects. We also kept up good levels of refurb investment in existing stores. As a result, CapEx for the first half exceeded 190 million and our ROC held up above 30%.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 24, we are pleased with our total cash sales growth in the first half of 14.1%. Store-on-store growth was 11.2 for the period but 7.9% in the second quarter where we cycled against a stronger comparative trading period. Growth was achieved from strategic initiatives in merchandising and in service as well as from new stores.</p>
          <p>On the trade side of our business, sales grew 7.2% as a result of good traction from our trade strategy. This volume growth is being achieved both in the store network as well as through the new trade center format. The Bunnings network continues to expand. We opened eight warehouse stores, two smaller format stores and four trade centers in the half. As I said earlier, our property team has been very busy and as you can see from slide nine in the supplementary pack, at 31 December we had 12 stores under construction with many, many more good sites in our development pipeline.</p>
          <p>In terms of outlook, back in the main pack at slide 25, we expect to sustain growth in cash sales in 2010, although I repeat comments I made at last October's investor briefing that growth rates will be tempered as we cycle against last year's second government stimulus. Our trade business is positioned to perform well as the housing construction market continues to recover and we widen our trades in the network. In January, we opened our 26th trade center. More will follow.</p>
          <p>We are very focused on strengthening our customer offer through new merchandising and service initiatives and we intend also to further lift operational effectiveness so we can provide more value for customers. Network expansion will continue at the high end of our stated range of 10 to 14 new stores per annum, whilst at the same time we are also investing significantly in the new store pipeline for the longer term.</p>
          <p>At the heart of our thinking is a desire to provide customers with the best offer. That aim of delivering the widest range, lowest prices and best service is unchanged. I'm very pleased with the ongoing drive in innovation to deliver and enhance the best offer within the Bunnings team. And this, combined with the good momentum we've built up, positions Bunnings well for the long term.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 27, I'll comment on Officeworks. We have been really encouraged by these results given the intensity of the turnaround work being led by Mark Ward and the Officeworks team. Trading revenue grew by 10% for the six months to 31 December and earnings grew by 9% and an EBIT margin of 4.1.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 28, the Officeworks store network delivered pleasing sales growth of 12.7% for the half, with the second quarter growth of 13.1%, a real highlight. A strong uplift in transaction numbers underpinned the headline sales growth whilst pressure on margin and cost continued across all channels of the business. Sales momentum in the Officeworks business channel continued to grow as small to medium size businesses started to regain some of the confidence lost across the past 15 months.</p>
          <p>Expansion and reinvestment in the retail store network continued and good results are being achieved. Four new Officeworks stores opened during the half and seven full store upgrades were completed. In addition, a number of other stores underwent refreshes and merchandising upgrades. Pleasing progress has also been made in a number of areas to improve productivity. The implementation of the new point of sales system was successfully completed in December and there have been a number of supply chain enhancements made that once fitted down will provide good long term benefit.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 29 and the outlook for the second half for Officeworks. Mark Ward and his team are very committed to driving the actions needed to build a stronger business. Growing sales through improvements in the customer offer as well as through expanding and renewing the store network will continue. Efforts aimed at reducing complexity, lifting productivity and lowering the cost of doing business are ongoing. Our expectation for the second half of the year are for moderate sales growth in an environment where Officeworks will face continued competitive pressure on margin.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll hand over to Launa Inman.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. If we could just look at slide 31. Target's profit for the half was 279 million, up nearly 30% on last year. This equates to our EBIT margin being 12.8% compared with 10.3 last year. It is a pleasing outcome which is a result of us appealing to our core apparel customers and providing them with a product that they wanted at the right price.</p>
          <p>Sales increased by 4.2% for the half and a comparable store increase of 1.7. December was a difficult month for us. However, we did continue to grow our share of the department store sales over that period. This was achieved against a backdrop of cycling the worst of last year's financial crisis and the first of the government stimulus packages.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons we were able to maintain our profits is that we did not resort to incremental discounting to achieve our sales like many other retailers. Our advertising program was much the same as the previous year and in fact, we actually reduced expenditure on advertising year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Our performance has not been uniform and while all apparel departments grew on last year, non-apparel, with the exception of toys and leisure, did not perform as well. Sales of gaming console related products particularly benefited from the stimulus package the previous year. However, this year, there was a swing out of these categories. In addition, certain categories experienced further deflation in prices. However, we were pleased with our ladies wear, childrenswear and baby related products that generated good sales on last year.</p>
          <p>Our negotiations with oversea suppliers was also very productive, their desire to ensure continued production in a difficult trading environment assisted us in establishing better pricing for goods. We also controlled our overall costs well and have reduced our costs as a percentage of sales.</p>
          <p>We have done a lot of work in the supply chain through cost management and revamped processes and these continue to flow through to profit, and in addition have improved the outcomes for our store team members. Inventory is a strong focus and we are going to continue to monitor the inventory levels very closely. As a result, our current seasonal stockholding is very clean. This inventory focus will be ongoing, particularly as we cycle last year's government stimulus packages.</p>
          <p>We opened six new stores in the half and we are looking to increase our roll outs where suitable opportunities arise. However, the impact of tighter credit markets is still felt in the property sector. Hence, we are only opening one new store in the second half and we will close two stores that have been replaced by new ones.</p>
          <p>We completed 13 refurbishments in the first half, maximizing resources that would normally have been applied to new stores. Our refurbishment program will continue with another 15 stores planned for the second half.</p>
          <p>Regarding our outlook on slide 33, we are cautious as we move into a period of cycling the government's second wave of stimulus packages, particularly as the key purchases were clothing last year. We are going to really manage the business at all levels, specially inventory and margin and we have strengthened our focus on the customer. We know the consumer is looking for value and we will ensure that we have sufficient product at the entry price points. Our aim is to always deliver wanted product at the right time and right price.</p>
          <p>To ensure this, over the next six months, we are going to be bedding down a new way of developing and sourcing products which will ensure our continued differentiation. I have always spoken about differentiation being the core to our strategy. We have internally called this our new way of working and put simply, it means we are going to be doing more design within the house &#x2013; within house and the development of Target product, working particularly closely with key strategic partners.</p>
          <p>This process while new to Australia is really emulating the best practices from top retailers around the world. We see this as a strategic initiative that will give us an advantage in the future and in the market and enable us to continue to have future growth.</p>
          <p>Overall, I'm pleased with the results we have announced today and while I'm cautious about the second half, we do have solid plans in place. And with that, I'd like to now hand over to Guy.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Launa. I go to power on slide 35. The results for the half have been quite pleasing and I'm very proud of my entire organization and pass on my sincere thanks to them. The business recorded an EBIT of $154 million. This was an increase of $79 million over the same period last year. The EBIT margin for the half was 6.9%, an improvement of 360 basis points. Revenue over the same period was a decline of 1% and a comparative sales decline of 1.6%.</p>
          <p>On to slide 36. The main highlights over the first half have been that the business has shown improvements in its underlying profitability as a result from the initiatives we implemented through the Kmart turnaround strategy that I have been outlining over the last six months. We have successfully exited unprofitable products and promotions. Improvements to our margins have been evident from this showing us that confidence in our everyday range offer has increased and reliance on promotional sales at lower margins has declined.</p>
          <p>Benefits have also been achieved through reduced cost in supply chain and the non-store costs, where our previous administration initiatives were in place. The comparative sales for the whole period were down 1.6%, were impacted by the exit of those unprofitable products. The second quarter, however, was down 1.1%. Although challenging, particularly in the early weeks of December as we cycled the impact of the government stimulus package, the last week just prior to Christmas was particularly pleasing.</p>
          <p>During the half, we also opened two new stores and continued in our investments to upgrade the floors and fitting rooms in our most run-down stores with 30 being completed to date. Finally, the Kmart Tyre and Auto business again delivered strong sales and profit results with thanks coming out to John Sink and his team for their continued efforts in this particular part of our business.</p>
          <p>Slide 37, whilst we are pleased with the improvements thus far, there is still a lot of work to do at Kmart. The focus of the renewal of Kmart remains and investment in fixing the core metrics of the business model needs to continue. Whilst renewal is still active, we have now commenced working on the growth phase of the strategy where there will be a larger focus on customer engagements and the reintroduction of the Kmart brand.</p>
          <p>We recently launched the Expect Change campaign at the end of January and rather than a customer guarantee, this is an invitation to customers to come back and experience the changes for themselves so that they can expect change in fast and friendly service, expect clearer aisles and expect cleaner and easier to shop stores, expect lower prices and expect longer trading hours.</p>
          <p>So whilst we continue to reset Kmart for renewal and growth, we expect sales growth to be moderate in the short term. We also remain cautious of the retail environment given the impacts of the government stimulus and the increased interest rates.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand over to Stewart Butel.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Guy. And I refer you to slide 39. Operating revenue for the Resources division of $624 million was 56% below last year. This is a result of a major reduction in our export in metallurgical and steaming coal prices. Metallurgical coal was down 57% and steaming coal was down 45% compared to last year. It was also impacted by lower sales volumes and the hedge close-out losses.</p>
          <p>The EBIT at $2 million was 99.7% lower than last year. This decrease in EBIT, as previously foreshadowed, is due to the decrease in revenue as a result of lower coal prices, locked in hedge losses of $65 million and higher Stanwell rebate at $106 million, reflecting the higher rolling 12-month weighted average coal price on the back of last year's record prices.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization increased $8 million due to an increase in asset base plus a review of major asset lives. Coal production for the year decreased by 8.3% from last year to 7.3 million tonnes. This was due in part to two key factors. At Curragh, in the previous corresponding period we ramped up incremental production to capture the record coal prices at the time.</p>
          <p>At Premier, production in the previous corresponding period reflected higher coal demand during the Western Australian gas crisis. Importantly, our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate at 2.3 was 54% improvement on last year, illustrating our continued focus on safety.</p>
          <p>I now refer you to slide 40, resources highlights. That include, as stated, a continued improvement in our safety performance. During the year, Curragh was recognized at the Australian Export Awards in the minerals and energy sector for an outstanding achievement in the export marketplace. Here, our sales increased despite the largest reduction in the international demand for coal in 40 years.</p>
          <p>In November 2009, Curragh entered into a new agreement with Stanwell to secure the rights to mine an additional 46 million tonnes of reserves. These reserves underpinned Wesfarmers and allowed us to approve a further investment of $286 million to expand Curragh's export capacity up to 8.5 million tonnes per year.</p>
          <p>This expansion involves the construction of a new coal handling and preparation plant. Work has commenced with the additional capacity due to come online in the second half of calendar year 2011. During the year, Blackwater Creek diversion achieved practical completion, one year ahead of time and under budget, providing access to additional coal reserves. Curragh's cost reduction program is on track. Mine cash costs per ton for the first half of the year are 8% lower than last year, reflecting both success in our cost control program and the benefit of lower input costs such as diesel fuel prices.</p>
          <p>I now refer you to slide 41. The resources outlook. There are strong signs of recovery from the global economic crisis. World steel production is recovering and we are experiencing significant increases in demand, and spot prices for metallurgical coal and steaming coal are increasing. Forecast in metallurgical coal sales from our Curragh mine expected to be in the range of 6.3 to 6.8 million tonnes for the year, up from previous guidance.</p>
          <p>Sales mix for the year is expected to be 47% hard coking coal, 22% semi-hard and 31% PCI. Coal price negotiations with our major customers are expected to progress over the next month. Pricing outcomes are positive. We expect improved earnings in the second half of 2009-'10.</p>
          <p>The Stanwell rebate is expected to substantially reduce from $106 million in the first half of 2010 to approximately 50 to $60 million in the second half as the rolling 12-month prices are reduced.</p>
          <p>Hedge close-out losses of $20 million will be recognized in the second half compared to $65 million booked in the first half. This is our last period of close-out losses. The Curragh cost reduction program is ongoing and delivering results.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Rob Scott from the Insurance division.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Stewart. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on slide 43. Revenues for the Insurance division increased modestly in the half to 868 million. This was ahead of our expectations given our recent exit from unprofitable underwriting agencies and the impact of lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>Divisional EBITA of 63 million was down from 75 million in the prior corresponding period. This decrease masks a strong underlying improvement in our underwriting businesses, particularly Lumley. The lower earnings were primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates on our investment returns being $19 million, and six million of claims associated with the runoff of their builders warranty portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the highlights on slide 44. We have included a slide in our supplementary material, page 31 that highlights the improvement in the underwriting margin of $15 million for the half. As noted, this was largely a result of recent initiatives in Lumley including the exit from unprofitable business, better risk selection and premium rate increases.</p>
          <p>The generally benign weather in the first half was favorable for the industry. However, Wesfarmers Federation Insurance was subject to a higher than expected property and crop claims resulting from storms and bush fires in some rural areas.</p>
          <p>Broking earnings were constrained by the lower interest rates, adverse movements in New Zealand dollar and U.K. exchange rates, and a generally challenging environment facing many of our SME clients. Our profit margin remains strong and we have been increasing our investment in talent and systems to improve our proposition declines and to help drive future revenue growth.</p>
          <p>We've made good progress through the half on a number of growth initiatives. Lumley recently hired a team of experienced underwriters with a strong track record in the corporate market. This team is complementary to Lumley's portfolio and will provide greater technical expertise and diversification for our business.</p>
          <p>Turning to the outlook on slide 45. We expect further benefits to flow from our change program in Lumley. The restructuring in the portfolio remediation is largely behind us and we now look forward to turning our attention to profitable growth. Whilst weather conditions have been favorable in the first half, and the prospect of storms and bush fires remain a key risk to earnings in the second half, the recent storms and wet weather in New South Wales and Queensland highlight this risk.</p>
          <p>We expect the commercial premium rate environment to remain competitive. The prospect of rising interest rates will have a direct improvement to our earnings given that we have total investments of 1.3 billion in bank deposits.</p>
          <p>Our focus in broking is to continue to expand our network, while leveraging our scale and capabilities. To help drive this, Steve Lockwood, formerly the CEO of Crombie Lockwood has been promoted to a broader oversight role of our broking operations in Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.</p>
          <p>On the earnings outlook, I note that the relationship between first and second half earnings in financial year 2009 should not be considered relevant in the current year. Subject to no severe weather and cat events above our allowances, we would expect the second half earnings to be broadly in line with the first half.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Terry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. Turning to slide 47. The first half's EBIT of 27 million for Chemicals and Fertilisers was ahead of last year which was impacted by the Varanus Island gas outage. The current year's result reflected a solid return to earnings in chemicals, but a disappointing fertilizer contribution due to lower domestic fertilizer prices that resulted in both margin pressures and a $25 million write-down of fertilizer inventory. Safety performance in the division continued to be well managed at low levels.</p>
          <p>On slide 48, production and sales volumes in the various chemicals businesses have been good, as have earnings. Ammonium nitrate production and sales in Western Australia have been at record levels, and the performance of QMP has also been better than last year. The commencement of the Boddington Gold Mine has stretched sodium cyanide production capacity where there has been a delay in commissioning the 8,000 ton per annum expansion, due to some equipment issues. We expect that now to be completed by March this year.</p>
          <p>Finally on chemicals, Australian Vinyls production and sales were ahead of last year despite a relatively depressed market in PVC. In fertilizer, sales increased by 17% over the last year and market share appears to have been broadly maintained, despite some changes in distribution arrangements in Western Australia.</p>
          <p>Earnings were down, however, as falling prices and strong domestic price competition resulted in lower sales margins and the write-down that I've referred to. As a partial offset, CSBP did sell a phosphate deposit at Mt. Weld.</p>
          <p>Moving to outlook, we expect continued growth in demand for mining chemicals; and within this context, the group continues to progress the FEED study on expanding ammonium nitrate production at Kwinana.</p>
          <p>On fertilizer, recent strengthening in global and domestic prices have resulted in strong sales and forward orders being placed by customers, and suggests to return to historical levels of nutrient application this year following a 30% decline last year. Fertilizer use, however, will depend on growers' terms of trade and ultimately the seasonal break.</p>
          <p>To industrial and safety on slide 49. Operating revenue for the division was $637 million and down 7.3%. This reflects slower industrial business activity following the global financial crisis. In particular, we've seen a lower level of capital projects and pricing pressure as customers focused on cost reduction.</p>
          <p>Despite reducing the cost of doing business in this business, the division's earnings before interest and tax reduced by 25% to 51 million, reflecting both those sales and margin pressures. Employee safety performance, however, was very well managed at record low incidents.</p>
          <p>While the results reflected on slide 50 a tough business environment, it is notable that the second quarter of the half showed some improvement. Despite the difficult conditions, the division has managed to increase its contract market share and continued to strengthen capabilities, particularly in regards to its supply chain and sales effectiveness.</p>
          <p>In regards to the outlook, the trading conditions going forward are expected to improve as a stronger pipeline of mining, oil and gas and infrastructure projects occurs; and any improvement in general business conditions will also benefit, although we expect pressure on margins to continue for a while. The division will continue to focus on improving its customer service and also capturing growth opportunities while further improving its efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Moving to the energy division on slide 51. Earnings and return on capital were above our expectations for the half and were driven by higher LPG production and improvement in clean heat performance. The result was also significantly higher than the same period last year, and was affected again by the Varanus Island Gas disruption. Employee safety again was very well managed throughout the period.</p>
          <p>Business conditions for Energy's LPG activities in the half benefit from both stable supply in contrast to last year, where output was restricted. Steady increases in international LPG prices also benefited the business and contrasted with last year's pricing volatility that resulted in both margin pressures and inventory write-downs in that year.</p>
          <p>The LNG plant operated in line with expectations and its one year inspection was successfully completed without issue. LNG sales volumes to the power generation sector were solid. However, growth in the heavy duty vehicle and industrial sectors continues to be an area we focus on.</p>
          <p>Demand for core gases, industrial gases remained subdued in the half, in what was tight trading conditions. And enGen's earnings were ahead of last year following commission of facilities at both Sunrise Dam and Darlot.</p>
          <p>In regards to outlook, LPG earnings will remain reliant on a stable gas supply and also domestic gas prices, which are expected to be impacted following the recent settlement between North West Shelf Gas and Alinta. The industrial gas businesses are expected to benefit from any uplift in economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Turning to Other Business performance on slide 54, profit before tax from associates was 45 million in the half as compared to a loss last year of $2 million. Included in this result was an upward revaluation of the Group's investment in Gresham Private Equity Funds and an improved performance from Bunnings Warehouse Property Trust.</p>
          <p>Interest revenue of 29 million ahead of last year, and this reflected the increased funds on deposit over the half. Non-trading items of $39 million were made up of $33 million in costs associated with the restructuring of Kmart's Victorian supply chain and a $6 million write-down in relation to property at Coles.</p>
          <p>Other costs of $4 million was mainly related to the Group's self-insurance provisioning, but were significantly below last year's cost of $81 million; which occurred, if you'll recall, due to reduced discount rates increasing our self-insurance provisions as well as the mark-to-market of a number of investments held by the Group in that year.</p>
          <p>On slide 55, in regards to capital management, as Richard said, cash generation for the half was strong and we've further strengthened the balance sheet. The Group's key liquidity ratios are all in good shape, as evidenced by a rolling 12 cash interest cover ratio of 6.6 times and net debt to equity of a little over 15%.</p>
          <p>As Richard mentioned, the Group has announced an interim dividend to $0.55 per share fully franked. The Group will continue with their dividend investment plan, which is valued by many of our shareholders. No discount will apply to the allocation price of this. And the dilutionary effect again of shares issued under the DIP will be neutralized through an arrangement with a broker, who will acquire the required number of shares on market as nominee for participating shareholders.</p>
          <p>In relation to debt on slide 56, the Group's net debt at 31 December was $3.8 billion and included 1.8 billion of cash on deposit and at bank. The Group also had access to committed but undrawn facilities of $1.4 billion, and the majority of our debt remains hedged.</p>
          <p>The all-in cost of debt for the period was around 8.7% for the half, and after adjusting for costs associated with the Group's $500 million domestic corporate bond issuance in September and also costs associated with over $900 million of debt repayment during the half.</p>
          <p>The Group's debt maturity profile shown on slide 47 highlights low level of debt repayment due in both financial years 2010 and '11; and the Group is remaining active in looking to diversify both the tenure and nature of its debt structure.</p>
          <p>In relation to cash flow, both operating and free cash flow improved on last year despite the significant fall in cash contribution for the resources division. Cash realization as depicted on slide 58 continues to be very strong at 157%. It is worth noting, however, that the Group typically has seasonally stronger cash flows in the first half.</p>
          <p>Working capital cash flows on slide 49 provide some additional information around our management of this area. The retail businesses &#x2013; in particular Coles, Target and Kmart &#x2013; continued to turn around their performance in respect to this area. Significantly in the Industrial business, the result was CSBP, where fertilizer prices and also inventory also returned to more historical levels.</p>
          <p>Finally on slide 60 and CapEx, total expenditure of 891 million was ahead of last year. The Group continued to invest in organic growth opportunities, including opening new retail stores and refurbishing the existing stores as well as various other expansion projects such as the Blackwater Creek diversion.</p>
          <p>Market conditions also created opportunities in regards to freehold retail property acquisition, and this area of expenditure was well ahead of last year.</p>
          <p>We expect full year capital expenditure to be in the vicinity of around $1.9 billion as the retail businesses continue to secure, open and refurbish stores; and the resources division increased its expenditure on its expansion of Curragh.</p>
          <p>As previously noted, there may be some variability in this final number, and that will be largely depending on opportunities around freehold property.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand back to Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Terry. And just finally from me before we open up for questions, on outlook on slide 62. We think the Group is well positioned to benefit from any further upturn in the economy. The outlook for export coal as Stewart mentioned is positive, and we're expecting an increase in the resource division earnings from the fourth quarter of this financial year.</p>
          <p>We expect the recovery in the Insurance and Industrial businesses to continue. And while we're optimistic about the long-term future of the retail businesses and their performance, we are cautious about the second half as each of Ian and John and Launa and Guy have talked about because of the climate where consumers are anticipating further rises in the interest rates and we will be cycling last year's stimulus balance. But overall I think the Group is in good shape. Our systems and processes are working well and there's a very strong focus on value creation in all of our businesses.</p>
          <p>And now, we'll be happy to take any questions.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if I could ask a question on the food and liquor business and if we could just get any color on the sales growth and whether there was one particular category growing much faster than others, liquor or fresh versus basic groceries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Yes. In fact we've seen increases generally throughout each of the businesses and we're encouraged by the rate of growth that we've seen in each of the areas. We've maintained a strong promotional program within our core grocery business. But also the focus we've put on availability, quality, freshness in fresh food, has seen our fresh food participations growing as well. So that's also encouraging. And there's been a lot of work done in liquor as well to drive better value for consumers in each of our liquor brands. So I'm pretty encouraged by the rates of growth that we're getting in each of the areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a wide difference between the growth rates or are they all broadly similar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are obviously differences, but I'm not going to go into the detail of that. But by and large I'm encouraged by the rates of growth in each of the sectors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe then just on the stores that have the easy order, are you seeing significantly different results out of them? For example at the sales line are you seeing much better results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not really about driving better performances on sales although we do get improvements in availability. But the whole approach within the store has significantly improved. As I've mentioned before there's obviously great risk in rapidly rolling out these programs without fully considering the impact on stores, which is why we've been cautious in our planning. But we've now got 45 stores on the program and all are performing well.</p>
          <p>So what we're noticing in particular are improvements in availability but also reductions in inventory. It's actually making the stores far more easier to manage, but they're focused in a different approach in terms of in-store management. But certainly the store management teams are very encouraged by it, those that have it so far. And we've got a planned progressive rollout across the coming months that you'll see more of our stores and more of our volume moving into the easy ordering process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Richard, if I could ask a question on target. Obviously a fantastic result. Could I understand maybe you're hedging a bit better because I would have thought that if anything you were facing adverse purchasing rates versus the U.S. Dollar. But I just wanted to check whether there was &#x2013; if I got that wrong and you actually get the benefit of FX in that first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, Phillip we didn't have the advantage of the higher dollar because we had in fact hedged. What we did do though is we did a lot of work with our suppliers on costs. And also a lot of our third party suppliers don't necessarily hedge, so they were able to take the benefit of the better dollar as it improved. Whereas we on our own direct sourcing didn't have the strength of that dollar, but we were able to balance it out. So it was really a combination of that and also working hard with our suppliers to get better prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think the benefits of the dollar really come more in the next financial year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It won't be in this financial year because we do take cover for quite a period of time ahead, knowing that we are &#x2013; as I always say, we're not in the game of speculation, we're in the game of retailing. So we wouldn't really start to see any great advantage before as you say the next financial year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's all really, so is the bulk of the GP really sales mix and the work you've been doing and then some cost of doing business benefit? Would that be the way to think about how much your margins have expanded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, the result came from a number of things. Firstly, there was a swing in the mix of the product. As I have mentioned, the previous year, at Christmas it was very much driven by electronic games, consoles, the Wii and that type of product, which was low margin, whereas this year it was definitely swung more into toys, books and clothing. And those are all better margin items. So that was where we benefited from. We had also done a lot of work on supply chain and that profit &#x2013; and those benefits certainly flowed down into our profit. And we've really been working on our cost of doing business generally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one last one if I could on the debt levels, I mean $2-odd billion of cash, I'm sure there's a free float in all the retail businesses but that seems like a higher level of cash than you'd need or what are the plans in terms of using that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I missed that. Do you want to repeat that again, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so the $2-odd billion of cash in deposit, obviously there'd be free float in all the retail businesses so I understand there would be a certain level that needs to be in the business, but 2 billion does seem a bit high. I was just intrigued as to, at some point, where you're going to be offsetting that against some of your debt levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've paid down debt over the half as we've described. So net I think in the half was around $400 million and paid down another $300 million in January. So we have released some cash for the repayment of debt. We think the balance sheet's structured about right at the moment. And there're still signs out there that debt markets are still a bit skittish and we think the flexibility that a bit of cash on the balance sheet gives us at the moment opens up both potential growth opportunities for us as well as it should &#x2013; it gives some protection should things materially change for some reason. So we continue to look at the amount of cash we're holding.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon Richard and team. Just if I can ask a question around food and liquor and perhaps where the margins have moved. I would have thought there were a number of factors in the first half such as supply negotiations, natural operating leverage, fresh food sales as well as improved shrink. A lot of that seems to have been reinvested into price. Is that a fair way to understand the margin movement in the food and liquor business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In part but not exclusively, Craig. I think we've clearly invested in value to drive volume and gain sales momentum. But I think you have to remember where we've come from. The company's suffered from years of underinvestment in basics of maintenance, cleaning and service in the stores. So we had to invest upfront in adding into basic fixed costs in order to ensure that those elements are met in order that we can compete effectively. So the EBIT percentage at the early stage of the turnaround, the accretion there was always going to be lower than it would be later on in the plan. We want to gain and drive sales momentum initially and we're obviously working harder on driving improvements in our cost of doing business through efficiency. But maintaining costs at an inappropriate level to deliver the best service to your customers is not where we want to start.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And the sales momentum you achieved in the second quarter especially relative to industry growth, is that where you're about comfortable or would you like to see a greater level of sales momentum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're very satisfied with the level of sales momentum that we're currently gaining. We still got more to go and we'd anticipate that. But it's a competitive market out there and we want to make sure that we continue to drive sales through value and continue to track more customers to spend more at Coles.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. It doesn't surprise me. We've operated in competitive markets before and the Australian market is a competitive one. So you recognize and respond to those competitive changes over time but it doesn't change the ultimate ability to turn the company around.</p>

          <p>Just on Target, it's probably a bit of a philosophical question about what the right level of margin or what margin you're comfortable with, Launa, obviously it's a great performance for the first half, but at what level do you worry that it incites further competition or retailers attacking some of your categories where you obviously make very good profits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Craig. It was a good performance and the margin as I said was very much driven by the fact that we had a swing into apparel. But also because we have been cautious, we've managed our seasonal stock very tightly. So we didn't have a lot of markdowns relatively within the season so we picked up margin there and that was something that we had anticipated. So that did go to our benefit. We are cautious going forward for the second half because last year with those stimulus packages that came through in kind of March, April and May it was already into apparel, so we're not going to have the benefit of that swing in the second half. So I think I need to kind of caution you on expecting to maintain that margin going forward into the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean we definitely see the volatility in your business, but could your first half margins in the year is still maintain or just staying around the 12.8%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no I mean we don't see it being that because I think that it's going to be tough for the second half, I really do. And I'm not quite sure what it's going to be but I don't believe it's going to be that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And just lastly, a clarification on the resources, the cash cost, you alluded to a further reduction, just wanted to understand, that run rate of an 8% decline in the first half, will that be carried through to the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, the first half performance was good from a cost reduction point of view, and put a lot of effort into working that area particularly at Curragh. As we move into higher commodity prices, I think we will start to see a re-emergement of cost pressures on our businesses. I think that's an inevitable outcome of that. Hopefully that's not this year but hopefully it's pushed out in time. But clearly we will be under some pressures as we move into the next couple of years and higher commodity prices.</p>

          <p>Your next question will come from Emily Behncke from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I've just got a couple of questions, both in relation to the very strong margin performances you got from both Kmart and Target. Just further to the earlier question, where Launa indicated probably margins to come back in the second half both in relation to Target and Kmart, are you &#x2013; do you think that the margins achieved this half are a one-off or do you think that down the track we could expect those sorts of margins to be maintained?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start Emily then I'll let Guy and Launa. I think we're not going to give any forecasts and margins are an outcome of a whole bunch of things. What I would say and it goes back to a bit of Craig's question as well about philosophy. When we took over Coles everyone recognized that Target was a very good business and had very strong margins. The margins we've reported this half are higher and it's a combination of factors that Launa indicated. When we look forward over the long-term, we think Target's a business that still has plenty of opportunities because there was a lot of things that the business can improve on including supply chain, including the way it satisfies its customers' needs and procurement. So I don't think anyone should get into paradigms on margins, because I think that then restricts the way you operate a business. And so margins will fluctuate from one quarter or one half to another depending on seasonal breaks, depending on how well we predict fashion and a few things like that. But over the long-term, my expectation is we will have strong margins in both of these businesses, if we execute well in them. But Guy and Launa, do you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only to say that obviously Kmart's in a different situation to Target, that we're trying to fix a model that was broken and we're only really at the second stage of that. And we talked about the discovery phase and the renewal phase and this is what's come out of the renewal phase. With the team at Kmart are really focused on executing the Kmart turnaround very diligently. We all want this business to succeed and so I'm really pleased with what's happened in that first six months. We've got Rick Trussell, our General Manager of Operations that's got all the store people and team members focused on delivering great service, cleaner aisles, cleaner stores and fast and friendly environment. And Ian Bailey, I think he's a very important part of all of this where what's happened in this first six months Ian looks after marketing, the merchants and supply chain or heads them all up. He has been able to, with his team, successfully exit the unprofitable products that I mentioned in the last six months to all of you, products that we were selling in hard goods, white goods, big and bulky items, getting the marketing team to rely less on promotional sales, getting off that high/low pricing drug and getting to lower prices for consumers that they can trust every day.</p>
          <p>And then my CFO, Marina Joannou has really got the whole organization focused on reducing the non-store costs to be able to reset this model so we can get something that's really worthy of being able to compete in a very competitive environment. So I'm just happy that what we've done is &#x2013; what we said is what we've achieved. But we've got a lot more to do now as we move into the third phase of growth.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think basically what Richard said really covers everything, Emily, with regards to Target. I don't know that we can produce these margins every single half, and that's not necessarily the intention, it's about what we need to do that's right for the customer and right for the business.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon guys. Maybe just, Ian, can you just tell us whether or not gross margins went up during the period, and if the EBIT margin expansion you got was all cost of doing business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't comment on that Shaun. But I think that we've obviously got our mind on delivering value but also recognizing we've got to balance that with good operating gross profit line and focus on cost of business. So it's a good question, but I think that we've got the balance right at this stage in the turnaround. And we'd expect to see that balance continue as we go forward. And on EBIT percent, I think we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that our growth in cash profit was ahead of our sales. So as I said, I think that the balance within the business is structured right at this stage of our turnaround.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you maybe talk a bit about how much the quantum of the provision release in Coles was, maybe this is for you Terry, and also how much Kmart benefited from potentially sort of low costs following the &#x2013; lower depreciation costs following the one-off costs in the prior period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Coles. That's, we've stated again, it's $65 million per annum. So it would be half of that effectively. And Kmart, I'm not...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Kmart, I mean, you guys wrote off quite a number of costs last year. Did that have any positive impact on EBIT margins in the first half of '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably best for Guy to answer, but what I could say is refer you back to the &#x2013; I mean most of the provisions we took were in relation to redundancies that were obviously scheduled to be payment &#x2013; paid in relation to supply chain restructuring and surplus lease from property that we would no longer have a use for. So, and I think in both of those cases, I'll let Guy answer fully, but the answer would be there'd be no discernible effect of those going through our result potentially kind of for a while.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and Terry, you're right. The results that came through for the half were about exiting unprofitable products, the high/low, just about removed the high/low percentage off altogether for that first half, which gives you a &#x2013; gave you a better margin in products and not selling products that below cost, as we were doing in the past. Supply chain costs are starting to flow through pretty strongly, and the first few months when the organization was bought off for six months, we did &#x2013; we looked at our non-store costs and basically did that right up front, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way you should think about that, Shaun, is the provisions are there to take care of the, if you like, the non-ongoing costs and the results that came out effectively will be the ongoing business results as they improve the supply chain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe another one back for Ian. How confident are you that Coles can post good numbers, on good numbers in that Coles is benefiting from quite a period of fairly weak like-for-like sales growth? You now got to move into a state where you're having to cycle that for the first time in many years. How confident are you that you'll be able to sustain strong comps and continue to outgrow the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the $64 million question, isn't it? I think that the opportunity for us to grow is still there within the marketplace. I think we recognize that. But it's a phased program. We have to have sort of more stores on the ground delivering to a higher operating standard. We've also got to make sure we continue to invest in value to try to create confidence in consumers to continue to shop with us. That means we've got to continue to grow our fresh food participation in particular. It's so far so good. We've seen growth at a sales revenue level and a volume level and anticipate continued growth into the future.</p>
          <p>Clearly we would need that in order to make sure the turnaround is effective. In terms of the rate of growth relative to where we've been, clear that's going to get tougher, A, because we've got to work harder at delivering the changes that we've got within the organization, but also as you point out, we'll be cycling higher comps against ourselves, but we're very focused on its delivery.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two final questions. Terry, what's the plan with pubs? We've read a fair bit about that in the newspaper, but can you maybe just sort of talk a bit about the plans that you've got with your hotels?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm happy for Terry to answer it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>I'm asking for an answer anyway.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our sales remain a very important part of our business, and it's never been our intent to seek control. I think if there were opportunities to have further professional support on a joint basis to further develop that part of our business, then if those opportunities arise, we'll consider them. And I think we've got in more recent months, we've had a much stronger management control within that business, and it remains an important part of the mix of the Coles sectors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, just in terms of property, you've highlighted property acquisitions as something that will be a swing factor in terms of CapEx across Bunnings as well as Coles. Could you talk about how many properties you've acquired in the first half and maybe how that's split &#x2013; sorry how that impacts total CapEx so far and into the 1.9 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might answer for Group total CapEx, and then probably in terms of the types of things that are going on, John and Ian probably best place. Around if you look at the variance from a group point of view, more than around $120 million of that was related to freehold property year-on-year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Shaun, I don't think it's useful for us to run a commentary every time we have one of these briefings on how much property is in the pipeline. What I can assure you is that the support we're getting from Richard and the Wesfarmers Board is tremendous, and our property team's extremely active and our pipeline's very, very healthy. And the timing of acquisitions will be difficult to predict because sometimes a site, you secure the rights to it and you might work through something that's 12 months before the CapEx hits.</p>
          <p>And other times the way to secure the sites is just to go bang and to buy it straightaway. So it is a very lumpy part of the business in terms of predictability. But our intensity of focus on it is very high, and our run rate of acquisition, I think, will be higher than in prior years, as we build from a Bunnings perspective a very healthy pipeline for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll always look at opportunities in Coles of growth opportunities. Most of them will be through joint development opportunities where we &#x2013; takes place from another party's development. Clearly in more recent months, there's been less development, well that's starting to change, and if we've seen opportunities to acquire sites ourselves, and we follow those opportunities through.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a couple from me. The Resources division OpEx even if I backed out royalties in Stanwell, seems to have gone down a lot more on a dollar per tonne basis than sort of the 8% outlined for Curragh. I am just wondering whether there is something else happening there we should take account of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we'll answer that honestly. The 8% is mine cash costs. It doesn't include offsite costs. Offsite costs are in addition to that. In the offsite area, we're seeing significant reductions, particularly in the royalty area as coal prices have come off record, coal prices last year 300 or thereabout to the headline price down to 127. That clearly will have a major impact on the royalties that we have to pay from our export and domestic businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And remember Grant that Stewart can get the details right. But remember the Queensland government put in a sort of super royalty on coal prices above $100 a tonne or something like that it was. So that's come off a fair bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah that's the 116 of the 42 that you outlined in your financials. But even if I back that out, it looks like they've gone again, we only see across the entire divisions from about 67 to about $48 a tonne if you backed out Stanwell and the royalties and the FX, I might add, the adjustment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult to calculate it on a total basis because you're looking at in the case of Curragh, it's the export metallurgical coal price has come down from a very high number. And that price has come down around 57%. In terms of Bengalla, that price has come down about 45%. And you've got different royalty regimes depending on what state you're operating in. In terms of Queensland it's a 10% royalty on the FOB price and in terms of New South Wales it's a little less than that. So it is quite a complicated calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought I was talking ex-royalties. But maybe I can cover that up offline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just another one. On the food and liquor CapEx I mean to-date the business has benefited obviously from fairly flat depreciation. The amount of CapEx going in is not that similar from the historical depreciation. I guess at what point &#x2013; given that you are starting with a portfolio that does need some substantial catch up, what would be a more medium-term outlook over say the next three years for CapEx going into the Coles business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look I think the guidance we've given in the past, Grant, probably still exists at the moment. So we clearly &#x2013; we've, I think looking at the number of refurbs we've done in the current half is more than a half ago but obviously is &#x2013; and the team are still doing a lot of work on that so that will accelerate. We've got some freehold property in there that may not be in there in future periods. And then we've got an increase if you think of things like self checkout and things like that we've got increasing other areas of expenditure, which is helping the business. So I think all we can do is refer you to our previous guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's $1 billion a year? Is that about the right ballpark number?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean you do pose an interesting question that your major competitor obviously Woolworth's been putting a lot more CapEx into its stores than that. So either they've been spending it very inefficiently or you get further behind on quality of store and fit out?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think what we've always said is that we take a prudent view on return on capital and that's going to be our focus. We've got to invest and develop business as I mentioned earlier on and you can't have stores that are operating in a substandard presentation to customers. But any advancement in terms of development we'd expect to see improved returns on capital from where we are now. And we've always insisted on taking that balanced approach and that will continue.</p>

          <p>In the previous year remember there was a because of interest rates falling and discount rates falling rapidly in the last half, we ended up with having to write down, or sorry write up a provision for workers' comp for our self-insurance <mark type="inaudible" /> mark-to-market a number of investments. So it was &#x2013; between the two of them they represented the bulk of that write-off last year &#x2013; or, sorry, that cost last year, which was around $80 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, subject to again the same type of things, I mean a lot of this can be affected by discount rate. You got large provisions in workers' comp and things and they can be affected by discount rates, both positively and negatively. It's occurred in the past. So it's an area that's largely non-cash, so.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon all. Just first question on the Resources side of things. There's some comments that's been going around sort of BHP specifically is out there looking to move to sort of shorter term contracts. Is that something that you look to be involved or follow if that was to happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Look, there's no doubt that BHP are looking at moving from annual pricing to six monthly and quarterly pricing and I think there was an article in the Financial Review today that touched on that in terms of their strategy. Our position is clearly wait and see and see how that develops over time. Ultimately there probably will be a transition to a shorter term pricing mechanism over the next couple of years. We're clearly talking closely with our customers and clearly our customers are the ones that are going to drive us in the right direction in terms of that. So it's a wait and see in terms of that pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms sort of the discussions with your customers, because the other talk was that they tabled an offer around 240 bucks a ton to the Japanese steel mills in the last couple of days. Is that &#x2013; just interested in your thoughts on that sort of number for hard coking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I'm not going to speculate on what the coal price will be. It will be what it is when it settles and it hasn't settled yet. Clearly, the fundamentals are very strong. We're seeing traditional customers, their production rates getting up towards 100% now. We're seeing clearly China with a strong appetite. They're importing at around about a 30 million ton per year rate and that's come from nowhere from 12 months ago. And clearly spot prices are up there and we're seeing some spot prices well over 200. But I think things will become clearer over the next two to four weeks. I think things will settle in that period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And just one for Guy on Kmart. You obviously you'd expect now you're going to be starting to turn a profit for the whole year in this business. And I suppose should we be thinking sort of a &#x2013; how should we be thinking about the split in terms of first half, second half for this business now? Is it sort of 60, 40? Is that reasonable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wish I knew. There's one of you that I think I should ask. You know the next six months, well, I should say the next 12 months, we've taken this to a third phase. So it's a little unpredictable from my perspective. We &#x2013; I mentioned to all of you around November about reducing SKU count, lowering prices and basically getting Kmart to be focused on everyday items for families. That's the phase that we are moving into at the moment. So I'm really looking at setting this up for the long term so the business will be profitable in the second half. But I don't &#x2013; I wouldn't expect the same type of growth that happened in the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, if you look at last year, there was &#x2013; the SKU was much more than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so we're not going to give you a number because, as Guy said, there's a lot of unpredictable things. But one of the pleasing aspects of the turnaround in Kmart has been that when we took over the business, it was profitable in about three months of the year, three or four months a year. And Guy and the team have turned that around. There'll still be some months when it may breakeven or lose money but they're not nearly as frequent as they were in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And one for John as well just in terms on the Bunnings side of things and just your comment around the outlook for the second half. I suppose from your commentary you'd expect to still see slowing on that 7.9% number and I was wondering maybe if you could talk sort of a little bit behind that, in terms of what you're seeing in terms of deflation in categories and the like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Ben. Well, I took you back to the comments I made in October where I said looking at &#x2013; and then I was looking at December and the first stimulus and the second stimulus periods, which really hit around April, May from our perspective. And I made the comment then that we felt that for the full year, a high single digit would be a very good result. I made that comment on the back of the first quarter result being 15%. So I'm not referencing it off the 7.9%, if that makes sense for you.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the mix in the business, we're very pleased with how the whole store's performing frankly. We've got a lot of exciting developments and innovations right across all of the departments we play in. And the vast majority of those are kicking very nice goals for us, and we got great customer responses. So our merchant team and our operational team are working very cohesively and there's an exciting couple of years ahead as we continue to innovate on our product offer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fantastic. And just finally, on the food and liquor side of things, I was just thinking in terms of the fact that sort of incremental margins on the sales have slowed quite a bit from sort of the second half last year to first half this year. And looking at that, do you think that you've now sort of done that investment phase at the store level that's going to see your variable and your fixed costs coming up and should we expect to see your leverage starting to pick up from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I mean there will still be investment required. It's not complete yet. But I think that we'll be looking further to improve our overall efficiencies in the stores as we maintain our sales momentum. There was growth on EBIT from this period last year to where we are now. I'd anticipate growth again during the course of the second half. But beyond that, I would think we'll just look at a progressive program, but it will be back-end weighted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fantastic. Sorry, last one. Just on the deflation side of things, that &#x2013; it looks like Q2 was sort of probably negative two or around that mark in the food and liquor side. Is that how we should think about it for the next few quarters, do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that &#x2013; it's difficult &#x2013; obviously it's difficult to predict where inflation or deflation is going to be going forward because there are so many variable factors that influence that. But I would anticipate that in the second half that you're going to have low levels of inflation coming through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fantastic. Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. Guy, you've given your 10/10/20 strategy a good shake although it doesn't look coming from the topline, so two questions for you. The trade paints a picture that you've obviously got lower price points but you're selling lesser volume and that was best explained in the revenue line. But with those sorts of metrics, I don't see how your profit is up unless you've reduced your cost of doing business significantly. And in respect to that, are you pulling most of your product out of GHPL now?</p>

          <p>Yep, I'll see you tomorrow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Getting off &#x2013; I mean I'm just repeating what I said before. We were selling products before below cost, so we've stopped selling them. They had high average sale price in them, so that's why your sales drop and your profit moves up somewhat. High/low is a very interesting pricing strategy. And if you understand the DNA of it, which is very complex, getting to an everyday low price to consumers that they trust actually can push volumes up. And that's what we've seen -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And pushes margins up as well. What I'm not telling you is what point in the high/low I sat on. It's just that I'm sitting on the best possible price I can deliver to consumers that they like to the point that it drives volume. And when you get the right price and you drive volume, you get a significant increase in dollar margins.</p>
          <p>The two reductions in the cost of doing business really happened about a year ago and are starting to flow through more significantly now. One's in the supply chain. The Kmart supply chain was hugely over-invested in and so we're getting the benefits from that. And the non-store costs that we mentioned before.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ian, can I just ask you about these non-value items, these KVIs that you're working in your communications with customers. Coles seems to have a very communication strategy to Woolworths. So I'm just wondering is this the go forward strategy? Does it have to evolve? Does it have to change? If market conditions change would you change what your communications are to customers or this is where you're going and where you have to stay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the customers are always interested in value delivery and they'll look at across a basket of shops. So how we communicate will vary depending on where we think their leanings tend to at certain moments in time. So where there are opportunities to demonstrate value through KVIs, we will see that opportunity. But our Christmas campaign was more broadly based around Coles' home brand, house brand and all the differences that we put into our Coles Finest range.</p>
          <p>We had a number of different new product developments there in our fresh food areas through the free range turkeys and additional hams that we did. But we operated even the basic products like mince pies with better products and better value than last year. So there's no one aspect to the strategy, Greg. It actually is looking at individual moments in time and seeing what we believe best appeals to consumers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So from where you sit, is there a price war?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've got to look at the difference between sort of rhetoric and reality really. There have been a number of different protestations on whether prices are coming down or not. Competitors are talking about prices lower than last year, which can broadly reflect what's happened in the marketplace. Many of them are reflected by changes in cost structures at suppliers or even reductions in levies from the government.</p>
          <p>So they tend to reflect what's happened in the industry anyway in many instances. Our deflation level has been a genuine one and we are looking to invest and drive value. And it's not just about price on KVIs. Other areas of the business have seen fairly significant deflation particularly in fruit and veg where certain product categories and products have seen deflation of up to 25%. So it's about maintaining a strong competitive position.</p>

          <p>Hi, team. A couple of quick questions if I may, this one is for Guy. If I have a look at your performance in Kmart, can you give us an indication as to what percentage of your sales you've eliminated because they were non-profitable or extremely low profit and therefore have been able to replace with higher profit sales?</p>
          <p>And supplementary to that, how far through the process are you on doing that? Is that now complete and we're looking at in effect a clean sales line going forward? Or is that only halfway through complete so you'd expect to see the same sort of impact coming through in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I actually won't comment on what percentage that we've exited versus added on because clearly we're moving metrics around all over the place in the business. All I can say is that we're probably about three quarters of the way through reengineering all of this because now as I mentioned, we're now moving into a new phase which we launched to our consumers about Expect Change.</p>
          <p>So this Expect Change piece is very critical for us because we need to &#x2013; with all the changes that have happened in the stores, with faster service, friendlier service, clearer aisles and easier to shop, we need to be telling &#x2013; reigniting with consumers that used to visit us to come back. So that's why in my outlook I've talked about a moderate sales growth that I expect at least in this quarter that will be in the positive.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What &#x2013; was the majority of your margin expansion gross margin or cost of doing business related?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was in both areas. The gross margin improves because of the &#x2013; because of what I articulated about the exiting unprofitable products. And the costs of doing business reduction maybe was about a third of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Launa, in your area, again the margin of improvement there, was that fairly equally weighted or is that mainly CODB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a number of things as I've said because we did a lot of work on our supply chain which saw that improve our margin, but that is still going to cost to the business as such. So, it was a number of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No indication as to roughly whether it was more one than the other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. As I just said though, don't forget it was the swing as well into the higher margined items that we were selling which did benefit us, as it moved away from electronics and that type of product that was low margin more into apparel which is our core competency which does traditionally have higher margins.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This one is for Stewart. Stewart, your expansion of your met coal production capabilities, are you expecting to sell all of that to existing customers? Or are you going to have to develop new customer relationships to move that extra volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's fair to say that we've forward sold the additional volume to take it up to the 8 to 8.5 million tons of export metallurgical coal. The majority of that has gone to our existing customers in North Asia. There's one or two additional customers we've brought on line. But, essentially our philosophy has been very much to look after existing customers before we look outside. So, essentially it's gone to our existing customer base.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. Gee, this turnaround thing seems pretty easy, when are you going to have a crack at Fosters? No ideas? Look just in terms of the potential expansion &#x2013; sorry, the expansion in Curragh, I'm just wondering whether you've got any further idea in terms of the timing across the FY '11 year of that volume through put. You've provided updated guidance for FY '10 of 6.3 to 6.8. Can you provide any further clarity in terms of FY '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've said there is that the expansion will come online late calendar year 2011. So, Q4 2011 is the timing for the additional volume coming online.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we'll talk about sort of volume expectations for the 10 or 11 year at the briefing day in May</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. And I just wanted to go back to one of the very first questions asked by Phil and just towards Ian. I'm not sure whether he mentioned growth in the new format stores. Obviously, it's not a large enough store base to move the needle on total sales for Coles. But I was just wondering how the sales growth was going there with the reformatting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean the stores have new concepts in them, the sales growth in those stores continues to perform well. We're seeing improvements in fresh participation, in customer perceptions of freshness and value in service well ahead of the chain. So, it's an encouraging sales story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's all from me. Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And your next question will come from Richard Barwick from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Richard and team. A question for Ian for starters. How much of the deflation that we saw across the half is the result of price reinvestment and how much is actually natural deflation in the supply chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't split that out, but what we're doing as a program is ensuring we've got a strongly competitive position in the marketplace. And we're investing in price to drive volume and deliver better value to customers. And customers are responding to that by shopping with us more often and spending more with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's been a &#x2013; I guess in the long term there's been a few &#x2013; there's been perception issues from consumers towards Coles' pricing. Have you &#x2013; do you feel like that you've got consumers thinking about Coles' pricing the way that you'd like them to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that supermarkets generally, there's more work that needs to be done. I think that the level of trust there is in supermarket pricing in Australia it is lower than it is in other countries. And I think that what we've got to do is to try and have more openness and transparency in our pricing policy. That's why we moved to our uniform pricing policy, which we announced a few weeks ago to try and make sure that consumers accept this sort of consistency across individual states. And customers have responded well to that particular move.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How long do you think it will take Ian before you're in a position or perhaps where the consumers are thinking and believing in the price proposition as you describe it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have to work on it continually. I don't think you'll ever be there completely. Consumers will obviously look to seek out value and they've got every right to do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You mentioned or at least it was listed on the slide pack, increasing competition as part of the Coles' outlook. I don't think you really touched on it in much detail though and how much of the price reductions that we've just seen from Woolworths plays into that comment? I'm hoping you could explain that in a little bit more detail please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I think there's a broader competitive set out there. I think everybody is mindful of the fact that the consumer is becoming more value focused. I think that last year it was marked in terms of consumer consideration in that regard, when there was risk of the recession.</p>
          <p>And although that was narrowly avoided and there's broader levels of confidence, I think that once consumers have sought out value they maintain that habit. And I think all retailers have to be mindful for that. I think that there's a certain degree of confusion over the Woolworths position. I think that in their announcement they said that their inflation number is 1.6%.</p>
          <p>So, in their sales level that's about $300 million of price rises against 120 million of claimed price reductions. So, I don't know whether they are putting three times the prices up as they're bringing down or not. You'll have to ask them. But our position is a genuine one where, based on our calculations, that we're investing in price to deliver better value. And that's where the 0.9% deflation comes from. It's real.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep, I understand. The 40 renewal stores that are on the ground now, how many of those are new stores and how many are refurbishments of an existing store?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Broadly 50-50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think you'd given some color before around numbers targeting 50 renewal stores for the end of financial year '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's about right, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I mean &#x2013; it would make for a pretty lazy second half with only ten more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've got to remember in the second half you've got other factors that prevail. We're coming out of the Christmas period and into Easter and a lot of it is a question of timing of what stores are coming out of the ground. So it's a balance across the financial year. I mean, 50 at this stage in the turnaround, I think Asda had less than 10 at the same point in time. And it's not a rush on numbers. It's more ensuring that we've got the right concepts working to deliver the right return.</p>
          <p>We've seen that we're getting good consumer responses from that. We've got stores in each state and across different demographics, so it's giving us real insights into what's working. And in some respects there are some elements of renewal that we can lift out of the renewal stores and roll back across the fleet. And we're doing that in our health and beauty concept, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, sticking with the 50 for this year and sticking also with the 100 for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when we said we would get &#x2013; during the course of 2011, we'd anticipate getting up to a &#x2013; if you're at full pace you would be up to around about 100. But I think that what we've got to recognize in this it's not just about physical renewal. It involves a lot of changes in terms of philosophy in the stores, on people, the product offering as well and a broad range of concepts as well. So, we'll be progressively broadening the program. But, we're looking very carefully at the returns that we're getting out of the stores before committing to broader levels of roll out from where we are now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a lot of other things going on too, Richard, like the easy ordering rollout which is very significant as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I understand. In terms of driving like-for-like sales growth, do you see increased fresh participation as the biggest driver?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think that it's certainly been a benefit. But we've seen as I mentioned earlier on one of the previous questions, we're seeing positive growth in each areas of our store, whether it be in core grocery and also in fresh food.  We're also seeing good sales improvements in liquor as well. That's the encouraging thing about the program at the moment that we're seeing momentum in each aspect of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And a question for Guy now. Guy, obviously we talked a lot about what you've done on gross margins, category mix and smarter promotions et cetera. Would you say you're actually starting to win some customers back from Target and Big W yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've always had the view that my competitors are a lot more closer to the K-Mart stores than what all of you have referred to in mentioning Target and Big W mainly because of the walking distance between the three brands. So, I still feel the same way about that, is that each -- my businesses have a lot of competitors right next to them. And I believe that if we focus on price, products that consumers need, and make sure that the team members deliver great superior service, that we will get a bigger percentage of consumers coming back to K-Mart as well as getting them to spend some more. So, it'll take some time, but I'm still of this firm belief that my competitors are within a three minute walk of where my current K-Marts are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So how &#x2013; what does that mean in terms of how long do we have to wait until we start to see some positive like-for-like sales growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look forward to talking to you in May or April.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that sounds promising. And final question for Terry. Obviously we've seen some big licks come out of working capital. How much more of that should we expect to see before it settles down and normalizes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think I'll reiterate again that &#x2013; to look at the first half as there is a bit of seasonality in those numbers. So, that's the first point I think that you've got to consider. Then we look at the turnaround performance particularly in K-Mart and Coles. We've always had a strong working capital focus across all of Wesfarmers and Launa's and the management team there is &#x2013; have been focusing on all of the things that Wesfarmers would've focused on in any case. So, when we look at the turnaround, there was obviously some opportunities in Coles and K-Mart. I think we've moved very quickly at a lot of that. I think the reality is that increasingly we'll probably see some slowing in working capital release because you get to a point where it becomes harder. So, &#x2013; but we will &#x2013; if we reflect back well in excess of where we thought we'd be on working capital release. So, we're pleased where we've got to today and it's one of those things you keep working hard at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when I think back to the original documentation you guys put out when you first bought Coles, you're well ahead of those sort of numbers. So, I guess that's the question, if we'd see any more periods of the big changes or if it's time to settle down into I guess a more normal pattern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Hi guys.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi David. I thought you must have been asleep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I nearly did. I forget what I was going to ask &#x2013; when I look at the &#x2013; I don't want to be a killjoy on the performance of Target and K-Mart because clearly outstanding results. But when I look at the retail businesses &#x2013; when you look at Bunnings, Bunnings has sales growths around that 14% and EBIT growth's 14%. Coles volume growth is around seven percentage now and you're getting 12% to 13% EBIT growth and Office works was around that 10% sales growth and 10% EBIT growth. And they're both businesses I think Ian reiterated many times, reinvesting in value for the customers.</p>
          <p>Now I understand when you look at Target, you're looking at 2 to 3 or 4% sales growth and 30% EBIT growth and K-Mart negative sales growth and 100% EBIT growth. And the things that were cited were areas cited that just about every retailer in the world is doing, supply chain, cutting unprofitable lines, selling more profitable items et cetera, et cetera. I suppose where I'm getting to here is I'm very concerned that maybe you're cutting the mustard a little bit. I mean, the last retailer I saw generate negative sales growth but with a big profit increase was Myer and they've got a bit of a world of trouble at the moment. I'm just worried because I haven't heard Launa or I haven't heard Guy mention once that they're reinvesting in the value for their customers. It has all been about cutting unprofitable items, cutting costs and basically back-pocketing the outcome of that. So, that's my observation. I'm concerned about that. I was just wondering if you could comment on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David let me just kick-off and then I'll quickly hand on to Guy and Launa. I think there's a big difference between those two businesses. And I'll let Launa answer for Target. But K-Mart, 6 or 12 months ago, everyone was talking about what a dog of a business K-Mart was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But what we did was we put in place a very good management team that's now delivering on our strategy. And so, while some people might be surprised with the pace of improvement, no one should be surprised that that business can improve. And in fact you've just got to look at some other businesses that have done that. So, I think where we've taken &#x2013; while the performance of K-Mart is very pleasing, you're looking at the overall context of where it's come from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I can remember you saying to me, Richard and others that you were looking at Myer's strategy and K-Mart was going to follow a Myer's strategy. Now Myer's strategy was to really take costs out, not really grow sales. And right now it's probably fair to say that that business is really stagnating and struggling to go forward. I'm just wondering at the end of the day, you've got to try to improve the underlying business. I mean you can cut costs and bank a big profit, I suppose the issue is the sustainability of that and that's where I think most of the questions today are trying to get at.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you improved the underlying business or have you just basically made it more profitable; it may only last for a short period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's any question that we are improving the underlying business of K-Mart significantly. And while I don't want to comment on other businesses, I think if you look at where Myer was when it was sold off from the Coles Group to where it is now, I think it's a much stronger business as well. And my comments about K-Mart in relation to Myer were that there were a lot of things that were done in K-Mart that could be improved on, and with the appropriate attention, focus and good management and focus from our staff, we would be able to achieve, and we're on that path, and I actually think that path's got a long way to go.</p>
          <p>And on Target, as I said, I think people get into a paradigm of thinking that this is &#x2013; business is good and this is all it can do. I actually think what we've shown in the first half and we've had some things go our way, but what we've shown in the first half is that Target's actually got lots of further potential as well. I'll let Guy and Launa talk about specifics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So David, I don't know whether to thank you for your misguidance on what you thought was going to happen. But I want to be very clear about K-Mart. Whilst it's a complex problem that's occurred over the last decade, this $4 billion business, unlike all the businesses you refer to that had a cost-cutting strategy to improve profit, this business had no profit. Its net income was zero. So, whilst the results are pleasing for the first six months, they're still in third place compared to the two businesses that all of you keep comparing me to, which is Target and Big W. I'm still third and there's still a long, long way to go.</p>
          <p>Their other two models have got similar revenue with EBITs between 6% to 10%. So, I've got a long way to go. So, our business was focused on three things: discovery, working out what was wrong, and what we needed to address. The second phase was renewal. And that's a little bit like before you start growing the business, we needed to fix up the DNA of the organization that was built over many, many years and was not acceptable. So, the renewal part was resetting the foundations before you start putting a glossy paint to make it look good.</p>
          <p>So whilst I know that sales growth is absolutely important, I did announce, if you were listening earlier, that we've now moved into phase three which is growth.  So they're all going together, and one isn't, one isn't &#x2013; not reliant on the other. They all need to continue on in a forward motion. And as I said, my expectations over the next quarter is that you'll start to see positive sales momentum. But the resetting of the business will clearly throw up some challenges in regards to the profitability that we achieved in the first half, may not be as significant in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Launa, is it &#x2013; because I must say again both of you, neither of you actually said what Ian said, reinvesting in the value for the customer. Neither of you actually said that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well David, let me just say I might not have said it, but we in fact are doing that. In the last few months, we've been very aware that competition have been lowering their prices, and we have in turn responded, particularly in categories where we felt we were being attacked. In fact going forward we are starting to do further price reinvestment, and we have called that out. And if you'd been into our stores over the last few months, you would have actually seen categories where we had dropped the price, where we've put new lower price. And we are continuing to do that and to reinvest, and strongly.</p>
          <p>The thing about summer was that our products, particularly in ladies wear, are well priced. Our whole strategy is to be 20 to 30% less than specialty stores, and that's what we are. We keep a very close eye on what the costs and prices are in both the Myer's, Jackie E and any of those other retailers that we deem to be competitors. And we therefore make sure our prices are adjusted accordingly. Going forward, we will continue to do that. We are also aware of what Big W does, particularly on the lower price points, and we have made sure that we have strongly moved volume into those lower price points, particularly in children's wear.</p>
          <p>So David, I might not have said it, but we are very aware of what's happening out there in the market and responding accordingly. Look, for all the great profit, we were disappointed with the sales result, but it was what we expected. We were up against a very tough &#x2013; we had had a good sales growth the previous Christmas, we were up over 6% if you recall. We had to now go against that and we planned it well.</p>
          <p>We didn't have a great December and we anticipated it. What we did do though is we managed our stocks and managed our costs. I am cautious for the next half, and I called that out quite clearly to you because we did have a good winter, and it wasn't product that gave us a good profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a great result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I just want to say one thing; I did say it, so maybe you weren't listening properly. I said expect change at K-Mart with faster and friendlier service, expect clearer and cleaner aisles, expect lower prices and expect longer trading hours. And if you didn't hear that; watch TV. It's also on the TV where I'm giving that commitment to consumers right across Australia and New Zealand, and on billboards if you don't watch TV, on the road.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I hope the consumers watch it, because then we'll see greater sales growth, so I'm sure they will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look forward to seeing you in May.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just finally, moving on to one last question on Resources, Stewart. The hedging book I notice, I think you've got about U.S. $330 million locked in. And if rumors be true or if speculation be true, that will probably only hedge about 1.5 million tons of coal in the coming year. When do you think that you might have to start rolling that book out, because at the moment Curragh is pretty &#x2013; in an un-hedged situation for currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, clearly we recognize that and over the next few months as certainty comes out there in terms of coal prices we'll be hedging to cover our policy over the next three to four years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, it's Terry here. We've got a policy that we still abide by, which is on a declining basis, an increasing percentage of Curragh's hedge book. So we will look at that. But I think in the next &#x2013; over the next year, our hedging will be fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great results, guys. Launa and Guy certainly took the heat off Ian today, so well done.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me just say one thing David, don't be thinking you're going to get 12.8% EBIT margin for the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll never underestimate you, Launa, you know that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks David.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question will come from Andrew Harrington from Patersons. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will need to wrap up shortly, so. Hi, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll be quick. So good afternoon. I'm going to ask this question of Stewart. What's the CapEx rollout over the next few quarters, in particular for Curragh? And what's the profile production over the next, more specifically FY '11, but if you can give an outline of the total production levels going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll give guidance on next year's production and sales at the May Investor Relations. Clearly I've given guidance for the second half of this current financial year, and that's 6.2 to &#x2013; 6.3 to 6.8. In terms of capital, we've clearly announced some major capital expenditures over the last 12 months. Blackwater Creek is finished in December. It rolled into our first half capital expenditure, which is about $107 million for the first half.</p>
          <p>Second half of this financial year is going to be a further $200 million plus. Clearly the bulk of that will be in and around the Curragh expansion which we announced in November, and that's $286 million. There's a big chunk of stay-in-business capital associated with running our businesses. So we do have a reasonable capital program over the next couple of years, and it's all about driving growth through our businesses. So, and it's an exciting time for us. In terms of the &#x2013; I suppose the expansion of Curragh, we are particularly excited in terms of that because we've managed to get that expansion away probably ahead of the pack in terms of other expansions for the coal industry. We've been able to capture what we think is very, very competitive infrastructure and capital prices. And if the market goes the way we think it will be, we'll be able to capture some of that with higher metallurgical prices going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And does that include all the allocation of rail and port? That's all locked away for the expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've got sufficient rail and port capacity to meet that 8 to 8.5 million tons per year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we got one more question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Your final question will come from Daniel Broeren from CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon everybody. Launa, just one question for you, what sort of investment would be required to bring the design function in-house, and just an idea of the timing for that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just say we are actually underway with our new process and we already do have designers within our business. What we have looked to do is to further increase the number, both here and in Hong Kong. And the idea is that that will be funded as we start to consolidate our suppliers and be more meaningful to them. And we are also expecting to have costs come away from our suppliers as we undertake the design work in-house, because the whole idea is we will give them a design pack which has got all the QA specifications and everything that will be handed over to them. We've also &#x2013; looking to be purchasing some of our own fabrications which will enable us as well to look to get better prices. This is not going to happen immediately. It's commenced, but you'll only really start to see the benefits of it unfold next year.</p>
          <p>And we're actually in a tricky stage at the moment, because we're still working in the old way of working, in other words the way Target used to work. But yet we're starting to do far more forward planning to make this effective from really the next calendar year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So basically we're going to see some GP margin benefit from this strategy going on from the next calendar year plus currency benefits still to come in the next fiscal year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry Andrew you broke up there. I didn't get that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can you hear me now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, yes. Can you just repeat what you said? I didn't quite get that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there're going to be some GP margin benefits coming through from this strategy in the next calendar year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not in this financial year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right, next financial year plus some currency benefits coming through in the next financial year as well. So is it fair to assume that the average margin on an annual basis for Target can increase beyond 12 &#x2013; beyond current levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't like to say that. This is called a whole strategy that's unfolding in the sense of how are we going to be going to market. Our actual strategy of differentiated products stays the same. It's the manner in which we're trying to achieve that that has been changing, that's going to be changed. And I wouldn't like to go out there and make any forecasts at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for that. And one last question on Chemicals and Fertilizer. Just looking back at last year's half year presentation deck, it was mentioned that the Varanus costs impacted EBIT by about 50 million in the first half, and this year's result has been a $27 million EBIT contribution. Can you just talk through the difference there and why we haven't seen all that contribution come back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, we said that we had a very good Chemicals half and returned to normal gas supplies. So it would be fair to say that the value that we put in the previous half has returned to profitability, which then obviously leaves you with fertilizer, which we said we had a pretty significant write-down of 25 million. And you could assume from the comments that the margins in Fertilizer have been extremely low in the last half as well. So effectively, in broad terms as I said you've got a decline in fertilizer earnings, reasonably significantly and you've got an increase in chemicals earnings reasonably significantly. And overall we're above last year but it's &#x2013; that's what drove it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now that makes sense. Thanks for that. Cheers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you all. We look forward to seeing you all in the not too distant future</p>
