          <p>Greetings, and welcome to the Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Second Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Elana Holzman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Holzman, you may begin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Teva's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.</p>
          <p>We hope you've had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is available on our website at www.tevapharm.com. Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast of this call that is also available on our website.</p>
          <p>Today, we are joined by Shlomo Yanai, President and CEO, Eyal Desheh, Chief Financial Officer, Bill Marth, President and CEO of Teva North America, Dr. Gerard Van Odijk, President and CEO, Teva Europe, and Yitzhak Peterburg, Group Vice President &#x2013; Global Branded Products.</p>
          <p>Shlomo Yanai will begin by providing an overview of our results. Please note that Shlomo will be referring in his prepared comments to non-GAAP operating profit, net income and EPS. Eyal will provide additional detail on the items excluded from our non-GAAP results. Also, all financial comparisons Shlomo will be making in his prepared comments are to the second quarter of 2010 unless otherwise noted.</p>
          <p>We will then open the call to question-and-answer period. Before we proceed with the call, I would like to remind everyone the Safe Harbor language contained in today's press release also pertains to this conference call and webcast.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Elana.</p>
          <p>Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the second quarter of 2011. Net sales during the quarter were $4.2 billion, representing 11% top line growth. Quarterly operating profit was $1.1 billion with net income of $984 million. And cash flow from operations during the quarter reached a record $1.3 billion. This brought us to EPS of $1.10.</p>
          <p>With the first half of the year now behind us, we continue to anticipate higher growth during the second half of 2011, as we previously guided. Already of Q2 though, we began to see the impact from our strategy of growing our generics business through global diversification with excellent contributions on our business in Europe and other parts of the world, enabling another quarter of growth for Teva despite the challenges we face in our U.S. generic business.</p>
          <p>In the U.S, we had no major launches during the quarter. In addition, the second quarter of 2010, with its many new launches and sales of key products, set a high bar for comparisons. In fact, the declining revenues, as a result of products that were either absent or significantly diminished in the second quarter of 2011 totaled over $470 million. I want to reiterate that we do not in any way view the challenges we faced in the U.S. during the first half of 2011 as representing a trend. In fact, we anticipate over a dozen launches over the balance of the year, including an exclusive generics launch of the $2.9 billion brand <mark type="ph" /> Deprexa (04:06), which is scheduled for October.</p>
          <p>I am happy to report we have partnered with Dr. Reddy and our exclusivity for Deprexa now includes the exclusive marketing of the 20-mg strength.</p>
          <p>The opportunity to bring high quality, affordable generics to patients in the U.S. has never been greater. There is over $0.25 trillion of U.S. branded opportunity awaiting generics. Teva's pipeline includes 185 ANDAs, representing $116 billion of this branded value, with 77 first-to-file opportunities worth $54 billion, which creates tremendous opportunity for our future growth.</p>
          <p>These opportunities in generics are further enhanced by the advent of more complex branded products with more sophisticated IP and higher technical barriers. Producing this product requires significant resources, but in the long term, they generate a greater and more sustainable revenues. Teva's scale and advanced capabilities makes us uniquely well positioned to capture these opportunities.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we made excellent progress in resolving the quality issues that slowed our production and hampered sales in the first half of 2011. In early June, Teva received notification from the FDA that the corrective action we had taken and the commitments we have made with respect to our Jerusalem oral solid dosage facility appeared to address the concerns listed in the FDA's warning letter from January. The FDA has conducted a follow-up inspection, which concluded with no observations, and the agency has resumed approving product applications for products manufactured at this site.</p>
          <p>As you know, we have resumed production at our <mark type="ph" /> Earbank (06:24) facility. We have been working closely with the FDA's Drug Shortage division, and I am pleased to report that we are gradually adding more and more products for distribution.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, Teva has also took some important steps in terms of risk integration through a legal settlement of two major parts of four suits. Those related to our at-risk launches of <mark type="ph" /> DevaPantin (06:52) and Lotrel. We are very pleased with these settlements, which would significantly reduce our exposure.</p>
          <p>As you know, those launches have played an important role in our generics strategy and will continue to do so. At the same time, we will continue to mitigate that risk whenever possible.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to Europe, which provides a perfect demonstration of the positive impact we are already beginning to see from the global diversification of our generics business. During the second quarter, we made excellent progress in Europe overall, as well as in several key European markets.</p>
          <p>We enjoyed record sales in Europe, up 82% in U.S. dollar terms, driven in large part by the quick and successful integration of Ratiopharm, which is delivering real results and significantly increasing our profitability and competitiveness.</p>
          <p>Our average organic growth across the major European markets was 10% during the quarter, solidifying our position as the generics market leader in Europe. And we believe we are well positioned for continuous growth in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>This was an especially strong quarter in Germany, where sales were up 8% organically, despite the very challenging market environment. In terms of sales of our Ratiopharm branded products, we have now become the number one generic player.</p>
          <p>This was also a very strong quarter in other key European markets where Teva is the leading player, including the U.K. where sales grew organically by 29%, boosted by our <mark type="ph" /> Trotostatic (08:51) launch there, and in Italy, where sales were up organically by 25%. Other countries, including Spain, also experienced significant sales growth.</p>
          <p>In France, market growth slowed to the low single-digits, and we saw an increase in competition and pricing pressure. But despite the challenges, we retained our market share position in France. When we look at the overall picture of our European business, it is clear that Europe is now a major contributor to Teva's growth.</p>
          <p>We are also realizing the benefit of our strategic initiatives in other geographies. During the second quarter, we made good progress in growing our Eastern Europe business, particularly in Russia, where generic sales increased by 47% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. In Latin America, generic sales grew organically by 14%.</p>
          <p>This was also a quarter of major strategic achievements for Teva in Japan. Japan is the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world. And as you know, during the quarter we acquired Taiyo, the third-largest generic company in Japan with sales of over $500 million annually. And we have already closed the transaction.</p>
          <p>We had originally announced our intent to purchase 57% of the shares of Taiyo, but in fact, we were able to purchase nearly 100%. Taiyo provides us with a very strong platform for achieving our strategic objective of becoming a major player in the fast growing Japanese market. Our current JV in Japan reached sales of approximately $60 million, up 18% in U.S. dollar terms. As you can see, Teva's global generics platform is enjoying strong growth. From a strategic perspective, the second quarter demonstrates the great benefits we are deriving from our initiative to build new growth drivers, broadening our scope and reducing our dependence from any one business or geography. We are more excited than ever before about the opportunities that lie ahead for us and the continued growth of our global generics business.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to our branded business where we've had a very strong quarter and enjoyed both sales and market share growth across the board. This was a record quarter for Azilect, in-market sales of which grew by 38%.  Sales were strong in Europe, as well as in the U.S., where Azilect is the leading branded product to treat Parkinson's disease. Copaxone continues to be the global leader among MS therapies.</p>
          <p>In-market sales of Copaxone reached $957 million during the quarter, up 24%. In the U.S., Copaxone retained its market share of 40.6% and grew 7% in volume despite the introduction of new therapies. We believe that there was a great deal of opportunity for continued growth, especially when Teva complete the take back of full marketing rights in Europe for Copaxone, beginning in 2012.</p>
          <p>As we anticipated, IMS data shows that the production of new MS therapies into the marketplace has had the affect of increasing the size of the market overall, which has also increased the sales of Copaxone. We believe this market growth holds great promise for Copaxone, future Copaxone enhancement and our pipeline product, Laquinimod. And we expect to receive the results of our Bravo study on Laquinimod shortly.</p>
          <p>The second quarter was an extremely busy one for Teva in terms of business development. In addition to our announcement, and closing of the acquisition of Taiyo, we announced our planned acquisition of Cephalon. Earlier this month, Cephalon's shareholder's voted to approve the deal and we are awaiting regulatory approval in the U.S. and E.U.</p>
          <p>In essence, this acquisition will do for Teva's branded business what our initiatives across Europe, Japan and Russia are already doing for our generics business, that is, to significantly broaden our platform and reduce our dependence on any one growth driver. We are expanding our branded business into a diverse specialty pharma business, which will not rely on one product or even a handful of products, but rather a portfolio of successful products in key niche therapeutic areas.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention, and now let's turn the call over to Eyal for a detailed financial review of the quarter, as well as an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Eyal?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Shlomo, and good day to everyone. I hope you have had an opportunity to review the press release we issued earlier today. As you can see, and in line with our original guidance for the first half of 2011, we experienced another challenging quarter for our U.S. generics business, which had a major impact on our results.</p>
          <p>We reported a quarter, which for the most part was in line with our expectation, including top line growth compared to Q2 2010, and earnings per share improvement compared to Q1 2011 and Q2 2010. We continue to generate strong cash flow, with record cash flow from operation of over $1.3 billion and free cash flow of $897 million.</p>
          <p>Before we delve into the numbers, I would like to touch on two topics. First, I would like to remind everyone that we are presenting GAAP and non-GAAP results. In our non-GAAP presentation, we have excluded the following items this quarter: legal charges of $221 million, primarily in connection with the settlement of our litigation with Novartis on generic Lotrel and with Pfizer on Gabapentin, and product liability lawsuits pertaining to Prevacid, amortization of purchased intangible assets amounting to $162 million, of which $152 million are included in cost of goods sold and the remaining $10 million in selling and marketing expenses. I'd like to remind you that we started recording amortization of Ratiopharm intangibles in Q1 this year.</p>
          <p>Restructuring and acquisition expenses and impairment of assets of $51 million related primarily to the acquisition of Ratiopharm, costs related to regulatory action taking in facilities of $45 million, which relates primarily to quality issues in Irvine, our Animal Health business, and Jerusalem, an inventory step-up of $16 million relating to the acquisition of Th&#xE9;ramex and Infarmasa, and related tax effects of $86 million.</p>
          <p>You should note that the items excluded in arriving at our non-GAAP results for the second quarter of 2010 are not identical to those in the current quarter. Please review our press release and related tables for reconciliation to our GAAP numbers and more complete information. As indicated in the past, we present non-GAAP figures to show you how the management team and our board look at our financial results.</p>
          <p>The second point, foreign currencies, they continue to have an impact on our results this quarter, influencing our P&amp;L, as well as our balance sheet. In the second quarter, foreign currency differences is a positive impact of approximately $222 million on sales and $40 million in non-GAAP operating income, as compared to Q2 2010. Foreign currency also had a positive impact on equity. The weakness of the U.S. dollar, primarily relative to the euro, on June 30 compared to March 31, increased our equity by approximately $338 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at our consolidated results for Q2, sales totaled $4.2 billion, an increase of 11% compared to Q2 last year. In local currencies, sales grew by 5%. Sales in North America declined 15%. Our U.S. generics unit, which had another particularly soft quarter primarily because several products that were major contributors to sales in the comparable quarter 2010 had little or no sales this quarter, and at the same time, there were no significant launches in the quarter to offset this, but we continue to expect the second half to be much stronger than the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Sales in Europe grew 82% in U.S. dollars and 60% in local currency, due mainly to the consolidation of Ratiopharm results. But it is important to note that we again saw organic growth in generic sales in Europe beyond the consolidation of Ratiopharm, calculated &#x2013; as we did last quarter, as if Ratiopharm and Th&#xE9;ramex were part of Teva in Q2 2010, generic sales in Europe grew 4% organically compared to 2% 2010. And as we expected, Germany contributed to our growth in Europe this quarter, with generic sales growing 8% organically.</p>
          <p>Sales in our emerging markets, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia grew 22% in U.S. dollars and 15% on local currencies, with Russia again posting very strong results.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP gross profit margin, which exclude amortization of purchased intangible assets, inventory step (sic) [step-up] (19:54) and costs related to regulatory action taken in facilities was 57.3% in the reported quarter, compared to 59% in the same quarter last year, resulting primarily from a significantly smaller contribution of high margin generic product in the U.S. With the expected improvement in the U.S. generic businesses in the second half of 2011, non-GAAP gross profit margin is also expected to improve.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin were $1.1 billion and 25.9% respectively, down from $1.2 billion and 31.6% in Q2 2010. The previously mentioned decline in high margin generic products in the U.S., as well as high SG&amp;A expenses, contributed to the decline in operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin &#x2013; sorry, I read that. Non-GAAP net income reached $984 million, essentially flat compared to $981 million in Q2 2010. Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share were, as mentioned, $1.10, up 2% compared to last year. The weighted average share count for the fully diluted non-GAAP EPS was 896 million shares.</p>
          <p>Now, let's discuss operating expenses. Net R&amp;D expenses were up 4% compared to Q2 2010, totaling $243 million or 5.8% of sales. The growth in net R&amp;D expenses over the comparable quarter last year is attributed to greater investment in our branded R&amp;D. Gross R&amp;D in Q2, which includes participation of third parties, totaled approximately $262 million. Selling and marketing expenses, excluding amortization of purchased and intangible asset totaled $794 million in the quarter, or 18.9% of sales, compared with 16.7% of sales in Q2 2010. Higher selling and marketing expenses resulted from the consolidation of Ratiopharm and Th&#xE9;ramex.</p>
          <p>Total G&amp;A expenses this quarter were $284 million, or 6.7% of sales, compared with 5% of sales in Q2 last year. The increase in G&amp;A expenses this quarter resulted from exceptionally high legal expenses related to product liability and patent litigation, as well as the inclusion of Ratiopharm and other acquired companies. Foreign exchange also impacted G&amp;A expenses. In the second half of 2010, we expect G&amp;A expenses as a percentage of sales to be lower than what we've seen in Q2.</p>
          <p>We recorded $20 million of net financial income in Q2 2011 compared with $25 million of non-GAAP financial expenses in the comparable quarter of 2010. The income resulted primarily from the settlement of various financial derivatives, including an interest rate swap agreement, which we executed on one of our long-term notes. We expect finance expenses in the second half of 2011 to be around the levels of Q1 this year.</p>
          <p>The non-GAAP tax expense provided for the second quarter was $113 million of pre-tax, non-GAAP income of $1.1 billion. Our current estimate on the non-GAAP annual tax rate for 2011 continues to be 11%, compared to 13% for 2010. The lower GAAP tax rate for 2011 resulted from a particular mix of products that are manufactured in geographies where Teva benefits from tax incentives. The estimated tax rate for 2011 GAAP results is 5%.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a look at our cash flow. Cash generated from operations this quarter reached a record of $1.3 billion, up 39% compared to Q2 2010. Our free cash flow, excluding net capital expenditure of $224 million and dividend payment of $203 million, amounted to $897 million. The strong cash flow resulted primarily from group collection and working capital items.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we bought back approximately 2 million shares at an average price of $48.98 per share for a total of approximately $95 million. Since we started this buyback program, which our board approved in December 2010, we bought 11.8 million shares for a total of almost $600 million, reflecting an average price of $50.28 per share. Including our earlier redemption of the convertible debentures, we invested over $1.4 billion in buying back shares since the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>On June 30, cash and marketable securities totaled $1.4 billion, up approximately $350 million from March 31. Our total outstanding loans, bonds and convertible debentures stood at $6.4 billion, down approximately $400 million from $6.8 billion as of the end of March. Our financial leverage, as of June 30, 2011, was 21%, down from 23% at the end of March, lower than our financial leverage prior to the Ratiopharm acquisition, which we closed exactly a year ago.</p>
          <p>Following the financing of Taiyo, which we already completed and Cephalon, which we now expect to close in October, our leverage will, of course, increase. The anticipated October closing date of Cephalon is based on the current status of our discussions with FTC and the European Commission.</p>
          <p>DSO, or day sales outstanding, declined to 41 days this quarter compared to 46 days in the previous quarter and 50 days in Q2 2010. We calculate DSO after netting out from the receivables, our sales reserve and allowances. Inventory days stood at 197 days, up from 195 days in the previous quarter or 172 days in Q2 2010. The increase in inventory days resulted primarily from foreign exchange differences and preparation for the AOK tender and volume growth in the U.S. generics expected in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Gross capital expenditures reached $226 million this quarter, compared to $234 million in Q1. Dividend &#x2013; on Monday, Teva's board approved a quarterly net dividend amounting to approximately $210 million for quarter. On a per share basis, our dividend, which is declared in Israeli shekels, is NIS 0.80 per share. Based on yesterday's rate of exchange of the shekel to the U.S. dollar, this translates into approximately $0.235 per share.</p>
          <p>And now, I would like to give you an update on our guidance for the second half. We expect that our earning per share for the third quarter will be approximately $1.22. We also expect a very strong fourth quarter and will reaffirm our guidance for 2011 for earning per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.20. This guidance includes the recent Taiyo acquisition, which will be slightly dilutive to non-GAAP earnings, but does not include the pending Cephalon acquisition. Thank you all for your time and attention today.</p>
          <p>Now, we'll be glad to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Our first question is coming from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Eyal, I had a couple of questions. The first is that it seemed like the significantly higher legal expenses in the second quarter held back your profit, and specifically the G&amp;A line grew 50% over year, obviously that includes acquisitions, but you did mention the higher legal expenses. Could you just provide a little bit more color on how much of those legal expenses were one-timers and how we should, you know, think about your legal expense run rate? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Second, with respect to post-Cephalon financials, just wondering if you plan to change your reporting format, starting with the third quarter after you close the Cephalon acquisition. And then finally with respect to Taiyo, you mentioned that you purchased nearly 100%. If you could just remind us of the timing and what the annual sales contribution will be from that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That's a long list. First, on the G&amp;A, we have approximately $30 million of active legal expenses. I don't believe that this is going to be recurring at this level, as I mentioned in my previous comments. It is resulting from our patent litigation, as well as product liability litigation that we're running. We expect this number to come down in the second half of the year. The G&amp;A cost, part of that is done in non-dollar currencies, also increased year-over-year as a result of the strong euro and other European currencies, as well as the strong shekel. So that would be, in fact, the major impacts on G&amp;A. As I mentioned in my notes, this is going &#x2013; we believe that the numbers will come down in the second half, as well of course a percentage of sales which will come down significantly towards our target of 5% of sales.</p>
          <p>Regarding Taiyo, we &#x2013; yeah, the second question is clarification, but regarding Taiyo, as Shlomo mentioned, we did buy 100% of the shares and closed the transaction there. Taiyo is expected to add about $250 million to our sales in the second half of the year, which is within the range of our guidance. And as I said, for the earning per share, it could be slightly &#x2013; a couple of cents diluted at the beginning, and will be accretive in 2010-12. Would you please repeat the question about Cephalon? Because I'm not sure I followed it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yeah, so on Cephalon, just wondering, given that it's a significant addition of branded revenue, just wondering if you're planning on changing your reporting format. And then one other follow-up, sorry to keep piling on the questions, but could you just repeat what you said about third quarter EPS guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Bill Marth. With respect to Cephalon, I know exactly what you're asking with respect to disclosure, and you should anticipate that the level of transparency, or disclosure, will increase. We're still working on those models at this point in time as to what that's going to look like, but yes, we anticipate we'll be doing something there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Schott of J.P. Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much. Just had three questions. The first, just to clarify the guidance, I'm sorry if I missed this. I saw you reiterated the EPS guidance, but were there any other changes to elements of your guidance in terms of the $18.5 billion, $19 billion top line or the SG&amp;A or R&amp;D kind of ratios for the year we should be thinking about?</p>
          <p>The second question, as we think about the rest of 2011, specifically North America generics, can you talk about the key launches that are driving sales higher in subsequent quarters from here? I guess, beyond Zyprexa, what are the major opportunities that you are now reflecting in your guidance? And then the final question, given the strong growth you're seeing in your ex-U.S. generic business, and with these franchises becoming a larger percentage of your sales, can you help us understand the margin differences between these generic franchises and your core U.S. business? How significant of a margin gap is there at this point? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Chris. Why don't I start with, I think your first question was about the guidance on the revenue end, and I think you're asking about Taiyo there and I think that Eyal will speak to that in a second. The other question, though, absent &#x2013; let  me be clear on this. Absent commercially sensitive information, I want you to know &#x2013; we talked about, in Shlomo's speech, a bit about 12 opportunities that I can think of off the top of my head, things like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:14), Combivir, <mark type="ph" /> Depraxa (35:17) of course we mentioned, <mark type="ph" /> Dyzol (35:19), I think we've just launched yesterday or are launching today, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:26) we have a pretty good shot at a product <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:30), we're pretty excited about and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:31). That's just a couple of the opportunities that we see. For whatever particular reason, the second half of the year got particularly backlogged with launches this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and Chris, regarding the revenue guidance, we didn't refer to that. Revenue guidance remained the same as we originally guided at the beginning of the year, $18.5 billion to $19 billion and we're not changing it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Shlomo speaking. Let me just make sure because it's a very, of course, sensitive issue or subject, so I want to make sure that we are very clear on that. We, in fact, with our guidance of 2011, we re-confirmed that, we just tried to give you more clarity, more transparency how to handle the Q3. And therefore, Eyal just provided the $1.22. We have a back-loaded, let's put it this way, Q4. And as we said, there is commercial sensitivity issue that we cannot elaborate more than that. We'll definitely give you more clarity on that when we end the quarter, going into the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, I think you had one last question and I don't think we got that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, and I appreciate all the color on the guidance here. The final question is just a bigger picture one, which is, as we're seeing obviously a larger percent of your business coming from kind of ex-U.S. generic business, can you just help us understand if we look at your core U.S. generic business, as compared to these ex-U.S. franchises, how should we think about the relative margins of those franchises? Is there a large gap now? Is there &#x2013; are the margins relatively similar? Just help us &#x2013; qualitatively how we think about those businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand now. Chris, those margins are actually the same, if not better. Because when you think about the Latin American business, the European businesses, there are a lot &#x2013; a lot of it is <mark type="ph" /> DGXs (37:38) and now you have a little bigger SG&amp;A, but you have a higher pricing point. And so, there's lots of potential there. So, in general, those opportunities are slightly better.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from Elliot Wilbur of Needham &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. I guess, just with respect to sort of the progression of our earnings growth throughout the year, if in fact you do just sort of meet your third quarter guidance, that would imply, based on the reiteration of full year guidance, roughly anywhere from 25% to 50% sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Obviously, variability in timing of U.S. generic launches could in fact be a significant factor behind that delta. But I'm trying to maybe get some additional perspective on what some of the other items of variability may be, embedded in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Elliot, this is Bill Marth. I just &#x2013; with respect to that question, there were &#x2013; the question asked by Chris essentially related to the generic launches. And I want to give you some more clarity on them, and again, absent from commercially sensitive information, that was a good list of launches. But I think the other thing that you need to keep in mind is that all &#x2013; really, all areas of the business ramping up in Q3 and Q4, we see much better respiratory, we see much better &#x2013; we see improved Copaxone, we see improved Azilect, we see improved all other &#x2013; rest of the world. And Shlomo can add more to that, but it's really contributions coming from all divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I may just jump in on that, because I think it's important, as we go toward the future, what you should be more aware of is the importance and the significance of the other generics business out of the U.S., as we go to the future. And it's not just about Europe that I elaborate on that margin. We see the second quarter in a row, how the world is becoming more significant and reaching a much larger part in the overall Teva businesses. It's also about Japan, Eastern Europe, Latin America, all these places, first of all, the room to grow generics there is much more than in any other previously U.S. base for generics. And, believe it or not, the profitability of this business <mark type="ph" /> will due to be (40:20) a level of competition, we've always said the kind of the <mark type="ph" /> business of each one (40:26) brand of generics and some other reasons that we can take offline, is giving us better profitability on that part of the world, at least for the coming years, definitely competition will take it later down.</p>
          <p>But at least, as I said, it's a great opportunity to expand the business and we are ramping up our businesses in these part of the world. And we're pushing hard to get to our numbers. And as I said, you can see the first results, the positive results of that, even in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I had one follow-up question for Eyal. If you could remind us, please, of the timing of the take-back or reacquisition of marketing rights to Copaxone in key ex-U.S. territories. And again, just sort of top-level perspective, what the flow-through or impact on the P&amp;L will look like. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. The major parts of our take-back are actually starting in October. We're taking back Germany and the Nordics, and the rest of the major European countries will start in February next year. We'll take the entire 2012 to materialize. Regarding the input on the numbers, basically when we take back a country from Sanofi, we double the sales and &#x2013; we double the reported sales, of course. We believe that our unique focus on selling will also improve the results in this country. But right off the bat, we're doubling the sales and we're adding about 50% to the profit, just from the action of taking back a country from Sanofi. And the impact will begin to be seen in Q4 this year. It's part of the &#x2013; of what's happening in Q4, and of course, will be &#x2013; it will even intensify in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Eyal, if I could just follow-up on that. You mention &#x2013; you stated that you add back about 50% of the profit, but does that take into consideration the need to sort of maintain some sort of active promotional presence and the like, in order to support the product?</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Maris of CLSA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A few questions. First, on the Express Scripts/Medco deal, what does it mean for Teva? What does it mean for the industry? Secondly, the &#x2013; is there anything in the current debt ceiling proposals bill that concerns you from an industry standpoint on pricing or reimbursement? And then lastly, I think one of the questions a lot of clients are going to ask today is, if the fourth quarter is so back-end loaded, why, at the beginning of the year, did you not get a better handle on it, and kind of focus it there? That's just going to be a complaint that I hear, so I think it's &#x2013; you might as well address it now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Bill Marth. I'll start with the Express &#x2013; the Express Scripts question. This is kind of more of the same that we've seen, which is of course, large customers becoming even larger. Meaning large suppliers. So it really reflects more to what we've often called, as Shlomo has often referred to, as our big-to-big philosophy. So, big purchasers and big suppliers, and we think that bodes well for us.</p>
          <p>To be sure, we've had some issues as of late and Shlomo spoke of those and we are taking action to correct those and we see improvement moving forward. But we think this is good. ESI &#x2013; as Medco has been, is a great partner and we're excited about it. I think the one thing I would add to that, where the issue may lie, is for some of the smaller to mid-size generic manufacturers, there may be &#x2013; that may cause more M&amp;A activity within that space.</p>
          <p>With respect to the question on the debt ceiling, I have to tell you, David, I'm not fully aware of all the provisions that are in it as of yet. I've been out of the States for about a week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, David, let's see, regarding the question on the back-end loaded year and Q4, I'd like to remind everyone that from day one, when we guided for 2011, we said that the first half will be slower than the second half and that we will see improvement from one quarter to another during the year, and that this is going to be a back-end loaded year. And as you know, especially on the generic business, many parts are always moving, and this is why we're coming to you guys now, in order to make sure there is full clarity on how our plan is going to develop throughout the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, it's Shlomo. I'd like to add to Eyal because I think this is something that we should make sure that we see eye to eye. We are committed to transparency, and we try to share with you, of course, without hurting our commercial future, as much as importantly as we can in any given time. But as you well know, our business, due to enormous number of moving parts, let me call it this way, sometimes the clarity is coming only when we get some more progress on the year. And therefore, we provide for the first time, I think, the kind of quarterly guidance, just to make sure that you are not making any mistakes or to help you to do your models. And whenever I'm going to get or to have more information, I'll do my best to share it with you as soon as I can, even not on a quarterly release date, but even in interim kind of updates. So, it's just the nature of the business, and especially 2011 which is a very, let's call it challenging and interesting year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then just one follow-up, but thank you for the color on that. The &#x2013; on Lipitor, is there any scenario that you see that gives you an opportunity to be among the first with Lipitor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, this is Bill Marth. What I can say about that is we have a settlement with Pfizer, the terms of which are not &#x2013; we're not allowed to disclose. So, and I really can't add much to that, other than the fact that I would say that we're not the only ones who had a settlement with Pfizer, and of course I wouldn't know what's in their settlements.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks, guys, and thanks, Eyal, for the specific guidance. Bill, a question for you, and not looking to go back too much retrospectively, but maybe it helps us going forward, is &#x2013; this hole in the U.S. line seems to have persisted a little longer than most of us expected, this lack of new product flow. And I know it happens from time to time, and you've given us due clarity in the back half of the year. But can you just speak generally about your level of enthusiasm as you look forward and whether there's any way you can prepare us, are there going to be more holes from time to time? Is there kind of &#x2013; a little bit more proactive to fill them as we look forward?</p>
          <p>It just seems like this has persisted. It's caught us off-guard for a while, and wanted to get your level of enthusiasm over the next couple of years on the U.S. line specifically, understanding from your all perspective, it's a diversified business, but just want to get your thoughts generally speaking on the U.S. line going forward. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Ken. Appreciate the question. A couple things. You have to really think about the enormity of this business, right? When you have, in a single quarter, the loss of HYZAAR, COZAAR, the loss of exclusivity, right? It costs you $161 million, just the change in Lotrel alone <mark type="ph" /> with incoming competitors, (49:29) $38 million, Protonix, $48 million, Eloxatin, $63 million, pramipexole, which is Mirapex, $64 million, and Yaz, which is Gianvi, $97 million. That's $471 million in a single quarter <mark type="ph" /> you have (49:42). Not only that, we got Venla, the delta in Venla from quarter to quarter was about $159 million from Q1 to Q2. So, those are just huge variations. Now, we've had launches for Triamcinolone, Clonidine patch, <mark type="ph" /> Infitibine (50:03), Diazepam Gels, some of those launches, but they were relatively small.</p>
          <p>So as we move forward, we know we've gotten good launches. We laid those out for you, Olanzapine and a whole bunch of other products that we think are very interesting moving forward. So, yeah. The launches get better as we move forward. And the one thing I would mention about '12, that I don't think people are thinking about, there are a lot of launches in '12. And we're excited about '12. But there's not a tremendous amount of exclusivity in '12. There's a lot of NCEs. So, you have to think about the competition that's going to be there. But yeah, and you couple that with Jerusalem, which as an issue, Irvine, which was an issue that we spoke to. And those are all improving. Jerusalem, we're over it. We feel great about it. Approvals are coming again.</p>
          <p>Irvine is coming back slowly. It's incremental, because you've got to bring some new products back. We believe another seven products will come back into commercial in the next couple of months. So, again, gradual improvement there. So, yeah, I'm excited about this business, but it is some gradual improvement. It is the largest generic business on earth. People can't forget that. And it's going to go up and down with exclusivity, but it is still one big business. We have a ton of files out there. There's a huge &#x2013; 185 files, 77 of them are first-to-files, and just the first-to-files alone are about $54 billion.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. A couple questions. First, can you give us your thoughts on Copaxone and how that went? Second of all, can you just dive into Europe with a little more detail, especially in France? And specifically, what is going on in France? And is it just pricing? And is volume still strong there? What are the volume gains for the market for what you're doing?</p>
          <p>Are you guys taking or losing share, specifically, there? And then, third, can you give us a sense of the Irvine impact and the Jerusalem impact year-over-year, just like you just did, Bill, with the major U.S. launches? So, how much sales this quarter versus what was there a year ago for Irvine and what you lost, kind of the delta? And also with Jerusalem. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marc, let me start out with the Copaxone. I think Shlomo would like to talk to Europe, and then we'll move from there. But with Copaxone, Shlomo said what I think the big story is, right? Everyone thought Copaxone would decline. Copaxone is the leader, 40.6%, a 7% volume increase, sales are up 29%. And the key, what we had said before is the market appears to be increasing, and that's a great thing. The share is strong at 40.6%, and it appears that the loss in share is with the interferons. And so, we think that bodes very well for Copaxone, for our life cycle initiative, for our basic Copaxone product, and potentially as well for our potential product <mark type="ph" /> with hormone (53:34).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the European one, I suggest Gerard, would you take it, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, with all sorts of pleasure. I think Europe, in the first half year and also in the quarter, did very well. But we saw a bit of a split picture. We saw a few markets that did excellent, and those were mentioned by Shlomo. We saw a few challenges from other markets, besides they already mentioned, France, which I'll give you a few comments on in a second. We saw Portugal slow down. We saw in some Central European markets, Hungary and Czech and Poland, we saw a slowdown of the business. So, that &#x2013; it was not everywhere in Europe a great business, but I think we did in all these places reasonably well. We did at least as good as the marketplace. But as said, the marketplace itself slowed down, which is something we saw in France, as well.</p>
          <p>If you look at France, I think the quarter itself was a soft quarter for us and for the market. We saw a slightly unexpected stronger slowdown of the market dynamics than we had expected about six to nine months ago. That's probably related to these mediated cases. A lot of turmoil about this product from <mark type="ph" /> Cervea (54:54) that serves to a lot of debate and conservatism in the French market. And we see an overall slowdown in the pharmaceutical market in France.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, we see that everybody is fighting like hell for any single part of the market share that they think can go up. And so the commercial conditions under which people are competing are extremely aggressive and sharp. If you look at our performance there is that we see a slight decline, quarter-on-quarter, although for the full year it's still slightly growing. But we do see that we keep our share. We keep our 16% market share as a company. We are a solid number three behind Mylan and <mark type="ph" /> Barr (55:37).</p>
          <p>And I'm not sure how quickly it will be resolved. I expect the second half of the year in France to be slightly better, but still with a lot of pressure. I think there's &#x2013; all companies competing there are under pressure, are fighting and it's very incidental with success there. We believe that we've got the right ingredients to take our share back, or to grow our share further, but I cannot predict exactly how quickly that will take off. Some of these, as I said, the dynamics in the markets need to just settle down a bit before we can see significant growth in France coming back again. So, for the second half of the year, we expect some good numbers from France, but no real strong growth coming from there.</p>

          <p>Marc, on your last question, let me just follow up with one other thing on Copaxone. I think the important event, too, we should mention, you know, the Copaxone litigation, right? The trial. And I see, you know, obviously we're very pleased &#x2013; pleased, and I think anyone &#x2013; clearly, anyone who was in the courtroom saw the difference between the teams. We were really excited with the case. And we think we're going to do extremely well. The <mark type="ph" /> Terazosin (56:54) decision makes the bar for IP very high. I think, really, the most important thing out of this particular IP trial was the ability to get the judge, Judge Jones, a very fine judge in the Southern District of New York up to speed on the case. I think this will put her in a position, moving into the September trial, with quite a bit of information and a good feeling about the fundamentals of the case.</p>
          <p>And your last point about, about what Jerusalem, particularly Jerusalem and Irvine, cost. Irvine, remember, we had to stop shipping in the second quarter of last year, so there's minimal impact on the Irvine number. Jerusalem number is in the $40 million range, but it's really difficult to hit the exact number, because it's also the but-for case. Meaning, yes, there were sales on batches I just absolutely could not ship. And I can, I can validate that and that's around the $40 million number. But the other part is the new products that I couldn't get launched, the products that I couldn't ship more share because I had to slow down the processes. That's a little bit harder to ascertain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ronny Gal of AllianceBernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. Two questions. And again, I guess we're all struggling a little bit with the trajectory from here until the end of the year just because it's so back-end loaded. So, if you don't mind, I'm going to ask two questions about that.</p>
          <p>First, I don't know if you mentioned the number, but can you give us Germany and Norway as a percentage of Europe? And two, Bill, we all tracked the script growth and the injectable revenue growth through IMS.</p>
          <p>Roughly, when should we see a turn in your year-over-year trajectory? Is it coming up right now or should we wait another quarter before it shows up?</p>
          <p>And third, with so many launches in the fourth quarter, I guess the question is, where is kind of like the mid-point in your mind of consensus sales on your business? That is, if you get all of those products launched, are you going to be at the high end of your guidance? And if you have a lot fewer, at the bottom end? Or do you kind of have to get all of them to hit the bottom end of the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start first &#x2013; you only ask about Germany, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Gerard, will you take that and then Bill will take the U.S. part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> I only want Copaxone (59:30) on Germany.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I can take them both. First of all, hi, Ronny.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question on Germany, I think it's &#x2013; if you look at the question of Teva in Europe, it's more interesting one.</p>
          <p>Our business set-up is roughly a reflection of the overall generics market in Europe. So as you know, probably around about 25% of the total value of the generics business across Europe is coming from Germany. Well, that's roughly the case with us, as well. And you can go around Europe, and we are basically sort of a mirror picture of the overall build-up of the generics markets across Europe.</p>
          <p>So that's a more general answer to this, which is different from some of our competitors, as you know. Which gives us a good, resilient way of responding to situations like I was just referring to in France. So that's the situation in &#x2013; therefore for Germany and the relative contribution.</p>
          <p>If you look at the Copaxone business in Europe, I think in volume we've been growing at 10%. Value was less, and value was just a few percentage points. That was all on the back of the impact of the price decrease that we faced in Germany, the mandatory price decrease. And that should go away if you look forward for the second half of the year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One more thing about the Copaxone out of U.S., because I think it deserves some highlight, before we go to your &#x2013; the second part of your question.</p>
          <p>I think that you should pay attention to the Copaxone business out of U.S., which is right now about a third of the business. This is where the potential for growth is still in front of us. And I strongly believe that we, especially when we do the take-back, we can do more with this product.</p>
          <p>And that's part of what I anticipated for the future of Copaxone. It's not only about gaining more market share points, it's about the whole dynamics that we are seeing in the MS therapies, including what Bill already mentioned &#x2013; that the pie is growing due to the newer therapies and the change in the trend among the current therapies. So just a kind of food for thought regarding the future of Copaxone out of the U.S.</p>
          <p>Bill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ronny. With respect to injectables, we pretty well guided on this before &#x2013; that Irvine would be up to about $100 million run rate by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And we feel pretty good about that. That's where we see it right now. And that's reflective of what we believe will be coming out of Irvine, not the ex-Irvine injectable manufacturing. That, of course, could be &#x2013; that could be quite a bit more, depending on what we launch in the injectable line. We would remind, of course, that we're shipping product now from <mark type="ph" /> Guangxi, Godola (1:02:36) and other sites from around the world.</p>
          <p>And your last question was? Is there another outstanding question, Ronny?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess the last question was simply about do you need to actually hit all of the products you're designing for the fourth quarter to get to the bottom of your guidance? Or essentially the guidance range reflects some sort of a logical assumption, if we get all the products in the fourth quarter, then we'll be the high end. If we miss a couple of them, we'll be the low end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't make any more comment about guidance, other than what I already made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Amsellem of Piper Jaffray.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. Just a couple. First, any update or comment on generic Lovenox? And then second, just some additional color on what's driving the improvement in Germany. Is it mainly higher volumes?</p>
          <p>And then just give us sort of your general thoughts on pricing trends in Germany going forward. Then I have a quick follow-up after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I'll start out. This is Bill Marth. Appreciate the question, but as we've said before, we are not going to comment on the enoxaparin until we launch the product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Gerard, can you take the Germany question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, David. Germany, we believe that, first of all, in the first half of Germany, in particular, the Q2, was slightly better than we expected. I think we were very pleased with the improvement of the business that came in a bit earlier than we also expected. As you may remember, I said that the second half of the year, we were expecting it to be much better. Well it came in a bit early, which is great.</p>
          <p>But we also know that there's a lot of competition out there, and &#x2013; but we're doing relatively well versus the competition. So part of our success is that we're just capturing more of the opportunity in Germany than some of our competitors.</p>
          <p>The second point is that in the second half of this year, we should be seeing the effects of the tenders we won, which we did very well <mark type="ph" /> taking (1:05:01) in. Formerly, the AOK Tender would have kicked in on the 1st of June, but because of some supply issues at some major suppliers of this tender, the AOK slowed that down to the 1st of August. So there might be an effect on the market share and <mark type="ph" /> flight in the (1:05:17) sales on the back of these tenders, that is going to also give us benefits for the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, what you will see in the German market is that in the second half of the year, the impact of some of the pricing measures that were taken last year should go away, and that should help us as well to grow our business again. Those are the main explanations for June.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just a quick additional question, if I may, just quickly on Adderall XR can you talk about the supply situation on the authorized generic, and if you feel that you're being adequately supplied, and where your sales are trending there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, this is Bill Marth. Actually, our supply was better this month. And you can see the share pick-up that occurred because of that. And it's really just &#x2013; it is literally a month-to-month thing with respect to our allocation. We keep working that as actively as we can. We had a decent quarter this quarter with respect to sales, and I don't, off the top of my head, have that sales number.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a few. First for Bill, is it still the case that you have not discussed settlement with Momenta or Sandoz on Copaxone? And how is the litigation going so far from your point of view on that product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Right now, the litigation I think couldn't be going much better. It couldn't be going much better. We're very pleased with it. So &#x2013; and there's been absolutely no discussion with Sandoz or Momenta with respect to settlement. And we don't see a reason at this point in time to engage in that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Shlomo, I had a question. You talked a little bit about the potential for more acquisitions, especially with the Express Scripts/Medco deal. What is your appetite for more deals, especially in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I stated many times before, acquisitions is about two major things besides other criteria that I already mentioned. One is whether they are strategically fit. And the second one, of course, is about the economics. To skip the third one, just to remind you, that we have to make sure that the deal is accretive in a year's time.</p>
          <p>So it's about the target or the specific opportunity. And that's &#x2013; like always, it takes <mark type="ph" /> two events these events (1:09:18). You have to make sure that it fit to the strategy, and what I can tell right now, that from &#x2013; that for the financial capabilities or financial strength, we are able to continue our acquisition path. But right now, we are digesting the Cephalon, and we are going to digest it in the coming year. And so it should be a very attractive target or opportunity.</p>
          <p>We have the resources, but we have first to make sure that we understand, and we see the opportunity. And definitely we have to take into consideration that right now, we are taking care of the acquisition that we did in Cephalon, in Taiyo and some other small acquisitions that are complementary acquisitions. That could of course be the pattern for the next year, as well.</p>

          <p>And then also, can you comment on the profitability of the different countries, in particular U.K., Germany and France?</p>
          <p>And then finally, on gross margin improvement from Ratiopharm, I know you said this is going to be a long-term sort of situation. How is that going? What are your sort of timelines there?</p>
          <p>And then finally, just you had a few questions right now on potential acquisitions in the U.S. Can I just confirm that your guidance for 2011 does not include an acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first start the last one. Our guidance is not including any future acquisition in North America. That's the question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll clarify, Shibani. The guidance for the rest of the year does not include the impact of Cephalon. It does include the fact &#x2013; the earning per share that we expect prior to be a little diluted, a couple of cents diluted for the second half of the year, and that is included in our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but no additional acquisitions factored in, within the &#x2013; correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; [06GB8K-E Shlomo Yanai]: No, Shibani, as I said &#x2013; Shlomo speaking. As I said, no future or potential acquisitions included in that guidance. If that would happen, definitely we would have to give you a new guidance, and we'd have to talk about that.</p>
          <p>And Gerard, would you take the European question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. First of all, thanks to Shibani for the questions.</p>
          <p>The organic growth without Nexium or Esomeprazole, as we call it, Atorvastatin/Lipitor, we do not take that into account like that. We do not analyze the market like that. Because every other year we've got a whole range of launches. And launching products in the generics environment is part of our lives, and it's part of the underlying growth of any given marketplace. So we have these molecules this year, you had other molecules last year, and we'll have other molecules next year.</p>
          <p>And you should note that the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:18) opportunity this year in terms of launch opportunities for Europe is much better than it was last year, and we expect to benefit from it in the second half of the year, as well as next year, as some good products will lose their exclusivity and therefore they will drive the growth. Though I cannot specifically answer you the question on organic growth, excluding specific products.</p>
          <p>In terms of the profitability, in general, one can say that the fact that we're number one in the U.K. makes us, let's say, more efficient, and therefore, using our scale much better. And therefore I think we are, we're doing very well in the U.K. It's a very price-competitive marketplace, but if you have a 30% market share, like we have, then you can make a good return on the buck, and I think that's exactly what we're doing there.</p>
          <p>We do not specify specific profitability numbers by country as you know, so I do not plan to change that policy now.</p>
          <p>Same is true for Germany. I think Germany &#x2013; our size is very good. It's &#x2013; the second quarter for us in Germany that we have a very diversified portfolio of product. We're not only in retail generics, we have specialty generics. We've got OTC. We've got private business in hospitals and in the retail. We've got a whole diverse portfolio, which makes our profitability there very attractive. And Bill referred to earlier on when he said the outside, versus the U.S. business, Germany's one of those markets that is doing very well profit-wise.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the margin, on the Ratiopharm, switching products always takes more time, as you know. And when did the announcement on the Ratiopharm closing, which was on the 10th of August last year, we said it would take us between two and three years to start reaping the benefits.</p>
          <p>We're now merely one year down the line, and we get the quick benefits out of that. Some of it is in API purchasing, some is in pooling or buying of some other products. But the real product process always takes a bit more time. We're working very hard, and we're on track to deliver the benefit and savings of the full process of that. As a matter of fact, overall, the savings in the Ratiopharm will &#x2013; as we predicted, are slightly ahead of schedule, as we revealed to you a year ago.</p>

          <p>On the &#x2013; I think the overall markets as IMS is reporting it for Lipitor in the U.K. is north of &#xA3;200 million. We do not give any more specifics on the launch as we've given so far, and we'd like to stick to that for good reasons, as you can imagine.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On Laquinimod, the rollout of the results from Bravo trial &#x2013; will it follow a very similar communication trajectory or path to the previous results that were released? Will they be top line and then full results presented at <mark type="indiscernible" />(1:16:54)? But can you just walk us through how you plan on communicating the Bravo results? And then I have one last follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said before, we are expecting the results very shortly. And only then decide what is the right way. For sure we are going to publish the results &#x2013; <mark type="indiscernible" />(1:17:19)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just on the Proctor &amp; Gamble joint venture. Any additional incremental commentary on P&amp;G and how the formation of that joint venture is progressing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:36). John, can you repeat the question a little louder, because you're breaking up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Providing any commentary on the Proctor &amp; Gamble joint venture, the formation of that, how that's progressing, and how you see that rolling out moving forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hear you very bad, so I'll try to answer based on what I heard here.</p>
          <p>We are moving fast in concluding the agreement with P&amp;G. It's expected somewhere toward the end of the Q. Maybe at the very beginning of the next Q. The more we dive into that idea, or if you wish, to this venture, we are more excited.</p>
          <p>It's <mark type="ph" /> worthwhile maybe at (1:18:25) one of our next investors meetings to better &#x2013; or explain in more details why OTC, or high end OTC, is going to be one of the growing segments of the business. I, generally speaking, see that another leg for Teva businesses in the future, beside the generics and the specialty pharma that we all know about.</p>
          <p>And I think that, together with P&amp;G, we not only having the geographical advantage because we can turn now in their &#x2013; in countries where they are strong, but we also have more channels, because we can use their channels to the market, whether it's retail or others. And definitely their outstanding world know-how in branding would help Teva very much in leveraging our portfolio and our capabilities in different part of the world.</p>
          <p>And I'd like to believe that that answers your question. If there's any more, please ask.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Buck of Buckingham Research Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Jim Dawson for David Buck. I just had a question on the second half improvement you discussed in U.S. generics. And what is driving that, besides the additional launches? Is there anything else that we should know about there? And also, are you starting to see a pricing turn in the U.S.? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David. This is Bill Marth. Really, I think we talked about the various launches, at least a dozen opportunities, great improvement there. Again, a sequential improvement in our total supply chain. Improvement in all businesses, not just generics, really what contributes to this.</p>
          <p>And with respect to pricing, well, pricing hasn't really changed much in the U.S. for quite a while. And so I haven't seen any changes in the trends there, whatsoever. So really things are relatively stable. I don't think I can add a whole lot more color than I have already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then just on the gross margin and if it's going to improve. Could you just get into that a little more specifically in the third versus the fourth quarter? And also the drivers behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, there. It's Eyal. Yeah, we anticipate a very, I would say, improved product mix in the second half, Q3, as well as Q4, with more launches in the U.S. generic markets, with some continuous improvements in Europe, some better sales on our branded products. We mentioned respiratory <mark type="ph" /> subliminals (1:21:30) are part of that.</p>
          <p>All that should get the gross margin at a higher level than what we've seen in Q3. That should work in both quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And Q4 will be better than Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it might be, but the differences are not going to be that high, probably mostly on the top line side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. One last thing is just on the status of the Jerusalem facility and the FDA's warning letter, when will you be back to a normal approval timing there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Bill Marth. We're essentially at normal activity now. Again, we have not received the official letter, although we are getting approvals. And although our conversations with the FDA have been very positive and there are no longer any issues, we just haven't gotten the letter in hand. You know, again, there were some additional quality initiatives put in place, but those are all in place, and we are running smoothly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can just say that the Jerusalem file, from my point of view, is closed. Of course, we are awaiting, as Bill said, for the official letter from the FDA, which I believe will come very soon. We cannot speak for the FDA, but that was my understanding from the discussion with the FDA. And Jerusalem is pushing ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. At this time I'd like to hand the floor back over to Mr. Shlomo Yanai for any closing comments.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you have heard, we are looking forward to increasing growth across all our geographies and businesses in the second half of the year. I would like to believe that we also captured the enthusiasm that we have regarding the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>And again, thank you all very much for being with us today. And have a good day.</p>
