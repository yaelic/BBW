        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $18.1 billion, up 4.6% from last year. Comp sales were positive 4.2% and our diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the closure of our stores in China were $0.74. Our stores in the United States had a positive comp of 4.3%. We faced a difficult year-over-year comparison in the quarter, particularly in our Northern division because of the overlap from Hurricane Irene last year. Despite this, all three of our U.S. divisions had positive comps. The Southern division was our strongest division for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Of note, all of our major markets in Florida showed quarter-over-quarter comp improvement and in the Western division our major markets in California had growth rates above the company average. Both of these are signs we believe of a continuing healing in the housing market. In all, 33 of our top 40 markets had positive comps and our markets with negative comps were primarily in the Northeast.</p>
          <p>On the International front, our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps for the 36th quarter in a row, for nine years of quarter-over-quarter positive comps. In Canada we had positive comps for the fourth consecutive quarter as Bill Lennie and his team continued to improve our business there. And during the quarter we announced the closure of our big box stores in China; after several years of effort we concluded that we could not make our big box retail model profitable there.</p>
          <p>As you will hear from Craig, in the U.S. we continued to see strength in the core of our store and the company had solid growth in both transactions and ticket in the quarter, making this our sixth consecutive quarter with transaction and ticket growth.</p>
          <p>We also continued to see recovery in our Pro business. Our Pro sales grew during the quarter though at slower rate than our Consumer business due in part to comparisons to the strong sales in roofing from last year. On a regional basis it's encouraging to see our Pro sales growth matching Consumer growth in key areas like Northern California and Phoenix.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we also rolled out several enhancements to our Pro website including a bulk pricing program online that mirrors our in-store bulk pricing program. And Marvin and his team continue to focus on improving the in-store experience for our Pros. We look at customer satisfaction surveys for both our Pro and Consumer segments and our net promoter score for Pros is now consistently over 70% as is our Consumer score.</p>
          <p>Our Installed Services business had another quarter of positive growth with strength across the country and in all key programs. This is another critical area where we have implemented improvements to our website, in this case with a functionality called MyInstall, that is specifically designed to improve the transparency and communication in install projects and simplify the customer experience. We will be adding capabilities to MyInstall throughout 2013.</p>
          <p>In the quarter we completed the purchase of U.S. Home Systems, a kitchen and bath re-facing business. This company's business was already effectively 100% Home Depot based but the acquisition will allow us to create more effective interconnection between our stores and the U.S. Home Systems in-home selling platform, just as we've done with our Roofing, Siding and Windows businesses.</p>
          <p>We continue to work on improving our supply chain and in the quarter we completed the mechanization of all of our rapid deployment centers, which will further improve the cost-effectiveness of this platform. Disasters such as Hurricane Sandy create enormous demands on the supply chain and our team responded. To date we have shipped approximately 4,000 truckloads of product to assist the communities impacted by the storm.</p>
          <p>As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are updating our earnings per share and sales guidance for the year based on our outperformance in the third quarter. We anticipate that over several quarters' time, Hurricane Sandy will have an impact to our sales comparable to that of Hurricane Irene, but the exact timing of that is uncertain.</p>
          <p>As a more general comment on our market, we believe the U.S. is still working through the issues associated with the housing crisis. Credit availability remains a major issue, but we can start to see the housing market as an assist to our growth rather than an anchor. That is consistent with the national numbers, which now show housing as a positive contributor to GDP. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP has improved for the fourth consecutive quarter to 2.5%, though it is still well below previous historical lows, not to mention its 60-year average.</p>
          <p>Based on this quarter's results, 95% of our stores will qualify for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. This is a reflection of the hard work and dedication of our associates, and I'd like to give a special thanks to all of our associates who have worked to help the communities impacted by Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Isaac. They have worked tirelessly under difficult circumstances, often in the face of disruption in their own lives caused by the storms. Helping in a time of need is a core part of the Home Depot culture and we are very proud of their efforts.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our performance in the third quarter as sales exceeded our expectations. The departments that outperformed the company average comp were lumber, decor, kitchen, paint, lighting, bath, electrical, outdoor garden, indoor garden, hardware and flooring. Plumbing, tools and millwork performed positively while comp sales in building materials were negative due to a tough year-over-year comparison in roofing.</p>
          <p>In the last week of the third quarter we experienced around $70 million lift in sales including batteries, flashlights, generators and extension cords, as customers in the North prepared for the threat of Hurricane Sandy. Looking ahead, it's difficult for us to forecast the magnitude of ongoing cleanup sales in the affected areas.</p>
          <p>In the beginning of the third quarter I told you that we'd be setting our holiday assortment in half the time previously required by leveraging our supply chain and merchandising execution teams and we did just that. The objective was to extend our fall cleanup selling season and allow time for an additional fall event which exceeded internal expectations.</p>
          <p>These efforts along with great fall weather drove double-digit positive comps in walk behind mowers, riding mowers, pressure washers, exterior stain and chemicals.</p>
          <p>Portable outdoor power, exterior paint, lawn accessories, soils and mulches, fertilizers, grills and planters all performed above the company average comp. Patio furniture and live goods had a positive performance in the quarter as well.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter we began setting some of our appliance showrooms to include Electrolux, Whirlpool and Frigidaire brands. We will complete the rollout of our 120-store pilot during the fourth quarter. These appliances are available online through HomeDepot.com and can be ordered in all of our stores and we are pleased with the results we have seen so far.</p>
          <p>For the balance of the business we continue to see momentum in maintenance and repair and simple decor. On the maintenance and repair side, departments such as hardware and electrical as well as categories such as cleaning and plumbing repair continue to perform positively. Bath, lighting, flooring and interior paint performed well within simple decor. As part of our interconnected retail strategy we are inspiring and educating our customers through our Style Guide, available on the web and for the iPad. The Style Guide is rated 4.5 stars out of five and is consistently a top 100 app in the app store. And this week we'll launch the holiday version of the Style Guide.</p>
          <p>Total transactions grew by 1.7%, while average ticket increased 2.9% for the quarter. Our average ticket increase was impacted somewhat by commodity price inflation from lumber. The total impact to the ticket growth from commodity inflation in lumber was approximately 70 basis points.</p>
          <p>Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were flat for the third quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 4.3% in the third quarter. The drivers behind the increase in the big-ticket purchases were strength in appliances, flooring and in-stock kitchens.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Innovation remains a key part of our leadership strategy, and one of the products we're excited about is our second generation Ryobi lithium batteries with fade-free power. Our lithium-plus batteries offer better performance for existing tools, fuel gauges and extreme weather performance.</p>
          <p>We bring to market the looks customers want with the features they need. In the fourth quarter we will be exclusively launching a new wood-plank-look porcelain tile from Marazzi. This new product will give customers the ease, the maintenance and durability of a porcelain tile with the wood finish they desire.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we introduced the Moen Haysfield motion-sensing faucet, exclusive to The Home Depot. This faucet delivers consistent hands-free activation even when the handle is in the off position with two sensors that provide flexibility and convenience in many kitchen tasks. We're also the exclusive home-improvement launch partner for Kidde's Worry-Free smoke alarms. These alarms utilize lithium technology, eliminating battery changes for 10 years, saving our customers, on average, $40 in battery replacement while enhancing safety.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have an outstanding offering of products in our gift centers for the holiday season and our best lineup yet in holiday decor. The offerings in our gift centers will feature an extensive assortment of hardware and holiday items for gift giving and decorating. For Black Friday we have outstanding special buys with extreme values for our traditional DIY-ers and professional customers.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I want to remind you that in the third quarter we closed seven big box stores in China, and as a result of the store closings recorded an after-tax charge of $165 million or $0.11 per diluted share. The charge included the impairment of goodwill and other assets, lease terminations, severance and other charges associated with the store closings. In our press release, we provided a supplementary schedule that sets forth the impact of these charges. And for the purpose of today's call, I'm going to talk about our financial performance on an adjusted basis, adjusting out the financial impact of the China store closings.</p>
          <p>So with that, sales for the third quarter were $18.1 billion, a 4.6% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 4.2% for the quarter with positive comps of 2.6% in August, 5.1% in September and 4.8% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 4.3% for the quarter with positive comps of 3% in August, 5.2% in September and 4.6% in October.</p>
          <p>On an adjusted basis, our total company gross margin was 34.6% for the quarter, an increase of 22 basis points from last year. Our U.S. business drove 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter while our international business, principally Canada, contributed nine basis points of gross margin expansion.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. our gross margin expansion is explained by the following factors. First, our shrink reduction efforts are gaining traction and we realized 10 basis points of margin expansion due to lower shrink. Second, we experienced seven basis points of margin expansion due to lower costs in our supply chain. And third, we experienced four basis points of gross margin contraction due to a change in the price and mix of products sold. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 93 basis points to 24.2%. Our expense leverage reflects our strong sales performance and some favorable year-over-year comparisons.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year, we had $21 million of natural disaster expense that didn't repeat this year. Additionally, our credit card expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $37 million lower than last year due primarily to benefits arising from our private-label credit card program. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $150 million, a slight decrease from last year.</p>
          <p>On an adjusted basis our income tax provision rate was 36.4% in the third quarter. Let me note that on a reported basis our tax rate was 40.2% in the third quarter because we didn't realize any tax benefit from the charges associated with the China store closings. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.74, an increase of 23.3% from last year. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.63, reflecting the $0.11 per diluted share impact of the charges associated with our China store closings.</p>
          <p>A few other items of note. During the third quarter we opened two new stores in Mexico and closed seven stores in China for an ending store count of 2,250. At the end of the third quarter selling square footage was 235 million and total sales per square foot were $307, up 4.6% from last year.</p>
          <p>At the end of the quarter inventory was roughly $11 billion, up $243 million from a year ago, and inventory turns were 4.6 times, up from 4.3 times last year. We ended the quarter with $41.7 billion in assets including $2.6 billion in cash.</p>
          <p>Moving to our share repurchase program, in the third quarter we received 5.6 million shares related to the true-up of an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR program, we initiated in the second quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter we repurchased $700 million or 10.2 million of our outstanding shares. This included 900,000 shares repurchased in the open market and 9.3 million shares repurchased through an ASR program. For the shares repurchased under the ASR program, this is an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon completion of the ASR program in the fourth quarter. Further, we plan to repurchase $700 million of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter, bringing our total share repurchases to $4 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters return on invested capital was 16.1%, 200 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>As we head into the fourth quarter we are faced with unknowns surrounding the magnitude of the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy that is home improvement related and the speed with which impacted areas will recover. In addition, we are heading into the winter months where weather could hamper the rebuilding efforts. Our hearts go out to those who were impacted by this horrific storm and we will do our best to be there when our customers need us. But forecasting the impact of damage related sales prospectively would simply be a guess.</p>
          <p>So our guidance for the year is going to reflect our performance for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 coupled with our plan for the fourth quarter. And given our third quarter performance, we are lifting our guidance. We now expect fiscal 2012 sales will increase by approximately 5.2% on a 53-week basis. From an earnings per share perspective remember that we guide off of GAAP so our guidance includes the $0.11 per diluted share impact related to the China store closings in the third quarter. We're projecting fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 18% to $2.92 on a 53-week basis.</p>
          <p>So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Vicky, we are now ready for questions.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. First question is just on Sandy and I understand the difficulty in projecting anything at this point given the amount of damage and the speed with which recovery is done. But Craig, it sounded like firstly you said that you thought the overall benefit, or overall impact, would be similar to Irene. I guess I'm wondering why it wouldn't be larger given a larger magnitude of damage? And Carol, did you just imply that your guidance for Q4 does not include any impact from Sandy? And how do you reconcile those two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well let's just start with the impact from Irene. Last year we had $230 million of sales from Irene in the third quarter, $130 million of sales from Irene in the fourth quarter, for a total of $360 million of sales. And of course, it's a rough estimate but this is our best guess of the sales coming up from the hurricane. So we would envision going forward we would have at least $360 million coming off of Sandy. The property damage, as we understand it, related to Irene was about $16 billion; the property damage for Sandy is about $20 billion, so it would suggest possibly higher sales, but it's impossible for us to know right now.</p>
          <p>As we look at our guidance for the fourth quarter, you are correct. We are including no benefit from Sandy in our guidance because again, determining what it will be prospectively is very difficult. I will say, however, that our sales for November are quite good but interestingly enough, the strength is coming out of the West and the South, and not so much out of the North, because as you all know, our customers are still very much in turmoil. You may have personally experienced some of this yourself. So this is going to be a different type of recovery than what we've seen in the past. Would you agree, Craig?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it is. I think the other comment I'd make, Colin, is this is a different storm than Irene. This was much more impacted in terms of water flow; Irene was stronger wind impact. So there's a little different needs that exist in this storm versus Irene.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Then my follow up is on expenses. If I look at the expense of last year and back out the Irene impact of $21 million, and then I back out the $37 million of credit benefit this year, it looks like trying to normalize that, SG&amp;A or operating expenses were up about 2.2% year-over-year. Is that kind a normal growth rate you're thinking about now as you work through some of the benefits? And while we're on expenses, depreciation was up year-on-year for the first time since 3Q 2008, is that now &#x2013; have we reached the bottom in declining depreciation with more system spending going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the last part of that question first. Yes. Because the investment in IT, and we write our IT investments off over a shorter timeframe, typically no longer than six years, we anticipate that you will start to see year-over-year increases in depreciation. And that's an okay thing, because the IT investments that we're making are giving us a positive ROI. From a normalized SG&amp;A perspective, as we told you back in June, we would expect long-term that our expenses would grow around 38%, 40% of our sales growth. This year it's going to be a little bit different than that. On a 52-week basis if you back out the impact of China, our expense growth will be basically flat, but on a normalized basis going forward we would expect more in the 38%, 40% area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next we'll hear from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hey, guys. Thanks. Just diving into the categories a little bit more, Craig, maybe can you talk to us about the trends you're seeing in the Window business? How has that been going the last few quarters? And what's your outlook there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we actually had positive comps overall in our Millwork business, and our Window business has come back from previous years, which were hit pretty hard during the downturn, so we've actually seen positive growth. Hopefully that answers your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep. That's helpful. And then maybe just between your larger Pros and your smaller Pros, I know you guys have spoken in recent calls about larger Pro doing better. Any indication that the smaller Pro is starting to see some of that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The larger Pro is still doing better, Peter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. My question was regarding your comments about credit expense being lower year-over-year. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on that? And secondly, on the inflation front, what you're expecting with building material inflation in the coming quarter, in the fourth quarter I should say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. As it relates to our credit expense, as I think you will recall, we capped our cost of credit at 1.3%. But we do share in the profitability of the portfolio, and the portfolio this year is more profitable than it has been, for a couple of reasons: one, higher sales, that's a good thing; but also the net losses in the portfolio are down. In fact, we're projecting that the loss rate will be below 6% by year-end. Contrast that to 2010 where the loss rate was 14%. So as the portfolio becomes more profitable, we share in that profitability. On the inflation side?</p>

          <p>Yeah, as it relates to inflation obviously lumber prices are remaining, at this stage of the game, higher than previous year. We've seen some drop in copper as it relates to year-over-year in the past few weeks. So our anticipation at this point is that we probably see similar type of movement in lumber. Don't see anything really taking that down short term.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Coming back to the topic of Hurricane Sandy, can you just give us the number of stores that you think will be impacted by this event versus Hurricane Irene, to give us some indication of the order of magnitude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Michael, I would say there'll be fewer stores that the breadth of Irene &#x2013; it impacted more stores than any storm in our history certainly when we've looked at that. So it declined some with Sandy but as Carol and Craig were discussing, the nature of the damage also was more severe. So there'll be fewer stores impacted but the impacts might be more significant with those localities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And will it be a significant amount? Will the delta between the number of stores be significant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it depends what you'd say is significant, but if you say a third fewer stores, just ballpark, but take that only directionally, yeah. So a significantly fewer number of stores. It's less, but again the magnitude of the damage faced in those areas is higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just say we are going to have some fun planning the store sales trying to determine which stores get the impact from the hurricanes but we'll do our best in that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful. And then a question on the strength you're seeing in the southern markets and the western markets. Is the consumer behaving any differently with respect to the selection of good, better and best products? So as the cycle manifests, might you have to assort a little differently to meet customers' changing tastes? And could that impact your margin? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Michael, we're really not seeing that much geographically that's different. So it's not as though the California consumer's coming back but is more on the opening price point or mid-price point. We're not really seeing that much of a difference regionally.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. This is actually <mark type="ph" /> T.J. Macumba (29:08) filling in for Budd. Congratulations on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. Frank, in your commentary and in the release, comments related to housing, I mean I think you noted we're still in the work through phase but it certainly sounds like you're incrementally a little bit more positive. Can you talk about maybe what you're seeing in the progression of the recovery and how that affects some of your long-term targets maybe, that you talked about at the Analyst Day in June?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, I'd say the comments are very much in line with what we said in June, that we see housing having to go through a work-out period and we'd say we're in that work-out period now. That's a positive though, because we're working through issues and now housing is a little bit of an assist rather than a negative. It was interesting just &#x2013; when we look at the number of times you use the word consecutive as we've gone through just this earnings call, we've had a number of quarters of consecutive performance that starts to give you some confidence that the market is healing. There's still lots of issues out there, there's a lot of credit issues in particular that we're concerned about and obviously broader policy issues, but if you look at our performance this year and take a two year quarter-over-quarter, our business continues to progress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might add a little more color perhaps, on the housing, Frank, if that would be helpful? We've got a high level and I'll call it imperfect model, but we have looked at drivers of housing that could impact our business, focusing principally on turnover. And if you look at how housing turnover is performing this year, on an annualized basis about 4.5 million units. We know from a study back in 2008 that the average spend is about $3,500. If you then calculate our market share against that and look at what our anticipated comps would be versus GDP growth we would estimate that housing turnover is impacting our comps by about 50 basis points this year. So as Frank pointed, out we're on the path of recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful, Frank and Carol. Appreciate that. And then moving along to some of those policy issues that you may have noted there, Frank, can you talk about maybe what some of the outlook is or what the planning is from a resource allocation and capital allocation perspective on what the potential impact of, let's say what a fiscal cliff might look like specifically, maybe your dividend versus repurchase decisions or something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no. I think we'll wait until we let the policymakers resolve those issues before giving you hypothetical responses to them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions. Best of luck on the rest of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Along those lines, what, Carol, is your estimate for the impact of the changes in healthcare regulation in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Laura, we're still working through this, it's highly complicated for all of corporate America, but with a company like The Home Depot, with over 300,000 associates, we've got to study this very carefully and we're waiting for the rules to get formalized. So once we know we will tell you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the appliance store pilot, how are you judging success from a quantitative basis? And if you are successful in whatever the metrics are you're looking to achieve, how large could that rollout be across your chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as we do with every pilot and every reset in our stores, we obviously go through a financial assessment of what we're looking to achieve and we lay out targets for that. It's very early at this stage in the pilot. We haven't completed our 120 store rollout yet. We still have that to finish in the fourth quarter. And we do like the early results that we see. Based on how the rollout continues and how the sales perform, we would then determine what the next steps might be and how many stores that would actually roll to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you looking for incremental sales per square foot? Or what are the metrics that you're looking to see improve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, that would be one of the metrics that we look at is exactly that, how do we actually continue to drive incremental sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The really interesting thing about our approach here is that it's not just a store story; it's also a dot com story, so we really like the penetration that the new brands are selling on our website. Craig, you might want to talk about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, all of our brands are obviously available on HomeDepot.com for our customers to shop around the clock when they choose to shop, and likewise, we leverage HomeDepot.com and our delivery system to make those brands available in all stores today.</p>

          <p>Next we'll hear from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Wondering if you could talk a little bit, you highlighted the big-ticket progress in the quarter, wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're doing promotionally within big-ticket and across the business? And then also if you could link that a little bit to how you think the gross margin progression works from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll address the big-ticket aspects. When you look at our growth in big-ticket it's a culmination of a lot of things; hard work by our associates in the stores, we've worked hard on the assortments over the past few years, kitchens, for example, continue to be a positive growth story as they have been for the past couple of years now. We feel like we're taking share in those areas. We've improved our flooring business overall. As a matter of fact, Eric, what I would say is that if you looked at our Decor businesses in total they actually outgrew the company average so I think customers are beginning to be willing to step in and do the decor projects like flooring, like kitchens. We've had a nice quarter in appliances as well. So I think that it's a combination of a number of things including assortment, our effort by our associates in our stores, to drive this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the gross margin front, we would expect the fourth quarter gross margin to be flattish relative to last year principally because of what we're anniversary-ing. You'll recall the fourth quarter of 2001 [sic] 2011 (36:24) we had 53 basis points of margin expansion coming off of our supply chain. We're not expecting that in the fourth quarter this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if I could just follow up, Craig, in terms of the promotions, in Decor you talked about gaining share, would you say that year-over-year promotions across those categories are similar to a year ago, more promotional, less promotional? How would you characterize that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty comparable to where we were a year ago.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First a comment, it doesn't count as a question. Could you get more generators in your stores in Vauxhall, New Jersey?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're working hard on more generators.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you -- Frank, you sounded more positive overall on signals of a housing recovery and you walked us through the numbers and we heard consumer spending is just as strong as the commercial spending. What are the signals? Could you go a little deeper into what you're seeing that builds that confidence up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Part of it is, Gary, if you think back to 2011 where we had some strong quarters &#x2013; second, third, fourth quarters very strong &#x2013; each one those quarters had its unique weather story, so it was difficult to pull the strands out of what's more weather-related, what's the housing recovery look like. It felt like that was the start of housing starting to heal, but a little cautious about it. We've had, this third quarter is an interesting quarter because it was a very tough compare for us, given the sales related to Irene, as Carol detailed. So the positive comp in this quarter, which again, not really Sandy related, Craig called out $70 million at the very end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>So the positive results in the quarter combined with, as I said, every quarter this year on a two-year stacked basis doing better, and again going to Craig's comments, strength in the core of the business, you go, we're starting to see, I mean this isn't, we're not lighting rockets over this and we don't want to get out over our skis, but we're starting to see the recovery of the housing market. And then there are lots of data points that we look at this on obviously. Geographically, the harder hit areas that were really the epicenter of the housing crisis appear to be on the mend, and it's been consecutive, it's been consistent. So that's why we think it's healing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Just curious, given where we are in the housing cycle and what appears to be a market still concentrated, if I'm listening to you right, Frank, in the basic repair and remodel portions of the home improvement markets. Are you surprised at all that transactions under $50 aren't a bit stronger than flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Craig, you want to address the --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I'll talk to that a little bit. So when we look at transactions under $50, there's an awful lot of those transactions that fall into a few categories. I'm very pleased with how we did in outside garden as you can imagine. That's a big transaction driver in that business. But then when you look at what has happened in some of the categories, the average unit retail growth, so for example, LED versus incandescent bulbs has had an impact on that business. When you look at the expansion of what happened in the retail side of the business in paint, you see transactions that maybe have fallen from what were under $20 to now over $20.</p>
          <p>And then there's some actions that we've taken as well in terms of how we're driving some off-shelf special buys, packs, value packs, that have led to part of that shift in transactions under $20.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Understood. And then you had also &#x2013; Craig mentioned something about fourth quarter aggressive holiday deals, et cetera. Is that something you saw in the third quarter or is that just an expectation that pricing will become more aggressive in the fourth quarter? Or is that just the normal holiday aggression in promotions? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As it relates to the fourth quarter we're excited about the plans we've put in place to aggressively go after the market. We have &#x2013; our merchants have worked hard to really create some outstanding values for our customers. We've got awesome values in our gift center, we've got a great holiday decor lineup, we do have outstanding values that we'll bring to the market around Black Friday, which is obviously a very aggressive time in retail. So we're excited about the offerings that we have forthcoming in the fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And don't forget, in the month of December last year we had a positive comp in the United States of 7.1% so we better have a good holiday to top that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. So first I wanted to follow up on the healthcare question, understanding that it's very complicated and you're not sure what's going to happen, but maybe just to help, you could remind us how your healthcare works now, who is covered in terms of your part-time and full-time employees? And you stopped telling us your percent of part-time employees in your 10-K, but has that changed very much since the last time you reported that, which I think was 55% or 59% in the 2010 10-K?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first off on what we provide, and now this is speaking U.S. obviously, we provide health insurance to our full-time associates. To our part-time associates there is a company, in effect we make available to them what might be called a mini-med program. In terms of the ratio of full-time and part-time, I'm not sure, when was the last &#x2013; I don't think there's been a major difference --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's not a major difference. No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the last time we disclosed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, but your in-store employees, full-time employees who aren't necessarily store managers, they are currently &#x2013; what percent of those are currently covered?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so we make it available to all of our associates and, Mike, one of the questions for us, and we're not going to get into our specific percentages on this, but one of the questions is, for us, in thinking about this program and understanding it and understanding the cost implications is for those associates who do not now take advantage of the healthcare that we provide, why don't they take advantage of it? Are they covered by their spouse? Are they not taking the healthcare because for whatever reason they don't choose to spend their money in that direction? And then as you shift into the healthcare legislation, what will the impact of the healthcare legislation be on those associates?</p>
          <p>All of those, in addition to the regulatory issues that Carol referenced that still need to be resolved, there is sort of a base understanding that we need to develop on what behavioral changes this will create within our full-time associate ranks, and that has a significant impact on how we estimate the cost. So as Carol said, as soon as we feel comfortable and confident of what the impacts will be, we'll be sharing that with everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. One more real quick one, the full-year guidance, that excludes the $0.11 impact from China. Does it include the $0.03 benefit, roughly, that you had in the first quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, and good morning. My first question, you've addressed sort of the magnitude of the impact you expect from Sandy on the top line. Can you talk about its impact up and down the P&amp;L? For example, you spoke about some storm-related expenses from last year that you cycled that were not repeated in Q3. Might we see those in Q4? How do you think about storm-related sales perhaps impacting the gross margin rate as they drive sales over the next several quarters as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course. Because Sandy was so coastal in its nature and we don't have stores built along the coasts, we were very fortunate and we had little to no damage in our stores. So we do not expect any storm-related expense in the fourth quarter. We do have a Homer fund, which is a 501(c)(3) that we've established that will take care of our associates in need but that won't impact our P&amp;L. From a margin perspective it's really going to depend on the products that are sold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, short term we're still selling things that have lower gross margins. We're still selling generators, that type of product, lumber, to get basic repair done right now, and it really depends on how those sales progress from here as to what the ultimate mix of sale will be which will determine where the margin falls.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again, rather than trying to guide to that prospectively, we'd rather explain to you what we experience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then the second question I have relates to buybacks. So you've had one of the most successful and effective capital allocation programs in retail, virtually every share you've ever bought back, given the stock today, is in the money. So that's worked out extremely well. You shared with us in the past your intrinsic value calculation that you use to think about the buyback. What is your thought process on the buyback and you said $700 million for the fourth quarter? In the short run and the long run with the stock having done so very nicely and the approach you would expect to see, any change in that from where we've been in the past year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first, Matt, thank you for your acknowledgement of our program. We have bought back about $37 billion worth of our shares at an average price of about $37. So the program has worked and we do have a point of view on the value of our stock and we're not there. We also look at it, what's the point where we should retire debt versus buybacks shares. So we've got a mathematical calculation that supports our activity and we feel very committed to our share repurchase program where we are based on that point of view and the fact that sitting on cash on the balance sheet is not very value creating for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And just to that point, you'll note that at the end of the quarter we have $2.6 billion of cash, so you may say aren't you a little heavy? About $1 billion of that cash is outside the United States. We could get our hands on it. We could repatriate it but then we'd pay a nice tax on that so we elect not to. So when I think about the cash that we have available for use it's about $1.6 billion and we need about $1 billion-ish to operate, so that's was giving support to the $700 million that we will buy in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And one last comment on the share repurchase. As you know, we introduced new financial targets back in June, our 12/24 target &#x2013; that's 12% operating margin and a 24% return on invested capital by 2015 -- inherent in that 24% return on invested capital is that we will use excess cash to buy back shares.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Just a couple quick ones. Carol, just to make sure the numbers you put out there for Irene and Sandy &#x2013; net-net for the quarter storm demand would be a net negative, correct? Year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then as you think about the housing recovery and some of things you've talked about from the bottom up, can you maybe put a little bit more color behind either at a market level or a state level which would be at the top of that list, either the 33 markets or across the states, where you're seeing the strongest year-over-year growth today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you just look at the third quarter, Dennis, we saw strength, as I referenced, in Florida. We saw strength in California that was above the company average, which as I said was to us a sign of a healing in the market. And elsewhere we were more &#x2013; as Carol has commented before on these calls, the range of difference among our top 40 markets has actually compressed over time. We were past the period where we'd have major markets that were significantly double-digit comping in comparison &#x2013; double digit negative comping in comparison to other markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you look at Florida and California as an example would the growth rates for those states put them in the top five across your network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I was looking at it from the market perspective, and if you looked at the top performing, markets in Florida would be at the top for the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In California the growth rates are between 50 and 180 basis points better than the company average, just to give you a point of perspective.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Next we'll hear from David Gober with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to dig back a little bit into what we're seeing in terms of the recovery. And Frank, I know you talked a little bit about how you'd expect the Pro to lead in a recovery and some of the characteristics you'd expect to see there. Just curious why you think that's maybe more of a coincident indicator at this point. And we're starting to see ticket pickup but that Pro is still more or less in line with the overall company average. What do you think is different than you would have expected and maybe than what you've seen in prior recoveries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first off, David, I don't know that we can speak to prior recoveries because we really didn't have the data to analyze the differences. And I'd say the basis for our expectation, if you remember, go back to 2008, 2009 and particularly post-Lehman, our Pro business dropped off at a significantly steeper rate than our Consumer business. Both were going down, but our Pro business was going down quite a bit more. So we had a theory, which to date, it looks so far so good, that as the market recovered, the Pro would start to pick up and would be a key part of that recovery for us. Where I'd say we are now, where the numbers say we are now and as we called out in June, sort of a work-out phase, the Pro is recovering but it's not yet at a point where it's surpassing the recovery of the Consumer. And again, as we referenced, the larger Pro is coming back a little faster.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to put that into perspective the larger Pro makes up 13% of our Pro sales, so the majority of our Pro sales are the smaller Pro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. That's helpful. Just a little bit more on the geographic mix. I mean I think what we've seen over the last couple of years is a greater level of growth in urban and maybe close suburban areas. Are you seeing any signs that the geographic mix within markets is changing? I mean obviously you addressed the Florida and California issues. But given that we started to see signs that household formation is picking up, are you seeing the mix within markets change at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And shifting more to our urbanly-focused stores? No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, sorry, I mean the other way around, maybe more towards suburban and ex-urban areas than where it's been the last couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll be honest, David, no, we haven't seen that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next we'll hear from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning. So I wanted to follow up on the capital allocation question. I think that your view has recently been you didn't need the cash and rates aren't going up anytime soon, so there was no rush to add debt to fund the buybacks. However, the other side of this is the stock price, so while it's below where you think it's worth, the market maybe is ahead of where you thought it would take it and now you have an incremental positive view on housing, November is off to, what sounds like to a strong start, this potential bridge from Sandy over the next two quarters of tough weather-compares. So I guess, Devil's Advocate, why isn't now a good time to go add that to the balance sheet and buy the stock below where you think it's worth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, all good questions. Here's our point of view on incremental debt. If you look at our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio, we're standing at 1.7 times against a maximum target of two times, which would suggest by the end of the year about $3 billion of debt capacity, more or less. As we look into 2013, a couple of things. There is the fiscal cliff issue and we'd like to get through that because as we talked about in the past, raising debt in an environment of high beta doesn't make a lot of sense. And there's no higher beta, in my opinion, than the fiscal cliff. Now we'll know soon where that ends up. We've got $1 billion and $250 million coming due in December of next year, we're going to refinance that, give us an opportunity to add some incremental debt once we get through the fiscal cliff, if we so desire. And when we make that decision, we'll let you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And then just as a follow-up on the shrink side, which is perhaps the only other question that hasn't been asked yet, it sounds like &#x2013; you said you were early on in a process and really the first quarter that you've talked about it, so what are you doing there that you haven't done before? And can &#x2013; do you expect this gross margin tailwind to sustain itself? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, this is Marvin Ellison. Shrink, really for us, has in the past been a really good-news story. The early part of this year, we had underperformance and it's really a refocus, a refocus on operational process, refocus on merchandising, packaging standards, just a refocus on execution. We have a new leader in the role. We have really a strong commitment and involvement from all of our associates and we're pleased with the performance in the second half of the year and we're optimistic that the performance will continue for the balance of the year and we'll take that into 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you may recall when we set forth our 12/24 targets, 12% operating margin, we showed a walk on the gross margin line and there was an element of the walk that we called operational excellence. That's code for better shrink performance. So to Marvin's point, between now and 2015 we continue to expect better performance there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another thing, Chris, it's probably worth noting that we've gone through quite a few process changes over the past three years and with process changes really creates uncertainty and a different view of transparency on how you impact shrink. So we had to make adjustments in the stores to really alter our processes to meet the needs and the understanding of our new process. So we feel real good about where we're headed and again we hope to keep the performance going into next year.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Vicky, we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With that being said, we will take Alan Rifkin with Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Just one last question, Carol, on Sandy. I mean, realizing that obviously it is difficult to forecast revenues coming from the storm, if you believe that in the quarter during the storm and following the storm the benefits from Sandy will be equal to that of Irene, that would imply about $290 million realized in Q4 which would equate to about a 180 basis point benefit on the comp line. Is that something that would be reasonable for us to expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You need to build the models the way you build your models. We've given the guidance that we've given based on our plan because we just don't know how to forecast prospectively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Alan, one thing just to keep in mind on why we're a little cautious on this and the comparisons to Irene may not be direct, is you've got very different weather circumstances. So last year, following Irene, if you'll remember, fourth quarter was one of the warmest winters ever in the Northern division, and that helped in the Irene recovery. We don't know, obviously sitting here today, what's the weather going to be like in New Jersey and New York as we head into the end of November and December, and that will have an impact on the recovery efforts. So that's, I mean, we have spent a lot of time thinking, gee, what's the right way to approach this issue for the fourth quarter and frankly the first quarter of next year, and that's why as Carol said, what we think is better is tell you, look, here's roughly what we think Irene did. We think this is give or take comparable to the impact of Irene but the timing of it for us is just very uncertain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll just pile on. We went back and studied every hurricane and the average time to recovery is T plus 6 months with the exception of Katrina. This storm in many ways is like Katrina. New Orleans is still rebuilding. So I hope you can understand why we are cautious in our outlook regarding the storm-related sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, no. Okay. No, I appreciate that, Carol. One last question, if I may. Carol, you said that in the fourth quarter you're expecting gross margins to be flat despite the anniversary-ing of more than 50 basis point benefit last year from the supply chain rolling off. In terms of the incremental gain to the gross margin, do you see that -- and obviously you've spoken about shrink at length &#x2013; do you see any changes in the mix benefiting your gross margins in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as Craig pointed out, we are a seasonal business. And if you look at lumber we would expect a lower penetration of lumber in the fourth quarter, which would help our gross margin, as an example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
