        <plist>
          <p>So, I will speak in English because we have some friends on the other side of the Channel and some other in the room. So I will start for the next ten minutes or fifteen minutes, not to really comment the result a little bit, but more to explain to you how do we feel with the Danone model, which help us to deliver the results.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the results &#x2013; it's a very small screen and I can't read. The best conclusion I have is 2011 is still a very good year for Danone. I will not speak about the context and the macroeconomic context, because I'm sure you know it better than me. But within this context, we are very pleased with the results, especially because we have some good surprise. Everybody is talking about France and Spain declining, we grew.</p>
          <p>And it's very good news for us because that's the right illustration of how do we play with the model. Basically, we have two models, an emerging country one growing, improving margin, and another one, the major countries one, where we are not declining, but we grow slowly and perhaps margin are less than that was in the past. That's the two models. But one day the emerging one is going to win, and in some businesses, it's already the case. So we are not transforming Danone, but the geographical equation is stretching in the right direction the model of Danone and you will see that.</p>
          <p>So if you look at this chart, as you know, I'm asking to everybody in the group to focus on the sales growth, like-for-like sales growth, which is the original items for the Danone model based on our brands, based on our businesses, then based on the different geographies. And as you can see 7.8% is one of the best of the best achievement for this company. So, I'm not talking about the context, but whatever the context was in the past, 7.8% is one of the best results for us. We achieved it differently than the other years, because we have different businesses, different countries, but at the end, the result is incredibly positive.</p>
          <p>The free cash, as you can see, we are totally on track to reach the &#x20AC;2 billion 2012 and we are already preparing what will be the next step for the company. And I am going to speak about the 20 basis points. You know that I love basis point, but you have to understand that it's very important, but the strategy is based on the two first items.</p>
          <p>And the 20 basis points, basically Unimilk, 90, and the rest of the business flat 1 basis point, which is exactly &#x2013; and we are not under pressure. It's because we decide to protect brand, we decide to continue to invest. So, we leverage Unimilk, and Pierre-Andr&#xE9; will explain where we are. But, clearly, we are on track on that Unimilk issue &#x2013; opportunity, sorry. Another way to look at it, if you look at the different businesses and the different countries, you have Europe, 2.4%, which is exactly what we want.</p>
          <p>As I said, the game for us is to leverage the growth of the emerging country. But it's much more easy &#x2013; easier, sorry, to leverage in the emerging country when you control a kind of growth between 0% and 3% for Western Europe and you will see the new geographic balance we have. So, this model will continue to improve. And when you see Europe 2.4%, you have to know that Russia is flat. Means the other country without Russia, Western Europe is much more better than 2.4%, which is, I think, a specificity for Danone. Asia, rest of the world, is just booming and we have many example of growing much more than 20% and perhaps you will see that during the Pierre-Andr&#xE9; presentation.</p>
          <p>Waters, sorry for everybody thinking that this business was totally dead, it's a really good one but, again, it's not very difficult to understand if you take volume, if you take net sales, if you take margin for the three items, two-third is coming from the emerging country. So, it's the next, next, next business model for Danone.</p>
          <p>I have nothing to say about Baby and Medical, still growing very well. So that's the results, but, obviously, Pierre-Andr&#xE9; will go much more deeper within the different items building the result. The thing I would like to explain to you is how do we achieve this and how do we leverage all the engines of the company.</p>
          <p>The first one, which is part of our model, everybody is talking about the strengths of our brands or the brands of the different company. Now within Danone, the first step of the model is to speak about the category. We are the leading brands in quite every countries, every businesses where we are. We're not everywhere, but where we are, as you remember, we want to be locally number one with a big gap with number two or three because of the retail, because of the pressure of the consumer, because of everything. But to do that, the first step, it's like a pyramid. We work on the category.</p>
          <p>Our job is to develop the category, means to develop differentiation, means to develop consumption per capita, means to have the right advertising campaign for the category. And you have there four example which I'm not talking about our brands, but are talking about the category. You are an Italian example for the Dairy. You have the Baby Nutrition example in China, where we are just claiming that you need Mr. &#x2013; Chinese mother, you need a specific food not for two months, not for three months, for three years. So, we build the category, because it's quite impossible to develop top-line growth with our brands if the category is not growing itself. So, our job as a leader is to build the category.</p>
          <p>Water, we are talking about the fact that you have to drink for health and you will see we have two new surveys, medical survey, about the impact of having the right hydration for your body we are going to disclose. So we build the category. And Medical Nutrition and healthy aging is exactly the same. Everybody want to live as long as possible, except that everybody wants to live in independency, not having somebody taking care of you, which is exactly the way we build the category.</p>
          <p>If I take the example of the Fresh Dairy, on the left, you have the per capita consumption. And you see different clusters, countries where the consumption per capita is very high, like France or Spain, 32, 33 kilos, country which are growing where we are, like Saudi Arabia, Argentina and so on, country where we just start and country like Russia and U.S., where we are recovering or building the platform for the future. It's going to be the main fuel. Not right now, that will take time.</p>
          <p>But it's exactly the &#x2013; we are very lucky because you can see that in some countries we can really bring value because we are not going to ask to the French to eat 60 kilo per year. But when you know that the U.S. are eating 4 kilos, 5 kilos per years per capita and the U.S. is a country which is really recovering by the time being, so the opportunity for us is huge.</p>
          <p>So that's the way we are, let's say, clustering our countries. In the middle, you have what I just explained, stable growth in Europe, double-digit growth in LatAm. And we are not so strong in Asia, which is something we have to think about, about Dairy, because the performance of Dairy are really impact by the fact that they are more European than Asiatic.</p>
          <p>We are booming in Latin America. We are nothing, quite nothing, in Asia. Do we have to do that now? No, that the way we take care of the global economic context because we know that doing things in Baby Food in China or Indonesia, we will get a better return much more faster than to spend money to create and develop Dairy in Asia.</p>
          <p>So we consider Dairy in Asia as a pocket for growth for the next 10 years, 15 years. The priority short-term is not there and the priority is how to develop Aquadrinks in Indonesia, how to develop infant formula in some other countries.</p>
          <p>On the right, we have the way we are looking to the business, how are we going to build the business, the Dairy business all over the world. So we go back to the what we call the why in our jargon. There's a nutrition, there's a functionality and based, obviously, on indulgence. And you have some example if you look at the U.S. market, we will continue to build Nutrition, we will continue to build functionality. But, obviously, when you look at the result of the Greek segment, which is an indulgent one, you feel it's an indulgent one, but it's a little bit more complicated than that. It's based on a diet more than an indulgent product because 90% of the Greek in the U.S. is zero fat, which is not exactly an indulgent product, but it's based on the diet in the U.S., based on the protein.</p>
          <p>The Water, again, which is a perfect example of what I just explained. Emerging 73%, mature, 27%, and within the mature we are growing again. Evian is growing, Badoit is growing, Salvetat in France is growing 25%. It's more difficult for some countries like Spain, especially because of Mercadona. But we have good news in Water and in Dairy with Mercadona, we get back some growth with specific format, with specific promotion in this &#x2013; with this retailer.</p>
          <p>But the main thing you have to understand within the Water division, I call it Water, is a mix. We continue to improve the quality of the businesses because of the Aquadrinks, and you know the Aquadrinks are Mizone in China growing &#x2013; I'm not sure we disclosed the growth of Mizone in China, but one day we know this business will do, will deliver &#x20AC;1 billion. Don't ask me when, but the growth is double-digit and the first figure is not a two. So it's really booming, really, really booming. And Aquadrinks is very important because our margin are better on Aquadrinks than on the Water.</p>
          <p>So, we leverage all the distribution system. Remember all the question you have about Coke and Pepsi entering the Water business? Now just imagine Indonesia with more than 70% market share, how we can leverage our distribution system.</p>
          <p>Nutrition, for Nutrition activities we put together Medical Nutrition and Baby Food. I have not many things to say except that for those who were a question markers on how are we going to digest Numico, how are we going to continue to grow the business, does Danone know how to make that kind of acquisition. The answer is on the chart. We continue to grow, we accelerate the growth, we accelerate the margin. And we really explode the free cash flow just putting people from the Dairy division within the Baby Food division and Medical Nutrition division. So, everything is doing very well.</p>
          <p>The platform, I just disclosed a few minutes before, as you can see, emerging, 51%. It's perhaps, in my country, in France, it's not very polite to say that we are very pleased to be in the emerging country. But definitively, to deliver 7.8% top-line growth like-for-like, you need this engine, you need the emerging. And you can see that a few years ago that was risky. Today, we know &#x2013; first, it's still risky, but we learned a lot from emerging, we learned from what happened to us in China, we learned about our development in Mexico and Brazil. So we are no more a French or even a Lyonnaise company. We really have the right people to drive the business, we are really becoming an international company. And as you can see, emerging, 51%. And as I used to do, if I add to that the U.S., which is an emerging country in terms of dairy consumption, we have more than 60% in the emerging countries.</p>
          <p>If you look at what we call the MICRUBs, I think you remember, Mexico, Indonesia, Russia, Brazil, U.S. and China. These six priorities, really priorities for us, represent now 60% of the sales growth and more of three-quarter of the EBIT growth. So when we said to you a few years ago that we are going to focus on the MICRUBs and these MICRUBs will help us to deliver the result we plan, you have the answer.</p>
          <p>So, now if I look at the group, I have two ways to manage the company. Saying, okay, the macroeconomic environment is very difficult, so we have to protect, we have to be shy, we stop to invest. And if I do that, within two or three years, I have nothing to comment in term of good result. So whatever the context, we have to find the right way to continue to invest and to build. Danone Group is a very young company. We just achieved the right balance in term of businesses and in term of geography and we will continue to build. To do that, I put some example countries where we are, so we will continue to build the right platform with what I call the MICRUBs. So I put some example how to really reinforce our position. Obviously, the Greek yogurt in U.S., we sell everything we produce, we grow dramatically, we gain market share, we already recovered the number two position. And that will continue because we are waiting for capacity until June, so that will continue.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we launched the Baby Nutrition, we have two additional water plants. Brazil, we launched HOD, means we have just replicate our rollout the success model we have in Mexico with Bonafont in Brazil. We are already number one in S&#xE3;o Paulo, now we add the HOD and I'm sure one day or another we will conquer these <mark type="ph" /> in our list (16:45). We launched also this &#x2013; the same model in Poland with Bonafont. Egypt, we &#x2013; it's another subject how to protect the milk resource for us, so we just opened a farm in Egypt to really control milk quality because now we have the right size to build that kind of platform.</p>
          <p>India, basically, we have our four businesses in India, very small, not impacting the group, but we are there. So, within few years that will impact the group, because, as you know, India, the impact will be terrific for us. And so on and so on, and Baby Nutrition or Medical Nutrition in China is booming.</p>
          <p>And the next chart is about Unimilk. I think Pierre-Andr&#xE9; will go deeper, but just to tell you that we are on track. First of all, the first years was to focus on how to refurbish the margin. We did it and now all the time is to build the growth on the right platform. So, we will continue to make productivity, but I'm sure that at the end of the year, we will, both Danone, the ex-Danone and Unimilk together, because it's done, it's merged. And we changed the management, we put right people at the right place, we take really control of the company and we already have some good result on local brand very well known, starting to grow again.</p>
          <p>So this is definitively on track, which is when you look at the size of this country, which is not a country, it's definitively a continent, we have there a huge potential. Perhaps not 2012, but I'm sure that within the next five years that will really help us to deliver the expectation we have for the campaign.</p>
          <p>I will not comment on the innovation, just to tell you that when we are talking about innovation, it's not the classic we have &#x2013; we are going to launch a new product. That would be too easy. Innovation for us is the best packaging. And you'll see that we definitively go back into marketing to the basic. Everybody is talking to you about digital and how to connect the consumer on the Apple, Google. Yeah, us too. But you have to do that and at the same time you have to go back to the basic, how to make a different in the shelf to control the private label. Even if the private label are declining little bit, we have to make the difference. So we have to go back to the basic principle of marketing. You can see this new pot &#x2013; new cup, sorry, for Activia, not only Activia, the full Dairy range we switched to the new cup. That will cost us money. We will invest.</p>
          <p>And perhaps that's the reason why you have to understand why we say margin flat. Not because we are under pressure. Just because we decide to continue to invest, to build the difference, to open new country, to launch new product, to launch new packaging, to add the better taste. Totally stupid? But when you are selling food, trust me, if your product is better than the other, you sell more. Very clever. But a lot of companies are forgetting this.</p>
          <p>So we ask to the marketing people to test all the products in terms of superiority, quality, stronger benefit and better ingredient and responsible sourcing. This example you have there with <mark type="ph" /> L'&#xC9;lite (20:25), I don't know if you can read, le lait de nos &#x2013; the milk of our farmers, okay. But that's the way we recover our growth, with the basic plan here growth in France, because it's &#x2013; that's the right way. That's the way you have to market your products for the time being.</p>
          <p>Again, innovation, but, again, not innovation just on product, but innovation because that will create a new occasion of consumption, a new benefit. Densia is a real success, so we are really thinking how to rollout Densia in more countries than the one we are right now. FortiFit, our new target. And for the first time I put Souvenaid. Jan Bennink was ready to talking about Souvenaid and I stopped to talk about Souvenaid in the last four years or five years.</p>
          <p>We put Souvenaid because we have the result of the second medical survey and its promise is really good. So perhaps not in 2012, but I think we will we are really preparing ourselves to launch this product end of 2012, 2013. That will depend, first of all, how we can publish the result and, more important, how we will convince the community which is suffering from this disease, because we need the support the community. In the U.S., for example, you have a lot of product trying to fight against Alzheimer. Nothing is working. And, more difficult, the community is not supporting that kind of product. So, you need this green light before doing something.</p>
          <p>So the environment, I will take an example because it's difficult not to take five minutes about the crisis. For us, the most difficult thing to deal with is not the economic crisis, except if Europe disappear or whatever, but we will have another meeting to explain the consequences of that. But personally, we think that the 2012 context will be the same than the second part of the 2011 context.</p>
          <p>So it's not very positive, but it's not very pessimistic. And if we find a way to deliver plus 7%, 8% full year, but also on Q4, that the reason why, except Fukushima and the impact on the water business, that's the reason why you saw in the &#x2013; because you already saw the guidance, we say 5% to 7%. So because we put this a little bit lower because of the impact of the Water business due to the seasonality last year and especially Japan and Fukushima.</p>
          <p>So, the most important thing we have to deal with is this raw material. We expect a slowdown. We expect not the &#x2013; the beginning of the year is continue to grow. Less than in the past, but continue to grow. But we think that &#x2013; and especially if the crisis is very strong, we will see the commodities going down in term of price. So, we plan that.</p>
          <p>But if you look at the curve, you can see what we swallow the last two years, three years, four years. Just imagine what will be the strength of this company with a reasonable price increase in raw material, and I wouldn't like to come back on how do we deal with this. I explained that last year. Everybody's talking of pricing power, increasing the price. And as since now two years, I explained that it is not our strategy. I even refused to answer about brand power, which helped to pushup the price, because one day the Dannon Yogurt, the Evian water we'll call Gucci or whatever, but no more Dannon.</p>
          <p>We can't transfer everything to the consumer, not because the brand are not enough strong, and some of our product are very resilient, like the infant formula product in China. So the strategy we have is in front of this raw material increase is, first of all, productivity. Not firing 6,000 people with a very high cost. No, it's an ongoing process. It's part of our DNA.</p>
          <p>In Danone, we want to be the lowest cost producer. We want to have the lowest cost structure we can imagine. And as you can see, we planned last year to achieve &#x20AC;500 million in productivity. We achieved &#x20AC;528 million and we plan the same kind of figure for next year, which is definitively more adapt to the Danone model, that's the first priority. The second one is the mix, because if you have the right mix, you are less impact by the raw material increase. When I'm talking about the Aquadrinks and if the PET is growing up, which is the case, obviously you control a little bit better.</p>
          <p>And third, but really third, at the end, we transfer to the consumer, which is good to protect the brand, but also destroying the competition which has not the right brands, perhaps not the right innovations. So, if the leading brand is not pushing up the price, you just struggle then, which is the strategy I explained last year.</p>
          <p>In the same time, it's easier to negotiate with a trade if you are not pushing up too much the price. So that's the way we do. Now, if we are doing price increase, even within the price increase, it is SKU-by-SKU, country-by-country and businesses-by-businesses. I think it's not difficult to understand that if I take France, if I have a pack of 16 club for family, I will not push up very strongly the price. If I have a very &#x2013; a pack of four cups of Activia Vanilla from Africa, whatever, blah, blah, blah selling at the corner of the street at midnight, I push up the price.</p>
          <p>So, it's really fine-tuning marketing. Is it new for us? No, we started in 2008 to do that when we deicide to do the reset. And by the way, we are very happy having done the reset in 2008 because it give us fresh air and more elasticity. If you are always hot, you are totally blocked by the consumer or by the retailers.</p>
          <p>We have to accelerate because I think I am late. The basic, I'm talking this chart is really summarize what I said few minutes ago. On the right, we have consumer connection. How to deal with the new tools which is really booming for us. I will not give again the example of Evian or even with the example of what we did with the Greek Oikos product in the U.S. with the Super Bowl, not doing by the advertising agency but by two students, which is definitively less expensive than to work with the agency, by the way. But the creativity is more, the connection is much more better.</p>
          <p>So, we have all these program on the right side of the chart. But on the other one, on the left one, it's very basic. It's what we call in French th&#xE9;atralisation, how to express the Danone experience within a shelf, which is perhaps the most important thing, especially because our customers or retailers are claiming us to help to develop categories. So we are just playing our leading role.</p>
          <p>Last, the mission of Danone. And you will see few example, but the thing I would like you to understand is a company like Danone will not deal with the crisis and the economic environment by cutting advertising, increasing the basis point, focusing on financial result or having the right brand. We have the right brand, we have right businesses. But much more important, we have people decide to fight.</p>
          <p>We have people within this company who are still playing the game, wanting to gain market share or growing the net sales, achieving the target. Yes, for their bonus system, but it's true it works, the bonus system is working. It's something new for everybody but it's really new, but it works.</p>
          <p>But to do that, we have to continue to protect the value of this company. So I will not comment again this chart, which is the mission of the company, there's in every stakeholder around the company. And this one, you have a social program called DAN'CARES. Yes, it's costly, it costs. But if you read what you have in the back on the left side of the chart, we have also the economic impact of that.</p>
          <p>What is the bottleneck we have in the emerging country? Quality people. How to be loyalty with these people, how to be sure that we will reduce the absenteeism in our factories, how are we be &#x2013; are we sure that they will really develop the efficiency we need just by giving sense to them?</p>
          <p>So if every time they have a small injury or whatever other disease, they have to stop to work. And they don't have the money to get back in the right health as quick as possible, we lose money. So DAN'CARES for us is a social program, but in the same time, we develop loyalty, we keep people within our organization because there is a real war about talent in the emerging country.</p>
          <p>Nutrition and Health, we will continue to develop the right model, not to make marketing with Nutrition and Health. It's not marketing for us. We really want to develop health through food to the maximum number of people. So, we put in place the right tool and the KPIs to measure, and it's part of the bonus of our people. So it's not just a marketing of flowers to, because it's very fashionable to be in Health and Nutrition. By the way, you see how we are switching from &#x2013; not switching but continuing to develop Health and Nutrition, but really looking also to indulgent and, again, we have the brand to do that.</p>
          <p>You have on one side, the pleasure product like Danette, for example if I take the Dairy, in the middle you have Activia, and if I have to go really deep with Souvenaid in the health benefit, I have another brand called Nutricia. Nutricia is really getting to play the hard health within the company.</p>
          <p>Another thing which is important for us, not because we are going to save the planet. It's not our job to save the planet, but we have to give sense to the people. And it's funny to see that people are thinking about, let's say, social issues or environmental issues outside of the company. But we think that the first thing we have to do is to ask all our people to take care of this, because they are working in Danone, but they are also consumers, they are also stakeholder, they are also speaking about the company.</p>
          <p>So we really decide to focus on this minus 30% CO2 target in 2012. And most, most of the things we are doing to achieve the target help us to save money because when you put out a <mark type="ph" /> pickup on a Par 4 (32:55), you save money. So productivity is behind also the program. It's always dual, social and economic, and we create with SAP a wonderful tool to really measure the efficiency of the program.</p>
          <p>And my last chart is this one, because sometimes it is a great pleasure to have rewards and that &#x2013; I'm sure you know the Dow Jones Sustainable Index. We start at the bottom. We were as a qualifier &#x2013; a low scores. And today, we are exactly at the same level of Unilever, for example, which is very good in this index. We are part of the Gold Class, which is very important for us.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I'll let Pierre-Andr&#xE9; going deeper in the financial results, but without what I just explained, you don't have the financial results.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Franck. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with a snapshot, which is giving you all the elements of the financial result and I'll come back on each of them. Just on this table, a few numbers to look at, the first of them is sales. We are now quite close to &#x20AC;20 billion, &#x20AC;19.318 billion net sales. So that's quite a change. And then roughly for the company, 13.6% increase in the reported sales and, as Franck already mentioned, 7.8% like-for-like.</p>
          <p>Operating margin is up on a like-for-like basis but down on a reported basis, and that's predominantly a scope effect, but it's basically we're &#x2013; we expected it. EPS up 6.5% reported and 8.8% like-for-like at &#x20AC;2.89. And probably again, once again, the best achievement overall in this table is the last one, the free cash flow at &#x20AC;1.874 billion, which is on a basis which was already very high, a 9.4% increase and another very good year on the cash.</p>
          <p>So I'll go through all that in the coming minutes. Just before we start, one small technical word and I'm sorry for the size of the letters and the fonts on the chart and the slide. It's about the change in accounting method and standards. You will see throughout the presentation that we keep referring to 2010 restated.</p>
          <p>We have restated 2010 with basically the two items you have on the slide. The first of them is the application of IAS 29, which we have decided to apply as from this year, which drives us from the corridor method to a full recognition of actuarial gain and losses, plus a booking of the charge into operating income, financial income and equity.</p>
          <p>And that's basically having an impact on 2010 for &#x20AC;17 million positive at EBIT level, &#x20AC;0.01 at the EPS level and, that, on the balance sheet is increasing our liability by &#x20AC;150 million and decreasing our equity by &#x20AC;120 million, approximately.</p>
          <p>Just to be very clear on that, this is applied on 2010 restated and, therefore, it doesn't impact and it doesn't have any consequence in terms of the way you can read the 2011 performance. I read somewhere this morning that part of the margin accretion is coming from that. That's definitely not the case, it's on 2010.</p>
          <p>And the second item is the allocation of the purchase price of Unimilk. You know that IFRS gives us one year to complete. We have completed it in November with some differences on the balance sheet, in particular, on the value of the assets and a very limited impact on the P&amp;L since we only accounted for one month of Unimilk last year and, therefore, the adjustment is extremely small, but that's part of the restatement as well. Okay, so that's just to say that 2010, I mean, these two factors explain 2010 restated and then we can switch to 2011 which, as I said, is no longer impacted by that, at least not in addition to 2010.</p>
          <p>So, back to business and performance. This shows the evolution of sales throughout the year. As Franck said, 7.8% like-for-like growth of our sales for the year, and the same number for the fourth quarter, which means that Q4 has been a strong one. The key elements for Q4 and the year I believe are, number one, the very strong performance of Water, which has been 15% for the full year and 23% for the quarter. I'll come back on that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, very strong emerging market performance, which have kept growing double-digits. North America and CIS in the second half have entered into what we call a transition period. Again, I will come back on that, but this is basically continuing in Q4. And one point to be noted is the resilience of Europe, which is true for the year but as well for the fourth quarter, which is an important point. And that makes another year not only of good performance but of real construction for the group.</p>
          <p>The traditional bridge of sales growth analysis, the sales on the Q4 have increased on a reported basis by 11.3%. This reflects the negative foreign exchange impact, which reflects weakness of the ruble and the dinar versus the euro versus the same quarter in 2010. The scope is basically Unimilk for two months in the last quarter. And then your left we have a like-for-like which is 7.8% made of 25% volume progression and 75% pricing, for a total of 11.3% reported.</p>
          <p>This is about the same picture for the full year with two exceptions. One is the impact of Unimilk, which is higher because we consolidate eleven months on twelve as opposed to two months on three for the full year, hence, the impact for the scope of 7.5%. Currency is very much the same. And why the like-for-like progression of sales is the same, the pricing is obviously higher in Q4, 5.6%, than it has been for the full year at 4.8%.</p>
          <p>This is something which you can see on the next slide, i.e., the progressive building of the pricing since, in fact, not only the beginning of the year but the last part of 2010, moving from 2.1% in the last quarter of 2010 to 5.6% in 2011. And obviously volumes have been going the opposite direction. Avery clear driver of the evolution of the volumes has been Unimilk, as you know, which has progressively compared to higher comparison base as we have moved in 2011 and, therefore, has become negative when comparing to 2010.</p>
          <p>Without Unimilk, I find the picture, which is the next one, the slide page 34, quite interesting. Without Unimilk, it shows basically the same trend, i.e., pricing building up, but at the same time, it also shows volumes which are quite resilient in fact, at 3.9% volume grown in Q4 versus 4.6% in the last quarter of last year. And I believe this reflects what Franck mentioned, which is our pricing strategy and the selectivity we have been using in impressing pricing in Dairy and Water, and in particular in Europe. I will come back on that.</p>
          <p>So a word about Dairy. You know the format again. The green bands at the top, shows that we are showing numbers ex-Unimilk, this is the last time. We'll start the year next year with the full integration of Unimilk and, therefore, no analysis ex-Unimilk. But to continue what we have started at the beginning of the year, Dairy performance ex-Unimilk is basically in line with Q3. Q3 was showing a slowdown versus the previous, the first part of the year, reflecting the slowdown of the American and the CIS market. Q4 is very much in line with that.</p>
          <p>When you look at the countries which have driven this performance, LatAm &#x2013; Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico remain very strong. Africa, Middle East, but also Asia-Pacific and Japan following the recovery after Fukushima remain strong. U.S. and Russia, I'll come back in detail on that. And Europe, again, has been quite resilient with perhaps one exception, which is Central Europe, which we already mentioned in H1 and in Q3. But the rest of Europe has really been quite resilient and, in fact, positive in terms of performance.</p>
          <p>In terms of brands, Activia continued to drive the growth, but it's clearly not the only one. And the increasing importance of indulgence products, such as Danette, and Nutrition products is basically confirming what it was already in the first part of the year.</p>
          <p>When you look at the evolution of pricing and mix, you see that pricing has kept increasing sequentially in Q4 under the full quarter effect of the price increases. In fact, no significant price increase has been passed in addition in Q4, so it's rather the full quarter effect. The important thing to keep in mind is that, as opposed to 2008, the volume remained positive, although at slightly lower than 1%. And they are indeed healthy throughout the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:15) with the exception of U.S. and Russia, again, which you know. And we'll definitely continue managing our pricing the same way going forward as it shows a quite good result.</p>
          <p>So a word on the U.S. I hope you have and otherwise I invite you to watch the advertising which we have run during the Super Bowl. It's been the first dairy advertising as far as I know, fresh dairy advertising, run during the Super Bowl and it's quite a funny one. It's been one of the few examples of advertising. Because otherwise we basically said everything we produce and we are not pushing on the Oikos brand despite that it has shown quite remarkable progresses. You'll see on the chart that the sales have almost doubled between the first half of 2011 and the second half of 2011. They now represent close to 10% of our portfolio. You can see that on the right-hand chart.</p>
          <p>And as we move into 2012, we progressively install new capacity and continue &#x2013; sorry, confirm the role of Oikos has been one of the leading brands of the fresh dairy market of the Greek segment, at least in the U.S. So from that standpoint, 2012 is definitely going to be very interesting.</p>
          <p>Unimilk, as Franck reminded you, the priority of 2011 was really to build the foundation. And build the foundation means make the company profitable and make the integration. So from that standpoint, this has been successful year definitely. Profitability, in particular, in the second half has come back to a level pre-heat wave and milk crisis in Russia. This is due to pricing we have taken to some slowdown in the cost of milk, but also two very good initial results of productivity programs and synergies which we are putting in place when making the integration.</p>
          <p>The integration is essentially done. I mean, it's never fully done. But, basically, we have today one organization, we have one head office, one management team. We have, during the third quarter, installed SAP in one of the Unimilk location, we'll continue the deployment in the coming quarters. We have really done the job in term of segmenting portfolio. In other words, we have built what we need to be able from 2012 to accelerate. And definitely, growth is going to be the theme on the Unimilk agenda for 2012.</p>
          <p>For 2011, basically, things are progressing the same way we have seen them progressing throughout the year. Volume keeps being stable sequentially, which is normal given the absence of push we have. Sales on the &#x2013; sorry, price per kilo, we've seen the anniversary of the price increase coming and, therefore, the positive pricing lapsing.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the mix confirms being positive. And all together, this has given a negative sales performance in the last quarter of minus 4.3% but, again, sequentially very much in line with the rest of the year. As I said, therefore, we very much look forward pushing and building the brands in 2012 and recovering growth gradually as we had already said previously. For the sake of reference, this is the addition of Dairy ex-Unimilk and Unimilk. It's the base we'll be using for 2012 and it's reflecting the combination of the two, which I've already explained.</p>
          <p>So this is it for Dairy &#x2013; oh no, sorry, it's not fully done. One word about innovation which are quite interesting. You have two Russian on the chart, one which is Actimel Fruit Cocktail, quite interesting and good, and Unimilk Fresh Cheese under the Prostokvashino brand, which confirms month-after-month being a very interesting brand.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, Activia has <mark type="ph" /> been declined (49:05) in a food version in Portugal, which is doing well. And, as you already know, we have changed the format of the cups in Spain, that's been the case for Activia the beginning of the year. We have extended that to the full range during the year and, as Franck mentioned, we'll be looking at expanding that to other countries in the course of 2012 given the very good results we've had with this new cup.</p>
          <p>And the last thing I want to mention is Milkuat Tiger Bottle, which is another example of packaging, but also a very good recipe at a very good price, which is making Indonesia taking off. And that's very good news because that's a country which is not only very promising, but also a country which is very strong for Danone and, therefore, we have the other businesses which can give some health in terms of infrastructure. So, that's all for Dairy at this time.</p>
          <p>I'll just drink water before talking Water. So that's been an outstanding year I think. Full-year top-line growth 16%. The third quarter had been weak on really poor weather conditions, yet 8%. Q4 is basically benefiting from all the positive you can imagine. It's benefiting from very positive underlying, i.e., Western Europe, which is growing slowly but growing, emerging markets which are very strong and, at the same time, it's benefiting from additional factors.</p>
          <p>The mild weather in Europe in Q4, it's a long time ago. I know it's been cold since then but the first part of the winter has been mild. Secondly, the Aquadrinks performance, which has not only been very good for the year, but has even accelerated in the last quarter of this year. And the last is the pricing. We have been on the back of a very strong increase of the cost of PET, we have been passing price increase and all together that's been helping the performance as well.</p>
          <p>Country-wise, Mexico, Indonesia, China, Argentina, have been, of course, the top contributor of the year. When you look at the analysis volume mix, you see very clearly that the underlying performance is not only very strong, but is also not so different from what we have been delivering in the rest of the year, and you can see that with the volumes at 10% increase in Q4. The big difference comes from the pricing and mix. Pricing represents about 7 points out of the 13 points and that's showing the price increase which has been passed throughout the year, mainly in emerging markets in Water to compensate the increase of the cost of PET.</p>
          <p>The mix is clearly showing the acceleration of the Aquadrinks, which are doing very, very well. I'm talking of Mizone in Asia, I 'm talking of Levit&#xE9; de Bonafont in Latin America, and this is what you see on the next slide on the right, i.e., a new version of Levit&#xE9; Pomelo Rosado in Argentina for Villa del Sur. And at the same time, in Europe we keep reinventing the packaging, in particular, food use of bio-materials after Volvic, which was first bottle last year with 20% of bio-meg. We have been using that material for Aguas Lanjar&#xF3;n in Spain this year.</p>
          <p>Baby Nutrition, another strong year, another strong quarter, basically very much the same driver performance which is driven by the growth of the milk category which is driven as well by an expansion of market share in almost all of our markets, driven geographically by Asia, of course, but also by Africa and Middle East. And if you compared 2011 with 2010, you will note that the additional performance is basically coming from pricing. Baby had as well to face some increase of raw material and, as a result, passed price increase, which contributes an additional 2 points in 2011 versus 2010.</p>
          <p>To be noted as well, and that's in the comments, Q4 has been particularly strong in China, given that Chinese New Year is falling earlier this year than it was last year and the building of the inventory ahead of Chinese New Year in China has taken place in December as opposed to January. So we find the reverse effect basically in January of 2012. But very good performance, again, of Baby, very consistent. I think that's really the important thing.</p>
          <p>With innovation which had been launched which are basically upgrades on what we call the <mark type="ph" /> Blue House (54:12) which is the immunity benefit under the brand Gallia Actimel, upgrades on the specials and upgrade in terms of packaging as well with the rollout of Eazypack. And on the food as well, you can see some soup and soup sticks in the Netherlands, which I recommend you to taste, it's very good for your baby.</p>
          <p>Medical Nutrition very much the same; another strong year, good performance. Pediatrics and, in particular, Nutrini and Neocate have been helping the performance. What's interesting in Medical this year is that the emerging markets are really contributing to the performance. This is the case not only of Brazil and Turkey, as in the previous year, but China starts taking an interesting position. And this is counterbalancing a Western European context, which has been a bit more difficult and it's basically illustrated by a negative pricing, which for this quarter has been negative 2%. So, clearly, a difficult context in Western Europe which doesn't prevent the performance in emerging markets, which are fully playing their role, as well in the case of Medical Nutrition.</p>
          <p>To end up with sales, one word about the geographical growth. I think the very good element is that it's a broad-based growth. Yes, emerging markets are growing and sometimes booming. When you look at Asia, plus 22% and the year which has been between 18% and 22%, it's clearly a very good performance coming from predominantly Baby and Water.</p>
          <p>When you look at the rest of the world with a top-line growth which is close to 15%, again, at 14.4% in the last quarter, that's a very good one as well, reflecting Latin America but also Africa, Middle East in Baby and in Latin America &#x2013; sorry, I didn't mention Dairy and Water. But what's interesting as well is that Europe remains solid, 1.5% top-line growth in Q4, and that's, as already outlined by Franck, is taking into account a negative Unimilk, so it shows that the rest of Europe is definitely very resilient.</p>
          <p>Now going to the margin developments, we've added this slide just to start from the full picture. As I said in my introduction, margins have been down on a reported basis by 55 basis points, going from 15.27% to 14.72%. The negative scope impact is basically Unimilk, it's in line with what we had been disclosing to you during the pro forma exercise a year ago. The positive ForEx comes from the weakness of the U.S. dollar and Russian ruble, which have an average margin below the average of the group. And then you have a like-for-like addition, which is plus 20 basis points,  in line with what we expected.</p>
          <p>In fact, we expected Unimilk to contribute 10 basis points to 20 basis points and it has contributed 19 basis points, and we expected the rest of the group to contribute 0 basis points to 10 basis points and it has contributed 1 basis points, that was at the beginning of the year. Talking about Unimilk, this is very much pricing, the evolution of the milk and the first synergies. We are really building up very fast synergies and improvement in terms of productivity, in particular, on the &#x2013; lots on the use of the product, the use of the raw material and the use of the packaging.</p>
          <p>So that's been a very solid performance, as expected. And for the rest of the group, plus 1 basis point, which is probably one of the most remarkable parts of the performance of Danone in 2011, given that we faced an inflation of all costs which has been close to 10%. So, at the very top and even slightly above the expectation we had at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>As Franck said, the way we have dealt with that has being primarily with another very strong year of productivity, which has given us &#x20AC;528 million, so slightly ahead of our expectations, which was &#x20AC;500 million. But this has clearly not been sufficient to offset this second year in a row of 10%, or close to 10%, increase of all commodities and costs and, therefore, we've been using the tool and level of pricing, but we've been doing that selectively. And, in particular, more in the emerging markets than what we have done in Europe.</p>
          <p>Important to keep in mind as well and that's in particular valid for Water, the leverage has been a real strong help to offset part of this inflation of our costs. So that gives you a stable margin and, you see on the right, that A&amp;P has been contributing as well. It's obviously more the promotional level than the advertising level although we have grown advertising by 2.5%, which we think was what we needed to maintain the pressure we have on the market at this same level, and we have at the same time doubled the level of spending in terms of digital media.</p>
          <p>So that's, as you know already, we've already discussed that in particular during the Investment Seminar. We view A&amp;P as one of the elements of fuel we need for the growth. There are others and there are two others in particular, which are research and development and sales force. And together, R&amp;D and sales force have grown double digit so that the total inputs for development, the total fuel we have been putting of the business, has been growing basically in line with the sales of the company.</p>
          <p>An important chart, this is trading operating margin by business line and geographical area. I've spent some time on it, starting by division, <mark type="ph" /> Ouibou (1:01:02) as we call them, business line, dairy is up 20 basis points, that reflects two very different situation. It was reflects Unimilk, which is contributing 19 bps at group level and, therefore, it means that the rest of dairy is negative 20 bps. And that basically says that the use of pricing in Dairy has been selective and below what will be required to fully offset the inflation of the cost of milk and the cost of the other material.</p>
          <p>Waters is delivering a stable margin despite or thanks to very strong leverage and very strong pricing, but that gives us an indication of the magnitude of the increase of costs which Water has been facing and, therefore, the net is a stable margin. Baby Nutrition has been not only compensating inflation, but is also benefiting from leverage and is delivering 24 basis points. And Medical Nutrition you remember had been declining in term of margin for the past two years. We said at the beginning of the year that our ambition &#x2013; or objective, sorry &#x2013; was to stabilize the margin. This has been the case this year thanks in particular to the increased scale of the emerging markets, which start giving fruits. So that's by division.</p>
          <p>If you look at the same picture by geographies, you will read about the same events. Europe is down 41 bps, but that's including Unimilk positive impact and, therefore, ex-Unimilk, Europe is down 75 bps. And that reflects, again, in Dairy but also in Water, the choice we have made of calibrating the price increase in the countries in which we thought there will be a better acceptance by consumer, and basically in emerging markets as opposed to Europe.</p>
          <p>Asia is booming in terms of margins for reasons linked to sales and mix. And the rest of the world is as well delivering a very good performance. All together, this gives you &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; a 20 bps increase of the margin and the level of margin between Europe and the rest of the world which keeps converging and is less year-after-year a weight for the group. So that's trading operating income, which multiplying sales by margin gives you &#x20AC;2.843 billion.</p>
          <p>As you know, we have other operating items which are non-current items. There are basically two in these results. The first is the cost of integration of Unimilk. As you know, under existing accounting standards, we don't provision or we don't book the full amount of integration costs, but we expense it year-after-year. We said it will be &#x20AC;100 million, &#x20AC;30 million of this &#x20AC;100 million has been expensed this year and about &#x20AC;50 million is going to be expensed next year.</p>
          <p>And the rest is made, in particular, of one element, which is rightsizing in China. You have seen that probably in the month of November, December. We have chosen in China after two years of existence of our stand-alone Dairy platform, to continue but to come back to a scale which will be very much focusing on two things, Shanghai, in terms of city, and Bio, which is the Chinese local equivalent Activia in terms of product. To maximize the not only growth but sustainability of growth, we are building in Dairy China for the future. This has led to a refocus in terms of teams and location and, too, some costs which are included in this &#x20AC;114 million. So, operating income total is at &#x20AC;2.729 billion.</p>
          <p>We've changed a bit this table, so if you were used to understanding the very complex previous table, you have to get used to another one. Sorry for that. We think it's slightly better. It gives you the full underlying P&amp;L on the left side for 2010, the same for 2011, then the non-current items across the P&amp;L for 2011 and the full-year 2011 complete.</p>
          <p>To comment on the non-current items, no specific additional comment. I've already giving you &#x2013; given you, sorry, the main elements, and tax, financial charges and minority interest are basically the consequence of that. On the underlying part, financial expenses have been increasing on the integration of the debt in ruble for the financing of Unimilk, which is at higher interest rate than in the rest of the group. Income tax, we continue being under pressure from that 10 points, so it increased by 70 basis points to 25.8%, so close to 26%, and &#x20AC;661 million.</p>
          <p>Affiliates has been down on three factors. The Huiyuan, which was consolidated for some part last year and is not this year anymore consolidated by mise en &#xE9;quivalence equity method. Japan, Yakult has been impacted by the earthquake and, therefore, is showing lower results. And we have a series of minority stake in Africa, Middle East which has been impacted by the events at the beginning of the year. So that deals &#x20AC;46 million net income of affiliates. And minority interests, on the other hand, are progressing under the integration of Danone-Unimilk and the quite good results of Danone-Unimilk.</p>
          <p>So, net income to EPS, the difference is basically of the addition of factors, basically the net &#x2013; the average number of shares, we bought back for &#x20AC;659 million of shares this year, which is approximately 14 million shares. As an average impact for the year, it gives you a decrease of 12 million shares in the fully diluted, which means that our EPS is growing from &#x20AC;2.72 to &#x20AC;2.89. And as I said in the introduction, that represents a 6.5% reported increase, which is made of a negative 1% currency effect, a negative 1% scope effect and a plus 8.8% like-for-like growth of the EPS.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, we have done some new slides. You have that on the screen, that's the cash bridge. I hope it's going to be very helpful. I'm not going to comment that table, but rather, this one, which is showing you the main elements of the very positive cash performance we've been delivering once again. Plus 9.4%, &#x20AC;1.8 billion, &#x20AC;1.9 billion at a percentage of sales which is close to 10%. And working capital which has been definitely helping once again this performance, with a contribution of &#x20AC;162 million, you see that on the previous page. And working capital percentage of sales, which has kept improving at 6.2% of sales. This means that Baby, the Baby division of Danone is now at the same level as Water and Dairy, in terms of working capital. So it shows you the continuous progress we are making in this field.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we continue investing to build the business and to support the business. CapEx at 4.6%, that's &#x20AC;885 million, and that's basically within the 4.5% to 5% which we have as a reference to continue investing.</p>
          <p>So, this &#x20AC;1.874 billion, how has it been used? Basically, two ways. You see that on the table. Dividends which have been paid for a total amount which is very close to &#x20AC;1 billion, I repeat, &#x20AC;1 billion. Out of this &#x20AC;1 billion, &#x20AC;780 million has been paid to Danone shareholders and the rest have been paid to minority shareholders. And we've bought back shares, as I told you, by for total amount of &#x20AC;655 million in line with what we had in mind at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>With that, the debt decreased by &#x20AC;200 million. Additionally, the value of the put option has been reduced by &#x20AC;200 million coming mainly from Spain, but also from &#x2013; yeah, coming mainly from Spain, sorry. And that gives you a reduction of debt of &#x20AC;441 million, which you can see on the balance sheet, going from &#x20AC;7 billion to &#x20AC;6.6 billion. Out of the &#x20AC;6.6 billion, &#x20AC;3.6 billion are on the put options, &#x20AC;3 billion is the financial net debt, the rest of the balance sheet is not moving very significantly, but just expanding as we expand in total.</p>
          <p>I'll end up 2011 with an opinion. I'm not too late &#x2013; no I'm not.  With one word about the next General Meeting, which is going to be on the 26 of April, which is the date of my birthday. We are going &#x2013; just to make people laugh a little bit because everybody is very, very...</p>
          <p>We are going to propose a dividend of &#x20AC;1.39 per share. This represents an increase of 6.9%, in line with he EPS, which means that we are basically maintaining the payout at the same level as last year at 48%, within the range of 45% to 50%, which, as you know is our policy and we'll propose the payment in cash only.</p>
          <p>Second thing, we continue improving &#x2013; sorry, driving the board towards more independency and diversity. And within that framework, three board members are going to renewed: Richard Goblet d'Alviella, Jean Laurent and Beno&#xEE;t Potier, which are contributing very well to the board. And we'll have three people which are going to be proposed to join the board to the AGM. Jacques-Antoine Granjon, is the founder of vente-privee.com, very much of an entrepreneur who is going to bring us this dimension, Mouna Sepehri has a legal background and is Franco-Iranian, working in Renault and is going to join us, and Virginia Stallings is somebody working in research on the Dairy side in the U.S. and, again, he is going to be bringing some diversity and, in particular, some expertise on the scientific side. So, all these are going to be proposed to the next AGM.</p>
          <p>So, this is it for 2011. I'll drink again. Thank you. For 2012, a few words. One word of context, when we look at the environment, you know that in the past three years, we've not been very optimistic and, unfortunately, reality has rather matched our fears. When we look at 2012, we see no reason to become suddenly more optimistic. And, therefore, when building the course of action and projections for next year, we basically assume that the environment in 2010 is going to remain, as Franck said, in line with what we have seen during the second half of 2011, neither worse nor better. We assume that European consumption will remain under pressure and will neither improve nor collapse, but rather is going to remain soft as we have seen it.</p>
          <p>We assume with respect to commodities that the stabilization which we have seen in the second part of the year in the very end, in fact, of 2011 is going to remain in place and, therefore, that's going to mean that we enter into 2012 with an embarked inflation which is around mid-single digits. So that's what we assume for next year for 2012. Not necessarily very sexy. This being said, we have many reasons to be optimistic. This is a slide which is extremely important because it gives you some flavors of why we feel good at Danone. We feel good because we are in the right sector. Food is clearly a sector which is a resilient one when economic conditions are difficult, which is the case, and we believe is going to remain the case.</p>
          <p>Within food, we are in the right categories. This is, obviously, particularly the case of Baby and Medical. And you have seen their resilience in the past four years. But that's also true for Dairy and Water, which remain fast-growing categories within food. We have the right geographies. 51% of our sales are in emerging markets and the level of profitability in these markets is progressively joining the level of profitability of the group.</p>
          <p>I don't believe there is any other player in the food sector which offers an exposure to emerging market and the quality of platform which is as good as ours, and, therefore, offering such a potential for profitable growth. Our cash generation is a real asset. It is giving us strength to navigate in the current environment and it goes together with what is, we believe, a very sound balance sheet. And last, what you have at the center, which is definitely one of the very strong elements of Danone, a lean organization. Because we are lean, each part of the organization is focused at delivering the mission of the group and that's creating the value and we are as well very mobile.</p>
          <p>So, a lot of reasons to be optimistic and it means that the priorities we have been having in 2011 are going to remain the same in 2012. This is: developing our categories and leverage our engines, in particular, of the MICRUBs, Mexico, Indonesia, China, Russia, U.S., Brazil, invest behind our brands, innovate, maintain and grow our competitive edge everywhere, everywhere, keep managing inflation, and responding food productivity and competitive pricing in the same way we've done it this year and do all the above in a sustainable manner so that we maintain our capacity to keep delivering year after year.</p>
          <p>Now, if I take that from a financial standpoint taking into account the assumptions I've described, we take for 2012, taking into account the priorities, our objective for 2012 will be the following: on the top-line first, we believe the current state of our business is consistent with targeting and organic top-line growth for the year of 5% to 7%. And, in fact, Waters will of course have a challenging basis of comparison especially in Q2 and Q4, but despite that, we think we have to target 5% to 7%.</p>
          <p>The margin, we basically want to maintain it stable on a like-for-like basis. We believe the existing difficult consumption context in Europe, as well as the potential of our business in the emerging markets is going to require that we have a good level of support of our brands, and we think it is important that we avoid any compromise if we want to keep delivering and building. So, we'll target a stable margin on a like-for-like basis. And the last is cash flow. You've seen that once again that's been one of the strong elements of this year. We expect to continue and to keep progressing and deliver next year a &#x20AC;2 billion free cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>That's what I wanted to tell you on the financial side. And we'll now be ready to take questions if there is any. I'm sure there will be, Franck and myself. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So we will start with three questions <mark type="inaudible" /> (1:19:04).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning. Pierre Tegner from Natixis. I have two or three questions. The first one is relative to what was saying Mr. Riboud on the way you will manage the year in term of margin and in term of growth. The point is that regarding the difference negative factors you are facing in term of margin assuming rising input costs. In front of this, you have further price increases savings, you have the operating leverage from volume and so, technically, the margin context is not so huge for you.</p>
          <p>And so my question is that could you little bit go more deeper in the way you will invest this <mark type="ph" /> matelas (1:20:26) in term of margin you have coming from price increases, savings, operating leverage and volumes? And the second question is are there specific factors we are not taking into account from now? I am referring to U.S. with the Greek yogurt and investments you need to put on the table. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on France. We understand that you are quite aggressive. Could you share with us the performance you had during the full year and during the Q4, specifically in Dairy and in the Water business? And the third question is concerning the points that Pierre-Andr&#xE9; said concerning the dividend payment. You insisted on the fact that you will pay the dividend only in cash. What's the mindset behind that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer first on what you called our aggressivity in France. It's the question for us is not to be aggressive. The question is how could we leverage as best as we can the emerging country. That's the reason why &#x2013; talking in term of top line. So, that's the reason why France and Spain, because it's exactly the same equation, we decide &#x2013; when we did the reset in 2008, end of 2008, to really take care of our brand and to be sure that we are not going to ask the consumer to pay for the raw material price increase.</p>
          <p>So for us, that was not aggressive. That was just the how to reset the position &#x2013; the price positioning of our brand which give us now the opportunity to grow up again with mix product. For example, in the Water division in France, we really have as a strategy, we want to improve margin by changing the mix and rollouting what we are doing in the other country with the Aquadrinks.</p>
          <p>If I look at the different businesses, all of them are growing except one, which is less resilient, which is weaning food, the jars building up, because in a crisis you can switch to adult food if you don't have the money to pay for the weaning food.</p>
          <p>So if I look at next year, I think we will be to answer &#x2013; there is something you don't know. I think we will be aggressive on these specific businesses, the jar business, to relaunch it and to make it more competitive. Otherwise all the businesses are growing and growing. And in Spain, we grew also in all our businesses except the Water business, mainly due to Mercadona situation, which is start to be fixed now by specific SKUs we released in Mercadona.</p>
          <p>So, again, France, and I am rearranging your question, you &#x2013; if you &#x2013; you don't have to look at Danone through the French situation. Even as ourselves, we are no more looking at Danone through the French situation. France is 10%; it's very important, but it's 10%. And we try even to change the mindset of our manager, for example, in term of innovation. The last 15 years, we were always thinking about innovation for France and Spain. Now we are thinking innovation from China, Indonesia, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, Argentina, and if something is doing well, the funny thing is, we rollout in the major country, but the leading country for the group is no more the major one.</p>
          <p>Even in term of margin, as you can see, and that's the goal for us to really transform the company as in international one having a very, very strong position in what we called the emerging country, even if &#x2013; if I want to be negative, I'm sure that if there is a real good &#x2013; real strong trouble in Europe, you will see also a slowdown in the emerging country. But as we tried to explain, we take the decision to manage the company this way. If you look at the guidance, we decide to &#x2013; first of all, the question for us was not to say, do we do 5% to 7% stable margin? The first question was, do we give guidance or not?</p>
          <p>But because the knowledge we have about our businesses and the way we look at the environment and the background we have, which is the most important thing in the actual condition if you want to look at the future, you really have to look how you deal in the past with the context. And because of that, we said, okay, 5% to 7% stable and free cash, because I think looking to companies we are also to go back to the basic and look at the balance sheet and how do we generate cash because that will be very important in the future.</p>
          <p>So, France, we are aggressive, but it's for us, very important to stabilize. And if I look out for the future, the real question is, how are we going to continue to improve the margin in the emerging country? But when you look at where we are, the level of volume we achieved, as I said, since now ten years, I'm convinced that will be easier for a company like us to improve margin by achieving new level of volume in the emerging country than for some other to improve their margin in Europe, because they are already very, very high in the emerging country.</p>
          <p>I think the leverage is much more easier starting the emerging country. Perhaps we are lucky, but it's like this &#x2013; it is like this, we are very, very young in the emerging country. So, I'm totally convinced that we still have a huge potential, except that we need to invest, we need to continue to build. And it's clear we don't want to have pressure on the margin because the visibility we have on the raw materials is not very clear. We suppose we will have a slowdown or, let's say as Pierre-Andr&#xE9; said, a mid-single digit, low-mid single digit, but honestly, we don't know. We will see. If it is better, that margin will go up.</p>
          <p>But as we always said with guidance, except the huge risk which is a collapse of Europe, we don't think honestly, but the rest of the risk, we take it. That's the reason, why we include everything in the different guidance. And you know the reaction of the board of Danone yesterday was, oh, stable is already very, very ambitious as a target. So we &#x2013; the first thing we have to do is to really explain to the board how confident we are country-by-country, business-by-business. But the track record is there, so I think we can disclose that. But we have no reason to go further, to put more pressure on the different teams of Danone. I'm sorry because I'm rearranging your question.</p>

          <p>Just &#x2013; on the last part, I didn't mean anything specifically, just part of the information, we pay the dividend and we pay it in cash and that's basically what we have done last year as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and the first question I think you commented, I mean, when managing 2012, I think most of the elements have been given by Franck. What you have to maybe have in mind is that we'll be going on in 2012 with embarked inflation in single-digit. We'll be going on as well with embarked pricing. We have no plan at the moment of significant price increase in addition to what we have already done is 2011. But, of course, we will keep managing the year with the same mindset, which is selective pricing and competitive pricing in fact. Sorry, Xavier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Xavier Croquez, Cheuvreux, sorry. I'd like to talk about basis points we all like, which is basis points of market share gains. We normally have a little bit more at this stage in the presentations in terms of market share. Can you give us a bit of a review on Dairy and Baby Food to start with, in terms of market share in big regions?</p>
          <p>And the second point is I think that in the presentation you said that in CIS sales were flat. On slide 40, when I do the average of the four quarters of Unimilk, I get to around 4%. So I'd like to get a sense of how I square all this. If Unimilk is up 4%, CIS is flat, what is down? Is it Baby Food, is it Dairy? Am I missing something, is it Ukraine? Any answers would help. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I will not go through all the countries in term of market share. But as an average and globally speaking, we gained market share in every country where we are. Obviously, we have some exception where we go down.</p>
          <p>The good news is, I'm sure because you check that every month, the U.S. because I think for the first time the Dannon brand will be stronger than the Yoplait brand for a very simple reason, Yoplait has totally missed launch of their Greek, so they are really out of the segment. And which is very important for us, because as perhaps you don't know, but the relation between the trade and the industry in the U.S. is really driven by what we call or what they called category advisor, or category captain in Europe, they called it category advisor. And we are not. Yoplait is a category advisor.</p>
          <p>Chobani become a category advisor because they are strong, but in one segment. So becoming the leading brand without Stonyfield and just Dannon, we have the right expectation to become category advisor in most of the U.S. retailers, which is very important as Europe, and it's difficult to understand, but in the U.S., everything is going to be decided by the category advisor. And we are already category advisor with &#x2013; I think it's Safeway in the South of the U.S. And, obviously, the target is Walmart for us. And now you understand also why we develop private label tactically with Walmart in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The other reason is the U.S. market is based on single cup. And I went to <mark type="ph" /> Bartonville (1:32:20) a few weeks ago to discuss with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:32:12) about the market, but not the market as a very sophisticated discussion. The shelf. The first thing we have to deal within the U.S. is the size of the shelf and the organization of the shelf. With the organization there is right now in the U.S., we will not develop the category. And we have the example with the Greek. The Greek is not developing the category. So, Greek is cannibalizing everything. Tomorrow will be something else, I don't know.</p>
          <p>The good thing with the Greek is new a technology is arriving in the U.S., the cheese technology, which was not existing. Which means that for example, for a product like Danimals, we can really improve the quality because we can use now the cheese process we are putting in place in our factories. We didn't have. That was another process than the European one. The second good thing is that the instance of consumption and the development of the indulgent product are really growing and, because of this, I think we will find a way to extend the shelf.</p>
          <p>The issue is how to switch from a single cup to a pack. Until you replace the category advisor, that will not change, because they don't have the facilities to deliver pack. So, that's what we explain and that's the reason why we are gaining market share. And don't forget that within the market share, you don't have Walmart. They are not taking into account the figures we have in Walmart. And because of lack of capacity on our Oikos product, we are really focused on Walmart. Having more and more capacity, we will extend and we will launch and get distribution or listing in other retailers. So, that's for the U.S.</p>
          <p>The second country is obviously Russia. Russia will come, because, again, that was very transparent. We said we want to refurbish the margin that was not zero that was minus something. And now it's positive and really positive. And as we said, the target is ex-Danone plus Unimilk going back around 10% and 11% by two or three years, which was the situation of Danone before Unimilk.</p>
          <p>But with the big platform that we will really develop, and it's important also because that will help us to be aggressive, as you said, in the rest of Europe. That's all. Market share in Russia is not an issue for us for the time being, and I said that from the beginning. That's the reason why we just fired more than two-third of the SKUs.</p>
          <p>Now, if I look at to &#x2013; Prostokvashino...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Prostokvashino.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... Prostokvashino, very nice, better than me in Russian, we grew again volume and value. So, now we have the right platform. So I think we have to look at what will be the end, the last quarter or perhaps second part of the year, which is going to be the real illustration of what will be the future of Russia. And in Russia, the price of milk and what we are doing with Ukraine ibeside n term of milk price is really giving us a competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>In the same time, we have a competitor called Wimm-Bill-Dann, who just basically cut everything on the last quarter because they need basis point. So, the aggressivity is not exactly the same than at the beginning. So, we feel that not a new strategy but a different one, which was exactly what we were expecting.</p>
          <p>So, in Baby Food we are still growing in China, but we will have a big launch at the end of the year in super premium category in China to fight against an American company, because you need the super premium. As I said, we launched also an affordable one because we are convinced that in the future China, and when I'm saying China I'm talking about, let's say, the central people deciding in China, they will not continue to accept for ten years that kind of growth with very high expensive product. They need a product more affordable for the country. That's the reason why we continue to support an affordable product, building the right brand in that segment, price segment. But in the same time, we will play the mix again by launching a super-super premium in China end of the year 2012, 2013 to gain market share.</p>
          <p>Indonesia, we continue to gain market share. Mexico, too, Argentina too. How to do that in beverage, because you have to understand the strategy we have behind the Aquadrinks. Aquadrinks is not just small bottle you just drink on-the-go. The main business is for us is a very high level of sugar beverage you have. I mention nothing but you know perfectly what I am talking about.</p>
          <p>And within this category, the lunch, not only on-the-go. So you will see development of small bottles for on-the-go with a very specific strategy and for the away from home business. But you will see also a clear strategy attacking the lunch or dinner, the meals, because our products are definitively less sugar than the other one. And we know that there is an expectation, on this instant, of consumption. So market share will progress not only with innovation or prices or whatever, but also because we are going to develop new means of distribution.</p>
          <p>If you'll take the drive &#x2013; what we called the drive in France, it's clearly something we are focused on, because the retailers in France, and it's a very French situation, are really growing when they have success in the drives channel, that means you order on the Net, you go with your car and they put everything in your trunk. And we try to be very strong. And it's a good news for us because brands are very important in that kind of way of buying product more than private label. And that's another reason to control the price, too. So <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:39:02) develop things everywhere.</p>
          <p>We'll now take two questions on the phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>We take a question from Warren Ackerman with Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Warren Ackerman here with Soc. Gen. I hope you can hear me. I've got three questions, the first one for Franck. Franck, how much potential do you think there is for Greek outside of the U.S.? I hear that Chobani is launching in Australia. You're thinking about Greek in France. I mean, could Oikos to be rolled in other markets? How much extra capacity is coming on from June? And do you think other markets could boom like the U.S.? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on Souvenaid, very interested in your comments on Souvenaid. I was just wondering whether you could tell us about the results of the trials and how you intend to roll out. How big is the addressable market? And would you consider working with a pharma company?</p>
          <p>And then finally, a question for Pierre-Andr&#xE9;. Looking at 2012, could you discuss some of the elements below the line, interest, tax, associates, minorities? It seems to me to be a lot of moving parts and I think some guidance would be very helpful. Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I will answer to the &#x2013; about the Greek. First of all, we already have a huge success in Spain with Greek. We tried to launch the same recipe in France four, five years ago. That was not a success. Very indulgent segment, very small volume, 4,000 tons, something like this, which is &#x2013; 4,000 tons, which is nothing for us. So we tested another product, we re-launched the one. You have to be careful about the success about Greek in the U.S. because Greek in the U.S. is not Greek like in Europe.</p>
          <p>As I tried to explain, the main success of Greek in the U.S. is due to the protein diets, means it's a diet product, it's not an indulgent product. It's a better product, but more than 80% of the Greek in the U.S. is low fat. So, if you ask me if I like it, yes, it's much more better than the classic yogurt in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The second reason of the success in the U.S., which is a success for the segment, which is not a success for the category because the category in value is not growing even with the price of the Greek in the U.S. It's a question of cannibalization. Activia resists, but some other products, look at the market share of Yoplait, really declining very strongly because it's a question of cannibalization. The question for us is and that's the country where we have to really build the category.</p>
          <p>Because if you ask the consumer in the U.S. they don't know why they eat the yogurt, they don't know when they have to eat the yogurt, they don't know who has to eat the yogurt. So we have to build everything, except that when they trust in something, you have a success. And look at the market in the past, everything was clear. After that you had the low fat, after that you have Go-Gurt from Yoplait, the things you suck. After that you have Danimals and you have &#x2013; you have, we are not in the U.S. so I can make mistake, you have even Activia, so the consumer is just looking for something new.</p>
          <p>And the real question for us was, do we have to invest? Is it too early, is it too late? Is it going to just collapse as many new products in the U.S.? But when you look at the size of the segment, we were more secure to invest and, as I said, we invest not only for the Greek, we invest because it's a new process, it's a new industrial process. I'm just a little bit en col&#xE8;re because normally we have to preempt all of these but we were focusing an Activia. So we have to now to catch up the situation.</p>
          <p>The volume we will have &#x2013; the capacity will be put in place by June. I can &#x2013; we can already say that that will be not enough to really follow the growth. But I think we have other project and other project in other categories, so we will leverage the success of the Greek. Thanks to Chobani, to really build the category, but build the category means reorganize the shelf and reorganize the consumer proposition.</p>
          <p>Now about Souvenaid. No, I will not comment more because we don't want to over sell Souvenaid. It's true that if we really achieve everything, it's going to be a jackpot. It's clear. But I don't want to see you thinking we will have a jackpot. It's tough. It's difficult. It's very serious. There is a real process, a real scientific process. So we must have the right medical survey and it's not a Danone medical survey, I have nothing against, but it's really driven by Nutricia, which is definitively closer to the medical community than us, so we let them drive this process.</p>
          <p>And the idea is we must get published in one or two very well-known, let's say, newspaper or scientific newspaper which are the foundation for that kind of product. We don't want to play a stupid game over-selling the product or the benefit. This product will not put away the disease. This product, if you diagnose it very early the disease, that will help you to really push back the impact and the effect. So, we are not a pharmaceutical company, we are not a medical company.</p>
          <p>Something we have to take care because of internet, when you ask us about launching the product, you can't say with that kind of product if we decide to launch, if we have all the green light to launch it, you can't say, I launch it in Luxembourg or in Belgium or in a small country somewhere to test, because very quickly the buzz will go out and people will order the products through internet or by friends, their friends in Belgium if we decide to launch it in Belgium or Holland, which could be natural for us. So we really want to secure every, every single issues we can have with the product.</p>
          <p>So it's too early to say. We wait, and more and more we decide to speak now because we have these good results through the second medical survey, but we have a long, long road before just launching the product on a worldwide basis. Because even if you launch in a very small country, that will be a worldwide impact. So, we don't want to see everybody dreaming, but I think it's fair to come back with a product because we have a good result. But it's a very long timetable and we have to go further in the right direction before disclosing everything. There was another question.</p>

          <p>I'll take the last one about what you call below the line. So essentially, you have to think about financial charges and associates providing some uplift or some contribution to the EPS growth. Financial charges because of cash generation and associates because we have been having a series of exceptional negative events in 2011 which we don't expect to reproduce in 2012, talking of the earthquake and the various revolution in the Arabic countries.</p>
          <p>Minorities, we expect them to keep growing above the pace of growth of the sales because Unimilk will contribute significantly to the increase of profit of the group. And we keep expecting taxes increasing and being between 26% and 27% in terms of effective tax rate. If you blend all that with the top-line guidance and margin guidance, I would say that on the current level of currency, our current EPS expectations are quite close to consensus.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, can I just come back on one thing? Just going back to the Greek question. I mean, obviously everybody is adding capacity in Greek. You are, Chobani is, General Mills is talking about increasing capacity significantly. I was just wondering how much industry extra capacity is going to be coming on in the next 12 months? And is that a risk that so much extra capacity is coming on, do you kind the need the Greek segment to increase from 25% of the market to 30% or 35% to justify all that extra capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's like all the growing market, everybody is running after capacity. As you know, we start the Greek Oikos both side for Stonyfield Organic and the Dannon, outsourcing our capacity. So, now we install capacity within our company. We don't go too fast, because we know that if we stop to use the sub-contractor we have, capacity will go to somebody else. So, we have also to control the real capacity we need, not giving capacity to somebody else. So it's a &#x2013; it's a tactical game also.</p>
          <p>Having said that, you will not have four, five, six success of Greek in the U.S. The idea is for us, you will have one or two successful brand, and perhaps a third one really smaller than the other. So, I'm afraid that people just starting to invest to get capacity are a little bit late. And the story will switch to something else within few months.</p>
          <p>So, having said that, as I said, the decision for us in terms of CapEx, which are quite important, was not just based on Greek, but, again, being the worldwide number one in Fresh Dairy, we know that having a new technology in the U.S. means a new taste, means new recipe, means new product, but we don't have to invent them. We have them. We have the portfolio already, except that that was impossible for us to produce in the U.S. because we don't have the technology, what I call the cheese technology. To understand, cheese technology is different from yogurt technology. Cheese technology is more based on the protein, which is the thing which is fitting with the diet in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So, somebody will &#x2013; you are right, I think somebody, I can tell you something about the Greek market, which is a very premium market in the U.S. And because of this capacity, you'll start to see pricing going down. Is it a good news or bad news? Short-term, it's a bad news for the margin. For people like us having some other products, to see the leading brand, having spent a lot of money in capacity, starting to reduce the price, is a good news in term of competitiveness.</p>
          <p>So we'll see within the next few four, five years. But it's very classical, except that when you have invest a lot of money, and you have a single line of product called Greek, that will be more difficult to compete in term of price. So no, I think, I was really angry about the situation few months ago. I start to smile again about our situation in the U.S. And anyway, in the U.S., you have to grab any fashionable products, any of them. It's an emerging country in term of yogurt consumption.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the Polly Barclay with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Polly Barclay from JPMorgan. I hope you can hear me okay. I have two questions, please. First of all, just in terms of Unimilk, perhaps you could give us a little bit more detail on the expectations for this year in terms of both the growth acceleration and also the profitability improvement? When should we start to see this through and what sort of magnitude? And perhaps you could then put that into context of the guidance of a stable margin, because surely we should see quite a significant profitability uplift in Unimilk coming through this year?</p>
          <p>And then my second question goes back to something Franck said right at the beginning of the conference call on the &#x20AC;2 billion of free cash flow that you're on track to deliver and his comment that you were now preparing the next steps for the company. I wondered if you could just expand on that and on the use of cash specifically? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I've not heard the second, I mean, what you explained, the second point the same way you heard. &#x20AC;2 billion is important. You know the use we make of our cash, it's pretty well explained, I think, and consistent. It's about cash generation net of a high level of CapEx, we have a level of payout of dividend which is 45% to 50% of earnings, 48% this year, in cash.</p>
          <p>We then have opportunities of acquisition and possible disposals, which are definitely not regular from one year to the other, and everybody knows what the opportunities are in our case. But I won't comment further. And then depending on the result of all these factors, we basically use share buyback to adjust the financial structure of the group and basically to maintain the credit level at the same &#x2013; at a constant level, which is consistent with the current rating of the group, which is a minus AAA on the two agencies.</p>
          <p>So that's being what I was telling you last year, it's what I am telling you today and it's definitely, I mean, we'll definitely keep managing the cash flow distribution and allocation of the group the same way, which is this way.</p>
          <p>On Unimilk, I think you have to refer somehow to the &#x2013; what we said or what we gave you as a vision in terms of potential at the time we made the acquisition. At that time we said we believed Unimilk had the capacity &#x2013; Danone-Unimilk had the capacity to grow double-digits, even 15%. We said as well that our goal was to have the margins of the combined entity to progress and to go back to the margins of Danone Russia pre-merger by within the coming four years or five years.</p>
          <p>And we're basically still in the same &#x2013; with the same objective. It's clear that the events of last summers or summer 2010 have been rendering the equation a bit more chaotic for while. It has changed our priorities. It has led us to focus more on the margins to reestablish diameters, led us to focus more on the integration or do the integration faster than what we expected initially, but it has not changed our fundamental vision.</p>
          <p>So, when you think about what we are targeting or hoping or expecting from Unimilk, it's basically very much in line with that. This being said, sorry &#x2013; on the margin side, it means that we definitely want to keep increase the margins, or think there is potential to increase the margins in this country on the back of cost synergies, on the back of top-line synergies, on the back of mix and productivity.</p>
          <p>On the top line, it's obvious that if you want to build something which is sustainable, you have to go from zero or negative to double-digit by stages. And this is why I've been using the word gradual acceleration of Unimilk starting from the beginning of 2012. We'll come back to you with some first reports of progress I hope in Q1. Don't expect, of course, sales to be growing by 10%. It will take time because we just want to do things in the proper manner, brand after brand and to build something which is solid. But we definitely think it's going to be progressively showing progress and gradually accelerating.</p>
          <p>About your point on margin, which is basically, to make it simple, you will generate margin improvement in Unimilk, why don't you have that staying at the group? Again, I have to step back and come to what Franck mentioned, this is what we said about margin is that we believe in the current environment, which we view as similar as the second half of this year with the current level of raw material, with the current need of &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; with the current context. We absolutely need to keep the flexibility to be supporting all of our brands, and to do so not only in emerging markets, not only in MICRUBs, not only new markets, not only in Europe, but everywhere.</p>
          <p>We think it is absolutely important at this stage of the economic context, at this stage of the construction of the group that we keep the ability to do so. And this is why we want to have to retain the margins stable, to retain the margin stable, I repeat, to have this flexibility to make sure that we'll keep doing the good job which we have done this year, i.e., to have a very good performance in emerging markets but also a very resilient performance in Western Europe because that is building a group which is very strong and very balanced.</p>
