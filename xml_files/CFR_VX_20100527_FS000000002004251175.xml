          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning also and welcome to those of you who join on the webcast. Before you ask what the heck is he still doing here, first of all, Mr. Rupert couldn't be here today &#x2013; he has other important business to intend which has nothing to do with Richemont. Secondly, I wanted to be living proof that there is a life after 55 for the Greek friends and after 60 for the French friends. And on a more serious note, of course this year has been still under my leadership and so has been the budget process. So I will lead you through some of the overviews and then of course Richard and Gary will continue. This you don't need...</p>
          <p>This was of course a rollercoaster year. Prior to your friends from Lehman we thought the sky is the limit, and after Lehman for a little while we thought, with asterisks, that the sky will fall on us and we are all pretty much dead. So I don't want to lecture you on things you know as well or better than me, but, of course, the feel good factor was really deteriorating as the demand for luxury goods was falling very severely, particularly in the United States. Our friends in the States know only two states of mind &#x2013; totally euphoric or totally depressed, and we will come back to this later.</p>
          <p>Even in Asia Pacific, for a while sales slowed down. But it was really a little while. I was in April in Hong Kong talking to some of the major property developers, and when I talked about something like a crisis, they said, "Norbert, come on, give me a break. What crisis?" Because, of course, I still wanted to see whether we could somewhere press down rents, but to these guys the crisis was like, I don't know, five weeks or something like this.</p>
          <p>No doubt that uncertainty and problems remain. We all look presently to the newspapers and to the media in general and see only the bad things. You guys on the other side of the casino speculate on &#x2013; or against the euro. To me, as a German, euro at 1.21 or 1.20 is very nice; we will have a hell of a lot of export. The Airbus industry, which is a French/German corporation, like almost this management was for the last five and a half years, is probably totally excited about the currency. And we all must not forget that when the currency started, the euro, it was around that, it was around 1.20, even less when it started, so...</p>
          <p>What of course is not good is the speed in which right now the euro seems to fall that is creating fear in Europe, specifically of course in Germany where people have been almost all the time very aware of the hyper-inflation Germany suffered during the Weimar Republic, and the saving rates in Germany, I just read yesterday, is going back to the highest in 17 years. For us that is not good news.</p>
          <p>Prices of gemstones and precious metals have been rising, not maybe so much a fear of inflation, but a fear of the future. I think we are over the hill where people bought physical gold and stored it in their backyard or in the safe or whatever. But we are of course a company which uses gemstones and gold and precious metal, and for while again you had a total rollercoaster. Prior to Lehman we couldn't buy gemstones; there were just not enough on the market &#x2013; and I mean big stones. And after it the prices dropped. Meanwhile they have stabilized of course and they have gone up again.</p>
          <p>We all discuss, and Mr. Rupert would now probably go about whether there is an inflation or a deflation coming, again, I don't want to lecture you on macroeconomics, but we all don't know quite yet how the world will get out and manage the macroeconomics to avoid an inflation of bigger than 5%. And, again, to the German 3% is already bad, to the Italians 10% is not too bad, to the French I don't know.</p>
          <p>So this will be interesting times ahead until the world has managed the present circumstances. And again now Europe starts seriously to look at their deficits. As they do this, Germany announced a cut of 40 billion in costs. We all worry about that this could slow down the economy. So interesting times.</p>
          <p>Recovery or a rebound of this is still lot quite clear, and I guess Richemont will continue to manage in a prudent way as we have built the budget. We hope for that the rollercoaster will now no more be down, but it's going up steep, and there are many signs, but there are also many insecurities in the market.</p>
          <p>I think when we started last year &#x2013; or after Lehman, nobody in the world knew where the business would shrink 10% 20, 50, and you have to see that the circumstances when you look at our results, and specifically also I think the uncertainty which started after Lehmans. And based on this, I think we have proven that we have the business under control. The company is well structured. We have stricter cost control. We have clearer lines of communication and responsibility. We have been able to convince the brands that reducing CapEx, at least for a while, is the right thing to do.</p>
          <p>The brands, and you know that we give the brands a lot of autonomy in running their unique businesses, and for that reason, again, Richemont is big group, but actually it's a small group with 18 different brands &#x2013; or now 19 if you think of NET-A-PORTER.</p>
          <p>We looked at the business without even jeopardizing our strategy through the rough times. Of course, we had lot of discussions with the brands to focus on creativity, and when I say focus on quality and service that's anyway paramount &#x2013; without good quality and good service you cannot survive in the luxury industry even in good times.</p>
          <p>We maintained our high-end positioning. We did not waiver to get too panicky and did resist reducing prices, and we have our equity of the Maisons is intact, maybe even more stronger than ever. As the brands although focus and concentrate on iconic products, and especially in times of insecurity iconic products are a big asset because you can tell the customer this is a product which lasts, it's for the next generation, don't worry about it, the prices will not go down, they will over time go up &#x2013; that's at least true for the hard goods products of parents in the group.</p>
          <p>We started to be very rigid on production control. We wanted absolutely to reduce oversupplies which only lead to trouble in the marketplace even though we continued of course in the investments in vertical integration &#x2013; I come to that later &#x2013; and in staff retention.</p>
          <p>There has been a lot of talk about Richemont reducing staff. We have not. We had structural problems in Roger Dubuis, yes, we had to cut people. And of course, to a limited extent, we had to cut some people in the component manufacturing which was of course hit very hard and much harder than the brands themselves. But looking at the 20,000 people which Richemont employed, we reduced not even 1.5%.</p>
          <p>We have throughout the year introduced stern measures which the brands didn't like: no replacement except if Platt approves it. You don't get too popular with this, but it helped getting through rough times. And, of course, no new hiring unless Platt approves it. It was kind of a very interesting period of time because I got the stacks of paper in that process.</p>
          <p>Now again with the new budget in place of course there is no more hiring freeze. On the opposite, in some of our manufacturing brands we have already shortages in standard products &#x2013; and I'm talking watches mainly. Shortages in standard products in the base business, so to say, okay? If you talk about the base business in Jaeger-LeCoultre then you are talking about the good, old reversal.</p>
          <p>We have continued to invest in what many people think is an SAP project. It's not an SAP project, it's a systems alignment project. Six years ago the group had I don't know how many warehouses, every brand has its own warehouse. Just to start with this we will middle of this year start our own logistics; that means one warehouse in Fribourg for the whole group &#x2013; except for the fashion business &#x2013; I'm talking mainly watches of course. And we will introduce the Gemini, i.e. the SAP project in France and Spain, which is a major step forward to have integrated processes for the group not only in America where we started, but now in Europe. And I think that some of the efforts you have seen in controlling inventories, specifically at Cartier, was to a great part fully integrated with this information from the boutique to the component manufacturer, is a result of this new discipline and information advantage.</p>
          <p>As you can imagine that with a dozen of hard goods brands, they all think their business is different and they cannot use a standard process. Mr. Rupert and myself have agreed that I will stay Chairman of the Steering Committee because you need a little bit of German dictatorship to continue running this project in one direction and not fizzle it up too much, again, even so if I am 63 already for the Greek guys, okay?</p>
          <p>We have increased the selectivity of our wholesale distribution and we have continued, maybe even increased, the amount of terminations of relationships with unsatisfactory point of sale in wholesale.</p>
          <p>If everything else is in good order, products, the customer wants; quality, which is undisputable; service in your boutiques which is first class &#x2013; and all this is of course a working side, it will never end, then the quality of your wholesale distribution makes the difference. Richemont, being in the watch business, will always have wholesale distribution. We truly believe that we need this to compete with the other watch brands and not only have them in a retail environment. But we will continue to build retail stores also for the watch business, and as we do this, we will reduce the wholesale partners and we have created this slogan which I like very much: less partner for more partnership.</p>
          <p>We have upgraded our retail network. That is even under normal circumstances of course a continuous process, but we have speeded it up specifically, also taken out some unprofitable although strategically not forward-looking stores in the States and elsewhere. At the same time we have opened stores in growth markets, mainly of course in Asia, China, Hong Kong, and some of our best performing stores today are now more in Europe, they are in Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>Therefore, logically, the focus remains and I will believe of the upside potential of the future. And the future, at least for the time being, lies principally in Asia Pacific &#x2013; and in Asia Pacific and in Asia Pacific. That doesn't mean that all the other markets we have to neglect; that would be rather stupid and shortsighted. I will come back to this later on, but it's obviously that this group has a very strong base in Europe and it sells basically the concept of European craftsmanship, and therefore having and maintaining a strong base in Europe is of course paramount. But growth is easier to get today in Asia.</p>
          <p>Well, you have seen of course this figures already. We have the limited decline in sales to 4%. Operation profits and operation margins were contained to &#x20AC;830 million and 16% of sales. Net profit from continued operations proved to be very resilient, it ended 18% down to &#x20AC;603 million. I mentioned it before, I am very pleased to report that cash flow from operations was &#x20AC;1.46 million (sic) [billion] , and therefore has nearly doubled.</p>
          <p>And when we started into this year, my Chairman, our Chairman was very afraid that we couldn't manage that and he still reminded me that in '94 we had to pay dividends out of borrowed money. And he said, "Norbert Platt, make sure with your guys you understand the concept of cash creation in troubled times." I think our people, our Maisons, the management, the logistic people, the production people have done a hell of a job to create cash flow, and therefore net cash today stands at &#x20AC;1.9 million (sic) [billion]  &#x2013; that was prior to the acquisition of NET-A-PORTER.</p>
          <p>Very nice picture... Of course, as I said before, a year of contrast, and I'm showing you this graph only to make sure you understand of course that as we go in a new year, in the year '11, the first half-year probably will be very good because we have comparatives which you can see on the chart on the right side in quarter 1 and 2 and we will of course have strong growth. Richard will tell you afterwards in some detail that April was up 24% against last year. But then the second half, which, of course &#x2013; sorry, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know can you hear me, because I lost this thing here? You can? No, it's okay. The second half, and you know that quarter 4 is the critical Christmas period; even though now as the world has obviously changed a bit and we have to look more also to Chinese New Year and the events in the Far East which is normally quarter 4, it will be not as easy to beat the relatively good performance of the second half.</p>
          <p>So what you will see, again, to make it very simple, very good figures in the first half &#x2013; we are very confident about this, and then in the second half we have to work hard to beat the figures of last year.</p>
          <p>I will give you an overview over the regions. Europe, as I said before, Europe is still the market where luxury brands have been created, where they have their home and where they have to be strong to be competent and authentic. It's our number one region with 40% of sales. Of course they have seen sales in Western Europe decline by 11%, which means that we ended just above fiscal level '07. But the beginning of the year was difficult, having sales down 21%, and then of course in the second half it recovered. It will be interesting to see what will happen in Europe now if the euro stays as weak. Of course, that will boost tourists coming to Paris and to Milano and to London and wherever to buy.</p>
          <p>Our business with the Middle East and Russia is important, but Middle East accounts for 6% of group sales and Russia only for two-thirds, still relatively small compared. Both markets were up in sales; for the full year, they had their problems.</p>
          <p>In the first half we all know that look at the crisis in Dubai, look at the oil rollercoaster which of course affects the Middle East. The bigger budget disciplines now in Abu Dhabi, I mean, these guys start for the first time talking about budgets and maybe that will have an effect on how much they spend spontaneously on a US$5 million piece of high jewelry.</p>
          <p>Asia Pacific. I said it to my colleagues in the last year, if you want to get really, really depressed you fly to America and if you want to avoid the headshrink, you fly to the Far East. The roles couldn't have been more different, okay &#x2013; or maybe now I should say you go to NET-A-PORTER, you can see all the 25 year old kids who believe in their future and see growth which is of course from the moon in that business.</p>
          <p>So Asia Pacific, like for the rest of the luxury industry I guess and maybe for the whole Western world producing, has been our strongest pillar, our hope. We see good growth. Asia Pacific now represents 34% of group sales instead of just 27% a year ago. A brand like Piaget has boutiques which do a turnover when I first looked at the figures I couldn't believe that this is a normal size Piaget boutique. And I went there to look at it whether I maybe had signed a boutique of 500 square meters but it was still a boutique of 80 square meters and the business was just unbelievable.</p>
          <p>As I said before, the initial impact of &#x2013; obviously their recession was very short lived. The momentum has kept accelerating since August last year. And again one can say strong brands get stronger, and that you can see specifically in Asia where our star brands Cartier, Piaget, Vacheron, IWC do very well &#x2013; Montblanc does extremely well.</p>
          <p>And for the lack of a better story, when I traveled to China the first time, probably 15 years ago or maybe more &#x2013; 18 years, the only guys who were there were the Swatch Group. There was rat all over Omega, a brand of course all the other Swatch brands. And I came there as the head of Montblanc and I said, "Hmm, maybe you should do something here." Rolex, I mean, the luxury industry, they were all still sleeping.</p>
          <p>Today of course everybody is there which means the competition is getting more fierce, but those pioneers who were there first of course have gained momentum, and it's also true for Montblanc. And then you have iconic brands like Cartier or Vacheron &#x2013; once the elephants start walking, they gain speed and they gain momentum and that's what you can see today with Cartier and the brands I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>The mood, the performance in Asia is practically all over the place; it's not only contained to Mainland China. Hong Kong is an absolute booming place. We have a cluster where almost all our brands are in the Heritage compound which is close to the Peninsula and close to Canton Road, and they are today some of our best performing boutiques on the <mark type="inaudible" /> Bank.</p>
          <p>Macau of course is still big, growing, and also Taiwan, Singapore, Korea, even though to a lesser extent is our growth markets and we have strong brands which can benefit from this.</p>
          <p>Sales in Mainland China rose only 19% after 30 last year. I say 'only' with a twinkle in the eye; that's still a very good performance. And it is now the fifth largest market for the Richemont Group after Hong Kong, Japan, U.S. and France.</p>
          <p>Now, of course the rather strong yuan helps, the strong renminbi helps to boost tourism as, by the way, does the yen. And, again, if you look purely &#x2013; to just to make that point again, purely to our business, a euro at 1.20 is beautiful for Richemont. If it doesn't create too much anxieties for the people who want to buy a <mark type="inaudible" /> earring or a Montblanc pen, it's beautiful, the best thing what could happen to us. Now we have a little bit of a problem with the strong Swiss franc, which of course has an impact on our cost of sales, but that is by far not as impactful as a dollar at 1.20 &#x2013; or 1.21 this morning I think.</p>
          <p>We will continue to look at Asia as a growth region where we put our strategic investment. But as I've said before, this is a group which needs global exposure and of course we will not reduce our view on other markets. This is particularly true for America. As I've said before, the Americans know only two states of mind: depression and total euphoria. And my American friends who maybe listen to me may forgive me for that superficial analysis.</p>
          <p>America was in total panic after Lehman. By April our sales fell 52%. And of course we were in a state of surprise and when will it bottom out. At the same time, as I said, we were as surprised about the suddenness of the rebound. Euphoria and panic. At the rebound of the second half of the year, we are very sudden, sales rose by 8%, and even though it's against easy comparatives, America, I think it's no more in a state of total disbelief in itself. And, by the way, the Americans are never in a state of disbelief in itself whatever the outlook is. Open brackets &#x2013; one of the reasons why we started this very complex project systems alignment, SAP, in the States, you &#x2013; Americans can &#x2013; we can do this.</p>
          <p>So as we look at the States and try to continue to reduce our operating leverage in order to manage the volatility, and as we continue to streamline our wholesale, we do believe that America will rebound probably soon. America is a fantastic country, huge, rich. Many people we send to the States never want to come back to Europe. It's still under-penetrated in terms of luxury. It has good demographics. We have great brands and why should some of our watch brands not grow very fast and continue to grow. So never bet against the United States, that's the message.</p>
          <p>Japan. Japan is a difficult market. It's still the second biggest market for the Richemont Group, contributing 12% of sales. Sales declined in yen by 17%. In euro fortunately that was only 10% because of the strengthening of the yen.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, Japan goes through changes, changings in distribution to department stores, are no more so strongly. You have to &#x2013; that the business is more and more also going through owned retail stores. The department stores merge and merge and merge; they are busy with themselves rather than with the customer. But the client, the Japanese client of course remains a luxury buyer. And I think we have strong brands and we have to believe that we can take market share to make sure that Japan stays a very important and profitable country. Although let's not forget that Japanese tourist start to travel again &#x2013; and yen strength is in that sense good &#x2013; notably to Korea, to Hawaii and France, and therefore of course it remains an important customer.</p>
          <p>Sales by network. I've always believed and still believe and I said it before that the quality of distribution for a luxury brand is paramount, and we at the headquarter of Richemont have to negotiate with our brands the short-term for the long-term &#x2013; the long-term is less wholesale policies.</p>
          <p>Subsequently, our direct-operated stores have continued to do well under the circumstances; they proved much more resilient, their decline in the first half specifically was much less than in wholesale and the rebound in the second half was stronger.</p>
          <p>Overall sales growth, some 2%, and performance well above wholesale, and as a result, today retail for Richemont Group represents 46%. That's a very good number. It's maybe not good enough, but it shows that we are on the way for better control of our destiny in the marketplace where we have touch points with the customer.</p>
          <p>Wholesale reflects what you have seen in the Swiss export figures for the industry. A strong destocking from watch retailers until about November. And at the same time we have continued reducing the number of external doors because in times of great crisis you can identify which of the partners are not partners particularly well and we have taken those people out.</p>
          <p>Restocking has started meanwhile, on a prudent basis I guess. We have had a 6% rise in wholesale in the second quarter of the year. We see specifically in April a very good wholesale &#x2013; for the first time it was better than retail. Richard will talk about this later. And as a present state of affairs, I said it before, because our managers in the brands were focused on cash generation and have really &#x2013; we had a swing in inventories of almost 650, 630 million from plus 300 last year to minus 300 this year.</p>
          <p>We see already now &#x2013; and it's a bit like you put a <mark type="inaudible" /> on the autobahn, we see shortages in production, specifically of the standard products, because these are the things you know in a crisis you try to reduce, you try to reduce the work in progress, you try to reduce the stock because they are it's easy to &#x2013; once we go we can easy rebuild it.</p>
          <p>Fortunately now the rebound seems to be really quite strong and we are lagging a bit behind, which in a way is good for the morale in the factories because, again, we have done short work quite a bit in order to save our know-how in the group. Short work is good for preserving cash, but that's the only thing it's good for. It will reduce your efficiency tremendously. People who work short work try to work slow so that they don't need to work too much short work &#x2013; that's human nature. They are afraid of what might happen to their job in the end which, again, makes them reduce their efficiency. When you are afraid of your job and the wellbeing of your family, you can't be very effective, specifically if you do work which needs concentration and you build a watch or a fine mechanical product. So, again, short work is not a salvation, never. It helps you contain the know-how of the brands and the factories and it is not very good for margins because you still have the fixed costs. I mean, that's what you learn in already the first semester in economics I guess. Some people don't still understand it, but that's what it is.</p>
          <p>So to recap and then give the word to Richard to give you more detail. I truly believe that the group is strong, well disciplined, well organized and the responsibilities of backbone round this brands is very clear today. The multi-brand services works; we have done a lot of progress in the last years. We have iconic products which last for generations. We have good, motivated management.</p>
          <p>Last off not least, luxury products are bought either as medals for civilists, they're bought out of love or sometimes reward, in extreme cases self reward &#x2013; if the whole world is shitty  at least I buy a nice Cartier watch or a Montblanc pen or IWC watch or whatever. That will not go away anyway. Love will not go away and self-esteem and being different will not go away.</p>
          <p>This is a very strong group. It has a hell of a lot of a good long-term growth potential. It's a good story. I have worked 23 years for this group and I leave &#x2013; and I not entirely leave &#x2013; as you know, I stay still a bit at the side, and specifically, as I said, with the systems project, but I stay President of Montblanc because the company still not yet a butterfly, it's still coming from &#x2013; become a butterfly from where it is today. And when you creep you are more vulnerable before you can fly.</p>
          <p>So I am very confident that I leave the company not in a crisis but on a strong way upwards. With this I give to Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Norbert. And thank you for your comments. You make it is easy for me as a successor.</p>
          <p>Let's now revise and look at the group results. So the decline in sales and gross margin was contained by lower expenses. Other results, the IFRS operating profit decreased to &#x20AC;830 million leading to an operating margin of 16% of sales.</p>
          <p>Let's review gross margin and expenses in details. The gross margin declined to &#x20AC;3.2 billion and now represents 61.6% of sales. This decline is primarily due to the very negative impact of a lower production volume on manufacturing fixed cost and of course a stronger Swiss francs because you know that the biggest part of our watch factories are situated in Switzerland. Piaget, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Montblanc and the fashion and <mark type="inaudible" /> accessories nevertheless managed to increase their gross margin percentage for the full year.</p>
          <p>Next, net operating expenses. They declined by 4%, in line with sales. Selling and distribution cost, which represent 50% of total OpEx, was only 3%. The rise reflects primarily depreciation associated with the retail and wholesale networks given that the stores we closed were fully depreciated.</p>
          <p>Communication cost declined more than sales due to last year one-off and the increased maturity of our Maisons. Excluding the last year one-off, which I remind you is mainly related to the second SIHH, A&amp;P declined by 17%. The ratio to sales amounted to 9.8% of sales, and for fiscal '11 we anticipate this ratio to be around 11%.</p>
          <p>Administration costs were more or less flat. We intend to maintain this cost discipline even if, as we are now going to see, we are gradually gearing up for a rebound. Indeed operating costs will start to rise again as a result of store network extension and a higher investment in communication, but, again, in a disciplined manner.</p>
          <p>CapEx will increase, in particular investment as far as stores renovation is concern. Also, I would like to stress that given the improvement environment and the restocking taking place, shortages have started to accumulate within our watch Maisons. As a consequence, we have to speed up the production again, although not at a full speed yet as we prefer to see more concrete evidence of a sustainable rebound and of course we want to continue to focus on controlling the level of our inventories. All of these may wait temporarily on our performance before we can take full advantage of a rebound if it is confirm.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the results by business area. First, jewelry Maisons. Sales in this business area decreased by only 3%, a notable achievement given the environment. The very <mark type="inaudible" /> of high jewelry has not reach past record levels, but the most traditional high jewelry and more accessible bijou did very well.</p>
          <p>Watches registered much better than the market thanks to strong retail sales. Operating contribution declined to &#x20AC;742 million, however, operating margin was contained at a high level of 28%.</p>
          <p>Cartier remains an outstanding Maison with marginal decline in sales and profitability. This achievement underlines the attractiveness of product offer, a broad geographic coverage and a leading position in growth markets.</p>
          <p>Van Cleef &amp; Arpels was also resilient albeit to a lesser extent due to a proportionally higher exposure to Europe and United States of America.</p>
          <p>Next our specialist watchmakers. Sales suffered most in H1 due to wholesale but rebounded greatly in H2. Overall a very good performance with a slight sales decline contained to 6%. Piaget and Vacheron Constantin performed particularly well and were able to grow sales in this difficult period. Operating contribution declined to &#x20AC;231 million affected by slower sales of course, the stronger Swiss francs and the under-utilization of our manufacturing tools. As a result, contribution margin were down to 17% of sales.</p>
          <p>Do note that excluding two loss makers, i.e. Roger Dubuis and Baume &amp; Mercier, our specialist watchmakers would have generated a strong contribution well over 20%. We have indeed a current portfolio of eight complementary watch Maisons, all with different maturities and strong individual potential.</p>
          <p>Writing instruments. The table here present the results of Montblanc Maison exclusively. The decline in sales was contained to 6%, which is particularly encouraging given Montblanc exposure to a more aspirational clientele more sensitive to economic slowdowns as well as to the U.S.A. and Europe. The continued downsizing of its wholesale network, mostly for pens, and of its retail network &#x2013; remember that we closed about 40 stores last year for Montblanc has put, of course, further of pressure on the brand. However, this streamlining will be beneficial for its medium and long-term future.</p>
          <p>All in all, this sales performance was achieved thanks to the resilience of watch and pens, higher retail sales and the leading position in China. Contribution margin rose by 14% to &#x20AC;79 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, the other businesses area that comprise on one hand fashion and accessories and on the other hand production and watch components to third parties and to our Maisons.</p>
          <p>First is the fashion and accessories. This business was profitable from a loss of 5 million last year. So &#x20AC;36 million is therefore only due to our non-branded manufacture of watch components.</p>
          <p>In fashion and accessories the retail exposure, shorter life cycle and more accessible price points of leather products certainly explains this resilience, so did the good work carried out to reposition most of these Maisons. Lancel was particularly successful over the period. Alfred Dunhill and Lancel were very close to breakeven. Chlo&#xE9; generated a single-digit contribution margin as the bulk is back which helped bring new clients for this brand.</p>
          <p>In production, orders were down by 60%, mainly from third parties. Although the momentum is improving, we do not expect a sharp reversal of trend in this area and it will take some times to be fully efficient.</p>
          <p>I now hand you over to Gary, my old partner. For those who do not know Gary, Gary has been working for the group, even if he looks young, for more than 20 years. He was the Finance Director of Cartier in America and after he become the Chief Operating Officer of Richemont North America before becoming the Chief Operating Officer of Alfred Dunhill and finally joining us at the headquarter as Deputy Group Finance and now Group Finance Director. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. It's great to have friends like you. We were talking about concrete things in operating profit, in cash flows, and my first slide that you give me in my presentation life is all about accounting and IFRS and mark-to-market adjustments. So we'll try and get through it.</p>
          <p>Net finance costs, &#x20AC;137 million. 132 million of this relates to mark-to-market adjustments on our cash and investment portfolio. As a reminder, we hold all of our cash in euros, but we hold it in a Swiss franc entity. So monthly we have to mark-to-market these euros into Swiss francs and that incurs either a P&amp;L charge or a gain. However, upon consolidation this charge is reversed back into equity. So in effect there's a P&amp;L effect but there is no effect on equity to the group.</p>
          <p>With respect to taxes, again, a mark-to-market adjustment has come into play. You know we are allowed to record deferred tax assets on the timing differences of our stock option program, and that is very much tied to the price of our stock. Now, as a reminder, last March our stock was pretty much at an all-time low. At the end of this March our stock price was at pretty much an all-time high. That deferred tax asset creation amounted to 270 basis points of credit in the tax line. We still believe that all things being equal, our effective tax rate will be in the 16 to 18% range for the medium-term.</p>
          <p>Our discontinued operations, nothing to speak of this year. This year is Montegrappa, last year is our investment in BAT which we divested. As a consequence of all this, profit from continuing operations decreased 18% to &#x20AC;603 million. This represents 12% of sales.</p>
          <p>Let's move to cash flow from operations. And Norbert touched on it, one of the key achievements for the year has been our ability to substantially increase our cash flow from operations in a pretty difficult environment. All of our Maisons &#x2013; and I want to stress, all of our Maisons &#x2013; substantially reduced their level of inventories. Particular congratulations should be given to Cartier who as the biggest brand had the most exposure and managed their inventories very, very well.</p>
          <p>Primarily due to the reduced inventories we enjoyed a positive swing in working capital of &#x20AC;684 million. Our rotations on our gross inventories, despite the decline in sales, remains stable at 18.7 months.</p>
          <p>Another pleasing thing for the year is our receivables were tightly controlled and monitored. I'm pleased to say that our average recovery rates year-on-year have remained stable.</p>
          <p>And other non-cash items for the year increased primarily due to long-term incentive plans and the recycling of certain hedge reserves.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our fixed asset investments. Gross fixed assets for year amounted to &#x20AC;151 million, which approximated 2.9% of sales. Our investments were targeted to growth markets such as China, the Middle-East and other places in Asia Pacific. In addition, we continued to invest in our strategic movement manufacturer Val Fleurier.</p>
          <p>Depreciation for the year amounted to &#x20AC;187 million, well in excess of our net fixed assets of 147. This I think reflects our cautious approach to the previous 12 months.</p>
          <p>For the current year we estimate our gross fixed assets to be in the neighborhood of 5% of sales. We're back to levels that we've seen in previous years. A substantial increase will happen this year in our store renovation program; as we sort of deferred last year our renovation program, so we'll have a catch-up this year, and those investments will be primarily targeted to Cartier</p>
          <p>Let's go into some details on the next slide of the types of investments that we had last year. 40% of our investments were made in the jewelry Maison, 25% were made by our specialist watchmaker. By category, 60% of overall investments were related to our retail network.</p>
          <p>The most notable new retail projects this year were the Hong Kong 1881 Heritage location which contains Audemars Maisons, the Cartier AIA Plaza Hong Kong boutique, a new flagship for Piaget in Shanghai, and the IWC Singapore ION Orchard project. In addition, over a third of our spend was related to manufacturing, Val Fleurier, as I previously mentioned, and also the completion of the Jaeger-LeCoultre factory facility.</p>
          <p>We are now left with the final operational element to discuss: free cash flow. Total free cash flow rose by &#x20AC;682 million to 1.24 billion. This has been achieved, as you've seen, by strong cash flow, reduced investments, lower tax payments which are consistent with our lower operating results.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our balance sheet. Richemont's balance sheet continues to be strong. Equity represents 73% of the total compared to 65% last year. Our gross position including investments amounted to &#x20AC;2.3 billion. After subtracting our structural operational debt, which is held in local currencies, our net cash position amounted to 1.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Since 2007, we have maintained a conservative approach to investing this cash. We have invested our cash resources in the most highly-rated banks and the most liquid, highly-rated bond funds. We review our portfolios on a regular basis to minimize our risk.</p>
          <p>Finally, let's review our dividend proposal. Our 2010 dividend proposal, to be confirmed by shareholders in September, is 35 centimes per share. As a reminder, this dividend will be paid in Swiss francs and is subject to a 35% withholding tax.</p>
          <p>The proposed dividend represents a 17% increase on the previous year. This is consistent with our Board's view, which aims to provide steady increases in dividends per share, profits allowing. We strive for consistency and reliability in our approach.</p>
          <p>As always, we will keep sufficient resources available to provide for growth opportunities and investments if conditions are right.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and I would like to turn the presentation over to Richard for a summary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gary, and before reviewing our long-term values, I would like to give you some color on current trends, even if I would like to underline the fact that April month is just the first month and this month is not very important for our industry.</p>
          <p>April reported sales were up 24% above last year, with retail up by 17% and wholesale up by 28%. Including NET-A-PORTER &#x2013; we will now, will consolidate NET-A-PORTER &#x2013; reported sales were up 28%.</p>
          <p>Main drivers, however, were easy comparatives. Another driver was the recent outperformance of wholesales, retailers. Retailers starting to restock, you remember how our business model is impacted by the cycle of wholesale. Last year, wholesale greatly underperformed retail and now we're saying wholesale is catching up, and as a result, you will see better performance of the wholesale, with sell-in more important than the sell-outs.</p>
          <p>The good news, because there is sometimes good news, is that sales in Asia Pacific continue to grow strongly. Wholesale in Asia Pacific was up by 39% and retail by 53%, of course helped by some store openings.</p>
          <p>Finally, the month of April was also marked by the acquisition of the control interest in NET-A-PORTER. And perhaps I would like to give you some details on NET-A-PORTER. Natalie Massenet, the founder of this business, has created a unique and outstanding business and I encourage all of you, especially the men because I'm sure the women already know the site, to visit her website. This is more than online shopping; her website is like a fashion magazine, like a personal shopper offering fashion advice on the latest trends. And of course, Natalie Massenet is a true entrepreneur &#x2013; she founded this business 10 years ago only, and we would not have acquired NET-A-PORTER had she had not committed to stay for a long time.</p>
          <p>The world is changing increasingly faster; distribution of high-end products is and will continue to evolve. It's our view that for high-class products like our products, shopping experience in a real stores enabling and direction with sales associates and physical contacts with brands attribute will remain the dominant form of distribution.</p>
          <p>However, the progress of technology &#x2013; look at the iPad for example &#x2013; is creating additional pent-up demand as well as from the traditional clientele and from the new generation born with internet. We expect therefore &#x2013; we expect online sales to grow dramatically over the coming years. Of course, as a result, we expect NET-A-PORTER to be a very promising investment in itself, and beyond that, it's providing us with a unique know-how and expertise that will be used within our Maisons, because to go from clicks to bricks is not as easy as it looks.</p>
          <p>NET-A-PORTER is already a profitable business, with significant growth potential. We expect our investment in NET-A-PORTER to be positive from a cash point of view this year and a profit enhancer at the IFRS operating level in the three years' time.</p>
          <p>Before we start our question and answer session, I would like to conclude the presentation by reminding you our key strategic principle of our group.</p>
          <p>The foundation of our group is and will remain our Maisons. We do everything to develop and protect the uniqueness, the creativity and the authenticity of the products. That's the reason why, for example, we put them and allow them to manage and control their own manufacturing activity and workshops, to make sure that they manufacture authentic and exclusive products, they develop the expertise and craftsmanship and, of course, offer the best quality. We give them time to grow steadily to their full potential.</p>
          <p>Another key principle is the efficiency of our business with them. What do we mean by that? We mean back office, shared services, operating platform which are managed by Richemont and which give us on one hand leverage related to the volume and of course control of the activities of our brands on the other hand.</p>
          <p>Equally important as a key principle is the control of distribution. Know that that we'll go for more retail &#x2013; thus is the lessons of the crisis. It's clear that retail is more resilient. That trend is also driven by the evolution of shopping habits, which are more and more concentrated in key areas. And last but not least, it's our view that we are less, I will say, quality wholesale network in the growth market, which leaves us to open more stores.</p>
          <p>Generally speaking, as said Norbert Platt, we go for less partners but more partnership. You saw that we have reduced significantly our distribution in the United States, as we did previously in Europe, and we continue to do so.</p>
          <p>We look for future growth opportunities and notably continue to pioneer new markets by establishing group organization in those markets with our leading brand Cartier.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, cash. We believe that cash is the best measure of a long-term value creation. We like to say cash is our fortress because more than ever in troubled times having cash is critical. It allows you to keep a long-term view, to finance your investments, to increase your dividends and, of course, to seize opportunities as well.</p>
          <p>In a nutshell, that's our run mark to build an ever stronger group.</p>
          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your attention. And now we are ready to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Luca Solca from Sanford Bernstein. I had a couple of questions. You were mentioning more difficult comparables in the second half of the year. Judging from the current trading trends that you were observing, could you give us a bit of an idea where in terms of geographies as well as in terms of product categories you would see that as a potential issue? I was thinking, for example, about the high-end jewelry portion of the business which had been resilient in the slowdown, whether this is going to have any time delays or any difference in the rebound.</p>
          <p>Another question totally unrelated about the NET-A-PORTER acquisition. Is it fair to say that this is probably more important for you in terms of acquiring the know-how and the expertise to run an online business for your own Maison rather than in terms of synergies that you're actually bringing to the business? And actually is there a risk of disynergies by owning the outright majority of NET-A-PORTER in terms of brands potentially deciding to exit NET-A-PORTER and choose other retailers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with the second question. First, the acquisition of NET-A-PORTER, I remember you that we already own one-third of NET-A-PORTER and we had the preemption right and our offer has been triggered by an offer made by a third parties. That's the first point. The second point, NET-A-PORTER, as I explained, in itself is a very promising business, and as a company financi&#xE8;re investing in luxury industry, because definitively NET-A-PORTER is about luxury, luxury online, it's a very promising investment. I may remember you that even on our stake, of course annuities that in our account, we have a very important return on the  investment we made. We believe that this business will continue to grow tremendously and even if we have no synergy at all, I would say it's really a luxury business which will be operate as a separate business and should have a very important payback.</p>
          <p>That being said, and even if it's completely operated separately, at arm's length we have access to the <mark type="inaudible" />. It's obvious, as we said, that our luxury brands like Cartier, like Montblanc, like all our brands will continue to operate predominantly in bricks. But the world is changing and it's not just putting your catalog online which trigger important sales in the luxury industry. So we may have to learn from the experience in NET-A-PORTER how our brands may themselves each one probably in a different way be successful with sales online. We strongly believe that it may become a complementary distribution network for our industry as well. That's the answer on NET-A-PORTER.</p>
          <p>Perhaps on the comps, first, we called your attention on of course an easy comparable because telling something different is misleading ourself and you. We called your attention that the only good news is of course Far East because Far East is not an easy comps. Far East is a growing story, but for America, for Europe, for even Middle East and some other countries and Japan of course, that's the only technical explanation of the rebound. How it may continue or accelerate, we do not know. That's very clear.</p>
          <p>In term of category of products, we mentioned high jewelry sales. Last year our high jewelry sales declined. And by the way, it still give more, I would say, light to the performance of Cartier which have suffer from decline of high jewelry sales. But declined compared to what? Compared to absolute record in 2008, and of course it was mainly driven by Russian and Middle Eastern. You saw that finally we have been retail positive in those two region and we may expect some stabilization, I would say, of the decline in high jewelry. And you saw, for example, that auction sales have decreased, even though <mark type="inaudible" /> of these have been very, very successful recently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thomas Chauvet, Citigroup. I've got three questions. The first one, on the spec watchmaker division, could you quantify the amounts of the Roger Dubuis restructuring charge and also the costs of closure of European and U.S. points of sale? And also, should we expect another charge, exceptional charge this year with regards to closure of point of sales?</p>
          <p>My second question, with regards to your underperforming brands, so Baume et Mercier, Roger Dubuis, Lancel and Dunhill which all lost money last year, what are the prospects in the next couple of years and are they still all strategic assets for the group?</p>
          <p>And thirdly to follow-up on Luca's questions on e-commerce, obviously NET-A-PORTER has mostly fashion apparel and leather goods, how do you see the main obstacles for you to develop strong e-commerce sites for Cartier and Montblanc and to become a big online retailer of high jewelry and watches? Is that still difficult compared to other product categories? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Norbert is a big fan of sales of Montblanc and NET-A-PORTER.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, first of all, to add to what Richard said already, NET-A-PORTER will be run arm's length and independently. You are aware that NET-A-PORTER today on the site has many brands which are not Richemont Group &#x2013; they are dominantly non-Richemont Group. That is supposed to stay that way. So no Richemont brand will go tomorrow to NET-A-PORTER and say, hey, can you put us on the line? And by the way, not only would refuse, because as Richard said in his presentation they consider themselves not just a site where you can buy, but a site which gives advice to the customers what is hot, what is good, what is sustainable, what is a good product. Not what's a good price, what's a good product.</p>
          <p>So of course, again, e-commerce is more and more an important thing. And I said it at the beginning, when I visited five years ago NET-A-PORTER &#x2013; we had a small share at the time. And I visited these guys, Natalie tried to convince me that it's a great story also for hard goods. Five years ago the world was different. And I said, "I can't believe this. Natalie, come on, give me a break. We need bricks, we need the energy of the stores, the excitement." And she said, "Just imagine. You know, this guy is deeply in love. Now it's 4 o'clock in the morning. He looks at this beautiful blonde girl." Now he goes to his &#x2013; today we would say iPad, right? And he orders this Cartier jewelry piece and by 9 o'clock in the morning somebody rings the bell with a cylinder and with champagne and the Cartier thing in the red box. And I said, wow, I haven't seen it that way.</p>
          <p>So that might not happen, but there's a lot of truth in how the world is changing, and specially the generation internet, I think the kids who are now growing into the luxury business, and as we all know, our brands are generally not made for 16 or 15 year-old kids, but they will grow in an interest.</p>
          <p>So e-commerce will play a more important role. We have to embrace that. From maybe five years ago to say, "No, this is... you know, it's no," we have to embrace that, we have to learn, we have to learn fast because this is of &#x2013; and I think, as Richard said, as we keep this NET-A-PORTER separate as a business, their know-how, their savoir faire, the way of their data mining &#x2013; it's quite amazing, huh? They are a small Google in a way. Their data mining is absolutely spectacular and we in the hard goods business still labor with good data mining. We can learn, but we will not use NET-A-PORTER as an outlet; the brands have to set up, as Richard said, their e-commerce on their own speed and their own volumes.</p>
          <p>Speed is also important because speed also depends on how good are you already with your quality of your bricks model distribution. Again, Cartier is far ahead with a high percentage of sales in own and retail boutiques. Montblanc is still laboring because they have still a too big distribution and have to reduce it even further because otherwise you cannot maintain the quality which you want to have on the net but is a medium which Richemont has to start loving. From rather saying, "Oh, we can't do blah blah blah," we have to love it, and Natalie will help us to love it I guess.</p>
          <p>Roger Dubuis, we have made... You want Roger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have made a good acquisition for the long-term. For the short-term we have had to learn that the company was not as strong as we believed it is. Certainly we have bought the company because it is much different in its appearance, it's much more extrovert than any of the other watch brands. That's one reason why we bought it, besides the fact that it has very high-end movement.</p>
          <p>We had serious problems with their main distributor in the Far East. We had half year practically no sales in the Far East because we were negotiating a way with their general Far East agent. That has cost us time. We had to fix some quality issues. Richemont cannot risk at that price point or at any price point that you have quality issues. You know we have established a new management, a new CEO and I pick a new management.</p>
          <p>So it's a building site; nothing to worry too much about. I think when we bought Vacheron Constantin it was a building site and look at what a beautiful company it is today. And I mean it's a cute, beautiful company and I hope Charlie listens to me when I say this. And it took them much more work because when we bought Vacheron it had many issues. So, yes, it's making some losses. We are there for the long-term. We don't look for the quarters and therefore we are &#x2013; relaxed is the wrong word, but we are not in panic. It's a good acquisition, it will add to the group, it's focused to a specific market segment and it will do well in the mid-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you remember so they as well, transfer <mark type="inaudible" /> and manufacturing capacity to other brands, like Cartier, we've been able to master the own Francois <mark type="inaudible" /> and making significant sales with this product and other brands who are intending to use Francois <mark type="inaudible" /> movements, which of course will not be recorded under the Roger Dubuis, but it's of course besides all these acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lancel. I totally believe in Lancel and always have. It was under pressure for quite a bit. The pressure has gone because we see now that the company is going in the right direction. Why was I so &#x2013; why were we, Richard and myself, we are really behind the story to maintain Lancel as a part of the Richemont Group.</p>
          <p>It has 80% of its sales is in their home market. That is very different to some other brands like Dunhill, which have not such a strong home market. When you have a strong home market, all what you have to do &#x2013; that's not so easy as I'm saying <mark type="inaudible" />, expand outside of the home market. When you don't have a home market, you have always an issue with the global traveler that he says, where is this brand in the country where it should be, where is it present?</p>
          <p>Lancel has made considerable efforts to improve its marketing, its product quality and, again, it is benefiting of course from the times. I mean, you ladies, you like to buy handbags but maybe you don't want to spend &#x20AC;3,000 anymore for it, when you buy three a year, or five. Maybe it's okay if you spent only 1,000.</p>
          <p>So there is a strong upbeat and Lancel is now slowly &#x2013; because nobody waits for another leather brands in Hong Kong or in Japan, but it's making considerable inroads in Japan and in Asia. There is good partners, strong partners in Japan, that's the previous partner who created Coach in Japan &#x2013; or who managed as an agent or distributor, Coach. And it's practically now breakeven and we are very confident that it will make a contribution to the group in a very foreseeable time.</p>
          <p>And let's not forget &#x2013; we haven't talked about this today, Mr. Rupert has decided, rightfully, that the fashion and accessory brands which were always a bit neglected by us guys. When you manage a group with 5, 6 billion and you have a 10% of the business in fashion and accessories, how much attention do we give &#x2013; me, guys &#x2013; and resource and encouragement? And we have now, as you know, since a year or since 1st of June last year, put Marty Wikstrom the Head of Nordstrom, and for a while of Harrods in London. She knows customer, she knows retail, she knows the fashion business. So we will see this brands coming out.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Jon Cox with Kepler. I have a couple of questions for you. I'll start with the reduction in the point of sales for watches in the U.S. and Cartier watches in the U.S. Can you give us a rough guess what the impacts will be for the year? And maybe just to make it easier for me modeling this thing, is it really like adding NET-A-PORTER, &#xA3;120 million, but actually removing &#xA3;120 million from the closure of the stores? Just as a mechanical way. That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, on the gross margin, any best guess? Richard, I know you have in the past given us some guidance on what you think may happen with the gross margin, just in view of what's going on with currencies and commodities and that sort of thing and also potential increased capacity utilization.</p>
          <p>Then a question on working capital as a proportion of sales, are we where we can be, that this is the best it can be, now we should start to expect maybe a deterioration as things pick up, or are you really trying to aim for that and maybe things may even get better, because of the various IT systems you're putting in place?</p>
          <p>Then I have a question, obviously, on the financials and sorry to do it to you, Gary. This 100 million figure there in the P&amp;L and it's to do with marking-to-market between euro and Swiss. So just as a guess, or give us some sort of guidance &#x2013; if everything's equal at the end of the year, no move in euro-Swiss, I guess that won't happen. But I'm just trying to get a feeling, if the euro goes up, say, 1% against the Swiss or 2% against the Swiss, what is the mechanism we can use to try and make a guesstimate that something may actually pop up in that line?</p>
          <p>And then obviously, the most obvious question, you're sitting on almost &#x20AC;2 billion of cash, a little bit of a deal you've done at NET-A-PORTER, but what are you going to do with all that money, because the dividend seems pretty stingy? You seem to be signaling maybe something's in the offing there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, reduction of point of sales, I will say it's sales of course, but it's not material. It's strategically material. It's euros denominated terms not material. It's of course, by definition, what we are closing is underperforming partners, quality-wise or even volume-wise. So -and we have always a conservative approach. And we did previous year, we never disclosed any figures and we did this year and we provide for that. We'll do probably next year. So that's the trend and we'll continue to do so. It's very material from a strategic point of view, but in terms of sales, no.</p>
          <p>Gross margin, we give no guidance. It's clear that if you have a real rebound sustainable, you may expect more efficiency regarding your factories, as it's happening now. How long it will last, I don't know. And of course the other impact is the Swiss franc against the euro. We are suffering an impact on that side, even though of course we are benefiting from an higher dollar and yen against the euro. All in all, I think globally it's more positive than negative.</p>
          <p>Third question was...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, on the guidance and the finance costs, I mean, I think it's pretty easy for you guys to work it out yourselves, right? I mean, most of the cash is in euro and you just take the end of a rate at a given point in time, balance sheet &#x2013; and, okay, there'll be flows, but, I mean, I think you can work it out. I mean, from March to April, we actually have a benefit &#x2013; it's not big, but it will go up and down, like my window shade I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's non-cash anyway, so I believe that the cash flow itself is more important of the operating income.</p>
          <p>We missed one other question. It was related to the capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the working capital. I think that this was a pretty extraordinary year. I think we're going to increase our fixed assets, as I stated, and I really don't think that we can generate cash out of the working capital period of this year. We have metrics that we use internally and we have our models as well, but there will be some increase in working capital next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I already have answer, cash is our fortress, so in a way that will destroy our fortress, and let's see how it may happen. We will focus on growing internally our businesses. We still have a lot of opportunities, we are going to continue to invest for the long-term and we have a number that we will increase our CapEx this year. It may also have opportunities we may seize as well, even if we have no thing on our agenda. And let's see how the world developed. We are really in a very uncertain world. Remember that last year, at the same time of the year, there was no access to cash, and many good companies have no more access to credit. Even in our industry, you know that some people paid a high price for that. So I believe that of course it becomes meaningful, and it forced us to be more profitable on our other assets because it's our view that for time being, they are not performing assets, but it's really key, as we explain in our philosophy, to keep that cash.</p>

          <p>Hello. Aur&#xE9;lie Husson-Dumoutier, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Three questions if I may. The first one is, you said that production was not back to full speed yet because you wanted to be sure that the recovery was sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First question, you said that production was not back to full speed yet, because you wanted to check if recovery was sustainable first. Is it your historic caution talking, or do you already have a clear sign that there could be some hiccups in retailers restocking? This is the first question.</p>
          <p>The second is on Ralph Lauren watches, could you give us some details on where we stand there?</p>
          <p>And finally, NET-A-PORTER again. Although you did not disclose the price you paid, could you comment on the market assumptions that are between 2 and 3 times sales? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't disclose but it was leaked in the press many times, and actually everything is discloseable when you look at our financial statements. So the valuation of the company was 350 million sterling for 100% of the business, which I do believe it's really a fair valuation, even though the company may have received higher offer should we have not exercised our preemption right. So of course, only the future will let us know if the price is high or not. It's clear that it's absolutely a growing business. NET-A-PORTER is growing very fast and this industry is growing very fast, and if NET-A-PORTER continue to be the leader of this segment on sales online, it should benefit from the growth of the market.</p>
          <p>You want to answer on Ralph Lauren?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ralph Lauren, well, it's very clear that we have been asked to do watches which are positioned at the upper end of the market &#x2013; that's where we are good in, otherwise other groups or maybe independent watchmakers could do a much better job. When you do that, it's very clear that in a period of cash constraint, there are not too many dealers who look for another high-end brand. We have therefore concentrated deliberately on starting accounts within the Ralph Lauren stores, to give the brand proper exposure with nice shopping shops and also the expertise to sell a watch at that price point. As a result, therefore, the present turnover is small, but will grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> our view that what may happen, and without being complacent, that's clear that what we managed well last year was the adjustment of production to the demand. And why it was important, it was important for generating cash, but it's also important for the brand equity, because the worst may happen is to oversupply the market and having shortage, of course, is an issue. On the other hand, it's better to have that problem than the other one, oversupply.</p>

          <p>Luxury industry, to an extent, is about torturing your customer. Now, this sounds very stupid, because we want to treat the customer like a king, but it's still not a conflict. Try to get a Herm&#xE8;s Kelly bag, go in the store and say, can I have a Kelly bag and we'll see what happens. They will smile at you and show you a list where you can put your name on. So I'm not saying that this is our business model, okay? It's always a fine line between undersupply and oversupply, but certainly, as Richard says, oversupply has much more risks, much more risks than undersupply. And for that reason, we are not right now in &#x2013; we are not encouraging our brands to work overtime and again, like we did before the crisis and push volumes in production, because the world is still not as solid as it was pre-Lehmans.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's John Guy from RBS. Two questions please, gentlemen. The first, really going back to the OpEx as a percentage of sales and the leverage. I guess when you did some work on Cartier and you reduced some of the wholesale exposure back in 2005, we saw the OpEx move close to 48.5, 49% as a percentage of sales. Over the last three to four years, it's been trending lower, at around the 44 to 45%. You've talked about this reduction in wholesale and a concerted move towards retail over the next 12 months and I know you've done work over these past 12 months as well. I'm trying to get a sense for where your OpEx as a percentage of sales you think will actually normalize over, not necessarily over a 12 month view, but over a three year view. And that's my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is with regards to the third pillar of growth that I know that you've talked about previously, with regards to fashion and accessories. Obviously, the NET-A-PORTER acquisition gives you another channel into fashion and leather goods to a certain degree, but it's not necessarily the kind of size and scale acquisition that you need to really drive the volume and potential synergies. So is this still an area that you're looking to really grow? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope that we have been clear on NET-A-PORTER. It's a standing alone operation. Natalie Massenet will report directly to the Chairman. We made this acquisition because we wanted to exercise and to defend our preemption right. She received an offer and we decided to exercise this.</p>
          <p>In itself, we believe it's a fantastic investment. We have been lucky to have more or less potential control, and the existing shareholder that, having decided to sell, we took the opportunity, being the biggest minority shareholder, to exercise our preemption right. And believe me, many, many strong companies were queuing to buy NET-A-PORTER.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, I would say that the fit between Natalie Massenet as an entrepreneur and our Chairman did the rest. That's very clear, that Mr. Rupert is very open to many other opportunities, and this combination of a new business &#x2013; because it's a new business, sales online is a completely new business. Luxury, it's a luxury, they sell at full price &#x2013; there is not so many sites selling at full price. Plus, more than just a distribution because it's as much about magazines, about prescription. It's very fantastic and unique combination.</p>
          <p>And you have really to look and to follow that business into the <mark type="inaudible" />. We didn't buy that because of, for example, Ala&#x3CA;a. Ala&#x3CA;a is selling some goods online and it was before advancing and will go on if the two brands decide to maybe get together. So that's the way you have to look at it.</p>
          <p>Regarding expenses and Cartier, it's clear that we go for more and more retail. Cartier is already probably, marketing-wise, at 75% retail because we don't have to forget franchise stores. Cartier's operating directly retail stores, but also through franchisee. From a marketing point of view, it's the same vis &#xE0; vis the clientele when you have a store in, for example, <mark type="inaudible" /> del Port (1:44.15) is operated by <mark type="inaudible" /> while it most operated by us.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, I will say the costs related to the store is very similar, because we put a lot of marketing behind this operation even it's a franchise store. So that's clear that we go for more operating cost, especially the retail and the cost of the rent and the staff, while on the other hand of course, we are capturing more money. As a result you see, I will say, a very resilient high level of the operating margin of the jewelry segment, which is known as being mainly Cartier, but we don't disclose the Cartier figures in themselves.</p>

          <p>Well, these are always the difficult questions without the crystal ball. China is managing, I think, its growth well. The Chinese are hungry for &#x2013; and I hate the word, but I will use it in that context &#x2013; status symbols. So if China continues to do well macroeconomically, and there is no reason today why they shouldn't, even so you guys in the other side of the trading desk debate this, we will continue to see double-digit growth. Will it be more like 20% this year or like the years before even higher, we don't know.</p>
          <p>But you must not forget there are 1.3 billion people in China and of course some haven't even started to realize that there are cars existing in the world. But the belt along the coasts of course get more and more wealthier. Let's not forget that a strong U.S. dollar will help to buy more stuff from China even though the renminbi is also going up.</p>
          <p>So Asia, we don't see why Asia shouldn't do well. And, again, let's not forget that, yes, it's also a strong tourist market, but traditionally it's also a very strong man's market. So watches, here we are, okay? A man's market. This is still &#x2013; you boys out there, there the world is still intact, okay? We are the bosses, not &#x2013; I'm married to a Chinese, I'm not the boss at home.</p>
          <p>But it's a man's market still, even though today the jewelry &#x2013; and you know how well some of the fashion is doing. The fashion competitors look at the type of stores other brands built in Asia. Just was in Singapore in April and you all know that one brand in the leather business builds a whole island, okay? An island next to the casino. So we believe in from what we know today, we believe that Asia is going to continue doing well and that we should see a double-digit growth with our brands. It's not by far exploited.</p>
          <p>Yes, it also means more retail, Richard said it before. Specifically in China watch brands go retail. If you want to make an impact you have to do your on stores or franchise stores, but stores anyway. That's the way it's done. And we are very bullish on Asia. We don't have the crystal ball but we are very bullish on Asia, okay?</p>
          <p>So communication, let's talk about this. I'm very proud of what happened this year in communication. And you will say, yeah, but it has gone down to 8.9% or something like this, 9% from 11 before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>9.8.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>9.8. 9.8, so it has come down 1.2%. When we started the year, and I repeat this, we didn't know how deep we would be hit. And it speaks &#x2013; I'm very proud of this &#x2013; it speaks for the maturity of our management in the brands that they have not after they saw, okay, Christmas is doing quite well and so on, start like crazy to spend the money just to spend it, like in bureaucracies, you have a budget numbers, you always spend again in relation to sales just to make sure next year you get the right amount of money.</p>
          <p>Let's also not forget that generally speaking above-the-line advertising, at least in some countries, was easier to buy. You know all the problems the media has, so costs have been declining in some markets, certainly not in Asia. And at the end of the day, you have to look at market share &#x2013; or a share flow, sorry, not market share, share flows. I think everybody has put the brakes on this, very few exceptions &#x2013; yes, we know others <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>As we have said &#x2013; I think Richard said it or Gary, next year you have again to think that we will again closer to the traditional 11%. But, again, to me that is a sign that our CEOs managed their business well, that they have not, so to say, scratching and say, "Now, Platt, Richard, the business is better, let us spend some foolish money just to poof."</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the S&amp;D question, what we say around office is this year was a year of two halves. The first year was pretty difficult and second year because of the &#x2013; the second half because of the comps were better. With regards to S&amp;D in the first half of the year, we closed a lot of stores, so to a certain extend I think the S&amp;D at the first half was a bit flatter. In the second half we opened up stores. The overall movement for the year is maybe not as normal as you would see, but we opened up a normal amount of stores. So I think the second half sort of comparison is probably a reasonable one to think of.</p>
          <p>With respect to NET-A-PORTER, you'll see if you look at the financial statements, we do have intangibles to amortize; it is an internet business. Those intangibles will be amortized over a relatively short period of time. So as Richard said in his presentation, we expect this to be dilutive to operating income for a three year period. It's not going to be significant, but it will be dilutive. Now, if Natalie and the team over-achieve their expectation of sales, okay, so be it, but in our models we think it will be marginally dilutive.</p>
          <p>We will record a gain on this transaction of &#x20AC;102 million. This will be recorded in the first half and it will be recorded in the associates line, so it will be kept out of operating results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason we have to record the gain is that there's a new standard and we have to mark our existing stake up to market. So that's another mark-to-market adjustment. We're not congratulating ourselves.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Next question from me, Matthias Eifert from MainFirst. First question, on Cartier, you said last year that you introduced more products at accessible price points. Can you give us a bit more detail what exactly where the facts form that? Did it help you or was it already big enough to help you to have this more or less almost stable result at Cartier last year? And what can we expect going forward, do you broaden this product range or you scrap it now that the environment has improved again?</p>
          <p>And the second question, what is your latest estimate, how much of your sale is going to Chinese consumers, i.e. including the tourists from China?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, do you have a estimate how much negative impact the currencies had on your operating results as well as on your net results? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will answer to the first question. Our intent was, by the way, not only for Cartier, to make sure that in this economic environment to have products in the store which create frequency. I mean, if people are in a bad mood and they see only products which start at &#x20AC;10,000 or US$15,000 or whatever, then maybe that is not a good idea because you want people in the store. Once you have them in the store, you have them in the store. That's very important. So our prime idea was to encourage brands to say, "Look, guys, don't be too swollen-headed. Make sure that in times where frequency, specifically in the U.S., drop dramatically, people will still find something which they want to buy even if their mood is not so good."</p>
          <p>Having said this, of course you have to make sure that it stays within the quality D&amp;A blah blah blah. I think we have achieved this. Sales have been positive, but it's not something which now changed the world of Cartier or Montblanc or anybody of our bigger brands. It's an important issue. I think we all have to realize that brands which are getting to swollen-headed might lose their customer. And we are very positive with this initiative, specifically by Cartier, they have felt that some of the jewelry products and some of the watches specifically when they were offered within the world of watches and within the world of jewelry have done well. Is it to the total sales of Cartier a big impact? No. Will we scrap it? Of course not. But it would be very inconsequent to say, okay, this was just little blimp &#x2013; we are not in the little blimp business.</p>
          <p>But I think it was a wake-up call for everybody who over the years &#x2013; and to an extent that's true for the watch brands as well. Prior to Lehman everybody pushed prices only upwards and cut products below &#x2013; and the industry, I'm talking industry, I'm not talking the sales of Richemont.</p>
          <p>And I think from time to time that your wake-up call is good to make sure if you go in a store you find something which you can impulse buy. Impulse, you know, like, okay, I spent &#x20AC;1,000. Impulse gets more difficult to the average middle-class I spent &#x20AC;10,000 &#x2013; that's not happening, well, let's spend &#x20AC;10,000. And that's the key to this.</p>
          <p>Latest, what <mark type="inaudible" /> their latest estimate. Well, what else do you want to know?</p>

          <p>Yeah, I'll just add on that point remember also that the growth has been driven by the growth market, and the growth markets, the prevailing clientele is more <mark type="inaudible" /> and more driven by, of course, entry price. And last but not least, we have to accept normal. We have to go on because we have especially in the Western countries where the austerity will prevail. I believe that some of you will have tax increases, so it's clear that the disposable income will be reduced. We have to continue to be relevant for our core customers which are the European ones. And of course also when you look at the twice of gold, for example, it's also create an issue in terms of too much price. And at the end of the day, our business and our product proposal is about creativity, uniqueness and not only driven by price. We may have very exclusive and very creative product at the right price for &#x2013; may be relevant for Western clientele, like in Japan, however, I would say deflation in <mark type="inaudible" /> terms or the U.S. or the local clientele in Europe.</p>

          <p>On the margin, I mean, in the currencies generally had a positive effect in the first half and a negative effect in the second half, but we had a counterbalance of more sub- activity in the first half and less sub- activity in the second half. So in actuality, the margin was fairly constant throughout the year.</p>

          <p>China is representing 8% of our sales. That's true that Chinese tourists start to shop abroad, especially in Hong Kong and Macau and some of them also in Europe. We don't even see that are not really meaningful I would say. So you saw that our sales in Asia Pacific are 34%, they are not all to Chinese. So it's difficult to have a clear assessment and guess how much are represented. It's clear that it's becoming an important clientele as was the Japanese and of course the European and the demographic factor is playing in their favor. That's obvious. Even though you cannot, it's not because you are Chinese that you have to say all the Chinese is <mark type="inaudible" /> clientele, like us, European or American. I think we are perhaps same, but at the end of the day they are different market and you only have not to put everything together. Remain more leading with Hong Kong and the China and Hong Kong Chinese and Hong Kong for 30 years and that's not the same clientele as the clientele of Mainland, even they are Chinese at the end of the day.</p>

          <p>Good morning. It's Louise Singlehurst here from Morgan Stanley. Just a couple of quick questions. In terms of the tone and the sentiment across wholesalers globally at the moment, U.S., Europe, can you give us an idea of how their confidence levels are at the moment, is the restocking process just at the beginning or are we at getting to more normalized levels of inventory?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, looking at the strength of your brands across the portfolio, can you give us any color in terms of market share gains, are you taking more floor space within those wholesale doors?</p>
          <p>And then finally, in the context of the double-digit growth that we've seen in the past for Richemont Group, can you talk about floor space expansion and pricing growth thematically over the next medium-term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's start with your question in the middle. It was the restocking question, is a crystal ball question. When we say less partners for more partnership, that automatically means more demand on floor space. We go there, we will say, "Okay, look, there are five watch dealers in the town or in the road or in the shopping mall, we will reduce it to two. What are you doing to be one of the two?" It's very simple. For us and what do you expect from us? And that automatically ends in all the things we want to have, more floor space, better training of the people who sell our product, better product portfolio et cetera. It's very clear. That is going to happen that's part of exactly that process.</p>
          <p>Restocking I will give to Richard because I don't know that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Restocking, market share, Swiss exports. Actually I am shocked sometimes to meet some article by journalist or even by some analyst confusing completely Swiss exports with market share and we sell out Swiss exports by finishing the good we export <mark type="inaudible" /> from our own subsidiary. The same goes for <mark type="inaudible" />, for Rolex, for Richemont and for all other groups who are fully integrated.</p>
          <p>It's our view that when you see Swiss exports collapsing like we did last year, we will revise the purpose of selling to your subsidiaries inventory and goods that you will not sell out, so you stop the sale of Swiss exports. While today you see a booming and it will go on for a while Swiss exports because we are just transferring our inventory...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...from Switzerland, from our factory to our subsidiary and now to our retailers. So the trend is absolutely exaggerated by &#x2013; and people confusing what they are doing at sell-out level with Swiss exports &#x2013; it's just we think misleading. So we don't like to play with that. We try to be serious, to be just factual, and try to explain to you what's going on.</p>
          <p>Technically of course now you see restockage of our retailers, but they are views that explains better <mark type="inaudible" />, so our retail sales and other low inventories. And that low inventories especially measure to what they do forecast because you never buy new goods because of what you thought in the past, but because what you believe you may sell in the future.</p>
          <p>So how long it will last, I don't know, but I think it's clear that we're in a period of restocking and it will goes on for a few months, but the key is the second part of year and of course how will be the feel good factor and environment at that time.</p>
          <p>Overall, I believe then we have to look brand per brand. I think some of our brands' deep growth last year, and we mentioned Vacheron Constantin and Piaget. Definitively those brands taken market share. Cartier has been very resilient; I mean, you saw the figures of this jewelry segment. At the end of the day, I don't believe it's very important, it doesn't matter really. We believe that globally we did perform well and the more important that we did perform well for the long-term, for what we want to be on in terms of brand equity without of course jeopardizing our short-term interests. But that's the vision that we have.</p>

          <p>I'll have a second bite at the cherry, as it were. Jon Cox with Kepler. Just on this you're moving from wholesale to retail and you're talking how that's going to be margin accretive, should the investment community start to think about Richemont getting towards a 25% operating margin? I'm not talking about tomorrow, next week, next year, but I'm talking about from more of a two or three, four year prospect. Sorry, just a --</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I really have to interfere here and I have to play now Mr. Rupert's role. Tell me what the euro against the U.S. dollar is in three years. Tell me how the macroeconomic is in three years. I mean, one thing is for sure, it will not go against 100%. That's the only thing that is sure. And, I mean, we have to be careful. There is always a fine balance. People who buy our products also are reading the financial papers. How much margin do you want to make &#x2013; that's nice for you guys &#x2013; before our customers they say wait a minute, I'm in <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So I don't know, it might disappoint you, my belief, but I'm saying what Mr. Rupert would tell you. We have to produce quality products and of course margin is important because we need to have the resource to build our business. The more margins, the more resource to build our business in the future and that's why we discussed about the cash generation and what have you. But it might disappoint you. This comes from running a good business. Margin comes as a result. It's not a means in itself. Oh, we want to make &#x2013; Mr. Ackerman says we want to make 25% or whatever and he's crucified, in Germany at least, for it.</p>
          <p>We want to produce products which to customer wants. If he wants it very badly we make better margins than if we want to shove it up his ears. It's very simple. It's not for us &#x2013; and, again, I'm saying this on behalf of Mr. Rupert &#x2013; it's not for us a means in itself. It might disappoint you. Good margins are very important. Of course we want to have good margins, but they are not &#x2013; we are not telling them, the brand, in three years your margins has to be there and there. Of course when we see that's the controlling part of Richemont for a <mark type="inaudible" /> in future running the operations. If we see a new product which has poor margins, we say, "Hey, wait a minute, what's wrong? Your old margin is this and your new margin is what. What's wrong? Is the product not attractive enough, are your production is not -- ?" I mean, yes, we challenge that... But, yes, 100% is the final target. We all dead by then because nobody will buy our products.</p>

          <p>If the U.S. dollar goes to 1.21, yes, it's possible. If it goes to 0.80 like it was before, it's very possible. If it goes to 1.50 again because finally the world will realize after speculating against the euro that the U.S. is also in debts like hell, 122%. I think I read a few days ago a very nice sentence which said, according to the debts which the U.S. has accumulated until now, 2010, they just should come out of World War III. So then if you guys in the banks all say hold on, what's about the U.S.? Of course it's a great economy. It doesn't have all the social liabilities we have in Europe. Currencies, Mr. Rupert has often said it, and I am now playing this role, $0.01 move in the U.S. dollar has a much bigger effect on us than profit or loss of Lancel and Dunhill together &#x2013; for the time being, until we make this big companies, then it might be different.</p>
