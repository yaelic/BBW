          <p>Good morning everybody and welcome to the Pernod Ricard Auditorium. Also like to welcome those of you who are following us by Internet. No need to introduce Pierre Pringuet of course, but some of you may not have met Gilles Bogaert. He is our CFO has been since the 1 of July never know maybe some people haven't met him yet. I several times I said he was a Director maybe not yet but to take you through our sales and performance for our financial year '08, '09 from the 1 of July 2008 to the 30 of June 2009.</p>
          <p>The presentation should last about 45 minutes. After that presentation, as usual you'll have about 45 minutes for questions-and-answers. As usual as well we'll also be taking questions from the auditorium here and over Internet, we will now rotate. And the press release has been available on our website since 7:30 this morning has been put out in compliance with usual rules applying in the fashion community, but before giving it before to Pierre Pringuet, who will begin the presentation two points of order.</p>
          <p>First of all, I'd like to ask you all to turn-off your Blackberries to avoid any interference for people following the presentation by Internet. Second point is that at 10:30 on the dot, we must vacant the room because it will be used for other presentations.</p>
          <p>Okay, thank you. I'll now give the floor to Pierre Pringuet.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I can confirm that Gilles is meritorious and deserves to be acknowledged. He was Head of Development. But, that is-- what covered our acquisitions of Allied Domecq and Vin&amp;Sprit so Gilles has extensive experience in development, he then spent a year in Brazil as a country manager. So, he is very much familiar with the business.</p>
          <p>Now, you will have noticed that the past year has been an interesting year. In that environment, I think we can qualify our results as particularly satisfactory. Our sales are up sharply. For the first time the group has exceeded net sales of over 1 billion and of course we have substantially reduced our debt.</p>
          <p>Now no need to give you a lecture on economics you are as familiar as I am with the prevailing environment. But just to highlight a few points that have an impact on our business, consumer spending of course and access to credit. Access to credit is the region that a certain number of operators and wholesalers and retailers substantially reduced their stocks.</p>
          <p>Now in that context you will see that our Wines &amp; Spirits performance is very good. A lot of consumer durables, a lot of particularly durables have decreased substantially. Then of course, we have currencies like the dollar and the yen -- I'm not going to get into this in any detail but interest rates as well also good news, after a period of sharp increase you will see that interest rates have softened considerably, you'll see the impact on our accounts.</p>
          <p>So a very eventual year, as I said. We completed the acquisition of Vin&amp;Sprit on July, we like to finish in July; we've done it again.</p>
          <p>Now, we also negotiated the termination of our ABSOLUT distribution contract with Maxxium and with Beam for the U.S., Beam for the U.S., Maxxium for the Rest of the World. So as of the 1st of October we took over distribution of ABSOLUT virtually worldwide. And I think it can be said that we kept it very active, despite the fact that the crisis was ongoing our management was more involved than ever before, head office and of course in subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>We had an asset disposal plan for some 1 billion, 70% of that has been completed. We also successfully increased our capital by &#x20AC;1 billion. And this is where our decentralized structure has worked very well. We succeeded in containing all our marketing and structure costs worldwide, you'll see that reflected in the figures, self-explanatory almost.</p>
          <p>Now thanks to our subsidiaries, we also manage our working capital requirements extremely well. Leading us to a record level of free cash flow from &#x2013; of recurring operations of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, that's a record level for us.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to underscore the fact that this is really a reflection of the commitment that made possible by our decentralized structure with country managers who know how to tackle problems, to enable us to adapt to our environment. Of course, we've also made a successful 800 million bond issue.</p>
          <p>What about the key figures? Each time we give you the nominal growth and organic growth. Nominal growth includes of course Vin&amp;Sprit. Sales of 7.2 billion, that's 9% nominal growth. Organic growth would have been flat from stable at least in our top 14, that's our 15 strategic brands except ABSOLUT, which we can't factor into the comparison, so volume down 4%, revenue stable. Profit from recurring operations up 21%.</p>
          <p>Now, if we factor out currency, our translation effect and Vin&amp;Sprit, this is organic growth of 4%, so even in a very difficult economic environment, we succeeded in posting a very good organic performance.</p>
          <p>And of course, thanks to the integration of ABSOLUT, we saw our operating margin grow sharply; it's now well over 25%, actually at 25.6%. I don't think there is any need to dwell on the reasons for that success, we've already commented on them before.</p>
          <p>So I think these figures show that A, Pernod Ricard has reacted extremely well, particularly the former scope of consolidation, which defended its marginal profits very well, and B, we have reaped the benefits of ABSOLUT, which is clearly in evidence in our operating margin.</p>
          <p>Working our way down the P&amp;L, 1.01 billion in net profit from recurring operations; we have kept our promise to you. Cost of our debt contained at 4.8% and Gilles will talk to you about our prospects for the forthcoming periods.</p>
          <p>Net profit, that's including non-recurring items, of course we had the capital gains from disposables, also restructuring costs as a result of ABSOLUT, but net profit is exactly the same performance as net profit from recurring operations up 13%. Free cash flow from recurring operations of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, significant debt reduction as well, which is very good news.</p>
          <p>Remember we started the period with a pro forma net debt EBITDA ratio of 6.2 and that multiple at the end of June was down to 5.3. So, our debt reduction has gone very well. I'll be telling you little bit later on what our ambitions are for the future.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's take a look at our sales growth. Now this is the breakdown of sales. You see organic growth, which is minus &#x20AC;26 million, which is flat. Forex impact, which have fluctuated right across the board, but the net impact of foreign exchange was a negative 2%. You'll see the positive impact on net income, but we'll explain that afterwards.</p>
          <p>The restructure of the group which is of course the additional Vin&amp;Sprit, which added 900 million in revenues, but we also had a number of disposals as particularly the discontinuation of Stolichnaya distribution that explained the negative effect here. The disposal I'll be talking about our brands later on of course, but this didn't have as big an impact on '08-'09.</p>
          <p>I told you earlier on that the Wines and Spirits industry has resisted well. I'm sure we'll have ample of opportunity to comment to that when it comes to the q-and-a session. But Pernod Ricard has also been very resilient. In fact, we won over market share in number of countries and in a number of segments.</p>
          <p>I've already mentioned France, but we've also done well in Spain, which is -- Spain is a difficult market, but we've done very well in whiskey and gin, which are the top two segments of the Spanish market. And in Spain, we have gained market share. Now, okay, we have a small share of the market, but according to the panels, we have become market leader by just a short head, but we are market leaders all the same.</p>
          <p>In Germany, Ireland, Greece and in emerging countries like Poland, China, India, Brazil and Mexico, we have also improved our position in all these markets. And remember that the emerging markets are one of our great strengths because we have been investing these markets for two decades now.</p>
          <p>Now those -- this was a year of two halves as we say and the first half was up 5%. And the second half we'll be looking at the breakdown by quarter incidentally in a few minutes. You see that really the third quarter was a quarter that was most affected by de-stocking.</p>
          <p>Something else we've mentioned a number of times is that in this economic crisis there has been a certain number of transfer of sales from the on-trade to off-trade sectors. This is people consuming at home quite simply because it's less expensive than consuming in restaurants and hotels.</p>
          <p>Okay. Let's take a quick look at the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter, as you may know, saw organic growth of minus 3%. The Forex impact was positive at 2%. Now there's been the effect of the dollar, because the dollar weakened. Actually, the dollar was higher in Q4 than in Q4 of the previous year. And of course there is the group structure again Vin&amp;Sprit of course which is just a proportion of what we saw beforehand.</p>
          <p>Now if we look at these GDP indicators for a number of countries such as France, U.K., Spain, Germany, Greece, European Union and Japan, what we see is that the crisis has deepened, in fact we hit bottom really in the first quarter of the year, our third quarter in our financial year, which is shown very clearly here.</p>
          <p>If you look at the organic growth of our sales you see that in the first quarter, from say July to September, sales were up 7%, they were up again 3% in the second quarter. And then the trend in the market reversed, particularly in the U.S., and this was an evidence as of November became particularly clear thereafter, but the third quarter saw sales for 12%.</p>
          <p>Western Europe and particularly Russia were by then in economic crisis and of course de-stocking was on a very, very large scale, a massive scale in Q3. Now of this minus 12%, about two-thirds were due to de-stocking, the remaining third was the -- just the decline in sales in the market. And the fourth quarter was down 3%, which we feel is a fair reflection of the market performance. I'm not going to come back to this. There are the economic figures for the four quarters.</p>
          <p>We are now going to move on to our portfolio review maybe I could remind you that our top 14, I know we say top 15, but that includes ABSOLUT. Factoring out ABSOLUT we are looking at a top 14. Volumes were down 4%, revenues stable. So we're going to go through each of the brands now.</p>
          <p>ABSOLUT volume was 10.2 million cases, ABSOLUT -- some 600,000 less than the previous year on a pro forma basis. Remember that the U.S. aren't altogether comparable, because we now have completely integrated distribution of ABSOLUT, which was not the case with Vin&amp;Sprit during the previous year.</p>
          <p>Now I have to say that we have succeeded this integration. Once again the Pernod Ricard machine has been up and running each country, each country manager; each sales network has integrated ABSOLUT in its network. We have reorganized our networks accordingly. And we have done particularly well in the United States, because we took advantage of this integration to reorganize our relations with our U.S. distributors.</p>
          <p>We now feel that our route to market, as we call it, is particularly efficient. Now, what about the brands performance? Okay, well, negative growth in the U.S. because it was a year of transition for one. Secondly, it was a year of economic crisis, which affected markets in general and of course the impact of on-trade, but it still happens that ABSOLUT is particularly important in the on-trade sector, because this is quite two-thirds of our volume is achieved.</p>
          <p>But if you look at the Nielsen off-trade figure, we're looking at negative growth of 4% which is not bad performance at all, elsewhere and everywhere else for that matter, the figures are -- figures in positive growth. Again looking at the Nielsen off-trade figures in virtually all our major countries, the brand has increased itself, very often increasing market share at the same time.</p>
          <p>So, I think, it can be said that the takeover of ABSOLUT has been successful despite the difficult backdrop, but there is no doubt about the fact that the objectives we had in buying ABSOLUT are about to be reached.</p>
          <p>Chivas and Ballantine now, first of all, the Scotch Whisky market, which was growing has now turned around, it's now in negative growth and that's reflected in our figures. Sales volume down 5%, revenue down 2% for Chivas, however premiumization is still marching on. Chivas 18 and 25 year old versions rose 2% whereas 12 year old Chivas saw its performance fall 6%. And that's been confirmed as recently this morning our subsidiary Chivas Brothers has put out a press release we are waiting for the figures actually.</p>
          <p>We now have confirmation of the fact that we are the leader in what we call the Ultra Premium sector that is 18 years old and older-- so that has since been confirmed only this morning in fact by the figures put out by our subsidiary.</p>
          <p>Go over the details very rapidly. In Asia, the market was down, particularly, in China because of de-stocking the Olympic Games effect Japan and duty free in Asia was particularly adversely affected.</p>
          <p>Conversely, we did particularly well in the Persian Gulf, which is a part of our Asia/Rest of World region and in Vietnam. In Europe situations contrasted, but somewhat difficult all the same and in the Americas, the U.S. did not fair well, but Latin America did do well.</p>
          <p>This brings to Ballantine's where the volume sales was down 4% and revenue down 5%. Ballantine's Finest lost ground in Spain, but won market share. The market was down 6%, we were only down 4%, meaning that we have won market share in Spain. We did however, do well in France, in fact Pernod did particularly well. We also did well in Central Europe, and Eastern Europe, North America and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>Now the Superior Qualities, which are the 17 year old version and older didn't do quite as well, largely due to Korea and the duty free market in Asia. But I think you're familiar with the difficulties on going in these markets.</p>
          <p>This brings me to Jameson. Jameson is one of those brand that could we called waterproof or in submersible; the volume sales up 2%, revenue up 8%. Okay, Ireland is in a crisis, Ireland being the native market of Jameson; but in the U.S., according to Nielsen up 28%, according to NABCA [National Alcohol Beverage Control Association] up 19%. And I'm sure there aren't many brands in the U.S. that can claim to have grown 20% or more over the year, but Jameson is one of the happy few, we're possibly &#x2013; maybe the only one in fact.</p>
          <p>In Europe there were difficulties in Ireland of course and indeed in the Untied Kingdom. The U.K. was one of the most severely hit markets of course growth in Eastern Europe and in Germany, stability in France.</p>
          <p>We also improved in South America, Australia and Latin America. So the brand has continued its development. The Glenlivet saw its volumes up at 5% and revenue up at 7%; double-digit growth in the U.S. according to Nielsen and NABCA. We also grew to a lesser extent in Asia, Latin America and Oceania and indeed in Europe.</p>
          <p>So when you look at these two brands, as I said earlier about, the Chivas I think we can claim that premiumization is still has a future. Our top brands are still expanding, still developing. I know there have been a number of questions on a number of targets, but yes, clearly with the Jameson growth isn't as strong as it was the pervious year. But Jameson is still doing wonderfully well as is the Glenlivet. We are convinced that when the economy turns around, these brands will be back to previous levels of growth.</p>
          <p>Martell, this is another example of premiumization. Volume and sales down 6%, but remember that we are reducing our volume over years; sales up, 12%. In particular -- we did particularly well in Asia, Singapore, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, among others. But we are -- and as I said last year, we are confirming consolidating our leadership in the ultra premium category and that's Cordon Bleu, XO and upwards.</p>
          <p>With ultra premium qualities beer and whiskey or cognac we are market leader. We have just become market leader for whiskey as I announced this morning, which is a good reflection of all the work we've put in.</p>
          <p>Havana Club saw its volume up 5% and revenue up 3%. Now this is fractionally down due to difficulties in Italy and Spain, which are markets that are not doing well. But it so happens that these are the markets where the proportion of the seven year old Havana Club is doing best. Now, difficult here for the seven year old version because these markets are having a very tough time, but if you look at markets like Germany our growth was in double-digits. Havana Club is now and by far the number one brand of rum. So we have markets that are particularly vibrant and Havana Club's performance is, I think, once again well, it's not the first time we haven't had WJ growth since 1993, but it still performing well.</p>
          <p>Ricard, volume down 3%, sales revenue down 2%. So the brand down slightly, and the off-trade volumes were flat, but because of the economic crisis and because of the ban on smoking on-trade, the idea of smoking a cigarette with a Ricard is just not working anymore because you can't smoke. Beefeater, the volume sales down 5%, revenue down 1%.</p>
          <p>Okay, these are not satisfactory volumes. But we have nonetheless gained in market share because in Spain where the situation is particularly clear and the U.S. we performed on a par with the market. There are three markets for gin, the U.K., the U.S. and Spain. Beefeater has done well, in fact has performed well in relation to its direct competitors. Malibu, volume down 9%; revenue down 7%. Kahlua's &#x2013; its volume down 15% and its revenue down 15% as well. The first thing I'd say and I think that is clearly in evidence by the WVSO's review.</p>
          <p>Liqueurs which was a very strong segment back in 2008 has completely reversed the trend. Malibu and Kahlua are liqueurs and liqueurs have seen the trend reversed. It was positive growth, it's now a negative growth.</p>
          <p>Okay, the market, the analyses are more complex, but I feel that modern liqueurs are used in cocktails. Cocktails are on-trade, as you know, which is probably one of the reasons that the market trend for liqueurs has been reversed. Now you can see how Malibu performed here. You have the figures under countries, but if you look at our figures, you'll see that shipments were down 15%, but Nielsen was flattened by plus 0.5%, that's clear evidence of de-stocking on the part of wholesalers, retailers.</p>
          <p>In Europe the situation is contrast as one country to another. Some countries up, others down, I'm not going into detail. We have also performed well in Latin America and Oceania. Broadly speaking these are two regions that have faired well over the last year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Kahlua in the U.S., once again shipments down 18%, Nielsen down a mere 5%, so difficult market clearly, but again very clearly de-stocking has played an important part in our negative performance, of course elsewhere which -- the markets which are much smaller are down slightly.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the wines industry. But we're really happy with our performance because as Jacob's Creek for the volumes down 2% and revenue was flat. This shows that any difficult market, we have successfully defended the value of our business.</p>
          <p>This is particularly clear in the U.K., which is one of the biggest market for imported wines, but also one of the most important market for Jacob's Creek. While in the U.K., we have won market share without jeopardizing prices. That's a strategy that we have rolled out very intentionally, that our British subsidiaries with Orlando Wyndham, our brand owner. The figures are on the screen, there is no need to comment them. I think, likewise in the U.S. for Nielsen was down 8 and 1% entry in our figures respectively.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Montana, figures are quite as good as Jacob's Creek, but if you look at the U.S. shipments down 25%, Nielsen up 8%. Here again clear evidence of de-stocking. So good resilience of our wines portfolio in a difficult market.</p>
          <p>Champagne, well Mumm, so it's volume and sales down 4% and its revenue up 3%. Again this is a clear demonstration of how successful our value strategy is. Maybe we should underline the performance of France and the carat of our network, Mumm has become the leader in terms of value for champagnes in France, a remarkable performance. This is after several years of prices increasing including over the last year. In fact our -- the Mumm prices increased over the last 12 months. So this value strategy has continued to be rollout.</p>
          <p>Perrier Jou&#xEB;t a brand that is much more exposed to the U.S. I think its half of the volumes, but very unsuccessful because the champagne is in a disastrous situation in the United States. The trend is negative. It's an -- even in double-digits. Perrier Jou&#xEB;t has not outperformed the market even though we have a number of satisfactions in Europe in market such as the UK. But the U.S., I think has been the strongest or most important single market for Perrier Jou&#xEB;t.</p>
          <p>This brings me to local brands. We don't often talk about them but from time-to-time, I think, we should comment their performance. Now these local brands are very often brands that mean that we have critical size in certain markets. And our local brands have resisted well.</p>
          <p>Volumes are successful. We have done well down to near 1%. The share of imported international brands is low when you have 300% customs duties on imported brands. Clearly imported brands are unaffordable but Royal Stag saw its sales up 22%.</p>
          <p>Other brands have followed exactly the same trend. So we have very strong growth drivers in India. Royal Stag up 22%, as I said. Likewise the brand, Something Special in Latin America up 18%. Wyborowa is not priority now that we have ABSOLUT we are still continuing to grow and up 17%. Clan Campbell up 8% in the France. And remember that we have gained market share in the whisky sector in France.</p>
          <p>We have two more difficult markets I just mentioned in passing, Imperial, which had a difficult time in Korea. The Korean market faired a very poor in, but it would appear that the market might pick up. It would appear that South Korea is beginning to do a little bit better, but Thailand I can't see anything &#x2013; any good news on the horizon but 100 Pipers is a quite simply a brand that is affected by the political and economic context in Thailand, which has unfortunately continued to be as difficult over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the end of our portfolio overview. And I'm now going to give the floor to Gilles Bogaert to tell us how that transmogrifies in the accounts.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pierre. I'm going to walk you through our statement of income. We have the key figures some of these figures were given in Pierre's presentation. I'm going to highlight the margin here. You see the jump from 21 to 25.6% ascribable to the V&amp;S integration and also ascribable to the good resiliency of our historical business up 4%. So, I walk you through the various lines of this consolidated income statement.</p>
          <p>First of all, we focus on foreign exchange and scope effects. Interestingly, Forex has a positive effect on PRO whereas it has a negative effect on sales. This is due to the fact that sterling and the Australian dollar weakened against the euro and these two currencies are currencies of country where we have considerable costs, especially true for whisky in Great Britain and for wine in Australia.</p>
          <p>The favorable scope impact on PRO, which we see right here &#x20AC;205 million, that is ascribed to the V&amp;S contribution &#x20AC;272 million, after a little over 11 months and the negative impact of disposals and the termination of Stolichnaya which amounted to 67 million.</p>
          <p>So, while we are speaking about Vin&amp;Sprit scope effects. This is the opportunity to look at synergies. We are confirming the total amount of synergies that we announced &#x20AC;150 million broken down as follows, &#x20AC;70 million for the distribution margin. These are the margins that we now pick up because the brand is indeed in our network in the U.S., where it was formerly distributed by Fortune Brands. And where it was formerly distributed by Maxxium Brand, we did not pick up the margins. Now we do.</p>
          <p>Structure of synergies &#x20AC;80 million, essentially due to the move to the ABSOLUT company, our brand owner now. Also savings across the V&amp;S network, notably the U.S. as far as ABSOLUT is concerned and there are synergies on the local Scandinavian and Polish businesses of Vin&amp;Sprit.</p>
          <p>The other piece of good news is that these synergies are achieved sooner than expected. In late June, we had &#x20AC;110 million in the synergies. In other words, most of the synergies have already have been achieved given the very swift integration of the brand in our networks.</p>
          <p>Gross margin after logistics costs, here I have to highlight two items. First of all the gross margin rate, which has enjoyed the contribution of ABSOLUT, which is highly profitable, also Forex has been good to us with the weakening of the dollar.</p>
          <p>In terms of organic growth, outside the scope effect, as you can see, there is a slight slackening there, similar to that of sales. It's good news actually, we did not suffer, anything unfavorable in our margin against sales, in spite of the rise in cost of some of our raw materials, glass which of course is critical to us, had price hikes given the lack of capacity, same thing for cereal, grain.</p>
          <p>And in spite of those price hikes, we've been able to sustain the trend of our cost containment. Of course, you understand that a great many cost containment efforts have been made, pooled procurement across the globe for most of our categories.</p>
          <p>Advertising and promotion expenditure, the ratio over sales dropped from 17.9 to 17.2%. 17.2% remains high, and as you can see organically, excluding ABSOLUT, there is 7% decline in investment. There are several items here, first of all, declining cost of media. We reallocated our investments on to priority areas. We reduced level activity on on-trade. And overall we focused our investments on brand market combination with the highest potentials. So, we invested less in lower priority brands and on lower priority markets. But by and large, we bolstered our strategic brands.</p>
          <p>The investment on our strategic brands accounts for 23% of sales. And roughly three quarters of the total investment of the Pernod Ricard Groups. So the priority of these brands is clearly seen in these investments. Take a good look its easy to see.</p>
          <p>Contribution after A&amp;P, which results from what we've just seen. You can see, the ratio is jumping there from 33 -- 39.3 to 41.2%. Structure costs, I'd like to point out two important things, first of all, the structure costs of our sales ratio dropped from 16.2 to 15.6%, 15.6% is probably one of the most competitive ratios in our industry.</p>
          <p>The contributions of Vin&amp;Sprit, the synergies we've accomplished have enabled us to achieve this historically low ratio. Also in the Pernod Ricard scope, structure costs did not grow organically at all which is very good. We have been able to respond effectively and efficiently to the crisis. We made the necessary adjustments.</p>
          <p>So this of course -- there were structure cost increases in China and India, but we've really shaved structure costs in many other countries. And this is the fruit of a painstaking procurement policy and a great adjustments made in countries where head count was adjusted. So therefore, we've been very responsive to the crisis.</p>
          <p>So, profit from recurring operations jumped sharply 250 basis points, up 4% organically. Of course, the scope impact, the contribution of Vin&amp;Sprit has helped us achieve this 21% in PRO growth, but you see that organically there is growth and Forex has been good, as well.</p>
          <p>Now we spoke about the margin. Now let's take a look at the regions that have helped to generate this organic growth of our profit from recurring operations. While, no region is in the red, while there one where the color is red, it's Europe. But Europe, did achieve an increase in PRO over the period.</p>
          <p>Overall the growth was driven by Asia and Rest of the World on one hand and by France on the other. There was a slowdown in the America's, but we managed to sustain our profit from recurring operations there. Not only because the year was difficult in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Asia/RoW [Rest of the World] key numbers, here you see a 7% drop in organic growth of profit from recurring operations, driven by a 2% rise in sales and optimization of our investments and costs and a reported 17% increase in PRO. This stems from a very strong organic growth in China, which was enhanced by highly favorable mix quality effect for Martell, which Pierre elaborated on. India also drove growth, with its local brands Royal Stag and Blenders Pride.</p>
          <p>Good performance in Australia, South Africa and Middle East, and all this has made it possible to more than offset the hardship we experienced in South Korea; probably the most hardly hit market in this crisis. And there was difficulty in Thailand and on the Duty Free market. The Duty Free market is of course very much connected to the Korean clientele customers, right there and also there was a highly favorable Forex impact.</p>
          <p>Overall, looking at the Americas, sales roughly flat, a slight dip in gross margin 2%, the U.S. was different from the other countries in the region. The U.S. market was difficult, as already mentioned there was a drop in consumption, namely on trade. There were retailer depletions, and also it was a transition year, the integration of Vin&amp;Sprit, the route to market change, which was brought about in March, so it's quite recent.</p>
          <p>And in spite of these difficulties, there was very good performance in the case of Jameson and the Glenlivet, premium brands definitely. And the operating margin grew sharply, from 24.8 to 31.4%, essentially driven by ABSOLUT in the U.S. Outside the U.S., the year proved very good both in Latin America and Canada.</p>
          <p>Europe, excluding France, the year was tough in Western Europe. Overall you can see that PRO jumped 1% with organic &#x2013; with organic sales around 3%. We had to make adjustments in number of countries notably in Spain and Ireland, so Western Europe was tough, as I was saying. Nevertheless, performance was good on certain markets, that were nonetheless hit by the crisis, Germany, Benelux, Sweden and Spain, which is hit hard, was a market where we gained market share in both whisky and gin.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, there was good performance overall, notably in Russia and Poland, but however there was a strong churn reversal between H1 and H2 from strong growth in Russia to a drop, which was furthered by the weakening of the ruble. You see the PRO over sales dropped from 24.5 to 21% due to the integration of the local brands namely Vin&amp;Sprit Scandinavian Local brands who's operating margin is lower than that of a restaurant portfolio.</p>
          <p>France, fine performance indeed a 2% rise in sales and a 12% jump in profit from recurring operations in spite of difficult economic backdrop. Ballantine's, Mumm, Clan Campbell are the key brands that drove the growth in France. And the growth also stems from the optimization of our cost base and from a shift to off-trade hence the 12%.</p>
          <p>Overall, looking at the geographic regions, I think it's fair to say that the most notable change is the weight of the Americas in our profitable recurring operations. You can see the last year, the Americas accounted for 27%. Now the Americas account for 34% and this of course is ascribed to ABSOLUT.</p>
          <p>Let's focus on the new economies, emerging markets. You see they now account for roughly one-third of our business, 31% to be precise against 29% last year. Organic sales growth amounting to 9% in these countries over the fiscal period and interestingly these countries are just as profitable as the mature markets because in terms of PRO you see that these countries account for 31% as well. This is very good news to us. We are very much exposed to these markets, which is good and this warrants future growth for the group. Without a doubt, this will be one of the drivers of our growth in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>So, we're still walking down the income statement here, first of all financial income, now financing costs increased of course due to the V&amp;S acquisition, average cost to debt 4.8% as the average cost of borrowing, which is quite competitive. We enjoyed lower interest rates as well as excellent terms for our syndicated loan, which we negotiated in the V&amp;S acquisition. Other financial expenses well essentially the amortization of bank charges, which we paid and looking to the implementation of syndicated loan and there were also expenses for the pension plans, the balance there is &#x20AC;23 million negative whereas we were roughly flat at zero last year this essentially results from the asset returns that went south.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow as Pierre said we are looking at &#x20AC;1.3 billion cash flow from recurring operations and free cash flow little over 1 billion. This is due to our cash flow performance, which is inline with our PRO, strong decline in working capital requirement, will come back to that in a moment and further containment of industrial costs. Here you have industrial investments net of disposal we have &#x20AC;20 million in spite the V&amp;S integration and next year we shall decrease them roughly &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
          <p>So the strong swing in working capital requirement was critical you see the &#x20AC;246 million drop there against the 533 million increase last year, there are three items that account for this. First of all the implementation of our factoring plan and the disposal of our receivables that amounted to &#x20AC;351 million overall as at the 30 of June, we really contained the growth of our ageing inventories for cognacs and whiskies and previous years we had to buy quite a lot for our ageing cognac. So in our ageing inventories we generated savings to the tune of &#x20AC;140 million against last year.</p>
          <p>And then there was a decline in our operating working capital requirement for two reasons essentially, our optimization efforts regarding the control of our finished products stocks, the collection of our receivables and lower business in Q4 as against Q4 '07, '08.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look at our debt in greater detail now. Between the beginning of the, our fiscal year opening of the fiscal year and close so you have the pro forma initial debt which factors in the financing of V&amp;S acquisition a little over &#x20AC;12 billion. You see the &#x20AC;1 billion in free cash flow that I just mentioned the difference between the operating free cash flow and free cash flow is essentially non-recurring cash items, restructuring and so on. And the impact of pension plans. And then you have the positive impact of the disposals &#x20AC;373 million that's over acquisitions but over the fiscal year we made more disposal acquisitions of course. &#x20AC;700 million, you have here the difference between the capital increase &#x20AC;1 billion and the &#x20AC;300 million dividend paid out over the period, and there was a negative impact due to Forex or debt related Forex because the euros was worth $1.58 in June '08, and we closed at 1.41, closed the year that is. So all these items enabled us to significantly push net debt or EBITDA down. It was at 6.2 pro forma after the V&amp;S acquisition and in late June '09, we stand at 5.3. And this is inline with our requirements of our syndicated loan covenants. So you see it's sharply down, and this is clear evidence of the fact that we were able to shed quite a lot of debt off over the period.</p>
          <p>This &#x20AC;10.8 billion debt, while the gross debt is 11.5 to be precise; and we have &#x20AC;520 million in cash. So we're looking at 1.5 billion in undrawn credit from our syndicated loan. You see the key maturity is in 2013 here, &#x20AC;7.2 billion that's our syndicated loan right there. So we're of course preparing for the refinancing of our debt, notably by pursuing our bond issue, a program, which we started in order to anticipate our refinancing need. And ultimately, our aim is to balance out our banking debt and our bond debt.</p>
          <p>A word about the breakdown? One third of the debt is under valuable rate, you have the numbers right here. Our capped variable rates are actually fixed rates, because we pay the rates that are connected to our &#x2013; the caps of our callers.</p>
          <p>Tax, income tax rate was 16.6 in the case of our recurring operations, a significant drop from the previous year. And this is directly connected to the V&amp;S acquisition. Next year we are anticipating a rate that would be similar to that of last year. That is to say around 21 or 22%, given the debt alleviation and the interest expense reduction achieved.</p>
          <p>So income tax on non-recurring items can't really be analyzed in terms of rates, because there Forex losses and so on, essentially non-recurring item. So this some Forex losses can be deductible and they are not necessarily posted in the consolidated accounts, so it doesn't make much sense to compare apples and oranges here.</p>
          <p>So very quickly here, minority interest. This is the balance of the companies where we have minority shareholders Havana Club, Corby and JBC in Korea. Other items, all of this stems from the brands that were disposed. These were the brands that we had acquired with the &#x2013; that we disposed of during the period; and the share of the results from Fortune Brands before the termination from the JV. So the attributable net profit from recurring operations is &#x20AC;1.10 billion, a historic high as Pierre mentioned, and that is 13% increased from the previous period for all the reasons that we've elaborated on in some detail.</p>
          <p>Per share diluted number &#x2013; well the diluted number is up 10% on a like-for-like basis. We had the dilutive impact of the capital increase and that is factored into the EPS for '08, '09 but its pro rated. So in other words only a month and half of the impact that period of course we will be hit by the full year impact of that next year.</p>
          <p>As I already mentioned in April 2009, where we announced the capital increase, we shall pay out a dividend, and we shall distribute free shares. At the AGM we're going into move a &#x20AC;0.50 dividend which is the remaining portion of the interim already paid out and we're going to have a 1-for-50 free share distribution. So we're going to move that at the AGM that of course is part of the share capital increase by capitalization of reserves to be carried out by the end of the 2009 calendar year. All this is part and parcel of the efforts that we are making to alleviate our debt.</p>
          <p>For fiscal '09, '10 we are going to move back to the previous policy of distributing about one-third of the net profit from recurring operations in cash.</p>
          <p>Very briefly now, non-recurring items excluding financial items. Non-recurring items amounted to &#x20AC;89 million in expenditure. There is a positive impact of the disposals Wild Turkey, Bisquit, &#x20AC;225 million. There is a negative impact &#x20AC;146 million, essentially from impairment of the Spanish wines that we bought back in the Allied Domecq territory so they impaired them to their fair value. And we also have exceptional expenses due to Vin&amp;Sprit acquisition namely the termination of the distribution agreements that's &#x20AC;48 million namely in Brazil, Greece as far as our U.S., the U.S. distributors and a number of acquisition costs namely the restructuring costs that we had to bear worldwide.</p>
          <p>Other elements in the Pernod Ricard historical scope are overall negligible. And we have &#x20AC;71 million in non-recurring financial expenses. This is due to Forex, time value interest rate hedges and accelerated amortization of fees among other things. So, the net attributable profit is &#x20AC;945 million, which marks a 13% increase.</p>
          <p>So, I am going to hand over to Pierre for the conclusion and outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gilles. That was a very detailed analysis and clear evidence of the fact that our fundamentals are very strong. So I'm not going to continue talking about '08, '09, which is a very satisfying period as you've just heard but let's rather not look at the future.</p>
          <p>Before this year, we expect the economic environment to continue to be difficult particularly in the spirits market. Now, when you read the papers, we read about some positive signs here and there in a number of countries. But, I still don't feel that that will be immediately in evidence in our figures not in our accounts as in the past the economic crisis begins to rise its head before we have ever feel the effect in our accounts. There is always this lag between the signs and the actual figures in the account.</p>
          <p>So our idea is that, we have to be ready to endure a market that will continue to be difficult over the next year. Even though as in the last year the situations will vary from one market to another. China and India are posting growth and will continue to post strong growth. Markets like Ireland or the U.K. will probably remain very difficult markets.</p>
          <p>However, I wouldn't like you to overlook the fact that when you analyze our results for the year, I wouldn't like you to overlook the fact, that's why we don't expect anything in particular in the first half year. But you'll be comparing us with figures that were up very sharply last year. So do bear that in mind when you compare our first half year '08, '09 with the previous half year.</p>
          <p>And we expect to be down in this forthcoming even in the second half year, the comparison will work much more sharply in our favor. So I think the profile for the next year will be exactly the opposite to the last 12 months. Last 12 months, the first half was good, the second half was poor and the year to come, I expect the opposite.</p>
          <p>And we are confident about the forthcoming year and this is in the form of the attitude because quite simply, we have a strategy that is well established. We have strengths that we're confident about the first of these being the reach of our worldwide network. I think we have the biggest network in the industry. There is a great strength in the emerging countries, which are doing well -- very well as you heard from Gilles. Then there is of course our brand portfolio and I can confirm that we are absolutely convinced that the premium brands are the ones that will benefit most from economic recovery. These are brands we need to invest in.</p>
          <p>I would also like to stress the importance of our decentralized business model. You've seen how well our subsidiaries reacted be it in cost containment or management of working capital. So our subsidiaries are very quick to react because our country managers are empowered, call it what you want, but it's a form of empowerment. This is why they can react so quickly. And I think that this year we have shown that isn't a just a lip service, it is something that is very, very real.</p>
          <p>For the year to come our ambition is clearly to reinvest in our brands. When I say reinvest, I mean, increase the amount we are investing in them. If you look at last year over the last 12 months we continued to invest in the first half of the year but we decreased our A&amp;P investment in the second half of the year. Now we want to invest once again but we'll see how the markets go but I hope that we will be able to increase our A&amp;P expenditure in our strategic brands.</p>
          <p>Now we have a number of initiatives planned Mumm, Jacob's Creek, Chivas, Havana Club, new campaigns for ABSOLUT, Malibu, Jameson not forgetting the Chivalry campaign with Chivas. It's a campaign that was launched recently, but will be completely rolled out very soon, and of course with the -- not just in advertising, but in the digital advertising and so on. We have a lot of new projects in the marketing projects -- projects that is in the pipeline. Not just in digital, but we do have in fact quite a lot of plans for digital advertising which is now part and parcel of our advertising strategy.</p>
          <p>So as you can see our ambitions are very clear, we're focusing on strategic brands. No question of letting up investment in these brands. Elsewhere as Gilles has already said, we will continue as we did last year to roll out a whole series of measures with a view to containing costs be it in raw materials, structure costs, wage policy. We have a wage policy for all our senior executives. We have also got plans to continue to achieve synergies in our income statement or from P&amp;L as you prefer.</p>
          <p>We also have a syndicated loan and the interest rate situation is such that we will continue to reduce our debt, which we expect to be at an average of 4.5%. All this of course will have a positive effect or positive effects should I say on our P&amp;L. The group's priorities are now perfectly clear. First of all to strengthen our advertising and promotion expenditure in the strategic brand. Secondly to continue to de-leverage the group, through disposal of assets. We plan to continue this asset disposal program, and we plan to continue to generate free cash flow. We've generated some &#x20AC;1 billion in the free cash flow over the last three years, a 1 billion a year. There are three priorities.</p>
          <p>Now, as is now customary, I know last year was very topsy-turvy. But I think and things are gradually getting back to normal and we too are let's say, getting back to business as usual. We will announce our guidance for the year at our AGM, our shareholders meeting. Gives little time to see how things are developing. So, business as usual from now on, and we will give you our guidance for the year on November the 2nd, next at our AGM.</p>
          <p>You now have the floor for questions and answers. Now, we're going alternate between questions from the auditorium and questions online. Procedure is always the same, just introduce yourself, you can tell us who you represent and ask one or two questions. No more please, because we only have half an hour. We must give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask a question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Antoine Belge from HSBC. I have two questions. First of all, you talked about a lag, the lag between the recovery of the economy and the impact on your accounts. But what is your analysis of consumer trends? Do you think when the economy improves consumers will revert to the same type of consumption? Somewhat ostentatious consumption as in the past or will premiumization resume at a slower pace than in the past?</p>
          <p>My second question concerns your communication spend. You said you will continue to defend your brands but on the other hand, you have said that the period will be in two halves, the first and second half year. But in the first half year, will we see A&amp;P &#x2013; the A&amp;P spend continue to be the variable that enables you to defend your results or will you anticipate an upturn in the market by sacrificing your margins in the short-term with a view to investing more in A&amp;P?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning the second part of your question. I have to say straightaway that I can't go into any details here. If I were go into the details of our P&amp;L it would be tantamount to giving you a very detailed guidance. No, we broadly speaking we intend to increase our spend over the year. We'll see how that pans out.</p>
          <p>Your other question is fundamentally, are we going to be faced with a change in consumption trends. And my answer to that is, no. No, it's not going to be a change in consumer trends because with products such as spirits or with brands in particular consumers are very attached to their brands. If I could give you a few figures to bear that out, in the very recent months there has not been any large-scale transfer from premium brands to less premium brands. The variances are a handful of percentage points but there is no large-scale transfer towards non-premium brand. Even the transfer from on-trade to off-trade is something I think temporary.</p>
          <p>Consumers have less disposable income, they are more inclined to save or at least eat out or dine out or go to bars less often, but when the situation changes and consumers have more disposable income we are all human beings, we are sociable human beings and we will go out, eat out, dine out and be back on trade. However something I think is very important and I mentioned it to you earlier on, we won't be selling our brands to our consumers quite simply because we're here, we will have to arouse their curiosity.</p>
          <p>And four, brands of spirits, which are, do not change, if you look at how our marketing campaigns are changed, look at Chivas for example we began with Chivas Life, which was a very successful campaign. Campaign we launched around, unless I'm mistaken, early 2003 but now we have -- now evolved that towards a campaign called Chivalry using different values more ethical values such as gallantry, team spirit, more chivalrous values. So constantly developing and evolving our campaigns.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you another example ABSOLUT as you know was very successfully launched particularly with its In An ABSOLUT World campaign that was Vin&amp;Sprit's invention by the way. But they had that in the pipeline, the In An ABSOLUT World campaign. And you will see it from this autumn onwards; they have now got a campaign called In An ABSOLUT World 2.0, which is version two of the In An ABSOLUT World campaign. I'd love to be able to show it to you now but there is an embargo on it so we'll have to wait a few weeks more before I can show it to you. But it's a marvelous video that we feel will have an impact, a big impact. So, the answer is there will be no structural change in the way consumer trends are going but brand owners such as ours, will have to continue to arouse consumers' curiosity through campaigns. This is exactly what we plan to do for the year to come.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Fran&#xE7;ois Digard from Natixis Securities. I have three questions if I may. First of all, you told us that the structural costs are particularly lower, one of the lowest in the industry, do you nonetheless plan to continue to reduce or improve that ratio? Secondly, appreciation of the Spanish assets, could you comment that and/or elaborate on that? Could this be for leading up to a disposal? And then you recorded a figure of 21% one of the main economic features in the acquisition of Vin&amp;Sprit was underpinned by this, could you comment that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am going to answer about Domecq Bodegas and Gilles will answer your other two questions. Concerning Domecq Bodegas, I think situation is very clear. We have stopped any global sale of Domecq Bodegas, because we felt that we would not achieve the price we feel they're worth, so we've changed the way we do this. Domecq Bodegas, which was accountable to Spain is now directly accountable to our European holding under Laurent Lacassagne, former Chairman of Orlando Wyndham Pacific, who is very familiar with the wine sector.</p>
          <p>We've also appointed a new managing director, a seasoned senior executive from within the group, so a couple of changes there; given our ambition to develop these brands internationally and particularly the flagship brand, the Campo Viejo. This doesn't mean that we won't be doing a bit of thinning here and a bit of pruning there. But we will be whittling down the portfolio somewhat. But, broadly speaking as regards disposals, let's be perfectly clear about this, I will never be obliged to sale. We have &#x20AC;300 million worth of assets to dispose of; that's the ambition, but if we do not reach the price we feel they're worth, we will not sell them off below their value</p>
          <p>That's for disposals. Now Gilles will maybe answer your other questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning structured costs, our ambition is clearly to avoid organic growth of structured cost. We expect that to be flat this year. Our ambition for next year is to continue to limit internal growth of structural costs. We will continue next year with what we did this year. We have trimmed structural costs in a number of countries already, but this is something we could continue to do. So a very disciplined wage structure. We have very clear directives that have been decided by our management committee. The whole series of measures, as I said, that will enable us to contain our structure costs.</p>
          <p>As a result of that, ratios will improve depending on revenues, but as we are not giving any guidance on our top-line, I can't give you any guidance about the ratio. I am sure you will understand that. As for the rate of income tax, yes, I think we have to distinguish between the effective rate and the accounting rate. Yes, the cash rate will be below 20%. I think that's the figure you're quoting. We expect a cash rate in the region of 19%, that's income tax rate of 19%. The effective rate between this year and next year has been anticipated and mechanically it depends on de-leveraging and other factors, which of course are the constituent factors behind our rate of income tax this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions please. Firstly, you mentioned the strength that you are continuing to see in China. Have you seen any evidence at all of a weakening in the on-trade? And the second question was, given your focus on de-leveraging, I was a little surprised to see the increase in the cash dividend payout for next fiscal year. Can you talk a little bit about the logic of raising that payout so soon? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[French] . I'll take the question on China. Concerning imported brands in China, maybe not all, but most consumptions on-trade in China as a result performance of our brands is a reflection of the on-trade sector's performance. As things stand, there is no sign of a major change in on-trade performance. Earlier this year, the third quarter was possibly weaker than previous quarters and if anything the situation is improving slightly now. But I think this is a very good reflection of the microeconomic indicators we have for China. And let me stress this, we're still growing. We have never seen negative growth in China -- negative growth of consumption that is, in recent times. Well, that's the trend in China and the answer to your question is no, no sign of a downturn of any description. What about the dividend, Gilles, what would you like to say, how are you going to manage this cash out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I could remind you that the fact that the dividend is limited to $0.50, which what we will propose at the next AGM. That's -- this will enable us to achieve a cash saving, but otherwise, I think we would be doing as we -- you all know. This is an exceptional situation, given the fact that we are in an exceptional environment, this was -- there was never any question of this dividend situation...</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody, it's Simon Hales from Evolution. Two questions if I can. The first, just going back to the A&amp;P spend, where you currently said for the top 15 brands in the year that you spent 23% of sales on those brands. I am just wondering what that ratio would have been in 2008. And then further to that obviously you say, Pierre, that you expect A&amp;P spend to rise in the current fiscal year. Do you also expect it to rise as a percentage of sales, or you just expect the absolute level to rise?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just thinking about overall top line trends, I am just wondering that since the year-end if you've noticed any improvement in the trend rates I am thinking of in the rate of trading down perhaps slowing in some of your markets? Whether you'll start to see signs of stabilization in the shift to the on-trade, a shift to the off-trade from the on-trade. And related to that, back in May, Pierre, you did say at the Investor Day that you thought sales would be flat to negative in fiscal 2010. I know you aren't giving any firm guidance at this stage, but is there anything to suggest at this stage that your views there have changed significantly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is a very broad-based question. And if I were to answer that in detail for all our regions that would take quite some time. But let me just glance over that with the two or three comments. I'm going to work on the second half of your question. As for any transfer towards the on-trade or off-trade, I think, I can't see the situation deteriorating any further. I can't see the on-trade deteriorating anymore by comparison with the off-trade. As for the off-trade segment, well all I can do is look at the panel indicators we get for our various markets. I think what I can say is that it would appear that the market is steadying -- as that's as the on-trade segment is still in a negative trend. All I can say is that at best it will be stable or maybe down fractionally but that's the trend as we see it now with the panel of figures for the end of July or in some cases the end of August. This is an ongoing, it's a living organism almost, so I can't give you anymore than a vague snapshot at a given moment of time.</p>
          <p>As for the A&amp;P ratios, I'm going to let Gilles answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm very fortunate, I found the answer to that question. Last year, for our top 15 excluding ABSOLUT, that would have been 23.6%, so from 23.6% we are down to 23% for the top 15, which is a decrease of 4 percentage points. That's internal growth was we said it will be 7% for the overall portfolio, clear illustration of the fact that we have given the pride of place to our top 15. The downturn for other brands was much sharper. So we have clearly targeted the top 14 because of their potential, that's clearly I think borne out by those figures. Back to the question, room for another question.</p>

          <p>There is a question from Mr. Chris Wickham from MainFirst.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> two questions please. First one concerning costs, compared to last year the ocean trade routes have dropped a lot, grain is cheaper, glass is still rising. The net impact seen for the next year &#x2013; are you expecting neutral, perhaps a little bit of a benefit next year on the costs.</p>
          <p>And the second question Pierre, back to China, could you give us a little bit color on why Scotch seemed to be weak and cognac has continued to be strong in China. And what do you think is the difference in dynamics between the two categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Gilles?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding costs, certain commodities are expected to drop next year. Certain commodities have been stored. You store the grain for whisky, so the impact on your income statement is not immediate from a cash standpoint; you're quite right, and the price of grain has indeed dropped.</p>
          <p>Regarding glass now, we did absorb single digit high growth &#x2013; last year would have been &#x2013; the impact would have greater had we not set up our pooling efforts. Next year as far as glass concerned, we are contemplating a smaller increase than in the previous year.</p>
          <p>So overall, we are contemplating a smaller rise in the cost of commodities than in the year elapsed. I'm not talking about a reduction; I'm talking about a slower rise. We had 4 % this year. It should be somewhat below that moving forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the compared dynamics of whisky and cognac in China, is a rather involved question. But I think I can share a few facts with you. First of all, consumer areas are not quite the same. Cognac is popular in the south, whisky is popular in the center and north of China. And in the year elapsed there were two events that bore on whisky consumption. First of all, the earthquake in the Sichuan, which brought consumption to a grinding halt for several weeks or even months because it was a rather devastating earthquake. And the second item, which had an odd unanticipated adverse effect was the Olympics, because the Chinese authorities shut down all the on-trade establishments during the Olympic games. Why, maybe for law and order reasons. We were expecting great consumption and it was the opposite. So, those are two key one-off items.</p>
          <p>The second thing I'd like to say has to do with our initiatives. We've realized that our Chivas Life campaign was not quite as effective towards the end, which is why we've needed this new Chivas Chivalry campaign, and all the indicators we have show the popular acclaim of this new campaign of ours. So we are hoping that this will translate into our sales. But it's like a hot air balloon. It takes a while to actually grasp the impact of a campaign you launch.</p>
          <p>But you see we are launching that initiative because you constantly have to sustain the appeal of your brands to your customers. And regarding cognac, you need to understand that it is an established value in the minds of Chinese in consumers whereas whisky is far more recent. It's fair to say that we created the whiskey market in China with Chivas, where we started it all in 2002. So whisky consumption is somewhat more susceptible to economic swings than cognac, which is more established, as I say. But we are the clear leader for higher categories of cognac, Cordon Bleu, XO and so on, and Noblige was introduced successfully. Noblige is a VSOP plus, but the Chinese consider it's a category in and of itself. And Noblige has been outstandingly successful when introduced in China. So, that gives you a picture, and of course we have to decipher what's going on in the minds of our consumers. But of course, we have experts working on...</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. Just two things, leading on from Simon's question about the A&amp;P and the portion of the spend on the top 15 brands. I mean, clearly it's very difficult if you hold that spend firm, at the same time as having a reduction of 70 basis points in your spend for that not to leave those brands that aren't out there effectively being milked. I mean, is that what's going on? And then the second thing, I was just wondering when you're going again if you're, just clarifying on working capital, how much flexibility you have going forward with that working capital on a regional basis. I mean, whether some regions where you can make much better improvements than other simply because of the nature of the distribution structure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the A&amp;P, well [French] .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, regarding A&amp;P we curtail the cost more for the non-strategic brands, for the strategic brands, which makes good sense and it is in line with our strategy. I can let you do the arithmetic. We reduced investments more sharply for the other brands. And for the strategic brands, nevertheless, we have 100, 150 brands in the portfolio. So, of course, it makes sense that smaller brands are not as heavily invested.</p>
          <p>Regarding working capital requirement, there are two different structural elements here. First of all, there is WCR connected to strategic stocks, which we've optimized considerably. We shall further optimize that without jeopardizing our brands' growth potential in any way, because that is what helps us generate the sales of the future. So we of course invest in the brands. So the growth -- so as for distillation campaigns and the Oeu de vie purchases are not connected to what's going on here and now. Regarding foreign capital requirement for other elements, we shall further optimize worldwide. First of all the optimization of our supply chain, for our finished products regarding the collection of receivables and will be just as painstaking as far as receivables collection is concerned being given the uncertainty of the economic situations. So we'll continue our efforts in that vein. And the WCR reduction we've enjoyed this year for a number of reasons that I explained and also there was lower business in Q4. So of course, if when the danger on the rocks has passed and business recovers, there will be a -- an impact on working capital requirement.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen; two questions. Firstly on the foreign currency outlook for FY'10, I wonder if you can give us a little bit more guidance. So obviously the dollars looks negative and some of those import cost issues in sterling and Australian dollar are probably looking less beneficial in FY'10. And the second question, you talked little about cost containment as we look at FY'10 and clearly France seems to have benefited in FY '09 from that. Can you give us some idea of the materiality what that could mean for the P&amp;L in FY'10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the second part of your question very briefly. Once again if we start delving into the detail in each of the lines of our income statement I might as well disclose all the information we have right now. I think we'll give you more detailed information as we move along in time. But quite clearly, let me say this, in our glass procurement we have been calling for tenders. We've been of course taking advantage of our volume effect with the execution of ABSOLUT and now we are negotiating better glass procurement terms. I won't go any further. I am just using this as one example, so I am just demonstrating that this is not wishful thinking. We are indeed launching concrete initiatives to contain costs.</p>
          <p>Also I would like to state that we are fully de-centralized when it comes to the enforcement of our marketing and commercial strategies. But we pool quite a few functions, and procurement is one of them. And when we are calling for tenders we are doing this group-wide, obviously. We are not going to let our brand owners or producers fend for themselves out on the market. So that is centralized, it has been and it will be moving forward, same thing for cash.</p>
          <p>I lost my lapel mike says the CEO. Here we go.</p>
          <p>So this group is de-centralized, but where and whenever necessary we pool and that is how we go about containing costs. Regarding Forex, Gilles?</p>

          <p>Obviously, in building our budget we factored in a few numbers that are necessarily different from what we're observing or different from what may happen. Anyway, we considered debt to foreign currency based on cash flow. So if there is a favorable impact on debt, there would be an unfavorable effect on results and vice versa as was the case this year.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Just two quick ones from me. Firstly, in terms of the guidance on the coupon of the interest. I think your predecessor, Gilles, was talking about close to 4%, it's now moved to 4.5. So, just wondering whether that's conservativism on your part or whether something has changed within that. And the second question, it looks like your organic A&amp;P sale &#x2013; to sales ratio in Asia and the rest of the world was down about 330 basis points in H2. So just wondering what the sort of weighted average inflation or deflation in media was across that geography? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, while your question on exchange coupon. Well, I don't know when Emmanuel Babeau made a forecast on that ,the things change every day. Let me tell you what we have now. The average cost of borrowing that is to say excluding pension plans is around 4.5%. Of course, if it would go along in that we'd be very happy. But this is &#x2013; our interpretation of the yield curve as it stands. So syndicated loans, we're looking at 130 basis points. Our debt reduction has been swifter than anticipated. And of course, we are contemplating a possible bond issue. This could have an impact on customer financing although it would be marginal for the whole debt. So 4.5 is our best shot as we speak.</p>
          <p>Regarding A&amp;P and Asia, the explanation is quite simple. On the one hand, as far as China is concerned, as you may have noted, our growth was driven to a certain extent by Martell as explained earlier, and the unit of value of Martell is extremely high. And oddly the investment may seem lower than for whisky percentage wise, but it's a mixed product's effect. So it's the development Martell that was outstanding in China in the year elapsed that has to be taken into consideration, and also India was extremely buoyant.</p>
          <p>I showed you the growth rates for Royal Stag or Blenders Pride, and these are significant albeit at a local our brands for investors. So we're investing less in them. Now that we're looking them, that's not the question. But these brands are purely off-trade, purely off-trade therefore we need &#x2013; we don't need to invest this much in these brands. These two factors as I see it, explained the slight slackening of our A&amp;P effort in Asia though by no means, this is a policy.</p>
