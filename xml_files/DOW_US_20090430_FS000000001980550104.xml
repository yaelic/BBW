        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everybody. I'd like to begin with an update on the progress we have made in the first part of this year against the backdrop of what we can all agree has been an incredibly challenging operating environment. Let me start with some context around our first quarter results, which actually showed sequential improvement from last quarter. Geoffery is going to give you a deep dive into the numbers, but I want to point out what we have done to actually drive these results.</p>
          <p>These results reflect the demand destruction that continued into the first quarter, balanced of course by strong results from Dow AgroSciences. Inventory destocking appears to be over, so at least one major component of demand destruction is behind us. We are encouraged by the operating rate improvements that we have seen each month sequentially from December to April. Cost reduction actions we took also had a positive impact as we adapted quickly to the environment, and they drove much of our sequential improvement in profitability. While we expect the recessionary environment to continue through the end of this year, we actually have seen a few bright spots and some moderation in the pace of decline in the industry, and we're going to provide some color around this.</p>
          <p>We know that we have more work to do, but we also know that operational excellence and cost discipline are two of the hallmarks of Dow and it shows particularly well in these times. We are taking the necessary actions to manage what is in our control, and we have in place operating plans to maintain and build on our strengths despite the challenges. The path is very clear to us.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our progress in restoring stability to our company, we have made enormous strides by any measure. If you turn to slide four, you'll see that since late January, we renegotiated the financing for our acquisition of Rohm and Haas and settled the litigation to a satisfactory financial outcome. Two, we restructured the financial terms that allows us to both preserve financial flexibility and advance our transformational strategy. Three, we announced the sale of Morton Salt on the same day we closed Rohm and Haas and at a full price. Four, these actions have essentially reduced our original bridge loan by nearly 50%. And five, in addition, we have increased the cost synergies for the acquisition by over 40%. Six, we have validated the Rohm and Haas growth synergies of $3 billion. And seven, we announced implemented cost savings that helped enable a significant sequential improvement in earnings from fourth quarter of 2008 to first quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>Now, although we have made substantial progress, we know that there remains much work to do. And if you turn to slide five, you'll see in this regard that we have three key areas of focus; strengthening our balance sheet to protect our investment grade credit rating, managing our business through a poor and uncertain operating environment, and successfully integrating Rohm and Haas into the new Dow. Pierre will talk in more detail about how we are doing to integrate Rohm and Haas both from a cost and growth synergy point of view. But let me expand upon what we are doing in these other two focus areas, deleveraging the balance sheet and running the company in these turbulent economic times.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide six, in regards to meeting our financial targets and deleveraging our balance sheet, we have a very disciplined yet realistic plan that will retire our bridge loan facility by the end of this year, even in these challenging times. This plan is also expected to keep our gross debt to EBITDA well within our covenants and reduce our debt to total capital to less than 50% by year-end. Asset sales coupled with debt and equity issuances that we have already announced are key elements to our pay-down plan. And more divestments are on the way in line with commitments we have made to divest approximately $4 billion in assets by year-end. And regarding our asset divestment plan, I would like to stress that we are seeking full value for these assets and that we have optionality. Due to our successful renegotiation of the bridge loan and changes we've made to our capital structure, we are once again in control of our destiny.</p>
          <p>Now let's more thoroughly review our divestment plans and start with the assets we've already communicated to you. As you can see on slide seven, we took a meaningful step forward with our divestment of Morton Salt for $1.7 billion, coming just hours after closing our acquisition of Rohm and Haas. This sale is at an attractive valuation. There is no financing contingency, and it will be a significant deleveraging event. And as we've previously communicated, we're planning on selling our share in TRN, our petroleum refinery partnership in Belgium, our equity stake in an olefin and derivatives business in Southeast Asia, and our calcium chloride business. All of these divestments are progressing well, and we will have something to say on these three divestments very shortly.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look at slide eight, as we have discussed in the past, these are part of 12 divestment options that we are working on in parallel. All of these are high quality assets with strong market and technology positions, and divesting them in whole or in part aligns with the company's strategic direction and our past practice of active portfolio management.</p>
          <p>I would like to give you more granularity and definition on some more of these 12 assets on today's call. The first group I want to describe are the assets that constitute our Olefins Envelope and related derivatives. While outreach and dialogue continues with our Kuwaiti partners, there are other parallel negotiations that are ongoing with two other state owned resource owners on an equivalent basis with a similar scope of the original K-Dow venture. These discussions are proceeding on an orderly and timely basis.</p>
          <p>We are also progressing in parallel with additional possibilities to strategically position some of these assets in several regional, asset light partnerships. The value range for the businesses in this envelope is approximately 4 to $6 billion, depending on the nature of the proposed venture. And we expect to have more to say about some of these regional ventures in the next 90 days.</p>
          <p>The second grouping of businesses that are in our Aromatics Envelope. Here too, these are good quality businesses with significant value potential that are simply not core to our strategic direction. Businesses such as SB Rubber and SB Latex would be desirable in other enterprises, and we are pursuing both global and regional options for these units as well. The value range for these two and other businesses in this envelope this 1 to $2 billion. Options we are examining include strategic, financial, and spin-off for this grouping. You'll be hearing more about these in the next 90 days.</p>
          <p>Our third grouping of several standalone businesses that are non-strategic. In addition, the portfolio management discipline we at Dow have demonstrated over the past few years continues with the acquisition of Rohm and Haas. After careful review, we have plans to divest the heritage Rohm and Haas powder coatings business as this business does not have a strategic fit within the new Dow advanced materials division.</p>
          <p>This business has historically competed with many key coatings customers. And with our acquisition, these issues have been magnified. It's clear to us that divestment is the best choice. The full value of this business and several other standalone businesses non-strategic to Dow are 2 to $3 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, another divestment option that has been much discussed in the past is Dow AgroSciences. This business is strategic to Dow, but given the current market for assets in the agricultural space, we have launched a rigorous evaluation process, underway here as well, as we continue to assess the right strategic outcome for this business. Options include a full divestment, joint ventures, and possibly an IPO. So as you can see, we have significant optionality. In fact, the total value of all these divestiture groupings adds up to approximately $25 billion.</p>
          <p>We are running all these processes in parallel and are looking for full value for these assets in order to maximize the return for Dow shareholders while accomplishing the objectives of our deleveraging plan. Achieving $4 billion of divestitures out of this complete mix of assets is very doable in our view within the timeframe of our bridge pay down plan. Other elements of our bridge pay down plan include issuing public debt and equity. With respect to our ongoing financial plans, we are pleased that the capital markets appear to be constructive.</p>
          <p>We will continue to monitor the debt, equity, and M&amp;A markets as we look to be strategic and opportunistic regarding our capital structure. We intend to file pro forma financial statements for the combined enterprise in early May, and shortly thereafter we intend to check the pulse in the marketplace for a possible bond issuance.</p>
          <p>Regarding equity, we are working closely with the fiduciary of the Rohm and Haas ESOP and are making good progress towards our goal of issuing common equity from treasury shares of approximately $550 million. On April 1, we also exercised our option to have the Haas Family Trust to make an additional $500 million investment in Dow equity. This will convert to common equity assuming we file a shelf registration statement prior to June 1, which we intend to do. The equity we are raising by June 1 will be dilutive on a share count basis. The ESOP equity is not expected to be immediately dilutive.</p>
          <p>On slide nine, let me review the operating plan because this is equally important to the deleveraging the balance sheet plan. This operating plan is comprised of three elements. Firstly, we will deliver on our fourth quarter 2008 restructuring program, and as you can see we are already making great progress. Second, we will right size our global manufacturing footprint to adjust to the new realities of the market and reduce demand. The focus here will be on shut-downs and associated workforce reductions. This will deliver several hundred million dollars more in savings. And third, we will reduce costs and defer or eliminate capital spending in order to achieve our 2009 pre-acquisition CapEx commitment of $1.1 billion. We're also focused on cash preservation since cash flow management is critical in these times of economic uncertainty. Let's start with our fourth quarter '08 restructuring program and our commitment to achieve $750 million in re-structural savings.</p>
          <p>On slide 10 you'll see since December we have delivered approximately half of the 5,000 commitment to reduce our global workforce, and we are 17% ahead of our plan savings. And we expect to be at the $500 million run rate by the end of this year. In addition to activities related to the fourth-quarter restructuring, we also completed the shutdown of eight plants in the quarter. And we are not stopping there.</p>
          <p>As we right size our global manufacturing footprint, more shut downs and associated workforce reductions will occur. For example, Dow's smallest ethylene cracker, which is located in St. Charles, Louisiana, suffered a mechanical problem on January 3 and was taken down. As we continue to evaluate the supply and demand dynamics across our portfolio, we decided to leave the cracker off-line until economic conditions improved. In addition, there are several more plants under review, which together with the aforementioned cracker could add up to several hundred million dollars more savings.</p>
          <p>In summary, the combination of the $1.3 billion in acquisition related costs synergies, our fourth quarter '08 restructuring program, and future actions on our footprint that are under consideration would deliver a run rate of approximately $2.5 billion of cost savings by the end of 2010. If you put that into perspective, this is close to half of our operating income in some of our best years.</p>
          <p>Now, we're going to have a lot more to say about this in the coming weeks. And last, just a few words on CapEx. We're on track to deliver our 2009 pre-acquisition commitment of 1.1 billion. I would like to stress at this point that our operating plan assumes no help from the market via an improved business climate. The visibility we get from our diverse portfolio and its broad market exposure shows there are a few bright spots actually out there and some trend lines that are moving in our favor.</p>
          <p>However, we are reaffirming our assumption that 2009 will be a recessionary year and we will not benefit from any meaningful growth. We have achieved a lot over the last 90 days. And our 2009 operating deleveraging plan is realistic. And we have all the levers necessary to implement these actions successfully. Now I would like to turn the call over to Geoffery for a review of our first quarter results and trends. Geoffery?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As you know, we're all in the midst of the most challenging economic environment we have seen for many decades. On slides 11 through 14, you can see that despite these significant headwinds, we achieved positive earnings on both an operating and a GAAP basis. But why so? Well, this is due to the diversity of our portfolio, including another record performance from Dow AgroSciences, rapid actions we have implemented to reduce spending, and lower raw material costs.</p>
          <p>So given the challenging economic times that we have all been experiencing since the fourth quarter of last year, I believe it is more relevant to compare our business performance on a sequential basis or perhaps even on a month-to-month basis as we discuss our first quarter results in order to help identify and track underlying trends and the potential for a recovery. For example, we've generated a substantial improvement in earnings from last quarter, earnings of $0.03 per share this quarter on a GAAP basis versus a loss of $1.68 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, on an operating basis, excluding certain items, we also saw improvement with positive earnings of $0.12 per share, up from a loss of $0.62 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. So while the year-over-year volume declines are the worst in more than 20 years, the pace of decline appears to be moderating.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 15, it shows a steady decline in our sales volume from October through December. But since January, even excluding Ag, we have seen monthly improvements in demand as the first quarter progressed. In fact, we saw business conditions begin to stabilize in the first quarter. And while volume is clearly nowhere near mid-2008 levels, there is evidence that the demand is beginning to pick up.</p>
          <p>In fact, March was the strongest month of the first quarter and helped erase most of the declines in volume we saw in December, when demand virtually collapsed. Now, these month-to-month trends combined with the diversity of our portfolio across markets, geographies, and businesses, led to these improved results.</p>
          <p>So you can see on slide 16, we sell into a wide variety of markets and applications, virtually unmatched in our industry. Now, this means that we are not overly exposed to any one particular market or application, especially those hardest hit, like for example the automotive side.</p>
          <p>Next is the diversity of our business mix and a powerful combination of our portfolio. So let me start with our performance segment. Here I would like to point out that all EBIT comparisons I will make here exclude certain items. Despite the drop in price and volume at the company level, we reported sequential EBIT gain, with the largest percentage improvement coming from our performance portfolio, proving the pricing resilience of many of our specialty businesses. Now these gains were above and beyond the seasonally strong contributions from Dow AgroSciences.</p>
          <p>Dow AgroSciences reported another excellent quarter, with sales up 10% year-over-year, all of this coming from volume gains. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter that Dow AgroSciences has posted sales growth records compared with the same quarter of the prior year. And Dow AgroSciences also posted a new EBIT record in the quarter, the third consecutive year in which a new quarterly EBIT record has been achieved.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the demand trends and the rest of our performance portfolio, you can see on slide 17 that performance plastics and chemicals had a positive trend, most notably from February to March, during which volume increased 13%.</p>
          <p>Now, when you compare March volumes to the lows of December, the improvement is even more pronounced. So let me share with you a few examples. Dow Epoxy, volume increased 47% since December. Polyurethanes and Systems increased 34%. And Specialty Plastics &amp; Elastomers increased 18%. A few bright spots in the combined performance segment are in epoxies where the electronics and telecom markets in China are seeing good recovery driven by government stimulus spending, and specialty plastics, where demand for packaging appears to be more consistent, and of course in Ag, where fundamentals are still good. These trends, however, are likely to be offset by several challenges.</p>
          <p>First, the ongoing weak demand in polyurethanes used in construction and durables. Frozen credit markets, which unfavorably affected large project spending in areas such as in Eastern Europe and in Russia, and the continued uncertainty in the automotive sector as global manufacturers consolidate, rationalize brands, and reduce manufacturing capacity.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our Basics segment, EBIT expanded sequentially as well here. Slide 18 shows a similar pattern of demand improvement throughout the December to March timeframe. In fact, polyethylene volume increased 10% from the prior quarter, and it was down only 4% on a year-over-year comparison. Basic Plastics should show some improvement since de-stocking appears to have run its course.</p>
          <p>In addition, underlying demand for films used in food and industrial packaging continues to be more consistent compared to durable applications. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in the Basic Chemicals businesses such as in ethylene glycol, where polyester textile demand will be down due to reduced consumer discretionary spending. And in our core vinyl chain, unfavorable conditions in pulp and paper and alumina are leading to demand decline in pretty much all geographic regions.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to talk about another key driver behind our results in the first quarter, and that's our rapid and effective actions to reduce costs. All across the organization, cost control is a top priority, as Andrew stressed. We are focused on things that are in our control, and the size and speed of the reductions were meaningful in this quarter.</p>
          <p> Now consider these facts as you can see on slide 19. Compared to the same quarter last year, SARD declined 93 million in the quarter, this despite an 8% increase in growth investments in Dow AgroSciences. And overall spending decreased $270 million year-over-year and sequentially, as we remain on track to achieve our 2009 CapEx commitment of 1.4 billion. That's for the new Dow combined with Rohm and Haas. We also continued to manage our operations in the quarter, carefully matching production to demand. And as business fundamentals improve, operating rates picked up.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 20, coming off historic lows of 44% in December of last year, operating rates jumped back into the mid-60s in January and climbed to 70% at quarter end. So while the quarter average of 68% it's nowhere near the mid-80s we reported a year ago, the improvement is clearly encouraging.</p>
          <p>We are also focused on tightly managing working capital. So while there was an expected inventory build for businesses such as Dow AgroSciences and Dow Building Solutions, which are both preparing for seasonal demand, we remain on track to deliver a working capital improvement of about $0.5 billion through the year. And days sales outstanding and receivables remain in good control at a relatively low 42 days, flat with the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>So that's the summary of Dow's results in the quarter. In a moment, Pierre will provide an update on the integration process. But first I would like to give you a high-level summary of the financial results for Rohm and Haas in the first quarter, as you can see on slide 21.</p>
          <p>Rohm and Haas reported sales decline of 29% year-over-year, but similar to Dow's performance segments, the businesses showed pricing resiliency against a 26% decline in volume. Also consistent with trends I mentioned earlier, gradual improvements were reported as the first quarter progressed in almost all Rohm and Haas business units.</p>
          <p>Sales increased 17% from February to March, and that's excluding salt, with March being the best sales month since October of last year. March volume at company level and again excluding salt was 46% higher than December. So demand clearly improved from the year-end lows. Costs improved as well, with SARD declining 21 million year-over-year. And coatings month-to-month improvements were recorded in the quarter. Challenging market conditions were partially offset by cost reductions, margin management, and new product launches. And encouraging signs of recovery were noted in the electronics businesses.</p>
          <p>And there is no better expert on this than my colleague Pierre Brondeau. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to him for an update on our integration offers. Pierre?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Geoffery. It gives me great pleasure to be here today to share with you the news about the new Dow Advanced Materials Division. As you can guess, we have had a pretty busy 30 days. Shortly before we closed on April 1, we named the management team for the business unit, which is shown on slide 22.</p>
          <p>In the spirit of truly combining the best from both enterprises, you can see we have a premier leadership team that is comprised of both Dow, and Rohm and Haas employees.</p>
          <p>One of the main objectives of the acquisition is to preserve the customer-centric business model from Rohm and Haas -- has been known for. At the same time, we are removing costs and increasing productivity by supporting back-office functions and manufacturing operations, a core competency of Dow.</p>
          <p>The maturity of the functional leaders come from Dow, while the majority of business leaders come from Rohm and Haas, putting in place the necessary expertise of both of these areas to achieve our goals.</p>
          <p>Through this combination, we have created large, high-growth global businesses. You can see some examples on slide 23 and 24. These businesses have size, scale, and reach to win in their respective sectors.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, you can see that since early April, we have also conducted lockdown sessions where business and functional teams came together and reviewed confidential materials gathered by various clean teams during the months leading up to the closing. We used the Dow acquisition process, and I can tell you it is a very impressive practice with more than 1,000 employees engaged covering businesses, functions, and geographies. These clean teams collected, analyzed and distilled thousands of documents and data points into actionable recommendations that will accelerate the integration and the capture of both costs and growth synergies.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, which is most important in the near term, we remain committed to delivering $1.3 billion in acquisition-related costs synergies by the end of 2010. Having been an integral part of the whole process, I can also tell you that the team is completely engaged and fully committed to the $1.3 billion target, which as you'll recall is up from our original estimate of $910 million, as shown on slide 26. In fact, we will begin tracking progress against these projects quarterly, starting with our second-quarter earnings call.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 27, you will see the clean team I just mentioned have already identified more than 100 major cost synergy projects and hundred more sub projects, with the top 12 projects representing approximately $650 million of cost synergies. As we have said previously, we intend to be at 60% run rate 12 months after the closing date, and by March 31, 2010. We have a detailed roadmap, and I am very confident we will achieve this goal.</p>
          <p>Turning now to growth opportunities on slide 28, we believe there is tremendous potential here as well. We have in hand numerous growth playbooks that were put together by the integration teams for each of our global businesses. On the day of closing, I finally had a chance to review these. And all I can say is five hours later, I was still reading with excitement. Tremendous opportunities clearly lie ahead of us.</p>
          <p>Sources of near-term growth synergies for the combined companies include a broader product offering, opportunities for cross-selling at key accounts, utilizing channel to market expertise, accelerating new product introductions and stronger technical service, and leveraging our complementary geographic positions.</p>
          <p>Near-term growth synergies span across all business groups, geographic, and market segments. The top 50 short-term growth opportunities represent over $2 billion in potential annual sales.</p>
          <p>Let me expand on a couple of these. The new portfolio of our coating business clearly allows a much stronger penetration of key accounts and of broader participation in the architectural and industrial markets. On the building and construction side, Rohm and Haas has developed new technologies but did not have the critical mass and channel to market, nor the deficiency policy base in these markets. The new company brings together normal technology and a very strong route to market.</p>
          <p>We also have significant long-term growth potential as well. The top 30 opportunities have a combined annual sales potential of $8 billion in addition to the previous ones. The combined marketing and R&amp;D organization are already hard at work to make this a reality.</p>
          <p>If you could turn to slide 29, I would like to discuss now the outlook for Dow Advanced Material for the remainder of 2009. We expect full-year sales to be down versus 2008, in line with the rest of the specialty chemicals sector. However, and consistent with Geoffery's comments, we have seen four months of sequential growth for the heritage Rohm and Haas businesses, excluding salt.</p>
          <p>In fact, as our specialty chemical demand actually grew year-on-year in March for some critical segments such as coatings. Electronics was significantly impacted due to the severe inventory correction and reduced customer spending, and the high gross margin of this business magnifies the negative impact on the resource.</p>
          <p>The good news is it appears the inventory correction is essentially over and demand is now improving. The semiconductor industry is seeing better operating rates and higher capacity utilization at foundries. The demand for flat-panel displays, led by China, is also improving. Both our coatings and performance based materials, although still affected by the global economic slowdown, have been posting modest sequential growth monthly.</p>
          <p>Even in Asia and Latin America stabilized or even started to show some growth signs in selected areas. North America is flat for now, while demand in Europe is still lagging. For the next several months, we will be focused on a few key priorities, as you see on slide 30. I have no doubt that we are building the strongest specialty chemical unit in the industry, and I am proud to lead an organization with such growth potential.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pierre, and welcome aboard. It's really great to have you. Well, let's conclude the presentation part of the presentation by talking about the outlook. And clearly, as you can see on slide 31, we are beginning to see signs that the pace of global economic decline is moderating, although the signals are still yet not overly clear, albeit they are much better than they were in January.</p>
          <p>We believe the rate of decline of the key economic indicators such as industrial production and consumer spending has in fact slowed. However, lower business spending, weak manufacturing activity, and growing unemployment warrants a cautious approach in the near term.</p>
          <p>Taking a geographic view, in the United States we are hopeful there will be a return to positive growth in the second half of 2009 as economic stimulus spending ramps up. In Europe, the view we have based on our diverse portfolio and vast end-market reach suggest the stimulus packages may not have been having the same impact and therefore recovery may be further out.</p>
          <p>China, however, has emerged as a potential bright spot. The declining growth rate there appears to have bottomed, and the story now seems to be a domestic one, with local demand improving in response to aggressive government stimulus programs.</p>
          <p>If we look at business trends through the eyes of our customers, we see a continuation of low inventory levels following recent periods of heavy de-stockings, but clearly the world is a far better place than it was in December, and it now appears that the inventory de-stocking was an overcorrection and that that part is behind us.</p>
          <p>The operating rate improvement from December to April is a good signal in our opinion. And Dow's reach into nearly every part of the industrial and manufacturing economy reduces our vulnerability to those segments that are most hard hit. Despite these bright spots on the horizon, we nonetheless continue to assume that 2009 will be a recessionary year globally and we're not counting on any material improvements in economic conditions in the near term as we implement our plans. But we are ready to take advantage of any upturn due to our cost interventions.</p>
          <p>On slide 32, you can see our priorities for 2009, which are to successfully integrate Rohm and Haas to capture growth and preserve their business model. To realize Rohm and Haas cost synergy targets and accelerate Dow's own restructuring plans. To execute our deleveraging plans to support the bridge loan pay down and protect our investment grade ratings. And actively manage our costs and operations through the economic downturn.</p>
          <p>Operational excellence and cost discipline are two of Dow's traditional strengths, and as promised we are focused on managing what is in our control. We view the results and actions taken this quarter as important steps towards our goal to realize the transformation of Dow into an earnings growth company. And we are firmly committed to deliver on the plans we have described on this call. The future holds a more rapidly growing, more profitable, leaner, less levered, and a far more valuable Dow.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn the call back to Howard for the Q&amp;A. Thank you, everybody.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Andrew. That wraps up our prepared remarks. For your reference, a copy of these comments will be posted on Dow's website later today. Now we will move on to your questions. Before we do, though, I would like to find you that my comments on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and to anything that may come up during the Q&amp;A.

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question will come from Sergey Vasnetsov with Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Sergey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Page eight is very impressive. It's a much longer list than probably most of us could imagine. And it seems to be a lot larger than you would really need at this time. So I just wanted to ask you, when you are trying to divest some businesses, what is the value you are trying to realize, or is it just to cover the bridge loan, or you try to sell larger amounts if the market allows you to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, Sergey it is an impressive list. It's one that has been thoroughly drilled over the last several months. And in response to the two points you are making, one is of course the bridge pay-down is priority one and returning an investment grade rating, and that shows optionality. But two, given that we have a very strong and aggressive portfolio management process at Dow that is meant to liberate resources for growth businesses, that process is what we put in place these last two months to yield slide eight.</p>
          <p>And then of course, we just started applying it to Rohm and Haas, and that's why the powder coatings announcement was part of my prepared remarks. What it basically says is that we have the portfolio that we want. We know what we're not going to grow. We know what we're going to divest. We will do it to pay down the bridge, but we can overachieve beyond the 4 billion that we've articulated in the bridge pay-down metrics. So priority one, bridge pay-down; priority two, liberate resources so we can grow key growth businesses in Dow so that we can actually transform the company's earnings profile. This has been Board approved, Board committed, and we felt very strongly compelled to articulate to the market that slide eight exists.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll go ahead and move to our next question which comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, P.J.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, you said that non-durable inventories are low and they've been destocked. When you look at durables, how much inventories are there in the supply chain, and when do you see a bottom for those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on the region of the world, P.J. I would say to you that the bottom has been reached in China on the durables side. We're starting to see products that serve the durable market start to have an uptick in China, which suggests that government consumer oriented stimuli is working. Remember the Chinese stimuli is not just infrastructure. It's also rebates that help the Chinese consumer do something the Chinese consumer is not used to doing, which is spend. That is happening in transportation, it's happening in durable goods. And you can see that in shipments from factories to the wholesale and wholesale to retail. And so that half is occurring, and frankly is the bright spot in the durables world.</p>
          <p>The rest of the world is still very cautious on the durables side. And I would say to you that we don't see the order patterns yet to suggest what you are hunting for, which is durable pickup, certainly in the U.S. economy. Europe is a worry to the negative, and the rest the world, it doesn't matter materially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And similar question for Pierre in electronics. Pierre, you mentioned that you saw a bottom in electronics. And given that these end markets are higher growth; do you expect a faster recovery in electronics as compared to like coatings or other industrial markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at the electronic market, the electronic industry as a whole, the slowdown was much more severe in the electronic industry than it was in the other building and construction markets. For example, we've been talking of numbers for the last quarter of about 40 to 50% slowdown in those markets. When you look at those markets, we believe about half of that comes from destocking, half of that comes from slowing demand, which brings the slowing demand the same range as the market. We believe the destocking is essentially over at this stage. So the electronic industry now should see some rapid improvement, actually very rapid, and we can see that already in April. We believe the quarters to come will still be; especially for the second and third quarter, will still be down versus a year ago. But you could see significant sequential growth and you could see sequential growth in the range of 25 to 30% in the second quarter, so limiting the slowdown to the lack of demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll go ahead and move to our next caller. Our question will come from Kevin McCarthy with Banc of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Kevin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, a long-term question for you. The Wall Street Journal described this morning the US swimming in natural gas. And obviously, cheap gas drove a lot of investments in the '70s through the '90s. That changed this decade as capital migrated to the Middle East and Asia. As you look longer-term, assuming that you right size the balance sheet, as you think about where Dow should be investing, let's say, over the next five to 10 years. Have you changed your thinking at all, given how cheap gas has gotten relative to crude oil, or are there other issues such as carbon legislation, etc., that would keep you on course?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think you gave part of the answer in your question, Kevin. And clearly, climate change legislation, which Dow is very proactive on and very supportive on to give the market a signal that it definitely needs industrial manufacturers in particular in terms of investment economics, we need to have that carbon signal out there. But having said that the dash to gas will be pretty strong if we don't develop alternatives for utilities and transportation. So natural gas is a clean fuel, and power stations in particular will move to natural gas under climate change legislation. So that will cause the long-term demand to re-up.</p>
          <p>And really then the next point that I will make, which is fundamental, which is demand destruction has led to this current artificial glut in natural gas, in essence. With 30% volume destruction in key markets, all of us are running at lighter rates. And it is instructive to us that natural gas, albeit at swimming, still has not returned to what we had in the '90s. I mean, remember, we built a whole industry based on $2 natural gas.</p>
          <p>Now, is there some better opportunity today than there was? There clearly is. And Geoffery talked about our feedstock flexibility. That gives us an opportunity to make more money because of our feedstock flexibility. It gives us a competitive advantage on our ethylene margin. We can crack lights selectively. And of course, that's a key parameter in this current oversupply. But frankly, we don't consider that the oversupply will continue once demand returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And two brief follow-ups, if I may. Do you have a Rohm and Haas EBITDA number for the first quarter? And second, I was wondering if you could comment on your operating rate in the month of April as a company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the operating rate, I'll let Geoffery or Pierre respond to the first question. On the operating rate, we are continuing the trend to the positive. So in other words, it's up from March. And again, this is an indicator of what I think I said in my remarks. Geoffery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me just comment here that the pro formas are going to be filed May the 5th. The Q is going to be filed on the 4th, which I think is Monday. So at that point in time, we will have all the details.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, another long-term question. When you look out to perhaps 2011, perhaps the first normalized year for both Dow and the -- on the globe, what is Dow's earnings power? I know there are a lot of moving parts with the assets. What is Dow's earnings power, maybe just a range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be very fair to all of us, David, we are putting a lot of work in the next several months to answer your question more fully. And I don't like ducking answers. You know me well enough, but I certainly don't want to give you a sense of that yet. We have a lot to assimilate into our view to go forward. One of them is the portfolio question, I've already addressed. Second is the earnings upside and some of the things Pierre talked about, which were pretty exciting to us. If you heard a couple of his numbers, the $8 billion revenue growth opportunity by twenty whatever it was. I think 10 years from now. There is a lot we want to fund.</p>
          <p>Having said that we have some drag because of our new capital structure. We have to get that remedied. So there's a lot that goes into that number right now. But our long-term goal is the 10% per year earnings per share growth, a 20% return on equity, and achieving a 10% return on capital through the cycle at an average up getting 2 to 3% above that number as we go through the cycle average. We should be a less volatile company with the acquisition of Rohm and Haas. We need to demonstrate that by portfolio cleanup. And that's why slide eight is so important. And we are encouraged by some of the regional possibilities we now have in the olefins envelope that we articulated on slide eight.</p>
          <p>The new Dow will be a much more focused Dow, one that is focused on end-use markets like electronics, like AgroSciences if we choose to retain that business in its current form, and like coatings, and like some of the other things that Pierre talked about, which should make us more predictable and achieve these earnings targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, what's the timeframe for Dow Ag decision? Is it the next few months? By year end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the Dow Ag decision has been a five-year timeframe, of which the last three months have yielded quite a lot of interesting opportunity. I mean, I would tell you that it went from people feeling we were a distressed seller to what I now call a more orderly process to position Dow AgroSciences better for its future and returning the highest value for Dow shareholders. So we have begun a very full process. It's quite wide ranging. There are very serious bidders on the business. And we are seriously engaged with many of them to figure out can we look at, for example, liberating valuation, liberating cash and redeploying that into better opportunities in Dow. So I would tell you that we will have a lot more to say in the next 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. But it wouldn't be end of year. We will not leave the property in its current form where we are looking at options till the end of the year. We'll do it in the next 30, 60, 90 days.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a former Dow Executive who used to talk about how the old Dow models didn't work anymore. And I'm reminded of that, given how far the Street has been off in the fourth quarter and again off here dramatically in the first quarter. And I'm wondering if you could share some light as to why do you think that is, and can you talk about the positive benefits that you saw with raw materials, size it for us in the first quarter, and then perhaps what the expectation is going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Frank, we are all veterans of trying to predict cyclicality and cycles. And I think one big learning is modeling doesn't tend to work very well when the moving parts are so huge. And I think we've been in a new era where inflationary hydrocarbon commodity prices took the Dow model to a different place in its portfolio, and the massive destruction that occurred in demand in December took the model to a completely off-center data point. So there is no model that could have put those two data points in place, one, the run-up to $150 oil, and two, the demand destruction that led to a 44% operating rate in December.</p>
          <p>In our view, you almost have to throw those two points out and then go forward, have a view to the future here on what are we looking at in terms of, A, our portfolio, which is 60% specialties in its current manifestation, B, the question on natural gas and what does the margin look like in terms of an ethylene margin, which is still a big impact for the company. Those two things are being worked on right now, to answer the question that was asked I think by &#x2013; it was might have been Dave Begleiter or Kevin. I can't remember who asked it. About what is our go-forward earnings profile. But one thing for sure, the volatility we all saw in '08, if you begin to think that that is a recurring thing, demand destruction of the type we saw in December and/or a run-up to $150 oil, then you almost have to reset all the models. And we're going to work on that. Our whole objective here is to get predictability in our earnings. By going to feedstock advantage, asset-light ventures like I've already articulated, so we reduce that volatility.</p>
          <p>In the more near term, I think what you are going to start to see is what you did see in the &#x2013; your other part of your question, which is we had good margin expansion because of cost management, and we lost less price compared to losing hydrocarbon. And as markets tighten around new asset footprints, we are reducing &#x2013; we are all reducing supply. There's 2 million tons of announced permanent shutdown in ethylene capacity that is out there already, and the cracker we just talked about adds to that, you will see that supply/demand &#x2013; the ethylene margin will go into the high 80s in terms of operating rates. You'll start to see the opportunity for margin expansion in the ethylene envelope in this more near term. All of that to tell you that it's a very complicated question. We're going to do our very best in the next 30, 60, 90 days, including our own analysis to give you a better guidance on that answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, terrific. Thank you. And then speaking of models, the old models aren't working, on Rohm and Haas, the result in the first quarter was I guess surprisingly bleak. But Pierre, if I'm to understand you correctly, you are seeing a material pickup in your high-margin electronics business such that we can basically take the first quarter, throw it out and get back to more normalized sort of electronic earnings for Rohm and Haas, for the former Rohm and Haas business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Frank. We are going to see some more normalized earnings coming from electronic rapidly. If you look at the first quarter, you had the specialty materials business with positive earnings and coatings actually not doing too badly, some of the performance materials being close to breakeven, and really electronic materials, because of the slowdown in sales and the high-margin, which was really a business which has been penalizing us from an earnings standpoint. This business is recovering very fast. The &#x2013; it's been sequentially improving since December. The month of April is looking much more robust than the month of March. Also, the display business is growing, led by China. So it is a business, when the top line goes up, the bottom line goes up very fast too. So we should see some improvement very rapidly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Andrew, getting back to Ag, you talked about &#x2013; I was interested in your comment about liberating valuations. So is this pretty much a signal that you just think that Ag won't get the proper value within the Dow portfolio and that you either sell it or IPO it entirely? Or is it sort of a partial IPO to liberate value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. All of the above in the sense of optionality. The key point is the one that you asked about or started with, which is, it is a property that sits inside a commodity chemical multiple. Now, of course the entire strategy of the company is to move our multiple towards the Ag side. To the extent that others, notably our friends at DuPont, are doing the same, they have become more and more of an Ag company. And of course they have other businesses. That model is not too dissimilar to what we would like to get to, which is less commodity, more downstream. Rohm and Haas is a seminal event in that regard for us, because now we have Ag and advanced materials and some of our performance products. And so, if we waited medium to long-term, there could be value liberation by the entire Dow enterprise moving it's multiple.</p>
          <p>Having said that, this process we are going through may give us a short-term return to our shareholders by liberating the value in part or in full now. And that is why we are decidedly interested in looking at how we can return maximum value to our shareholders. Full retention or full divestment are the two extremes.</p>

          <p>Andrew, a follow-on portfolio question. On the Basics side, you have talked about your various options on the ethylene envelope. What about the chlorine envelope, and obviously near term with the way the cycle is going, does that give you more of a sense of urgency to do something, to get that out from the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our decision recently to delay the new build of chlorine on the Texas Gulf is instructive that we really do believe that chlor-alkali still needs some degree of rationalization. We do believe that asset light is more probable in that future than not. We clearly also see that our Shintech relationship needs to be recast and that is being done as we speak.</p>
          <p>And I would say to you that the most important part of chlorine for us is it feeds our downstream derivatives that are value-add. And as we build new footprints, whether they be in Saudi Arabia or China, they will be asset light on the part of chlorine we don't want to be in, which is EBC, VCM, and try to get low-cost feedstocks to feed the chlorine value to feed the downstream value. That's indeed our strategy here in the United States, and for that matter in Europe, and asset light with feedstock advantage. The natural gas point, by the way, helps right now of course because of low cost power.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll go ahead and move to our next question, which comes from Peter Butler with Glen Hill.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have an observation. It's unfair to Sergey, who conformed with your request to hold your questions to one each. You are letting the subsequent people ask multiple questions, just an observation.</p>
          <p>Okay. My question is Dow has had a very difficult time of late making things happen in the Middle East. I think you are finding that contracts in the Middle East are written in the sand. Did you derive any lessons from striking out in Kuwait, probably Saudi Arabia, Oman, et cetera? Do you guys need to establish better relationships with the ruling families before you start negotiating with the petrochemical bureaucrats?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, thanks for the observation. Sergey, if you want to come back in on another question, please do, because I do think Peter is correct. We have been a little lax. We will answer everyone's questions either on the call or follow-ups.</p>
          <p>So certainly, Peter, you ask a very huge question, and one that in Dow's legacy we have been exceptionally good at, which is government relationships around the world done in the context of high ethics, high integrity, and the right way to do business as defined by Dow's 112 years of success.</p>
          <p>In all of those years, we have only had trouble in three different places, and both of them due to a change of regimes. And I think you are aware of the other two places. In this particular case, we have exceptional relationships with Kuwait. Nothing has changed there. Our ongoing relationship was validated by Kuwait Investment Authority coming along with $1 billion to invest in our Rohm and Haas acquisition despite the ruling family's decision late December to withdraw from the then K-Dow venture.</p>
          <p>We are still in negotiation and discussion with Kuwait. What happened was, people call it a black swan event. The ruling family and Parliament in Kuwait is going through an incredible amount of dysfunctionality, and that isn't going to finish anytime soon. On the other side of the coin, no situation is the same. Our Saudi relationships are exceptional. I am at a dinner tonight in Houston with Saudi Aramco's management.</p>
          <p>I will tell you that our Saudi profile is improving to the point where we are a preferred partner beyond just the Dow project. Rohm and Haas brings us a project which is an exceptional project in the region. So each country is different. Oman was a special circumstance. We still like to think that over the timeframe that the Oman project is doable.</p>
          <p>So, Peter, it's very hard. You are a student of the world. So am I. I wouldn't characterize our relationships as broken or weak in the Middle East. I would call them as strong. And we just have a situation in Kuwait that needs to be remedied that we will. I believe we will have a growth profile in Kuwait when all is said and done.</p>

          <p>All right. We'll move to a question from John McNulty. And I apologize. He has dropped from the queue, so we will go ahead and take a question from Mike Judd with Greenwich Consultants.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is real quick. You are likely to have some unusual charges in the June quarter and maybe even looking forward a little bit. Could you give us some sense of what the cash portion of the unusual charges could be for the rest of the year, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Mike, it's Geoff. I think we'll have some obvious cash charges when it comes to having closed the Rohm and Haas transaction. There's some further banking fees. We will have cash charges that are related to severance, in fact, severance both from our restructuring program as well as the synergy program for Rohm and Haas, and we are still finalizing, following the recent lockdown with Rohm and Haas in terms of that $1.3 billion of synergy costs in order to secure the cost synergies. So I mean a number, I would rather not give you at the moment. We'll be able to share more numbers with you later on. But the second quarter will have I would say a major cash charge.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Sorry, I don't know how I got dropped off there. But a question regarding the cash flows. It looks like you've burned through about 1 billion to 1.2 billion this quarter, and I know there is some seasonality to the business. But given the trends that you are seeing in terms of some of the businesses modestly picking up, can you give us some color as to when you think you might be cash positive so that you would be generating cash going towards paying down some of the debt itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Look. I mean seasonally, we normally have in the first quarter a cash flow that is probably about $0.5 billion less than the regular quarters. And in fact, I can tell you that from a working capital standpoint, as you know, we reduced our working capital requirements in the fourth quarter. I think the number was $2.3 billion. And we only gave up about 300 or $340 million, $332 million I think it was, in the first quarter. So, in fact, from my perspective, in fact the first quarter was probably better than expected. And for the full year, we definitely will see a pretty strong free cash flow. Definitely positive. I think on the working capital side, I said that we will see an improvement of $0.5 billion, and we should see a free cash flow of I would say around $1 billion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jennifer, we have time for one last question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sir. We'll take that question from Bill Young with ChemSpeak.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen.</p>

          <p>Hi, Bill.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing I still can't understand on the agricultural side is why you would consider a full divestment. The Ag business corresponds so well to Dow's strategy going-forward and specialties, performance, steady returns, low asset life. And I can see the joint venture route. Have you considered doing a partial spin-off to a financial type of partner similar to what you did a few years ago in the consumer products area? Maybe you could just cover this whole divestment thing. It just doesn't fly to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Bill. And you and many others in our investor universe have made a very similar comment. And look, January and February were extraordinary months in The Dow Chemical Company's history. We had our backs against the wall. We had a lot of situational issues that we won't go over. You know what they were. Clearly, to monetize a growth asset was the last thing we wanted to consider at that point in time for all the reasons you said. You will note that in my verbal comments, I said Dow AgroSciences was a strategic asset. So, you can rest assured that if we reach the conclusion of a full divestment, it is because it is so compelling that we have to consider it for our shareholders. That is the way you should consider that sentence.</p>
          <p>There are other ways to get from here to there. And you just labeled them and you just listed them. And they are much more consistent with our last five to six years of investment in the business, inclusive of more recent investments even in the first quarter. We increased their R&amp;D and increased their CapEx. So look, you are -- your headline is very accurate. There's a few more rows and columns to talk about as far as the Dow AgroSciences story goes, but you are very correct in summarizing it the way you did.</p>
