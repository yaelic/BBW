      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sean and good morning everyone.</p>
          <p>As we've said many times over the past few months, we are certainly living in interesting times. As we read the headlines every morning, there seems to be little, if any, good news. End-market demand is changing daily, generally not in a positive direction.</p>
          <p>At UTC, we're not immune from the market forces, but we are, I believe, uniquely prepared and positioned to outperform in these difficult times. If you saw the press release this morning, UTC closed out a strong 2008. Full-year revenues were just under $59 billion, up about 7% year-over-year. Earnings per share were $4.90. That's up 15% versus 2007. Cash flow, very strong, 105% of net income.</p>
          <p>So despite the worldwide economic slowdown, we continue to make investments for long-term growth of the business and to reduce costs. Engineering and development spending totaled $1.8 billion in our business last year. That's up nearly 100 million over 2007. We also continued our aggressive restructuring action, preparing for tougher times ahead. Total restructuring spending was $357 million. Strong evidence, I believe, that UTC can continue to outperform.</p>
          <p>So we began 2008 with most markets in a relatively good position, with the exception of the U.S. residential market. Early concerns about the commercial construction slowdown in the U.S. and Western Europe expanded of course into broad-based slowdowns across all industries and geographies. That rate of decline accelerated in most end-markets in the last couple of months, and combined with a strong U.S. dollar, this created unique challenges for global businesses.</p>
          <p>In spite of this, UTC reported fourth quarter EPS of $1.23. That's up 14% over last year. Foreign exchange translation, combined with Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada's currency hedging, adversely affected EPS by $0.06. Current quarter results also include $0.06 of net benefit from one-time gains in excess of restructuring costs. Last year's quarter had a net $0.04 charge from restructuring and other costs in excess of gains. Absent the impact of these items, the results for both quarters, EPS was up 4%.</p>
          <p>Revenues were 14.5 billion in the quarter. That's a 1% decline versus a year ago. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by $700 million, or 5%. Organic growth was 3%. You see once again that balance works at UTC. Sikorsky was the highlight in the quarter, with 25% organic revenue growth, delivering 204 large helicopters for the year, a 17% increase from 2007, consistent with its commitment to delivering more than 200 aircraft a year. On the other hand, weakness in our short cycle businesses accelerated. Carrier's organic revenues declined by 7%.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter order rates indicate that revenues will decline on a faster rate the first half of 2009. In addition to the weakness anticipated in the developed regions of the world, we also saw slowdowns in China, Russia and other emerging economies. Otis new equipment orders declined 14% globally including the impact of foreign currency. Carrier's Commercial HVAC new equipment orders declined 7% worldwide, also including the impact of FX. And as discussed at the Investor Meeting back in December, Carrier's Transport Refrigeration orders declined over 15% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>All right, turning to Aerospace. Pratt &amp; Whitney book-to-bill for large commercial spares was just below one and a quarter.  Commercial spares revenues were down just slightly. Hamilton Sundstrand's commercial spares book-to-bill, on the other hand, was just above one.</p>
          <p>While the business environment is challenging, we continue to focus on taking out costs through restructuring. We spent 136 million on restructuring in the quarter, and as I noted before, a total of 357 million for the year. Aggressive cost control and benefits from earlier restructuring led to margin expansion at four of the six business units, adjusting for restructuring and one-time gains. As Akhil will talk about in a minute, Otis margins were down in the quarter, but would have been up slightly, except for accounting adjustments related to its Brazil subsidiary.</p>
          <p>Cash flow in the quarter was strong, as I noted, with free cash flow at 141% of net income, resulting from seasonal inventory reductions and the strong collections. We repurchased $690 million of our shares in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $3.2 billion. I should also note that we contributed 250 million of our stock to our pension plan in December. For 2009, we're again targeting share repurchase and acquisition spending at $2 billion each, although we will be opportunistic and we may adjust these targets, just as we did in 2008.</p>
          <p>Acquisition spending in the quarter was 725 million, including debt assumed. This was primarily at  Carrier and Fire &amp; Security, consistent with our strategy of expanding our presence in the service and installation markets.</p>
          <p>As we've said many times, liquidity is not an issue at UTC. In mid-December, we successfully issued $1.25 billion of debt at a coupon rate of just over 6%, evidence that the debt markets are functioning for companies with good fundamentals and strong cash flows.</p>
          <p>We have about $1 billion of debt maturing in 2009, and on the back of the December offering, we have announced early redemption of 500 million to take advantage of the slight interest rate differential.</p>
          <p>I'll come back and talk about 2009, but for now, let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the business unit detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Greg. Before I get into the business unit performance, let me talk about the non-recurring items in the quarter. As shown on page 3 of the webcast, we had about $0.10 of one-time gains generated by the sale of certain investments and businesses. These gains were offset by a comparable amount of restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>In addition, the IRS tax settlement came through in the quarter as a pre-tax equivalent of about $100 million, as anticipated. This settlement, less the discrete factors on the one-time gains, added $0.06 to earnings per share.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 4, let me remind you that I'll talk to the segment results adjusted for restructuring and the non-recurring items that I just described.</p>
          <p>At Otis, revenues in the quarter were down 3%, and operating profit was down 7%, including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation, which accounted for approximately 7 points of decline in both revenue and profit. Operating profits were also negatively impacted by approximately $30 million of provisions to correct misstatements of inventory and other account balances which occurred over several years at the Otis subsidiary in Brazil. These adjustments resulted from an investigation initiated by Otis headquarters <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>At constant currencies, revenues increased 4%, driven by higher service sales globally. New equipment sales increased in North America and Europe, but were partially offset by a high single-digit decline in Asia, driven by the postponement of over 5,000 units in China, principally from the slowdown in the residential housing market.</p>
          <p>Excluding currency and the provisions related to the Brazilian subsidiary, profits grew 5%, as higher volumes, field installation efficiencies, and continued cost containment more than offset the higher steel and other input costs. For the full year, Otis revenues were up 10%, and operating profits were up 12%. Margins expanded by 30 basis points to 19.3%.</p>
          <p>As anticipated, the global financial crisis has begun to adversely impact commercial construction markets. As Greg said, new equipment orders at Otis declined 14% including impact of foreign currency translation, and 8% in the quarter at constant currency. Asia, including Middle East, was flat, Americas down by single digits, and Europe, down high-teens. We expect continued softness in new equipment sales until government stimulus packages worldwide begin to have an impact. Otis new equipment backlog remains strong, up 9% versus the prior year including the impact of foreign currency translation, and 12% at constant currencies.</p>
          <p>Turning to Carrier, consistent with the comments at the December Investor Meeting, Carrier's fourth quarter operating profit decreased 42% on 13% lower revenues. Operating margins contracted more than 200 basis points. Foreign currency translation contributed about 6 points of the revenue decline and 5 points of the profit decline in the quarter. In addition, about half of the EBIT and margin drop in the quarter came from the unfavorable impact of the dramatic currency changes on cross-country transaction.</p>
          <p>Revenues at the Refrigeration business were down high single-digit, with Europe down double-digits. While the U.S. residential business was down high single-digit in a tough market, Carrier's shipments outperformed the industry. Commercial HVAC business was up low single digit, all from acquisitions, with strong earnings and margin expansion.</p>
          <p>For the year, Carrier earnings were flat on 2% revenue growth. Approximately 150 million of benefits from restructuring and other cost reduction actions offset the adverse impact of net commodity headwind and unfavorable mix.</p>
          <p>The slowing global economy has had an immediate impact on Carrier's short-cycle businesses, and as Greg mentioned, we're also seeing a slowdown in commercial HVAC order rates as well as significant declines in transport refrigeration orders. First half compares for Carrier will be very challenging, given the weak end-markets and stronger U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>On slide 6, UTC Fire &amp; Security delivered solid performance in the quarter despite significant FX headwinds. Organic revenue growth of 3% was more than offset by 2 points of impact from net divestitures, along with 12 points of unfavorable foreign exchange translation. Fire Safety led the organic growth, with high single-digit growth in Europe and Asia. Operating profit at Fire &amp; Security increased 5%, or $9 million. Higher organic revenues along with the benefits of restructuring, integration, and continuing productivity initiatives generated approximately 21% profit growth. Foreign exchange translation adversely impacted profits at 16% in the quarter. Operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 11.8%. Fire &amp; Security delivered full-year profit growth of 26% on revenue increase of 12%, resulting in 100 basis points of margin expansion for the year. Full-year organic revenue and operating profit growth were 3% and 18% respectively.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Aerospace businesses on slide seven. Pratt &amp; Whitney revenues increased 3% in the quarter. Over 10% growth in commercial engines revenue from higher shipments and aftermarket services was partially offset by lower military development revenues and engine deliveries. Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada revenue was about flat, as higher engine shipments offset weaker aftermarket sales. Commercial Engine spares were down slightly in the quarter. Fourth quarter commercial spares included the benefit from the previously announced JT9D distribution agreement.</p>
          <p>Operating profits improved 8% in the quarter on better Commercial Engine mix and after market performance, lower net commodity headwind, and a favorable adjustment worth less than $0.02 to our Commercial Engine program. These increases were partially offset by lower military engine volume. E&amp;D was essentially flat in the quarter and lower than expected due to efficiencies and changes in program timing. For the full year, Pratt &amp; Whitney operating profit grew 9% on 7% higher revenues. Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, shipped 4,000 engines in 2008, up 34% over 2007.</p>
          <p>On slide eight, in the quarter Hamilton Sundstrand revenues were up 3%, with solid organic growth of 6%. On an organic basis, aerospace OEM revenues were up high teens, industrial businesses were up mid-single digits, while aerospace aftermarket revenues were down high-single digits. Commercial space revenue was down mid-single digit in the quarter, with book-to-bill slightly above one. Orders for the industrial businesses were down mid-teens. Operating profit grew 14%, primarily from higher volumes and favorable mix, both in aero OEM and Industrial businesses,  better repairs shop performance, and favorable adjustment worth about a penny to old acquisition-related liabilities. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower aftermarket revenues. Operating margin, at 19%, was up 180 basis points from fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year, Hamilton increased revenues 10%, and delivered on its guidance of $100 million operating profit growth.</p>
          <p>At Sikorsky, on slide nine, operating profit grew 38%, on 25% higher revenues. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 64 large helicopters, 38 based on military platforms and 26 commercial. As Greg mentioned before, Sikorsky met its 2008 commitment of 200-plus aircraft deliveries, with a total of 204 shipments for the year. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points in the quarter, to 9.5%, from higher helicopter shipments. For the full year, Sikorsky's operating margin of 8.9% reflects a 120 basis point improvement from 2007, and is on track to meet the target of 10% operating margin by 2010.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, Sikorsky also achieved first flight for the Canadian Maritime helicopter and executed an agreement that successfully re-baselined the program. This will be the most sophisticated maritime helicopter in the world, and first delivery is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Akhil. Let me just spend a minute here on 2008 before I get to the 2009, because I think it's important to focus on what a good year 2008 really was for UTC.</p>
          <p>Now despite the deteriorating economic conditions, earnings per share were up 15% over 2007, to $4.90 a share, and revenues ended the year at just under 59 billion, up 7% over 2007, with 5 full points of organic revenue.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was 4.9 billion, or 105% of net income. On ACE, our operating system, we reached 49% ACE gold and silver sites across the business by year-end 2008, and we are confident we can meet Louis's target of 70% ACE gold and silver sites by the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>We're also making progress on rolling out ACE to our supply base. You'll recall that this past December, Louis set another stretch goal to have 70% of our key suppliers spend ACE golden  performing levels by the end of 2011. The business unit presidents will provide an update on both our internal and supplier ACE initiatives at our February 24th Investor Meeting in New York.</p>
          <p>And 2008 was also an exciting year for product innovations and accomplishments. Pratt &amp; Whitney's continued testing its PurePower-geared turbofan engine, which based on testing to date is expected to achieve a 12% reduction in fuel consumption, a 55% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions, and a 50% reduction in engine noise versus today's engines.</p>
          <p>At Sikorsky, besides the Canadian Maritime, their revolutionary twin rotor X2 technology demonstrator achieved first flight in August. That prototype is expected to demonstrate that a helicopter can cruise comfortably at 250 knots while retaining excellent low speed handling and efficient hovering and safety. At Carrier and Otis, their energy efficient products performed flawlessly at the Beijing Olympics.</p>
          <p>As noted earlier, we continue to invest in the future, spending a billion eight in engineering and development, and 2009 will be no different. We will continue to invest in this business, and spend another $1.8 billion <mark type="inaudible" /> by the .</p>
          <p>Okay, let's talk about 2009 for a couple minutes. In December, Louis provided an EPS guidance range for 2009, 4.65 to 5.15, plus or minus 5%, including the impact of the acquisition-related cost for implementation or the adoption of FAS 141R. We're reaffirming that full-year guidance today, but I also want to point out a couple of developments since December separately that have put pressure on the high-end of the range.</p>
          <p>First, pension expense. Pension expense headwind increases compared to our guidance. Discount rates came down from 7% early December, to 6.1% at December 31. Although investment performance was slightly better than anticipated, the resulting impact of the sharp discount rate moves is incremental pension expense headwind of about 125 million on top of the 100 million already contemplated in our guidance. As a result, we're now anticipating making a $400 million contribution to our U.S. pension plans in 2009.</p>
          <p>Also since early December, end market conditions have clearly deteriorated in some of our businesses. The order rates we've mentioned earlier have put more pressure on Carrier's outlook, and Otis is also seeing pressure from push-out in projects, particularly in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>On the Aerospace side, while there is optimism that the world's commercial airlines will be profitable in 2009 due to lower jet fuel prices, global air traffic may be down 3 to 4%, versus the range of plus or minus 1% we anticipated in December. The business jet market is also weakening, with fewer departures and reduced OEM order rates putting more pressure on Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada.</p>
          <p>In response to this, we're accelerating our restructuring plans. We now anticipate 150 million of restructuring actions in the first quarter, with only about 50 million of that offset by gains. UTC's senior leadership team is working aggressively to initiate additional cost reductions beyond that 150 million across the businesses, to right-size each of our businesses for this challenging environment. You'll be hearing more about specific business unit actions at our February meeting.</p>
          <p>Just a few words on currency impacts. We provided the 2009 guidance, we mentioned the significant adverse impact the stronger U.S. dollar was expected to have on UTC's revenue and earnings, about 600 million on earnings, with half of that from the euro decline alone. And of course, the first half of 2009 will see a disproportionate impact, as the average euro rates of 2008 were 1.49 to the dollar in the first quarter, 1.56, second quarter, much higher than the rates we've seen over the last several months. As a result of these adverse FX compares, tougher market conditions, and $100 million of restructuring in excess of gains, we expect first half results to be below the bottom end of the full-year range, plus or minus 5%.</p>
          <p>We continue to watch all of these trends carefully. Based on the extensive global stimulus efforts underway today, we still expect a modest recovery in the latter part of 2009. As per our normal practice at the February meeting, February 24, the business unit presidents will update you on market conditions, the latest trends, and cost-reduction actions.</p>
          <p>As you've come to expect from UTC, our ACE operating disciplines, restructuring expertise, and experienced management team will allow the company to navigate through these turbulent times. Doing more with less is a way of thinking at UTC that has consistently delivered market-leading results. Operating discipline, market-leading franchise, a balanced global presence are the factors that give us confidence in the future, confidence that we will continue to outperform, even in these uncertain times.</p>
          <p>Let's stop there and open up the call for questions. Sean?</p>

          <p>Yes. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll go first to Nicole Parent of Credit Suisse.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

          <p>Hey Nicole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize. It was hard to hear you guys. Could you just, I guess, restate what the size of the Brazilian adjustment was in the quarter?</p>
          <p>And then, with respect to the color on the backlog at Otis, I think you eluded to, in your comments on the fourth quarter and '09, some push-outs in emerging markets. Did you have any cancellations in the U.S.? And then maybe, give us a sense of the comfort level, slack visibility, with the backlog? And did you have any emerging market cancellations or push-outs that you think become cancellations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. For now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let's start with the Otis Brazil matter. That was about $0.02 in the quarter. That is behind us, we believe. An unfortunate turns, those things that  unfortunately happened in a business with 225,000 people, but about $0.02 in the quarter. Obviously, if you adjust out for that, Otis's margin would have been up about 220 basis points.</p>
          <p>As for the new equipment backlog and orders, we did not see any significant cancellations in any of the businesses or any of the regions, but we did see significant deferrals, especially in China, and also in Russia. The emerging markets were probably hardest hit, and maybe the biggest surprise to us as we looked at this, we had over, as we said, 5,000 units in China were deferred out of 2008. And not cancelled, just deferred.</p>
          <p>So backlog's still up about 9% for Otis for the year, so we still think 2009 will be a good year. We expect revenues to be up at Otis again and for new equipment. But obviously, these challenging times are putting some pressure on that.</p>
          <p>I think you should also remember, I already mentioned the fact that some of these issues in China are probably of our own making, because we've tried to avoid extending credit to some of our agents there. So a few of these orders were actually deferred at our request because we didn't want to take the additional credit risk but, yeah, the market did slow in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I guess, do you have the split between service and equipment revenue growth at OTIS in the quarter? You might have given it, I apologize.</p>
          <p>And then, with respect to just the nature of deferrals actually moving into cancellations, maybe give us the sense of the comfort level of them staying deferrals, or moving into cancellations, as we go through 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nicole, this is Akhil. With regard to the growth rates for both service and new equipment, service grew mid to high single digits, between 6 and 7%, while the new equipment growth rate was between 2 and 3%. That's the first part.</p>
          <p>The second part, I don't think we have really seen any cancellations beyond normal at this point at Otis. Usually Otis does see some cancellations as part of normal business. Deferrals are the things which are bigger, as Greg mentioned, and I think emerging markets we'll have to wait and see what happens. We don't think the underlying demand driven by urbanization is going to go away. It may be just a matter of time, as the Chinese government's stimulus cuts come back in place and the residential market demand kicks back, whether it takes three months, six months, nine months; that's up for debate, but we do expect that backlog to be as solid and come back at some point in new equipment deliveries for Otis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one last follow-up on the Commercial businesses, probably more on the Carrier short-cycle, and maybe also Hamilton Sundstrand Industrial. How would you guys characterize the inventory levels that are out there? I guess when we think about kind of the massive deceleration you saw -- or everybody saw in November and December, could you maybe characterize where you think the inventory levels are out at the customer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on Carrier specifically, as we've been taking a look at channel inventory, channel inventories are down in line with the markets, so we don't think there's any big inventory overhang out there, and not a tremendous amount still to bleed down. On the Industrial side at Hamilton, orders were down at low double-digits there, most of that was on the compressor side. We're still seeing good order growth at Sundyne, especially in the oil and gas industry. But I would say on the compressor side, we expect some pretty slow growth here in the first half. I don't really have a view on inventory out there, but I do see order rates coming down pretty significantly at Solaire.</p>

          <p>Thanks, good morning.</p>

          <p>Joe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question was just a clarification. Greg, what did you say specifically on the first half, was it that EPS would be below the bottom end of the full-year range, meaning below 5% down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly what I was trying to get across, yeah.  5% is the full-year range at the bottom end, and clearly, first half is going to be lower than 5% down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And then secondly, I guess you're maintaining the $150 million restructuring placeholder, but that's all in Q1. It would be unthinkable, I would think, that you wouldn't have any more during the rest of the year. How do we think about what kind of an incremental restructuring your EPS guidance can withstand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about it, Joe, we've talked about $150 million of restructuring in the year, assume that was all going to be offset by gain, and that's the same number we started 2008. We ended the year 2008 with 357.</p>
          <p>Right now, I can tell you we are looking actively at doing additional restructuring across most of the businesses. There is contingency, or there was contingency, both at the midpoint of the range and the bottom end of the range, to absorb some additional restructuring. I don't want to give you a number today, but I will tell you that we're working hard on it at each of the business to quantify that and, again, we'll give you a lot more detail when we stand up in February for each of the businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What's your early look at the -- sort of the gain outlook this year? I guess the 150, how much of that do you have kind of buckled down, and are there other bigger items out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have visibility to, as I said, about 50 million here for the first quarter, and that's &#x2013; yeah. These gains, they kind of pop up from unexpected places just like they did  in the fourth quarter where gains were a little better than what we had anticipated. But right now, I think we've got a clear line of sight to 100 to 150 of gains, a little bit here in the first half and more in the back half of the year. Beyond that, not much visibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the Aero side, your Pratt spares were I think surprisingly good. They actually outperformed Hamilton, which hasn't happened for awhile and is a little bit -- given the mix, a little bit surprising. Just wondering if you could give some color. I guess Hamilton was kind of where I thought they might be, and Pratt was surprisingly good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, in fact, we talked about the distributor agreement which we had announced late in third quarter. That helped the Pratt spares situation a little bit. So while they were down slightly on a reported basis, if you adjust for the pickup we got through the inventory stocking at this new distributor, that would take the trend line more into the double-digit decline, which would be more consistent with third quarter and what you would expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's more like, somewhere in the teens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well less than that, double -- low to double-digit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, as we think forward through to next few quarters, I guess you'll only annualize that in the fourth quarter. So maybe the first nine months of the year, you continue to see the stocking? Or how do we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't actually draw that conclusion just yet. I think that what we saw in the back half of 2008, especially at Pratt spares, was a response to the rather significant curtailment in capacity, especially in the U.S. carriers. The spare order rates obviously are driven by RPMs and the available seat miles, and I would hope that we've kind of stabilized now and we're going to see a run rate -- and again, we're not predicting spares are going to be up at Pratt this year. In fact, we think it will be down a little bit. But I don't think we're going to see the major decline unless we see a much bigger drop in either capacity or RPMs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And keep in mind, Joe, I think as we talked about before, the capacity reductions impact the old engines, which is the JT80/90s, more than the other engines, and that has become a much smaller part of the overall Pratt spares stream. It's $350 million in 2007, more than that in 2008, compared with the billion that it used to be in the early 2000s, when the last cycle had hit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one more little one, that same topic. What were the Pratt Canada spares down in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They were down double-digits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the -- in the December meeting, we had a slide that talked about the commercial businesses having revenues that sort of down two, but operating profit growth up five to six, and I gather that that outlook is now worse. I wondered if you could, looking at that slide that we -- or the numbers that we had, which was basically commercial businesses offset by aerospace businesses, you've now kind of said the commercial business outlook looks like it's getting worse. The aerospace traffic numbers have been revised down. Perhaps Boeing and Airbus will lower deliveries in 2010, which might affect shipments in the back half of the year. How does this chart now look, which once upon a time was sort of 3% negative growth -- 3% positive at constant FX, and 3% negative after FX.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well clearly, let me just start on the commercial side. Clearly there's pressure on the Carrier top-line here, and a little bit of pressure even on the Otis top-line because of the order trends that we saw in Q4. I don't know that we're ready to revise guidance on any of these businesses quite yet. I got to tell you, with only two weeks under our belt her in our January, it's hard to draw any trend line. But clearly, there's pressure of the guidance on the commercial side. As far as on the aerospace side, as I mentioned, we've got pressure there from lower RPMs and lower biz jet volume in Pratt Canada, so I'd say both Carrier and Pratt are probably the most challenged as it relates to guidance we gave just about 5 weeks ago. But it is early in the year. So we'll update these things in another month as we get some better data points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Joe, let me just remind you, I think we talked about it in December as well, if all these business units met the guidance that we provided in December, we would be clearly at the top end of the range. And we did say that these are stretch plans, and that's why we have a contingency towards either end of the range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Could you comment a bit on what the impact is at PWC, biz jets, precisely what's the exposure there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Business jets --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which models are going up and down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the -- we are still awaiting discussions with our customers to give you a firm idea on the specific models there. Obviously the PW600 has had some stress, as you would imagine. The schedule changes are still not finalized and we will have better input from you from Dave Hess in February. But overall, I think you should think about $1.5 billion roughly of revenues associated with business jets for UTC, out of the 57, 58 billion, as just the number to keep in mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. So just to make sure I understand what's happening here. All of these businesses that conference constant FX have deteriorated since December, but of course those were the stretch goals. When we look at the slides that had the individual businesses, you didn't change any of them in the slides we had today. Should we expect that in March, that these will get revised to reflect what we really are already seeing, but which you've left alone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, we've said Joe, I think you're going --  there is pressure clearly on the Carrier and the Pratt guidance here. You'll rightly note that they were stretch goals to start with, and there hasn't been a lot of good news in either the Carrier markets or the Pratt markets since the December meeting. So yeah, I think there's going to be pressure to bring the guidance of these -- at least those two units down a little.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, just one other point. There is still some volatility which could swing in any direction. I mean, you saw euro move between 1.46 and 1.29 just in the last 30 days. And each euro has a $15 million impact on our earnings. So if you could call all those things correctly -- and the commodities the other factors to keep in mind, obviously it would be much easier to give a more precise guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. Thanks again.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr, Cowen and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. Can you tell us, where are looking now for R&amp;D in 2009 and kind of how -- is it still going to be up and is -- are all the quarters up? Any kind of patterns we should look for there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our R&amp;D, Cai, is going to be flat year-over-year, about 1.8 billion as I said before. I think even by business, I don't expect -- well, I shouldn't say that. I think you're going to see a little bit of a headwind at Pratt on E&amp;D. You're also going to see a little bit of tailwind on E&amp;D at Hamilton as the 787 program goes through its first flight. But overall, I would say at quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year, not any significant changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it'll still be with a ramp in the final quarter, would be the pattern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think again, more consistent with what we saw in 2008 in terms of a spending profile. And this is all dependent of course on program timing. Pratt's got some relatively big programs like the Mitsubishi regional jet and C series. Both of those, as we said earlier, have -- some of the program timing slipped a little bit to the right. We don't expect any deferrals out of 2009. So it's not a big change in E&amp;D.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, a follow-up. I might have missed this, but you said 100 to 150 of gains, and the total restructuring number for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now we're still at 150, but as I said in answering Joe's question earlier, we're going to launch 150 here in the first quarter. It's only about $50 million of gains, and I would expect before we're done, and perhaps even before the end of the February, you'll hear about more restructuring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As you look at your -- the offsets between your guidance and kind of achieving your guidance, and kind of saving 2000 -- bolstering 2010 if this goes longer, as it looks like it will, where do you guys come out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Help me with that question one more time, Cai.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well I mean, if you look at, because clearly it looks like you're going to spend more on 150. If it looks like you have the trade-off of kind of coming in at the absolute bottom of your range, and kind of bolstering 2010, just for instance, if it looks like it's weaker, and kind of delivering a little bit more, where's -- where do you kind of put the trade-off, in terms of where you set the restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would tell you, Cai, we're looking at this on a long-term basis. I think there's restructuring opportunities across most of the businesses, and I think, as you'll see here in the coming months, we'll take additional actions based upon what we see happening in the markets, because the idea here is we want to outperform, outperform this year and outperform next year, and even beyond. So we're going to rightsize the business for the markets as they exist today, as we see them, and we're not going to -- we want to be proactive as opposed to reactive to this restructuring. I think that's what the 150 is meant to convey, there's a sense of urgency on our part to get on with this, and again more to come beyond that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And could you give us some help in terms of which -- what types of restructuring are you looking at doing? What sectors, if you can help us there, and what types of things you're looking at doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Well clearly, the $150 million that we're launching here is all quick payback, it's primarily head count-related structuring. That is, taking out structure, taking out G&amp;A, taking out overhead, across the businesses. In fact, all of this 150, as we look at it, has a payback of less than a year. Even if we didn't see all the gains in the back half, I'm  still confident that we cover this, just through the restructuring savings.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague, Citi Investment Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just switch from the P&amp;L to the balance sheet, for starters. Greg, I assume it's pension, but your equity took a -- roughly a $5 billion hit sequentially in the quarter. Could you just give us some color on what's going on there and where the funded status actually played out at the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah it did. Obviously I think it's almost a $6 billion charge, down in other comprehensive income, or down in the equity section, and 4 billion of that related to pension plan performance. We ended the year down about 27% on a return basis, and on an ERISA basis, I think we're 91% funded at the end of the year, so just a little bit under the target of 94%. We'll do a little funding this year.</p>
          <p>The other major change that's down on the equity section is the charge related to just currencies for cumulative translation adjustment, and as the currencies move obviously against us in the back half here, that was a big swing down on the equity section as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then flip side of that equation, the big move in other long-term liabilities is pension and OPEB moving around also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, just switching gears back to restructuring question, kind of following on where Cai was. As you look deeper and go for more in the slowdown, do you get more into kind of heavy manufacturing restructuring actions? Tougher to do, longer to play out, slower payback? Maybe just some line of sight on really how this might progress over the next year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the first project of restructuring that we're going to launch as I said is going to be very quick payback. And as we dig further and further into this restructuring, obviously the paybacks aren't quite as good. And eventually, you do have to start taking out capacity. Right now, everything that we're looking at has pretty good payback. These G&amp;A actions are rest of the year. Some of the branch office restructurings around the world, the payback's a little -- a year, or two years. And then we move into the big factory closures, if we come to that, if we  really think volumes are going to be depressed for a long time, those are more like four-year payback. So I think you're right on track, I mean it's just depending upon how we see the markets, continue to see the markets develop here, we'll tell you how deep we're going to have to cut.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, just on this question of deferrals, a couple people poked around at obviously in these earlier questions. I'm just wondering if there's anything different in the complexion of what's going on? In other words, are you seeing deferrals once projects have already started and people kind of killing stuff midstream? Are these deferrals that are happening kind of earlier, before ground breaking, and how does that compare with maybe what you've seen in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think a lot of the deferrals, Jeff, are in the -- in China, in the emerging markets, where there is not as much rigor when a project starts or before ground breaks. So some of these deferrals are before these projects have -- even the ground has broken. They do have some deposits with us, so we -- and the reality is the underlying demand, as I said, would not go away, because there is going to be the demand for people to move to cities in China, and maybe at a gap for a year or six months, but then the urbanization trend will start again and some of these projects will be back on track. A lot of these deferrals are in the emerging markets where the profile is different than what you would see in a Western Europe or American market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and then just finally, what's the color for the tax rate in '09, Greg?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should be just about the same. Right around 28% is the targeted effective tax rate, as it was for the last few years.</p>

          <p>Hi Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Carrier, if I look at Q4, you would have had benefits from copper, should have helped on margin. And I would expect that the average currency that you dealt with was not as weak as you thought it was going to be at the time of December dinner. Could you talk about the margins in each of the four units there? I know you said commercial was up. What happened in each of these that got you to this lower margin in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just a couple of points here, I'll -- let me start out and Akhil will fill in some of the detail. But if you think about copper, copper actually averaged about 3.37 for us in the fourth quarter at Carrier. As we've said, we got about six months of long-term agreements in place typically, so the significant decline in copper, down to the 1.50 a pound we saw towards the end of the year, really didn't benefit and won't benefit Carrier until sometime in the second quarter, really more in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>As far as currency, I think one of the big surprises, or one of the big challenges that Carrier faced was this unprecedented move in currencies, and I'm not talking about U.S. dollar versus euro. I'm talking about Japanese yen versus Argentinean peso or Brazilian real. And we actually about half of the margin decline that we saw in the residential international business was actually related to these abnormal or displacements between these currency pairs, where we're producing product in Japan or Thailand and then shipping them to South America and other places. And that -- typically we've looked at that and we've not hedged those transactions, but then again, we've never seen currency shifts the way we saw in the fourth quarter. So, that was really the biggest -- biggest, I'll  say, headwind that Carrier saw in FX last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But when you look at the margin, then you're saying that, say operating leverage was not a particularly important issue here. So what I'm wondering is, when you go into '09, and I know you're expecting weaker revenues, are we looking at an issue here with capacity and operating leverage that will put some additional stress on margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's not what we think. I think if you go back to the math that Ari laid out in the December meeting, we expect high single-digit organic decline, maybe a little worse than we have seen, in the fourth quarter. That would give about a $375 million headwind from a contribution point of view. We have additional $150 million of headwind from FX, and so that's a 525 million roughly headwind.</p>
          <p>Of that, the good news on the other side is commodity, which should start to give us some benefits, maybe more in the later half, as we get to benefits of long-term agreements going away and these spot rates starting to come into play. That's between 100 to 125 million. Carrier has some aggressive product cost reduction actions that they have taken this year, which will be another 100 to 125. And then restructuring actions should give another 100, because you see, Carrier has had the largest chunk of the restructuring dollars in this year.</p>
          <p>So I think that would all get it back to the $200 million roughly midpoint guidance that we gave, down year-over-year. Now is there more stress, as we see the order rates, and certainly in the first quarter and first half, as we look at the more profitable Carrier transit cold business, seeing the order rate declines? Yes. There is some stress in the system, as Greg mentioned earlier, but that's basically the rough math, how Carrier will perform better than what we had expected in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it fair to say that there will be pressure, basically, of an operating leverage nature, but that you're going to be able to offset those -- offset that pressure with restructuring, commodity prices, and product cost reduction. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the game plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from David Strauss, UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Following up on Doug's question, what are you assuming for the net commodity cost benefit in 2009 for businesses in total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're expecting about 150 million of actual tailwind in the year, a little over 100 million at Carrier, and the rest between Otis and Pratt Whitney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Greg, what is that assuming for price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have assumed a relatively flat price in the case of Carrier and Otis. So the pricing tailwind is less than what had seen 2008. But there is not a huge amount of negative pricing assumed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally, I think it was Joe that asked about the Aerospace aftermarket. I think in December, at the December meeting, you were talking about a slightly lower aftermarket in total for Aerospace. Obviously, with taking down your traffic forecast, from flat to now down 3 to 4%, I would imagine would be materially worse than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah obviously, if RPMs do in fact come in down to 3 to 4%, that's going to put pressure on the aftermarket, both at Pratt Whitney and as well at Hamilton.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Any sort of guidance on what the aftermarket would look like under that scenario for you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not comfortable giving an updated guidance today. I think we closed out Q4 okay, and the first couple of weeks have been okay. But I think it's too early to really give you any specific guidance. Again, Hess and Bellemare will have a chance to update you on all this when we get a little bit more weeks under our belt here in just another month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I think for Carrier, you talked about a 10% organic revenue decline in '09. What are you assuming at Otis and Fire &amp; Security? So ex -- excluding currencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Otis, the plan was based -- the guidance was based on high single-digit organic growth, and Fire &amp; Security was low to mid single digits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning guys. Just a couple quick follow-on questions. When you go back to the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, should we expect some sort of charge or something related to the demise of the Eclipse program, because wasn't that the launch customer for the PW600?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was indeed the launch customer for the PW 600, but we've actually taken care of, in the fourth quarter, of any exposure that we had related to the Eclipse program. It was a little less than $0.02, and I think that's all pretty much behind us now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And then is there an upcoming labor negotiation in Sikorsky, and if there is, what's your expectations for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, one more time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Sikorsky, do you have an upcoming labor negotiation? In one of the facilities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do. We have actually the -- with the National Brotherhood of Teamsters. That contract expires on February the 15th. And we are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to reach a settlement with the Teamsters for that, and not go through another work stoppage like we had just three years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Nigel Coe, Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Just a couple quick follow-ons here. On the pension, you mentioned $4 million of funding. Is that still going to be in stock, or are you going to put cash into that plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that will be primarily in cash, of that 400 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And then, on the inventories, we saw a big reduction this quarter. I'm assuming that's primarily within Carrier. Did that have any outsized impact on the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, if you think about it, the inventories were down about 700 million from September through December, and Carrier was the biggest piece of that, down about 300 million. But we actually saw inventory reductions at each of the businesses for the first time in a long time. Pratt was the other one, down almost 250 million. So I think it was just good inventory management, and we've been focused on this for the last year or so, as you know. I think it's just another typical normal fourth quarter behavior.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and do you have any targets for inventories, maybe a 2009 year-end target for inventories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Louis has targeted a 50 basis point improvement in inventory turns each year, so if you think about that, I think our inventory turns ended the year at around 4.8. Obviously that's not great, but there's clearly upside there, so. Yeah, we hope to drive inventory turns at least towards the mid-fives towards the end of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally, within Carrier, how would you describe your lines of communications with your customers there? I mean, are they giving you any color on their end markets, assuming they're back at work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing exceptional, other than what you're hearing or reading every day. There is concern about the capital expenditures on the commercial side, although the orders have held up relatively well, I think driven by our energy efficiency play.</p>
          <p>On the residential side, the market has been so weak for such a long time that I don't think anybody is thinking -- in fact, Louis had mentioned our expectation that housing starts for 2009 would be 662,000. I think the most recent number is 606,000. So it's just hard to believe that those numbers could keep going down, but that's the gloom out there in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just a quick one, on transportation shipments. You said orders are down 50% during the quarter. What about shipments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shipments for -- there is a little bit of a lag between orders and deliveries, so the shipments were down in sort of high single-digit levels in the fourth quarter, with a greater decline towards the end of the year, in December. So we expect that to have some greater impact in first quarter and in first half. But then that business is one where the snap back happens relatively quickly as well. If and when the economy starts to recover, that business will be quicker to snap back than some of the others businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks a lot.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Macquarie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Just a couple questions on Otis, if I could. Looking at order trends, you were down 8% on a like-for-like currency rate in the fourth quarter. It's early days in Q1, but what are your sales people saying you could expect for this first quarter of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early, Robert. I think we should wait for till you have DDA in front of you in February, if we can have at least six weeks of data by that time, and that would be the time to really talk about it. A lot of the companies, a lot of the people out there push hard and -- including our customers, focus on the year-end, and the first two weeks of January are never a good indicator of what's to follow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and on the deferrals issue which we've talked about a little bit this morning, when these customers are deferring, are they deferring 2008 or 2009 deliveries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of it is 2008 deferring into 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So they have a relatively short window of time here, between them making the decision and the actual impact on you? We're talking a couple of months, maybe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's exactly what happened. I think in the fourth quarter, we saw these deferrals accelerate, especially in China. And again, they were not cancelled, they were just simply deferred into 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if the market conditions for your customers, say in China, remain weak for the next six months, is it conceivable that Otis OEM production could actually turn out to be lower than you're forecasting, because of these deferrals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it could be. If these deferrals continue, or if we're continuing to see more deferrals -- right now, we're forecasting at a high single-digit new equipment growth at Otis for 2009, and clearly that'll put pressure on if we continue to see deferrals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Howard Rubel, Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Couple things. First, just to conclude on your balance sheet, or just to come back on that, Greg. I mean, in this market that has much more uncertainty than we've seen in awhile, why not not buyback the stock and wait for a little more clarity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess what I would point to you, Howard, is the $5 billion of free cash flow that we had last year. I guess we all continue to think that UTX stock is probably the best investment that we can make with that free cash flow dollars, and we're not going to stop the acquisition agenda either. But as long as we see this sort of visibility for strong cash flows and I think fourth quarter's a great example. Despite everything going on in the world, that we generated 141% of net income in free cash flow. So unless we see some major change in the markets, I would think that UTX shares are going to be the place that we continue to invest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I understand on the acquisition agenda. And could you provide a little color in terms of, are you closer to finding either suppliers or horizontal transactions that would add to the business in a material way? Are discussions more lively than they've been, or people still holding out for the same argument that you've just made with your stock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well -- obviously, I think they're all -- everybody's got the same view in terms of valuations today. I think that Louis said it, talked about a willing buyer and a willing seller. Yeah, we are clearly in the market. We think there's some great values out there. We want to add to the core. We still have strong cash flows, and I think a good currency, that we could do a deal issue. But again, willing buyer, willing seller, and these things take time. I can't comment on anything more specifically than that, as you know, but we want to keep looking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you've talked a number of times about kind of -- I mean, a lot at the tone the call has been frankly the challenge of predictability. Are there any kind of signs you have, either you can talk about positive and negative, what you're looking for that would give you some comfort that, in fact the -- whenever you reset guidance, that this is rock solid bottom, we've seen the worst. And sort of just to complete this thought, is that look, if the number turns out to be below the end of -- below the low end, are you really just prepared to say, look, this is a number that's rock solid, and it was just hard to get there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're maybe a couple of steps ahead of us here. We're not going to change anything. We're not anticipating a change of guidance. I think the minus five to the plus five that Louis talked about, we still see that as guidance for the year. There's positive things out there that are happening in the market every day, and I can't point to any one thing that's going to give us the confidence that the markets won't get worse.</p>
          <p>So what we're going to focus on are those things that we can control, and that is our overhead cost, and the efficiencies within the supply chain and in the factories, that we're going to continue to focus on those things, and we're going to work to outperform.</p>
          <p>So, yeah, it's a tough question, Howard. I think we've -- it's something that we're continuing to focus on. We don't know how bad the markets are, but I think we're actually cautiously optimistic. I think there's lots of stimulus out there. We have a bigger stimulus package passed here shortly I think by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by the new President. And once consumer confidence starts to recover, as we all know, that's what drives the U.S. economy and eventually the world economy. So I don't want to throw in the towel on guidance or anything else now. I would just say, we stand by what we said in December, and we'll see what happens.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Actually a little bit on that theme, Greg, I wanted to get a sense of kind of a better understanding of your economic assumptions embedded in 2009 guidance, and a sense of a change in revenue visibility you're seeing kind of versus usual. If you think of the profile of the visibility in kind of year one and year two for sales, how does that differ for you as you think ahead, of not only 2009, but 2010? Because I'm just wondering, on 2010, given your combination of long cycle and shorter cycle businesses, some of 2009 sales would be somewhat cushioned, but I'm wondering how much cushion you have in 2010 sales?</p>

          <p>My crystal ball is not very clear beyond about tomorrow, and as we get out to 2010, it's really pretty cloudy. I will tell you, though, the backlogs are still very strong in the businesses. If you think about Otis, as I said before, backlogs were up 9% for the year, and in the shorter cycle businesses, obviously backlogs don't make nearly as much difference as does just the general economic initiative that we're experiencing in the world. We've got very strong backlog in Sikorsky. I think we've got good backlog in the Fire business in Fire &amp; Security. The OEM businesses at Hamilton and Pratt, again, all look pretty good.</p>
          <p>But there's obviously pressure on all things, I would say outside of the military spending here. Aftermarket will continue to be strong. People still use elevators every day, even if they're not building new buildings. So 40% of our revenues come from the aftermarket, so I'm not -- trying not to generalize here, but I think we feel pretty good about the revenues for this year, and not so bad about the revenue outlook for next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And on your assumptions for the first half being weak in 2009 and the second a half recovery, is that -- embedded in that, are you -- is that predicating a global recovery in the second half, so that your earnings kind of rise along with that rise in consumer confidence that you talked about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we're anticipating is it will be a probably late 2009 recovery. It will probably be led by consumer confidence, and I think mostly that will happen in the U.S. And we will see that first at Carrier. Carrier is the first to see the pain of an economic slowdown, and first to see the benefit of an economic expansion. As well, as you think about the compares from 2008 to 2009 in the back half will be easier, because it was a pretty tough back half of 2008. So we'll see what happens. But right now I think we are cautiously optimistic, as I said, that you should see an economic rebound, with all these massive stimulus packages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then turning actually to Hamilton Sundstrand. Are the Hamilton  Sundstrand systems that you've delivered on the 787, are they presently able to fully interface with all the other systems on the aircraft, or are you having troubles there, and can you talk to us a little bit about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think in fact, all the systems that we have delivered including the electric power system are up and operating, and we are fully ready to go for first flight here. I think we're still working with the Boeing Company one some final certification of the electric power system. Should have that done by the end of the month. But right now, we think everything is good to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that includes being able to operate within the other systems, not just on a standalone basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Okay. Our last question then, Sean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question will come from Myles Walton, Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Greg, you mentioned a couple of times this stimulus package. I'm just wondering, is there anything direct -- a benefit that UTC is seeing or could capitalize from it, or are we more talking about the indirect and consumer confidence issue that you alluded to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously the consumer confidence piece is probably the easiest to point to, but I think in some of the proposals that we've seen in the stimulus package and especially as they relate to energy efficiency products, fit right into the Carrier, Fire &amp; Security, and Otis businesses. So we actually are optimistic that we'll get a little bit of a bump just from those particular programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any way to quantify that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wish I could. No. I think it's just in general -- a general feeling that you are going to see investments in energy efficiency, you're going to continue to see investments in green buildings. It is part of the new President's agenda. I think that's all generally good for UTC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And then, one last one. Could you give us an update on the F-35 engine development and your schedule for delivering the redesigned third-stage STOVL engine to Lockheed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are still on schedule. We've had a couple of testing issues over the last month. We had some FOD, or foreign object, enter the -- one of the engines and we had another engine shut down. But other than kind of the typical normal development problems that you encounter on a high tech engine like this, I think we are pretty much on track.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that could happen in the next few weeks to next month or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have an exact date for you. Let me get back to you on that, Myles. But I think yeah, right now, word from Pratt is we are on schedule.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, thank you, everyone. We appreciate your time. It has certainly been a very good 2008, and I think we should not forget 2008 performance. In 2009, it will be challenging. We all realize that. But we are prepared. And we look forward to speaking to you in another couple of weeks. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.</p>
