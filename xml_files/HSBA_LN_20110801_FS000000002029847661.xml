        <plist>
          <p>Good evening from Hong Kong and a very warm welcome to our 2011 interim results webcast and conference call. I'm Douglas Flint, Group Chairman. With me the Group Chief Executive, Stuart Gulliver and the Group Finance Director, Iain Mackay.</p>
          <p>We're going to take you briefly through HSBC's encouraging first half performance, hopefully to relieve &#x2013; allow maximum time for your questions. Stuart will start with the highlights. Iain will then run through the financials and Stuart will finish by looking in more detail at the business performance.</p>
          <p>But before I hand over to Stuart, can I just say a couple of words about the geopolitical and regulatory situation. It goes without saying that the current geopolitical and regulatory environment remains a challenging backdrop against which to operate and to plan the business. We are continuing to take our responsibilities very seriously indeed and they're engaging constructively and transparently with national and international efforts to improve financial stability and the resilience of the international financial system. At the same time, we are emphasizing the need to maintain and protect the supply of credit to the real economy to preserve the growth agenda. The key point is that &#x2013; the key point we continue to make is that there needs to be an increasingly robust cost benefit justification for each incremental measure on top of the already considerable aggregate reform program already in place.</p>
          <p>For those of you on the webcast, could you take a moment to read the usual cautionary words on your screens. And for the avoidance of doubt, all the dollar figures in the presentation are US dollars unless stated otherwise. Stuart, over to you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Douglas. We saw an improvement in financial performance in the first half of 2011 and we've launched a range of initiatives to improve capital allocation, to improve cost efficiency and to grow the business in the right direction. And we've seen an improvement in revenue trends with higher revenues in each of our faster growing regions. We go into the second half from a position of financial strength and with capacity to grow.</p>
          <p>Reported profit before tax increased 3% to US$11.5 billion. Earnings per share increased 34% to $0.51 per share and dividends in respect of the period were 12.5% higher as we signaled earlier in the year. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see our key financial ratios. We're reporting a return on equity of 12.3% and the cost efficiency ratio for the half year rose compared to the first half of 2010 to 57.5% but declined from 59.9% in the second half. Significantly, the cost efficiency ratio in the second quarter was lower than each of the previous three quarters.</p>
          <p>Our advance/deposit ratio rose to 78.7% from 78.1% at the end of 2010 leaving considerable room for further growth. And we continue to generate capital, strengthening our core tier 1 ratio to 10.8%. Now Iain will take you through the financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Stuart. I'll start with our headline numbers on a reported basis. There are four points I want to highlight. Profit before tax excluding changes in the fair value of our own debt increased by 16% or $1.6 billion to $11.6 billion. Revenue growth in certain key markets combined with continuing reductions in loan impairment charges was partially offset by increased costs. Including the unfavorable change in fair value of our own debt, reported profit was up 3%. Our tax rate benefited from the non-recurrence of significant taxable gain in the first half of 2010, as well as deferred tax assets recognized in the US during the first quarter of 2011. Underlying financial performance also improved. PBT was significantly up against both halves of last year, 13% against the first half and 20% against the second.</p>
          <p>On this slide, we've drawn out the notable factors from underlying business performance, taking the income line first. With a number of economic hedges in place to manage interest rate and currency characteristics, of senior and subordinated debt instruments issued by HSBC Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries. These do not qualify for hedge accounting and generated adverse changes of $1.1 billion in the first half of last year and $314 million in the first half of this. Importantly, these have no impact on cash flow or economic performance.</p>
          <p>Following the refinement of our present value of in-force assets within our insurance businesses, we recognized a gain of $243 million in the period.</p>
          <p>Turning now to expense line notable items, these included $611 million of provisions in the UK relating to customers redress program, mainly PPI, a pension gain of $587 million in the UK as we rebased indexation against the consumer price index as opposed to the retail price index. And a $477 million charge against restructuring costs, notably including the impairment of software development costs, mainly within suspended One HSBC programs amounting to some $270 million. Finally, you can see the effect of the tax items I have already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Turning now to one of our major sources of revenue growth, we grew total customer lending by 6% and the lending was higher in all regions except North America, where we continue to manage down balances in the run-off portfolios and also saw lower balances in credit cards as customer behavior changed. We grew customer accounts by 5% for the group with every region recording growth, so our funding and liquidity position remain very strong.</p>
          <p>Revenue trends improved. Total gross revenues were broadly stable at $35.7 billion and the mix improved. Revenues from faster growing regions accounted for 47% of the total, up from 42% last year. The main growth drivers were strong growth in Commercial Banking where revenues were $819 million or 12% higher, notably in Asia and Latin American and higher sales of wealth management products in Retail Banking and Wealth Management notably in Asia and in Europe.</p>
          <p>Revenues were however lower in three main areas. The declines that we already signaled in balance sheet management, in credit and rates within Global Banking and Markets following uncertainty in the Euro zone and the effect of higher write-backs and legacy positions within structured credit last year and from the continued run-off of consumer finance portfolios in North America as we mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Loan impairment charges fell by 32% to $5.3 billion, the lowest since the first half of 2006. Most of the improvement was in the US with the run-off consumer finance portfolios benefited from lower balances and improving delinquency. And our cards business continued to see household deleveraging, evidenced by increased balance pay down and reducing delinquencies.</p>
          <p>This slide shows the significant factors behind the 10% underlying cost growth. I have already covered the notable items. Much of the increase in staff costs relates to faster growing regions in many of these markets, which are very competitive. We also experienced quite significant wage inflation.</p>
          <p>As noted, we've launched a number of programs to improve efficiency and capital allocation. These comprised the restructuring costs in the second quarter, notably, in Latin America, the United States and Europe. These cost efficiency programs are beginning to turn the momentum as you can see here. In addition to the increased FTE and wage inflation, we also recorded a pension credit adjustment in the second quarter as noted earlier. As a result, while costs rose by 2% against the second half of 2010, the rate of growth slowed markedly. And in the second quarter, our cost efficiency ratio of 54.4% was lower than in each of the previous three quarters.</p>
          <p>Finally, this slide shows the group's continued capital strength. There was a 6% increase in risk-weighted assets, lower than a 8% increase in customer lending on a reported basis. Continued capital generation led to an increase in our core tier 1 ratio to 10.8%.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn it back to Stuart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Iain. Today, I'm going to focus primarily on our first half performance. But first I would like to update you on our progress against the strategy that we articulated in May to become the world's leading international bank. To recap on the strategy, our network covers the majority of world trading capital flows and provides access and exposure to faster growing economies as well as mature economies. So, how do we seek to position our business given this context? Well first, within Global Banking and Markets and Commercial Banking, we focus on fast growing markets and their trading capital flow connections with one another and with selective mature economies.</p>
          <p>Second, within Retail Banking and Wealth Management, we focus on the high rates of wealth creation in the fast growing economies together with preservation of stores of wealth in certain target mature economies and of course we continue to run full-scale retail businesses in the UK and here in Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>In May, we outlined plans firstly to deploy capital more efficiently; secondly, to improve cost efficiency; and thirdly, to achieve growth in target markets. We are making progress in all three areas.</p>
          <p>First, we have stepped up discipline on capital allocation using our five-filters framework. We have announced the closure of our retail businesses in Russia and Poland, focusing instead on Global Banking and Markets and Commercial Banking connectivity. And we have also announced the disposal of three insurance businesses in the UK, Bermuda and Mexico. Much more materially in the United States, we have announced the disposal of 195 branches principally in upstate New York and we're progressing the review of our credit card business.</p>
          <p>Second, we are targeting $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion of sustainable cost savings by 2013. And since the start of this year, we have begun operational restructurings in France, the UK, the Middle East, the US and Latin America which will reduce our head count by some 5,000. We have also launched detailed plans to reduce the cost of HSBC 's global and head office support functions. And we have initiated more efficient business operating models for our Commercial Banking and Retail Banking and Wealth Management businesses.</p>
          <p>Third, we are positioning the business for growth. As a management team, we expect to be judged on growth in both profit before tax and return on equity as well as cost efficiency. In Retail Banking and Wealth Management, we are expanding in key markets with a substantial growth in sales of wealth products across Asia. In global asset management, funds under management reached a record high at the end of this period. And we also grew revenue from cross-sales of Global Banking and Markets products to Commercial Banking customers and indeed our cross-border referrals between China and the rest of the world grew by 50% compared with the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Now let's look in more detail at how we are delivering on our targets and driving growth by business and then by region. First of all, Commercial Banking. Commercial Banking profits increased by 31% to US$4.2 billion, supported by strong lending and therefore revenue growth. We continue to capitalize on our connectivity between developed and emerging markets, growing our trade revenue by 26%. We grew lending fastest in Latin America and Asia in response to customer demand. And we also achieved significant positive <mark type="ph" /> draws (12:55) in this business. The return on risk-weighted assets was 2.4%.</p>
          <p>This slide shows how we are repositioning our Retail Banking and Wealth Management business to capture wealth creation, to grow revenues and to restructure the retail business. We brought together our personal financial services, asset management, and insurance businesses under one management team headed by Paul Thurston. And incidentally, note that we now report asset management here and not in the Global Banking and Markets segment.</p>
          <p>We are achieving revenue growth. We saw a notable increase in sales in wealth management in Asia and Europe and strong growth in mortgage lending in the UK and here in Asia. And we have conducted a strategic review which will result in our exiting from businesses with a poor strategic fit. Clearly the substantial increase in profits in the first half reflected improvement in impairment charges across all regions notably in the USA for now. Costs rose as we invested in increased head count in Asia and Latin America to support business growth. As Iain mentioned, we also took provisions for customer redress in the UK, mainly in respect to PPI. The return on risk-weighted assets in this business was 1.8%.</p>
          <p>In Global Banking and Markets, performance held up well against what was a very strong first half in 2010, but profits were down 16%. But they were actually resilience in the face of difficult market conditions which led to lower revenues in credit and rates in Europe and as we signaled previously, we also saw lower balance sheet management income. These factors were partially offset by growth in financing and ECM, payments and cash management and equities and securities services.</p>
          <p>We have often argued our Global Banking and Markets business model is different from our peers and this can be seen perhaps a little more clearly in the first half of 2011 where we have fared better than others. The diversity of our business was a protection in difficult markets with revenues from faster growing regions rising by 10%, partially offsetting weaker performance in Europe. Return on risk-weighted assets was 2.6%.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the regions, starting with Europe. Compared with the first half of 2010, profit before tax fell by 39%, and on an underlying basis, it fell by 28% to US$2.2 billion. As I mentioned a moment ago, this was driven mainly by lower contribution from Global Banking and Markets. However, Global Banking and Markets remains strongly profitable in Europe.</p>
          <p>In Commercial Banking in the UK, income from customers using international products grew by 16% on the increased growth in lending to SMEs. We remain on track to achieve our lending goals under the Merlin agreement. We also continued to grow our mortgage book in the UK. Our mortgage share of new lending rose to 11% and this new lending is very high quality with a loan-to-value ratio of 53%. Higher costs in the UK reflected strategic investments in Global Banking and Markets. Now since the period end, we have announced a restructuring in the UK and in France affecting around 1,400 jobs.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East and North Africa, performance was resilient. We remained open for business despite unrest in 10 out of the 14 markets where we operate. Profit before tax was significantly higher from the first half of 2010, mainly reflecting improved credit performance with strong growth in reported PBT in our three largest markets in the region, Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.</p>
          <p>Costs were higher. However, we announced a restructuring during the period as we focused on improving business efficiency and as you would expect, revenues remain subdued due to the uncertain political environment. However, it's worth remembering this is a region that's home to 60% of the world's oil and to 6 of the 10 largest sovereign wealth funds and also we have operated here for more than 50 years. We therefore remain optimistic about the region's prospects.</p>
          <p>In Latin America our pre-tax profits rose by 23% to $1.2 billion. Overall revenues for the region were up 12%, driven by growth in Brazil. We achieved notable revenue growth in commercial Banking and Retail Banking and Wealth Management.</p>
          <p>We continue to restructure our regional head office to improve cost efficiency. And where we saw cost growth, this was reflected by wage increases in an inflationary environment and also additional front-line staff recruitment especially in Brazil. The costs also reflected the first tranche of restructuring following the closure of 66 branches in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Our North American business achieved profit before tax of $672 million compared with a loss in the same period last year. We continue to manage down the consumer finance portfolio and balances in cards declined. As a consequence, total revenues were lower. This contributed of course to the higher cost efficiency ratio, but also to considerably lower loan impairment charges and therefore to improved profit before tax.</p>
          <p>We continue to reshape our US business. As I said earlier, we've announced the disposal of 195 branches principally in upstate New York and we're progressing the review of the cards business. Canada continued to perform very strongly and was our fifth most profitable country in the first half, with a profit before tax of US$527 million.</p>
          <p>Now at the full year, I emphasized that protecting our leadership position here in Hong Kong was absolutely core to our business in Asia. So it's encouraging to see Hong Kong continue to perform very strongly. We saw balance sheet growth, strong sales of wealth management products and mortgages and an increase in trade related revenues. I would also note the continuing strong credit quality. Customer loan balances grew faster than risk-weighted assets as we added good quality lending.</p>
          <p>Staff costs rose, both to support increased business volumes and in response to inflationary pressures. Profit in the rest of Asia-Pacific rose 21% to US$3.6 billion, we achieved strong revenue growth of 13% overall, which as you can see was well spread across our major markets with particular strength in mainland China. We saw robust lending and deposit growth on widening deposit spreads and we increased sales of wealth management products. As in Hong Kong, staff costs rose to support increased business volumes and also reflected inflationary pressures. The contribution from our associates also rose. Together Hong Kong and the rest of Asia-Pacific produced over half of the group's profits.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to say a few words about the economic outlook. We remain positive on emerging markets. We anticipate a soft landing in China and expect the risk of overheating in Hong Kong to ease. We expect continued strong growth in the rest of Asia and Latin America and we remain positive on the outlook for the Middle East. But there are clear short-term concerns. The geopolitical and regulatory backdrop is uncertain and presents challenges to developed economies.</p>
          <p>In closing, I would add that I'm pleased with these results which mark a first step in the right direction on what will be a very long journey. Thank you for your time and attention. We will now take your questions and first the operator will explain the procedure and introduce our first questioner. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay, sorry, okay. So just wanted to understand the increase in loan loss provisions in second quarter versus first quarter. From what I understand, North America seems to be behind that increase despite the decline in delinquencies and charge-offs at HFC, so just wanted some color on that. Second, if you could tell us the capital gains that you're likely to book on the sale of the branch network to Bank of Niagara today. And lastly just some color on your outlook for the rates and the FX in the equities businesses, in the GBM which is done very well on a half-and-half basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. Actually the main driver behind the loan impairment charges, Sunil are actually in the line of impairments unavailable for sale of securities. We took $65 million against Greek bonds and then there was some $280 million on other impairments within the available for sale of securities, so that was the main driver in the second quarter. And if you think about what was underlying that, it was principally what we saw going on in the Euro zone, so that was it.</p>
          <p>If you look at the US portfolio overall, the loan impairment charges there were stable. Obviously we've had a declining trend over the last 7 or 8 quarters in that particular area and that trend stabilized in the second quarter of the year, although obviously continue to represent a significant decline against the same period last year as well as the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the transaction in the US, that transaction's priced off the deposits, which will be sold to First Niagara when the transaction closes sometime in early 2012. The premium to those deposits is about 6.67% and once the transaction closes, it's obviously highly dependent on the deposit base at the time the transaction closes. We'll obviously provide a little bit more insight, just certainly the accounting gain that would be generated from that.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital release of the risk-weighted assets that are being disposed, it releases about $350 million. And in terms of the overall proceeds, we're going to realize somewhere in the region of $1 billion from the proceeds of that transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and as for Global Banking and Markets. I think what you've got to do is dig into the various revenue lines in Global Banking and Markets. Clearly, we are impacted in line with the market by what's gone on in Europe and you can see that in the credit line, which is actually down year-on-year. But actually in rates and foreign exchange, equities, securities services, we're up because these are really businesses that are based around customers in the emerging markets. So our global banking revenues are up 12%, equities are up 23%, which is really an Asian business now with some Middle East and Latin American components. Securities service is up 14%, payments and cash management went up 24%.</p>
          <p>So as we've said often, we have a different mix of revenue streams within this business and I see no reason why we shouldn't continue to see reasonable growth in foreign exchange and global banking and the equity piece, securities services and PCM. Obviously through our credit and the fact we're a primarily dealer in a number of European government bond markets, that credit line will be impacted if the Euro zone problems continue to resurface and that's chronic.</p>
          <p>Remember, we don't have a significant commodities trading business, which is one of the reasons why I think we have outperformed some of the competition. We never built one and therefore we haven't seen a strong reversal in earnings that have come through a number of the thick numbers of our competitors. But this kind of reflects a lot of the investment we have made to really develop a customer facing Global Banking and Markets business, and we are starting now also to see some reasonable traction in ECM and equities here in Hong Kong, which has always been a little bit of our Achilles' heel. We've always been a very strong debt house in Asia but have some catch-up to do. There's still a lot of catch-up to do, but there's at least some trend, directional information here in that area which is also encouraging.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Smillie from RBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you gentlemen. I have three questions please all relating to geographic movements on the balance sheet. Firstly could you give us a sense as to the contribution to the other Asia risk-weighted assets from the associates, and I believe my asking is that about a third of the incremental group part of your <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:38) is coming from other Asia and then part of your zone ratio there is the same heavily distorted by the associates, so some understanding of their contribution to the number there would be very helpful.</p>
          <p>And secondly, inside Europe it becomes quite incremental RWA move is so low given that there is a very big pickup in the loan book there which doesn't seem to be flowing through to risk-weighted assets there. And then thirdly, in sight of the strong deposit performance of the group, it looks like France is the standout geographic contributor. And again I'm getting that coming from GBM, but some color as to what is happening inside there would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will kick off with France and Europe and then Iain can talk about the associates. So the deposit base in France is not coming from Global Banking and Markets. It's actually coming from the build-out of a Commercial Banking and Retail Banking and Wealth Management business there and a very deliberate policy to reduce the AD ratio of our French business, where the French market traditionally runs with AD ratios of 120%, 130%, more towards a group standard. So that's quite a deliberate move on the part of our French colleagues to actually win deposits within that market.</p>
          <p>The RWA impact in Europe is probably due to the growth of actually two things, in essence mortgages in the UK which obviously carry low risk weights. This is the bit I talked about earlier with a 53% LTV. And also we've done quite a bit of a switch into secured lending from unsecured lending so growth in trade finance and so on and contribute quite low RWAs. As for the associates, Iain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'm actually busy searching for that number's here, but what I can tell you, Ian, is that what we have done the risk-weighted assets within the associates in the rest of Asia-Pacific, we have in fact, in actual fact consistently across the group, that we have allocated them into customer groups to which they relate. As far as the Chinese associates go, the most significant proportion of that relates to Commercial Banking within BoCom, obviously approximately 60% to 70% of the risk-weighted assets which are consolidated in a proportional basis for reg reporting, settled within that. I don't have the exact number at my fingertips, but I will get that number to you at a later date if you don't mind, Ian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Ian, if you look at page 29, you can see an illustration of what Iain is talking about. The Commercial Banking RWAs are actually greater than the Commercial Banking's nominals.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's BoCom. So you can probably make a stab at that yourself. It's why there's an oddness to the fact that the nominals are actually in the case of Commercial Banking lower than the risk-weighted assets. It's because of the attribution of the associates' BoCom numbers into CMB.</p>

          <p>On the restructuring Cormac, of the total $477 million that was recognized in the first half, $270 million of it related to impairment on software development costs across a number of suspended work streams within one HSBC. If you'll recall, there were about 10 work streams there. We suspended work on three as we revisited the business models for Commercial Banking and Retail Banking and Wealth Management. The total impairment there was $270 million and across the remaining $200 million, that was principally restructurings within Latin America, the Middle East and Europe. In Latin America, which was the larger of the three at this point, it's principally within the Retail Banking and Wealth Management spaces. We've restructured some 66 branches within Mexico, but also addressed some of the &#x2013; head off the structural matters with in Mexico as well. But broadly within Retail Banking and Wealth Management, I think as we move through this, you'll find that there will be a spread across the customer groups and we'll keep you informed as to how that comes through.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, turning to China, the slowdown in the economy is part of the policy statement that was made in the 12th five-year plan where China indicated that it wished to see GDP growth drop to around 8%, and the 8% was a sustainable number and that the 13% number that they have been peaking at was in their view unsustainable and leads to some social pressures within the country. So first of all, this is not a slowdown that's being done to the Chinese government, i.e. it's the economy and they're responding; it's a direct policy initiative of the Chinese government.</p>
          <p>Now because China does not have a fully developed money market, its central bank is not simply reliant on official interest rates, i.e. the Fed funds or base lending rate equivalent to try and influence the overall macro direction of the economy. It has a raft of micro credential levers at its disposal, everything from moving reserve ratios to actually being able to direct through the branches of these state owned banks, specific lending to specific sectors by city, by province. So the richness of the micro credential tools and frankly the technical skills of the technocrats at the center, many of whom I've met and have visited for over actually 25 years gives me a great deal of comfort that China actually will manage a soft landing and will not have a hard landing.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, ladies and gents. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:30). First, given capital generation of the group is and how strongly all your key metrics have improving, whether we should be using EPS growth as a proxy for your thoughts about dividend distribution capacity. Because clearly bonds growing meaningfully faster than the other in the first half. And then secondly, just a point of interest really. Hang Seng pretty much stepped on the breaks in the first half and we saw Hong Kong Bank in Hong Kong kept on lending at a pretty fair clip. Were there anything we should read into the shift there, whether that's because of the different mixes but historically they've often grown in line and actually caught big divergence in the first half, what we should read into that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Hang Seng Bank, I don't think you should read anything into it other than the different business mixes of the two banks, And don't forget that the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation, you're right, came off the pace in 2009 when we were doing the rights issue for the group overall and actually scaled back some of its balance sheet growth at the time where Hang Seng Bank did not need to do so. So to some extent, you need to look at the fact that Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation kind of underperformed if you like in terms of volume variance, Hang Seng Bank during the period where we were raising capital at the group level.</p>
          <p>As for dividends and share price performance in EPS, I don't think we see the world in quite such a rosy way as you do in the following sense. Okay in the first half, we have an ROE that appears to have got inside our target of 12% to 15%, but of course that's based off a Basel II capital number. If you rebase and recalculate this, which of course is what we do based on our estimates of where Basel III would be, that ROE number falls quite dramatically. And to put it into context, roughly estimating on a Basel III basis, we'd need to have made an extra US$2 billion in the first half, so not $11.5 billion, but $13.5 billion to have got a 12% ROE on Basel III. So I think if you're working around to share buybacks, et cetera, I think we are a long ways away from that and indeed were we to get into a situation where we have far too much retained earnings, we'd deal with it through dividends rather than share buybacks. I don't know if Ian if you might want to add anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the other thing to bear in mind, Alastair, is within that return on equity that we reported first half, it's obviously got the benefit on the tax line of a not insignificant credit from the utilization of foreign tax credits through deferred tax recognition in the US. So, if you normalize for that one-time effect, our return on equity comes down to around about 11.5%, 11.6% and then there is the effect that Stuart talked to in terms of Basel II versus Basel III measurement basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening. Three questions if I may, first of all just a confirmation on the UK tax, the bank tax, $600 million I think was the number you have been suggesting might be the liability. Can I just confirm that will all come down in the second half and whether or not you've actually revisited that in any shape or form, given you haven't got a lot more information, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is a follow up on restructuring. Obviously we are going to see some pretty hefty restructuring charges one must assume over the next 2.5 or 2 years or so. Again can you could give us any thoughts on perhaps what you could share with us the sheer scale of those on a half by half basis and whether the $477 million, is it a reasonable sort of guidance to where we might be. I know you had the software charge there. And yes those are the two questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Chris, I think on the bank levy as you quite rightly point out, there is no new information on that front. So, I think as you leaf through with great delight the 250-page document that we put out, you'll find that our disclosures in that regard are consistent at $600 million. The accounting for this is still rather odd in the sense that we would theoretically book the whole thing on December 31, once we know the shape of the balance sheet on that day. But no, the number has not changed.</p>
          <p>On restructuring charges, I wouldn't read too much into the first half. As we implement around sustainable sales and consistent business models across Retail Bank and Wealth Management, as that may or may not affect head count, it may or may not affect other items whether it's in the form of dispositions or closures of businesses, we're absolutely going to try and balance the overall natural attrition that we see coming through head count on an annual basis, in terms of how we right size the workforce in each of the key regions around the group and try and effect that in as efficient a way as possible. So I certainly would not read too much into the $477 million or for that matter the $200 million excluding the software charge. What we absolutely will do is, as we have clarity in each of the measures that we're implementing, we'll provide you with that information on a timely basis.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys. A couple of questions, one on balance sheet management, the other one on the US funds corporation. Just on balance sheet management, came to $1.8 billion, just under for the half. It looks a little bit stronger than perhaps your previous guidance for the full year of $2.5 billion would imply. I wonder if you could give us a Q1/Q2 breakdown of that, and also whether you want to take up I mean your guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>And then on US, my question is that it looks like the impairment charge ticked up. If you take out the first quarter $400 million special provision for the change in economic assumptions, it looks as if there was an increase Q-on-Q of about $200 million. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:55) on the secured books because if they have gone up a little. But I just wondered whether you could talk about trends in the US as well, then please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will take the balance sheet management, Iain the delinquency trends. We have unexpectedly, I guess from our regional assumptions seen higher interest rates in a number of the countries in the rest of Asia-Pacific in response to higher inflation, actually it's also true in Latin America. So actually we have seen interest rates go back up and actually some quite sort of steep curvature in the yield curves in Latin America and in the rest of Asia-Pacific, which has benefited our balance sheet management numbers. We have also seen at times in UK and at times also in the Euro zone, where obviously rates are going back up, opportunities if you like to reload our positions where one and two year rates have backed up to a level against the overnight carry rate. So, I think it probably would be appropriate to lift that balance sheet management guidance, where I think we've set the kind of expectation around $2.5 billion to $2.5 billion to $3 billion. But probably not higher than that, because actually lower the curves again, particularly in the Euro zone, Sterling, et cetera, have gone back to being incredibly flat and the extent to which we've seen rates rise in the emerging markets has already happened as it were, but I think a kind of $2.5 billion to $3 billion rather than $2.5 billion is more appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking to loan impairments, certainly when you look at the US books of business whether in the context of two plus delinquency, continued downward trend in delinquencies across the mortgage services portfolio which as you'll recall has been in run-off now since early the first quarter of 2007. And as it relates to the consumer lending portfolio, which has essentially been in run-off since the tail end of 2008, absolutely stable quarter-on-quarter. Loan impairment charges in the US as you quite rightly pointed out, in the first quarter we took an adjustment for some of the economic assumptions primarily related to foreclosures in that regard. But in the second quarter they've actually dropped off, again resuming that downward trend that we'd experienced in previous quarters. Perhaps if you look more broadly at loan impairments across the group, one of the effects that you may be picking up is slightly higher impairments on the available for sale portfolio in the second quarter as we took the effect of impairments on Greek government bonds which were US$65 million. And then the effect of some repricing within the available for sale portfolio which took us to about another $280 million of impairments in the second quarter. So that may be the factor that you are picking up there.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Good evening, two or three questions, if possible. And just Stuart, you mentioned the 5,000 I think job cuts on the restructuring so far. Just what I'm trying to do, is just marry up the potential head count reduction. I've seen different figures mentioned. I'm not sure it's something that's officially in your disclosure or just on the wires, but, or more like 25,000. I'm just trying to match up the head count reductions against the $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion of cost saves that you see over the next two, three years. I wonder if you could clarify that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Looking at the 10-Q for Household, you're still at about the US$6 billion level on the capital. I'm just wondering is there any pressure to increase that? Or how does that capital move as you continue to run off the balance sheet?</p>
          <p>And the third thing is, there is an FX benefit in the core tier 1 and I'm just wondering are you sort of naturally hedged in terms of risk assets and core tier 1 or is there any a real benefits to core tier 1 ratio from that FX effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the jobs. So we've confirmed that there are 5,000 jobs cut took place in the first half which were made up of 700 in France, 700 in the UK, 1,700 in Latin America, 1,400 in United States, which is totally separate from any disposals and 300 in the Middle East. What we've also said and I said in answer to questions earlier today, as I expect to make a further 25,000 job cuts between now and the end of 2013. These are in addition to the 5,000 so a total of 30,000.</p>
          <p>This is a very approximate ratio, but if we are looking to take 10% out of the cost base of the firm, it's not altogether surprising that there is about 10% of a head count to the firm. What I have also said though, Mike, is that these are gross numbers. So therefore, given that we are in parts of world that continue to boom, it is quite possible that the net head count number it is not minus 30,000. It could be a smaller number, because we've added people. It could also be a bigger number because we've been successful in disposing of businesses, because this head count cut does not include head count that leaves the firm as a result of selling a business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's very clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As it relates to capital in the finance company, as we run down the portfolio as you would quite naturally expect, there would be some release of capital as we reduce those risk-weighted assets. However, at the same time as there are some change in characteristics in the portfolio with respect to at a probability of default or loss given a default, there is some upward pressure in terms of risk-weighted assets in that regard. But overall, the finance company is capitalized at the level with which our supervisors are happy. To the extent that we release capital as we run down those portfolios, that capital will be released certainly within the North American environment for redeployment across other lines of business in terms of being able to distribute it from North America back to the parent for allocation elsewhere. That's somewhat at the gift of the US supervisors at this point and as is well documented in the press, the US supervisors are less inclined to allow banks to do such things. But overall, certainly we're at the level or above the levels of capital with which the US supervisors are happy at this time.</p>
          <p>In terms of the FX effect on the capital ratios, broadly &#x2013; well not broadly, specifically speaking, we're generally hedged across our subsidiaries and branches just by the composition of the balance sheet which tend to be naturally matched in the currencies within the businesses in which we're doing work. So, we don't carry significant unhedged positions within the capital base. And generally, the capital base is not that susceptible to significant movements within our businesses.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello everyone. Can I just ask you about the seasonality in the cost to income ratio quarter by quarter because obviously, the second quarter things looked a lot better than first quarter. But if I look at the sort of first half and first half trends, even adjusting for sort of numerous one-offs and the US run-off, revenue was pretty flat. Costs were sort of high single-digit, so it's kind of going the wrong direction at the moment despite pretty good volumes and I think a better BSM out in the first half. So I just wondered if you could give us any thoughts on whether the sort of move into the second quarter is more reflective of what's really going on or are we going have to wait a bit longer possibly for the improvements to come through? Thank you.</p>

          <p>The second quarter I think is probably more directionally indicative of the journey we are on. Don't forget, we only had the Investor Day on May 11. The new team took over on 1st of January. This 300,000 roughly staff in 87 countries is quite a large ship to turn. What's quite pleasing within the first to second quarter numbers is there was strong revenue growth actually in Commercial Banking and Retail Banking and Wealth Management. So actually the revenue line actually picked up first to second quarter and I think looking around at some of the comparative results reporting so far, that's actually quite unusual. But I'll let Iain just comment on any of the technical cost numbers that are running through it. Clearly as you appreciate, Tom, there's a raft of sort of one-offs flow through these numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Tom, I have great fun trying to explain our cost number, just because of all those one-offs. But I think obviously the focus for the business over the last few months has clearly been delivering against some of the sustainable costs saves that we laid out in Strategy Day at the beginning of May. We're clearly beginning to build some momentum in that regard. We would expect to continue to build that and deliver on some of those sustainable saves through the second half of the year. But as Stuart quite rightly points out, there are any number of programs that we have got underway in this regard. We're certainly on a good trend, but there are some I think vagaries if you like in some of the revenue lines that we saw in the second quarter certainly with respect to some uncertainty in the European area which we'll keep a very close eye on and then adjust course within the cost lines as we see the revenues coming through. But momentum is good and I think generally we are on the right glide path to get to the sort of cost position that we want within the group.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. One quick follow-up, I think unrelated. Just on the impairment you've taken on your Greek bond exposure, what percentage, sorry, of the gross exposure did that represent?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think against the carrying values that we had at June 30, it was just over 30% in the available for sale portfolio and if you give me one second, I'll dig out what that was. Yes, it ran to about 30% deduction against available for sale within the Greek bond portfolio at that time. So it was, we had about $200 million &#x2013; around about $200 million at that time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, sorry, the carrying value, is that marked? That would have been marked-to-market already and then you've taken a 30% impairment on top of that or that's the total return?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Rohith Chandra-Rajan from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thanks. A couple if I could, please, one on sort of operating trends and a couple of slightly related actually on broader strategic issues. Just on the operating trend, you signaled at the 1Q IMS that you were looking at margin stability. Margins for the first time in a number of years seems to have improved in the quarter so up from 2.52% I think in the first quarter to 2.56% in the second. You talked previously about stabilization certainly on the deposit side in terms of liability spreads. I wonder if you could give a bit more color as to how you're thinking about the margin going forward.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, sort of more broadly on the strategy and highlighting the statement, progress on the strategic review, the credit card business in the US, that obviously has about $60 billion of RWA, so much more significant versus the $350 million in equity that you highlighted in the branch disposals and so I wonder if you could give a bit more color around that. And also coming back to your comments on costs, just wondering in terms of the initiatives that you've announced so far, how far in terms of run rate that might get you to the $2.5 billion to $3 billion of targeted cost reduction? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On net interest margin, there is a number of moving parts in the net interest margin number. I mean obviously we continue to run down that very heavy margin business in the States, Household, which obviously has resulted in the contraction of net interest margin. But in the other direction we are starting to see actually the ability to reprice credit actually in places like Hong Kong and China because interest rates and reserve ratios have increased a number of times. On the other hand in the rest of Asia-Pacific, we are again seeing deposit margin increases as interest rates have gone up in a number of countries, same in Latin America.</p>
          <p>But here in Hong Kong, there's actually deposit compression partly caused by a significant amount of money having moved into RMB out of US dollars and Hong Kong dollars creates a little bit of a kind of shortage in those currencies. And in the UK there is also deposit margin compression coming out of the competition for deposits from the state-owned banks looking to repay the Special Liquidity Scheme of the Bank of England by December of this year. So it's reasonably mixed, but the encouraging bit is that we're actually starting to see some ability to reprice credit across the piece in Asia-Pacific. So there is some signs of everything balancing out. Again just on the negative, we have deliberately started to move the book into secured from unsecured. That of course have a lower run rate.</p>
          <p>On this strategy, we have got nothing to report today on the credit card portfolio in United States other than that the process continue to run. Once we have got something to report, we will come back to you at that point in time. And yes, you're entirely correct that this one is the one that has a material amount of RWAs and would make a material difference in terms of capital release. But it's a work in progress at this moment. As for the costs, I think we are only in the foothills of the restructuring that's required to deliver the $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. There is a lot more to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess sort of your comments earlier to some of that costs that, sort of 10% head count reduction is sort of consistent with the 10% reduction in the cost base. Is that the case based on the 5,000 to date, would that be a fair assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's based on the 30,000, the 25,000 plus the 5,000.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. So far you're using the same assumption based on the 5,000 to-date versus your comments on the 30,000.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes look, we're clearly &#x2013; I think the thing to understand is, I'm not managing to a head count target, I'm managing to a cost efficiency ratio target that we set out. Remember when we set out the sustainable cost saves, we also did not say that you'll be able to deduct $3.5 billion from the cost base of $37.8 billion and find that we were operating at $34 billion. It was to create capacity equally. As we remove a chunk of jobs, we're clearly going to try and remove the biggest amount of costs we can. So it's not really about head count, but the head count has become a focus for a number of the press commentators in the last 48 hours. But it would be fair to say that one of the significant inputs to that $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, but only one, is clearly reduced head count. And the other thing to bear in mind about this is the 25,000 plus 5,000 takes no account of what the ICB may require us to do or indeed we may decide to do as a result of whatever the ICB recommends. And again it's impossible for us sitting here this evening to say whether that would reduce, would result in a reduced head count beyond the 30,000 or actually an unchanged head count.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And I appreciate, you sort of highlighted the uncertainties around all the number different drivers around the margin. Is your expectation still stability going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it is actually. I mean, don't forget, we have got this big portfolio running down and also if we are successful in selling that credit card business, that's clearly a very high margin asset business. So you also need to factor that in. In a way, the net interest margin of the group has been flattered by a couple of business, one of which actually had a very high revenue number, but an extremely high loan impairment charge and write-off number and therefore a disappointing PBT, the other of which has had a high return and actually a very profitable experience for us, but which is non-strategic. So don't forget, if we do succeed in disposing of the credit card business, it will be negative for the net interest margin at kind of first blush. But it is not a business that strategically we think makes sense for us. And we think that if we are able to do that and release a chunk a capital, we would do much better by our shareholders to redeploy that into faster growing emerging markets, which in assets with much lower risk weights than where it currently sits.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Helsby from Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi there, guys. I've just got two questions if I can. Firstly on loan growth across the regions, I think you've seen a slowdown as <mark type="ph" /> reflected (57:59) in Q1 in the first half versus year-on-year. I know you've got a bullish outlook on emerging markets, soft landing in China, et cetera. I was wondering, though, if that level of growth now has reached a level that you feel quite comfortable with, so you're quite happy with that type of balance sheet growth from a risk appetite as you look forward.</p>
          <p>And second question on sort of volumes and trading, I was wondering if you could give us any comment if you've seen any contagion or disruption in the market in Asia as a result of all the noise that you're seeing coming out of the US and out of Europe. And attached to that really but just thinking more about your fixed income businesses, I was wondering if in a developed market perspective, whether you can relate to the sort of revenue declines that peers have been seeing so in FIC, people have had down mid 20s Q-on-Q. I appreciate you have not got the same business mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of loan growth across Asia-Pacific, we are reasonably comfortable with the loan growth that we've seen. We have not in any way loosened our credit underwriting standards and we're comfortable with the credit risks that we are taking. We continue to have a very low advance/deposit ratio. We continue across Asia-Pacific to have an AD ratio of 59%. We have a lot of liquidity. We've grown our deposit base as well as growing our loan growth. The other <mark type="ph" /> credit (59:42) growth in Asia was about 8.5%. The loan growth was about 13%, so we're booking good quality assets. So we're comfortable with these kind of run rates.</p>
          <p>I see no real impact from what has gone on in the United States and what's going on in Europe to our business in either Latin America, the Middle East or indeed Asia-Pacific. And that of course explains in a large part why our Global Banking and Markets business is down 16% and others are down by much more. We have a very different business model. It's much less proprietary trading. We never built a commodities business up, so we don't have the now negative swing of a commodity business. And we have a business that's very much rooted in a customer base and in a customer base where the GDP growth is very high. Asia ex-Japan GDP growth before costs at 7.5% in 2011. That's obviously much higher than where Western Europe, the UK or the USA sit.</p>
          <p>So, I think that what would be fair to say is if you look at our credit business in Europe which is the biggest like-for-like read across, so wherever a European primary dealer, we do have similar declines in our profitability to what you see other European primary dealers have. But as I say, that's quite a small proportion of the Global Banking and Markets business and it's really been built around seven or eight revenue streams, all of which make over US$1 billion and it's geographically diversified to the emerging markets.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, everyone. I've just got one question actually, one area which is on in Hong Kong and particularly on this issue of Hong Kong dollar liquidity tightening up. Could you just give us your view on what that could mean for Hong Kong margins going forward? And also whether you think that could end up constraining Hong Kong loan growth? And then finally whether actually given your quite low LD ratio in Hong Kong, what the value is of the Hong Kong dollar LD ratio, but also whether that would put you at some sort of competitive advantage if Hong Kong dollar liquidity continues to tighten?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's actually ample liquidity in the market, but prices are going up. Those banks have been &#x2013; reliance on private banking, wholesale funding are bidding up to attract deposits. There has being this kind of skew in the Hong Kong market created by an enormous take up of offshore RMB. But I don't believe that actually there is a systemic problem as yet. And we have a very low AD ratio of 52% in Hong Kong, so it probably has little impact on us at this moment in time. And we've always had deposits at the sort of center of our funding strategy as you know. So I think what you're actually seeing is probably an increase in margin caused by effectively a slight supply/demand imbalance that that's not across the marketplace. For those banks that have substantial retail deposit bases, this is probably an opportunity. For those banks that have been reliant on wholesale funding, their margins are now being squeezed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so you said it might slow loan growth in Hong Kong or indeed how regulators feel about this either. Have there been any pressure coming from regulators?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regulators are certainly showing some concerns at an individual bank by bank level as they rightly should do as prudential regulators. But we're not privy to those individual conversations that they are having. The HKMA wrote to all of the bank CEOs reminding them of the need to grow their deposit bases to match their loan growth. I also think there's some indication as well that some of that high loan growth was due effectively many being borrowed in Hong Kong going across the border into China and given that China is in essence somewhat slowing it's economy, some of that pressure has also gone away.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, everybody. Could I have three <mark type="indiscernible" /> (64:00) please? Firstly on the expenses, could I ask you whether the second half of the year is likely to be higher than the first as it normally is? And just to clarify on these restructuring charges you have taken, what is the head count associated with the restructuring booked in the first half. That's the first area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Iain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As first half versus second half, Robert,  I think you're looking for forecasts again. So I'm probably not going to dish those out to you. I'd probably revert back to some of the earlier comments that Stuart and I made around certainly building momentum around sustainable saves. But being at the early stages of that, we will obviously continue to focus in the second half and through to 2012. When you think about the restructuring charges, $477 million in the first half, $270 million related to software impairments, the balance of $200 million or so. Certainly to the extent that those restructurings affect head count and we've talked about 5,000 through the half point, then clearly those restructuring charges cover any head count effect from that. But if you think about this in the context of the Russian disposition of the retail bank, wealth management, that was actually sold to Citibank. The restructuring charges that we took in that regard were absolutely de minimis. The most significant element of that $200 million actually related to the restructuring of some branches and the regional head office in Mexico in the first half. But certainly that $200 million addresses the &#x2013; included within that is the head count component of any restructuring in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Secondly, in terms of the roughly 10% reduction of head count that you're looking at on a gross basis and that equivalent reduction in expenses or certainly again on a gross basis, what kind of revenue impact do you think you would have with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Robert, to the extent I mean that the $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion remember is very much focused on sustainable saves within retained operations. So to the extent that we looked at removing ourselves from certain retail bank, wealth management businesses around the world, as Paul and the team refocused that business model, then there would be to the extent we disposed any of those business or closed them, there would be a revenue impact. But I think if you reflect back on some of the pages that we shared with you at Strategy Day, the PBT coming from those businesses within retail bank that we would focus on is absolutely de minimis. So at this stage, until we get into a little bit more of the execution beyond that which we've already announced, it's probably not appropriate to sit and talk about revenue impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the final area was a broader area as we approach the ICB publication. Can I ask what thoughts you have from overseas regulators as to what approach they might take post ring-fencing that comes in in the UK or what thoughts you may have as to what that indication has for businesses outside the UK for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask Douglas to answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Robert. We are not aware of anybody who is thinking of following the UK on a ring-fencing approach. I mean it's pretty clear talking to the major universal banking centers, Germany, France the United States, China that they continue to see the Universal Banking Model as core to their banking systems. I suspect there will be interest and observation at whatever proposals are put out, just to analyze them to see whether there is something other people have missed. But the feedback that we are getting from others is that this is not a route that they are contemplating because they believe the aggregate impact of everything that's being done so far is fairly comprehensive. But of course, it's so hypothetical because we don't know what the ICB will recommend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I as a follow up to that, what I was really driving at is whether regulators are taking &#x2013; may potentially take a different approach to your businesses because there is a reduced I mean effective support from the UK government as they ring-fence only a proportion of the activities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I mean I think the rating agencies used to give a small amount of credit to a group's structure and looking at the ratings of subsidiaries. They stopped doing that explicitly quite a time ago and basically everyone stands on their own. And I think that is the framework that regulators around the world now very much adopt to. They want to see the capital and support in the local country. If there is a parent, that's okay, but I don't think that they've taken enormous amount of additional comfort from that anymore.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thanks, thanks very much. Simon Samuels at Barclays Capital. Just a quick question really, on the fact that your total balance sheet grew by about 10% in the first half of the year and your risk-weighted assets only by 5% or 6%. And it looks like the big kind of area difference was North America. And I think there was an earlier question where you commented about through a higher proportion of mortgages where the average risk weightings come down a lot. So my question really is, is this kind of disconnect going to carry on do you think? Do you think the RWA growth will now lag the balance sheet growth going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, I think as it relates to the run-off portfolios in North America, it's unfortunately the opposite factor that we're experiencing that as we run down the portfolio, we're not at this stage seeing the same reduction in the risk-weighted assets as there's some adjustment to loss given default and probability of default as we update for some of the economic factors coming through the models. I think that will turn over the course of the next few quarters, but there is a little bit of a disconnect at that level.</p>
          <p>But I think what you do see more broadly across the portfolios is a fact that Stuart mentioned as it relates to net interest margins are remixing away from some of the unsecured products into secured lending across a number of the regions. And certainly overall the quality of the assets that we are putting in the balance sheet whether it's in Hong Kong, other areas within Asia, Latin America, has been maintained and continues to have a very tight focus around the quality of new business that we are writing whether it's the loan-to-values on UK mortgages, Hong Kong mortgages. Again they're underwritten at very low LTVs. So I think overall the focus is on putting, obviously is putting high-quality assets in the book and focusing very strongly on the impact that that has on risk-weighted assets and consequent effect on returns.</p>
