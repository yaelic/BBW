          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, and welcome to LVMH 2009 Half Year Result.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, and welcome to this conference call. I'm Jean-Jacques Guiony, the Chief Financial Officer of LVMH. As you may know, we had to advance the date of our communication with the market of the first half figures due to the fact that some information accidentally became available on some newswires yesterday. In order to ensure proper and timely information to all market participants, we took the decision to issue a press release yesterday and advance our meeting with the financial community. We hope you will forgive us for the inconvenience.</p>
          <p>Before I begin, I must remind you that certain information to be discussed on today's call is forward-looking and is subject to important risk and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially. For these, I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement included in our press release.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to today's topic, first half figures. I shall cover the first part with most significant figures and Chris Hollis, Group's Head of Investor Relation will cover the main development of our different business groups. And after this, both Chris and I will be available for question. The press release is available on our website, lvmh.com, as well as a slide for today's presentation and the interim financial reports.</p>
          <p>So let's start with slide one -- sorry, slide two. And I shall start with revenues for the first half of the year. As shown on the slide, they are broadly in line with the trend evidenced during the first quarter, with sales in euro being slightly up, while organic growth shows a 7% decline. Chris will comment on business groups in more details. But main comments I would like to make are the following.</p>
          <p>First of all, Wine &amp; Spirits remains a top business, with minus 22% for the semester. The main feature obviously of the semester was the fact the distributors made heavy cuts in their inventories. It is nevertheless worth noticing that the cognac business seems to be holding up better in recent months, despite a very demanding comparison base in the second quarter of last year. Last year, figures were up, if I remember correctly, about 17%.</p>
          <p>Fashion &amp; Leather is up 1% in organic terms, showing the particular resilience of Louis Vuitton, which was double-digit in euro for the &#x2013; in the first half of the year. I presume such a performance would be difficult to match by any player in the industry. For the brands, the second quarter suffered somewhat from the negative impact of initial deliveries of the fall/winter collection. This is a clear reflection of the prevailing difficult environment, particularly within department stores.</p>
          <p>Perfume &amp; Cosmetics is down 6% in organic terms, but the second quarter was significantly better, with the slowing, at least in the western world, of the destocking impact that we experienced earlier this year. Our sell-out figures are holding up reasonably well in most countries and make us feel quite optimistic for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Watches &amp; Jewelry are showing negative figures, which are mainly attributable to the level of inventories within the trade. And although the second quarter figures are not as bad as first quarter's, we expect only a gradual return to a more normal market condition.</p>
          <p>Finally, Selective Distribution. It's showing flat organic sales growth for the semester in line with first quarter, yet the travel retail business has proven more difficult throughout the period with the fear of swine flu weighing on traveler activity. Conversely, Sephora, particularly in Europe, improved during the semester with positive growth in some countries including France and Italy.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to slide three which shows the geographic breakdown of revenues. Europe and Asia including Japan accounts for roughly one-third each while the US is one quarter. I've said many times in the past, the geographic balance of our sales is an invaluable asset, particularly in the current market conditions. I would just point out on the fact that emerging countries represent about 30% of sales in H1 and were significantly up compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide four, where you may see evolution of sales in our main geographies. No major changes between first and second quarter, with U.S. and Japan being the most affected by economic additions while Europe and Asia are holding up pretty well.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to the next slide where you may see our simplified profit and loss account for the period. I would like to make the following comments. First of all on revenues, which are flat. I think we already discussed. Secondly, on gross margin, gross margin is slightly down at 63.8% of revenues versus 65.6% last year. More than half of the decline is attributable to the currency impact. As you will see later on, currencies all together have a positive impact on profit in the third term, but a negative impact on gross margin as the currency movement have more impact on revenues than they have on cost of goods.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are more or less flat in euros, but minus 5% in local currencies. We are very glad of this cost settlement, which is not obvious, in light of the weight of fixed costs in the total particularly. We managed to lower our cost base despite some businesses like LV Sephora growing nicely during the period, and without implementing major and highly disruptive social plans.</p>
          <p>Current operating profit is 12% down from last year, the combination of lower sales only partially offset by lower costs. This said, in one of the toughest environment that the Group ever had to manage, we are pretty pleased to report figures that are only about 10% lower than last year.</p>
          <p>Other operating income and charges are negative by &#x20AC;130 million, reflecting mostly reorganization plans, particularly in the fashion brands and at Zenith. I shall discuss financial charges in a separate slide in a minute.</p>
          <p>One comment on tax. The Group's tax rate is slightly up as expected, about 32%. The main impact on taxes was the end of the capitalization of tax losses carried forward, which has had a positive impact on the Group's tax rate for the last few years. As a result, Group share of net profit is down 23% at &#x20AC;687 million.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to slide six and some details in the current operating income, which is broken down by business group. As expected, in view of the difficult top line environment, the bottom line of Wine &amp; Spirit suffered too and despite a very strict cost of shipping. So the current operating profit is down 41%.</p>
          <p>Fashion &amp; Leather did much better and showed a 7% rise in current operating profit in the first half despite the difficult situation of some of the small brands within the division. Louis Vuitton achieved a fantastic performance, combining top line growth as we've seen before and positive operating leverage, extending from a very strict cost control. We expect this performance to be difficult to match in the industry.</p>
          <p>Perfume &amp; Cosmetic did also pretty well. The drop in current operating profit of 8% is in line with the drop in sales, showing the impact of cost-cutting initiatives implemented during the semester.</p>
          <p>Obviously a more difficult situation at Watches &amp; Jewelry where the drop in sales could not be matched in any way by an equivalent reduction in cost. This said, the Watches &amp; Jewelry division did a fantastic job in the semester in terms of cost reduction and brand management which should enable it to rebound strongly when the market condition improve.</p>
          <p>Finally, a more difficult picture at Selective Distribution, with a 15% drop in current operating profit despite slight -- flat organic growth, sorry. Most of the drop comes from the travel retail business which has started numerous cost-cutting initiatives, particularly in terms of concession fee reductions which will only impact the P&amp;L by the end of the year or in early 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide seven, let me address the currency impact on current operating profits. As you may see on the slide, and after seven years of negative currency impact, we have a slightly positive currency impact of &#x20AC;56 million during the semester. We registered a better yen and dollar in the semester respectively by plus 20 and plus 13% higher than last year. But our hedging gains, although significant, were much lower than last year. This explains the 56 million. We should expect, I think, a more quiet second half in terms of currency impact with average yen and dollar being probably closer to last year's and comparable hedging gains to last year.</p>
          <p>We have added on this slide the impact of the business decline which is basically an 8% drop in the Group's gross margin at constant currency, and also the impact of cost control or cost reduction with the Group cost base being down 5% on a constant currency basis. All in all, what you may imply from the chart is three things. One is that our current operating profit was only marginally boosted by currency. Two, leaving aside currency impact, the business impact on sales and gross margin is broadly similar, minus seven or minus 8%. And three that we managed to reduce our operating cost base by 5% in constant currencies. Obviously, the biggest drop was in marketing, but selling expenses essentially fixed were flat while G&amp;A was down.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to slide eight and the analysis of the net financial charges. It's a very important point in my view. First of all, the cost of debt was flat in the first half with two antagonistic trends, one being the drop in interest rates which benefited about half of the debt. The other being the higher average debt in the semester that I show you in a minute.</p>
          <p>The cost of hedging was much lower than last year. As you know, these costs is by and large unpredictable and the drop may not be extrapolated for the rest of the year. That said, we are also working on limiting the cost of our currency hedging portfolio.</p>
          <p>Finally, capital gains were nonexistent in the first half of this year compared to about 60 million last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide eight, where you may see the balance sheet structure. Not worth a lot of comments. We registered an increase in our equity to 45% of the total balance sheet while we had the euro seasonal changes in working capital with lower payables and receivables. Inventories are up by 200 million, mostly due to the Wine &amp; Spirit business where we had to pay for the 2008 harvest which we committed for in Q2 and Q3 of last year. This move was expected in H1, but we are obviously working with the Wine &amp; Spirit team to reduce inventories in the second half and achieve an overall inventory reduction for the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide10, a few words on the cash flow statement. First, cash from operations was down 135 million, more or less in line with current operating profit. But we got some relief on the back side. Basically, total taxes due for 2008 are slightly lower than the installment we had to pay in 2008. So we started 2009 with zero cash impact from taxes for the preceding year, which was not the case in early 2008, hence the positive difference. Overall, the cash from operations was up 5%, which we feel very favorable in the current environment.</p>
          <p>Working capital requirements were also about 200 million favorable to last year. Yet, this is far from being satisfactory, and we expect to improve this point much further in the months to come.</p>
          <p>The first half of the year suffered from the rise in Wine &amp; Spirit inventories that I had mentioned before, but also from the impact of new loan trends which forbids payment terms to suppliers higher than 60 days.</p>
          <p>And finally, capital expenditures are significantly down, generating an additional &#x20AC;100 million for the semester. And overall, cash from operations was almost 400 million higher in the first half of this year compared to last year.</p>
          <p>I will finish this part of the presentation with a comment on the Group's net debt which you can see on slide 11. Net debt reached &#x20AC;4.47 billion, about 600 million higher than the end of last year. This increase is usual in the first half of the year, mainly due to the payment of dividend to our shareholders and minority equity partners. The Group net debt as of the 30th of June represented 32% of total shareholders' equity.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to Chris, who is going to review the main developments within our various business groups.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Jacques. We'll turn now to slide 13. The idea is to go relatively rapidly through the different business groups, starting with the key figures of Wines &amp; Spirits.</p>
          <p>To further detail to what Jean-Jacques discussed, the first half has been a particularly difficult period in Wines &amp; Spirits due to a significant destocking by distributors, and especially in the Champagne business. This is evident both in the revenue and profitability of this business group.</p>
          <p>For the first half of 2009, revenue was &#x20AC;1.1 billion, compared to 1.3 billion in 2008 first half. The substantial portion of this decrease stems from the Champagnes and Wines business. We saw revenue decline to &#x20AC;458 million, versus &#x20AC;636 million in the year-ago period. As I'll discuss in a moment, wines were not as badly impacted as champagnes. Cognac importantly saw greater resilience in its revenue in the first half.</p>
          <p>Due to this revenue performance, profit from recurring operations in this business grew, with &#x20AC;241 million compared to &#x20AC;409 million in 2008 first half. This included the decline in profit from the Champagne and Wines businesses, which is &#x20AC;77 million compared to 194 million in last year's first half.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, 14. Let me provide a little bit more information about the results in the first half for the Wines &amp; Spirits group. Overall, there was a better resilience of volumes in the second quarter. We estimate that destocking by retailers accounted for 40% of the revenue decline in the first half of 2009. Globally though now we believe the stock situation to be stabilized, with the exception perhaps of Russia and Italy.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that according to the champagne association, the CIVC, total shipments of champagne from the region for the year to May 31 is down &#x2013; were down 23%, including a 40% decline in exports. This is a direct result of the global recession and its impact on consumer spending which is manifesting itself in an increase in at-home consumption as well as trading down in terms of spending on champagne. Volumes of the Group's champagne brands were down 28% in the period, with the prestige vintage segment particularly impacted by the trading down phenomena.</p>
          <p>These consumer trends have had a positive impact on sales of our sparkling wines which have seen good momentum in key markets such as the U.S. and Australia and delivered overall market share gain. In Argentina, however, the economic crisis has reduced demand for wine, considerably contributing to an overall volume decline for Group brand wines of 12%.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide 15, where we'll look at the cognac. The Group's Cognac business has shown better resilience, with volumes down 15%, due in large part to the destocking in the U.S. market. Despite this, our brands continue to gain market share in this important U.S. market, which we believe will serve us well when the environment improves.</p>
          <p>The economic crisis has clearly impacted demand in Europe, notably Russia. However, there has been a better resilience of Hennessy volumes in China in the second quarter following the declines we saw in the first quarter as a result of early timing of the Chinese New Year this year. This stronger performance is particularly evident in northern China, while southern China has been more difficult.</p>
          <p>Retail fee stocking also impacted the Spirits business which saw volumes down 18% in the first half versus last year, but there were some noteworthy bright spots from Glenmorangie and Ardbeg whiskeys in continental Europe, and Belvedere maintained its market share in the U.S. despite fierce competition. And Belvedere is also seeing a favorable reception to its new macerated vodka line.</p>
          <p>Going on to slide 16, the highlights. In the light of the challenging environment and to offset the impact to the revenue decline, the Group undertook a series of targeted actions in the first half, including being more selective in price increases; focusing promotional investment on the highest potential brands within strategic markets -- we'll have some administrations of that in a minute; advertising our A&amp;P -- adjusting, pardon -- excuse me, the -- our A&amp;P expenses in light of the economic context; executing cost reductions relating to logistics; the adaptation of our distribution network to the crisis and controlling other operating costs; and finally, being more selective in operational capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Slide 17, looking now, in terms of the outlook, these actions to improve bottom-line performance will come in conjunction with anticipated positive developments in the second half. As I mentioned before, we believe that distributors have now reduced their inventory levels, and the impact of destocking in the second half will therefore be less pronounced. At the same time, our Maisons are -- have implemented measures to optimize their own inventories.</p>
          <p>We also expect benefit from innovative new products, or publicity campaigns introduced in the beginning of the year, such as the Belvedere IX, the Veuve Clicquot DesignBox, Hennessy Black, or the Scarlett Johansson campaign for Mo&#xEB;t &amp; Chandon.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are strengthening our advertising and promotions in order to bolster near-term sales and deliver value. In particular, we are increasing our promotional activities at the point of sale with more value added tax, such as the Clicquot Ice Jacket, for instance, bringing more value to the customer.</p>
          <p>Finally, most notably in champagnes, the business group will continue to work on the synergies, notably in logistics and production, in order to improve profitability. We've identified these opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce costs and will be acting to achieve them in the near and longer term.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to Fashion &amp; Leather Goods, the key figures. This business once again delivered a standout performance fueled by the enduring strength of the Louis Vuitton brand. As you can see here, revenue rose to approximately 3 billion, up 8% on a reported base and 1% on an organic basis from &#x20AC;2.8 billion in the first half of last year. Profit from recurring operations also rose, up 7% to &#x20AC;919 million from 858 million euros in the year-before period.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 19. Before I give you a break down of performance in this business group, let me tell you a little bit about the geographic performance. Asia is showing continued good momentum, up 18% in local currencies. Europe too was an area of strength, up 4% in local currencies. The U.S. showed resilience in the face of a very challenging climate. Japan was down as well, partly a reflection of Japanese clientele reacting to the stronger yen by increasing their purchases outside of their own country.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the brands. Louis Vuitton once again delivered a remarkable performance and was the clear leader in the luxury sector during this period. Despite the challenging climate, this star brand generated double-digit revenue growth in our first half, reflecting gains in every market. There was particularly strong momentum in Asia, where there's been exceptional growth among Chinese clientele as well as Europe and the Middle East. And, as I mentioned, there were increases in Japanese consumers buying abroad.</p>
          <p>The strength of Louis Vuitton lies in continued innovation, building on the outstanding history and the stellar quality behind this product and the total control it has over its distribution network.</p>
          <p>To give some product highlights for the first half, the Damier Graphite line launched in 2008 has seen continued and rapid growth in sales, and the Stephen Sprouse tribute line created by Marc Jacobs saw success across product categories, and the brand overall saw strong progress in its accessories business.</p>
          <p>Of course, none of these products ever go on sale which shows customers will continue with the enduring value of choosing Louis Vuitton over other brands which have been heavily marked down and thus reducing their value in consumers' eyes. The brand is able to maintain this strict pricing policy by controlling all of its retail outlets, and that number grew to 433 worldwide at the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Louis Vuitton also maintained its commitment to advertising the inherent values of the brand for its selling Core Values campaign with the current advertising featuring the astronauts Buzz Aldrin, Jim Lovell and Sally Ride in honor of the 40th anniversary of the lunar landing, again shot by Annie Leibovitz.</p>
          <p>The brand also hosted a major exhibition in Hong Kong that opened in May and continues through August and has generated substantial positive publicity in that important region and worldwide. I should also note that Louis Vuitton continues to see success in shoes and has started operations at a new shoe production facility in Italy.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Slide 20. Several of the Group's other fashion brands were impacted by the very difficult selling environment in the U.S. as well as Japan which has been widely covered in the media. This was particularly evident in the second quarter revenue performance. There were, however, some bright spots. Fendi continued to expand its own store network, and in fact delivered an improvement in performance. Donna Karan's 2009/2010 fall/winter collection received a very encouraging news contributing to the more positive customer response to this brand. The brand also continues to deliver improved profitability.</p>
          <p>In the Marc Jacobs' world, the Marc by Marc Jacobs line has shown good resilience, and its licensee products, like the Daisy perfume, are maintaining their revenue performance. Givenchy relaunch under its exceptionally talented designer Riccardo Tisci has been successful, and the brand is expanding its presence in China to respond to the demand for it in this particular market.</p>
          <p>And the other fashion brands have seen greater impact with this difficult economic environment, but, again, this is more than offset by the performance of Louis Vuitton.</p>
          <p>Slide 21. In terms of the outlook for the Fashion &amp; Leather group, for Louis Vuitton, the brand continues to focus on delivering the innovation, quality and enduring value that sets it apart. In addition to ongoing momentum in its leather goods business, Louis Vuitton plans to launch a new collection in high-end jewelry. It will also continue to expand its store network with work underway towards the new Maisons in London, Macau, Rome and Las Vegas and to generate significant attendant publicity around all of them. The brand will also open its first store in the new market  Ulaanbaatar in Outer Mongolia.</p>
          <p>Louis Vuitton will also continue its eye-catching advertising and marketing. In addition to the Core Values campaign featuring the astronauts, the brand recently announced that the ever exciting Madonna would once again star in its fashion campaign for fall/winter as she has quite successfully in its recent spring/summer campaign.</p>
          <p>The outlook for the other brands in the second half includes continuing leather goods product innovation for Fendi and selective new store openings for that brand and strengthening of foundations at other brands by continuing to capitalize on the creativity and talent of their design teams while executing rigorous costs control efforts and being selective in investments until the environment improves.</p>
          <p>Now turning to slide 22 and looking at the Perfumes &amp; Cosmetics. This business too has seen significant destocking from distributors. This resulted in a decline in revenue of 6% on a reported basis, or 9% in organic revenue. I should note, though, that with a still high comparison base, the second quarter saw a slight increase in orders from retailers who had considerably reduced their stock levels at the beginning of the year, as Jean-Jacques mentioned. Consistent with this, profit from recurring operations was down &#x20AC;221 million.</p>
          <p>Slide 23, we've concentrated our initiatives on the most important markets, so an increase to once again our market share, which is the best measure for the health of our business. With a lower consumption in most markets and the destocking at retailers had impacted our sell-in. On a geographic basis, Asia has been the only growth region, supported by South Korea and especially the positive results from China.</p>
          <p>Our star brand, Parfums Christian Dior brand, maintained its proactive strategy in innovation and communication with good results. The attention given to the iconic lines of J'Adore, Miss Dior Ch&#xE9;rie and the mythical Eau Sauvage continue to bear fruit.</p>
          <p>There was a remarkable progress in make-up helped by the success of the recently launched Diorskin Nude foundation.</p>
          <p>There was good resilience from Guerlain which focused on its strategic markets and its classic lines, notably the perfume Shalimar and the skincare line Orchid&#xE9;e Imp&#xE9;riale.</p>
          <p>Innovation continues at other brands as well, with the rollout of the recently launched fragrance, the Absolutely Irresistible for women and Play for men at Parfums Givenchy, and the successful new launch of the KenzoAmour floral fragrance from Parfums Kenzo.</p>
          <p>Benefit continued its momentum through rapid growth in China and a promising start of its expansion into Russia and Make Up For Ever hit a notable milestone, celebrating its quarter century anniversary with double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the second half, we should be ready for soft demand with few exceptions of a distribution network that keeps stocks at a low level, but our strategy will not change. The focus will be on qualitative innovation and market share gains even in this difficult climate. The priority will remain on Parfums Christian Dior and the ambition to increase the quality and creativity of all the brand's expressions. First of all, in the support of its perfumes lines, the classic J'Adore and the new Fahrenheit Absolute and in a new impactful make-up, Serum de Rouge, which combines color and lip care with a revolutionary technology.</p>
          <p>There will be dynamic innovations at the other brands. Guerlain will launch Idylle, the first fragrance created by its new and highly talented perfumer Thierry Wasser. Uma Thurman will be the ambassador for Parfums Givenchy's Ange ou D&#xE9;mon Le Secret. Flower by Kenzo Essentielle is a noble version of the Flower line, combining exceptionally high quality raw materials.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the Watches &amp; Jewelry, key figures. The destocking has had a substantial impact across the sector as well. Revenue in this group was &#x20AC;346 million, compared to 417 million in the first half of 2008, down 17% in reported terms and 34% at constant currency -- constant structured exchange rate. Profit from recurring operations was &#x20AC;20 million translating to a 6% margin. The cost reductions implemented at the end of 2008 have not yet compensated the strong declines in revenue.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 26. In the watch market the destocking by retailers in all markets has amplified the softer demand. We estimate the difference between the sell-out of our brands and the reduction in revenue to represent between 10 to 20 data points depending on the market. The Swiss watch statistics demonstrate a 37% decline in watch exports in the 1,000 to &#x20AC;5,000 range in the first half, with the U.S. market down 57%.</p>
          <p>Against this backdrop &#x2013; against the backdrop of this very difficult climate, particularly at the high end of the market, the Group's Watches &amp; Jewelry brands have focused on strengthening their iconic lines, driving productivity improvement across existing networks and stores and maintaining rigorous cost control.</p>
          <p>TAG Heuer won market share in the United States, notably due to targeted initiatives such as the successful launch of the automatic Aquaracer 500, efforts surrounding the 40th anniversary of the iconic Monaco and improving network productivity.</p>
          <p>Hublot showed good resilience as demonstrated in the successful launch of jewelry related to its Big Bang line. It also opened its new manufacturing facility near Geneva.</p>
          <p>Zenith focused its efforts on its watchmaking expertise in its classic lines including celebrating the 40th anniversary of its El Primero movement. The Montres Dior continues the innovation of its Christal line and launched a Mini D, a small jewelry watch.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 27, the high-end jewelry market has been deeply impacted by the global recession. The Group's brands have, however, shown good resistance in their own stores, somewhat offsetting large declines in orders from franchisees. For the last nine months, we have slowed store openings and focused on improving the productivity of our networks and boutiques, while concentrating -- continuing to highlight products that are well positioned in this environment.</p>
          <p>For Chaumet, this has meant both selective expansion of store -- in stores, and focusing its jewelry offering on iconic products and at accessible price items. For De Beers, the classic collections and the solitaires have shown good resilience, leading to the market share gains in the U.S. and Japan. Then, finally, Fred is making progress in France thanks to its popular Force 10 line.</p>
          <p>Looking to the second half of the year, consumer demands remains uncertain and retailer stocks have still not completely stabilized, in particular in the high-end. In this context, our Watch &amp; Jewelry brands are focused on continuing to lure market share gains through optimizing their product offering for the environment. We will continue our efforts to reduce costs, with notably already in our initiative at Zenith, which will have their full impact in 2010. We will support our existing network of retailers and own stores and continue the industrial integration of TAG Heuer and Hublot. Actions undertaken to reduce our own stock levels should bear fruit in the second half and this will be helped the focus on the brands' iconic lines.</p>
          <p>Now finally moving to last sector, Selective Retailing, which saw a 7% increase in reported revenue or to &#x20AC;2.1 billion from just under &#x20AC;2 billion in the first half of last year. Organic revenue is flat. Now, profit from recurring operations was however &#x20AC;129 million compared to &#x20AC;151 million in the year-ago period due essentially to travel retail.</p>
          <p>Slide 30. DFS was significantly impacted by the decrease in international travel, while in the Asian market, the risks linked to swine flu had a clear impact in May and June which was somewhat compensated by the new developments. The Galleria at Macau in particular reported revenue better than we had expected, thanks to a high average basket. The airport concession at Abu Dhabi is off to a good start. And in this environment, DFS is more strongly committed than ever to reducing its cost structure and concession fees and tightly managing its inventory levels.</p>
          <p>Within the travel retail, I should also mention Miami Cruiseline, which had a difficult first half with a large North American clientele, the drop in traffic and customer spend was major and obliged us to reduce cost drastically.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, Sephora delivered revenue growth in all of its markets in the first half of 2009 as well as an increase in its profit from recurring operations. It continues to win market share according to NPD data relating to the U.S. and French markets. Sephora opened 40 stores net of  some closures in the first half of the year, bringing the total to 938 stores worldwide. In China we now have 60 stores which are working very well. Innovation remains the distinctive point of Sephora. We have the ambition to always be out in front in all aspects.</p>
          <p>Slide 31. As far as the second half of the year, we should be ready for a difficult environment. DFS remains committed to rigorous cost management in a difficult climate. At the same time, we will concentrate on building our position in the Asian market. The focus will be on the increasing wave of Chinese tourists, which in time could become the primary clientele for the brand. A second smaller Galleria in the City of Dreams will open gradually over the course of the second half in Macau and the renovation of our Hong Kong Sun Plaza store will start in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Concerning Sephora, our objective is to continue the positive momentum of the brand and strengthen our status as global leader in selective beauty or the beauty authority and we will focus our attention on productivity. But the key to future remains in our ability to offer a unique, innovative and qualitative client experience. The store expansion program will target key markets in order to ensure we have the best locations.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn the call back over to Jean-Jacques for a brief wrap-up before we take your questions. Jean-Jacques?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. I would like just to conclude this brief overview of the activity with a few comments on the H1 performance. First and foremost, I think all the data we get from panels, department stores, et cetera, are showing that we are doing better than the market in gaining market share. This is obviously true for LV Sephora, but also for our Perfume &amp; Cosmetics brands, particularly <mark type="inaudible" /> and even watch brands, despite depressed sell-in figures, are doing better than their market.</p>
          <p>Secondly, emerging markets are showing their resilience and are gaining in importance in the Group's business. Certainly and obviously very important for us, Louis Vuitton did another fantastic performance with double-digit growth in sales in the first semester, so far unmatched by any other brand in the luxury environment, and also a corresponding rise in profits.</p>
          <p>Finally, destocking took its toll in the first half with business like Wine &amp; Spirit or Watches &amp; Jewelry being severely affected. This will come to an end. Difficult to say when, but market conditions are bound to improve. It is nevertheless pretty clear that when we control distribution like Sephora or Vuitton, we do much better than in wholesale.</p>
          <p>Turning to the last slide, slide 34, let's end this presentation with a few highlights on the remainder of the year. Obviously it will be foolish on our side to bet on a material improvements in market conditions. If it happens, fine, we shall benefit hugely from it, but our job is to prepare ourselves for tough market conditions continuing to prevail. In this context, we are not going to shift away from our first-half focus.</p>
          <p>First of all, continued innovation and above all strong run management will remain a key point for us. We shall control our communication expenditures while keeping the objective of remaining present in our customer's mind. Secondly, on the financial side, emphasis will be good on cost reduction and inventory management. Key measures and programs have already been implemented which should yield fully in the second half, particularly on the inventory side. And finally, as far as capital is concerned, we shall keep our very disciplined attitude and spend only when justified by superior returns and low risks. All in all, our aim is to capitalize on the tough environment to exit crisis being stronger than before.</p>
          <p>That is basically all we wanted to say and we shall now open the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Three questions. The first is, could you give any more color on the impact to profitability at the gross margin level versus operating margin level in Wines &amp; Spirits and Watches &amp; Jewelry? And also confirm whether or not there was any impact of write-downs on profitability in either of those divisions during the half.</p>
          <p>The second question is at Vuitton, is it correct to assume that the organic growth for the second quarter was at least mid-single digit?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, in Fashion &amp; Leather, do you think it's reasonable to expect that in third quarter we might see even more significant negative impact to the sales trends in the other fashion brands as you deliver what is then to be a much smaller fall/winter '09 collection compared to the year prior? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. To your first question on the Watches &amp; Jewelry and Wine &amp; Spirits impact on both gross margin and operating margin, let's start with Wine &amp; Spirits. All the comment I'm going to make are excluding the currency impact. I mean, the currency impact is almost negligible for the Group in overall impact as I said before, but it could be fairly disturbing in terms of margin analysis, so I am moving that away.</p>
          <p>Basically, if you look at Wine &amp; Spirit margins, gross margin were more or less in line with last year, no major change. The big issue we had was operating expenses absorption which caused overall margins to decline. And that is said &#x2013; and we should have in mind that in terms of operating expenses, the business did a fairly good job in the semester. The problem is that when business is down 22% in organic terms, it's impossible to have a cost base matching such a decline. So that should not offset the fact that they did a very good job in terms of cost reduction. So that's the main story for Wine &amp; Spirit.</p>
          <p>Watches &amp; Jewelry is a little bit the same with one more negative factor, which is the fact that in terms of gross margin, gross margin were slightly down due to the fact there were some cancellation of orders that took &#x2013; and penalties connected with cancellation of orders that weighed overall on gross margin. And as far as operating expenses are concerned, it's basically the same impact as the one I described on the other division. So, that's your first question.</p>
          <p>Second question on organic growth at Louis Vuitton, as you know we are not disclosing figures on Vuitton. What I can say is that region by region Q2 was roughly comparable to Q1, particularly when it comes to Europe and to the U.S.. Asia was a bit lower than Q1 due to the fact that the Korean business which was really booming in Q1 was less strong in Q2 with the Japanese traveling less. Conversely, the Chinese business boomed in the second part of the semester and was really strong. So, we had a slightly lower organic growth at Vuitton in Q2 than in Q1, mainly due to the Asian business, but all in all, I mean, these were pretty strong figures.</p>
          <p>Third question of yours on the fashion brands in the second half, basically your assessment is correct. I mean, the weakest collection in terms of volume is likely to be the fall/winter collection. I mean, the spring/summer collection was ordered partially before the crisis broke out last year. Although some orders were canceled by the purchasers, the bulk of them were delivered. So the bulk of the crisis would be felt in this division, in this wholesale division with a sort of time lag which will affect the fall/winter collection. So, we expect this to be the bottom of the crisis for these wholesale businesses.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Just my first question with regards to the Fashion &amp; Leather sales in local currency. You talked about Asia and the U.S. and you gave us some numbers there. You said the USA and Japan was down. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more granularity in terms of how negative both those two to regions were? And with regards to the lesser brands within Fashion &amp; Leather goods, is it right to assume therefore that the likes of Fendi, Donna Karan and Marc Jacobs were all down double-digit on an underlying basis over the half? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question. With regards to destocking, you flagged that the Wines &amp; Spirits destocking accounted for 40% of the decline, can you give us some indication as to the percentage of the decline that accounted with regards to destocking within Watches &amp; Jewelry and also within the Perfume &amp; Cosmetics business, please?</p>
          <p>And if you could also finally give a guidance on your tax rate for the full year, that would be most helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Fashion &amp; Leather, Japan and the U.S., basically saying same type of figures than the one we had in Q1, negative double-digit in Japan and negative mid-single digit in the U.S..</p>
          <p>On your question on Fendi and other brands, Fendi did a bit better than the other and was not a double-digit negative in the first half; some of the brands were.</p>
          <p>In terms of destocking, it's difficult to assess the impact of destocking; even at Wine &amp; Spirit it's not that easy, but for other brands it's pretty complex. What I can say is that as far as Watches &amp; Jewelry are concerned &#x2013; I mean, the answer has to vary from one country to the other, but as far the U.S. is concerned, for instance, we feel that more or less 100% of the drop is connected to the destocking. Basically, our retailers, our clients are not purchasing from us because they have too high inventories. And even the best sellers, I mean, merchandise they know they would sell fairly easily, they are not buying from us because they don't have the financial flexibility to do it. So I think the bulk of the drop could be attributed to destocking.</p>
          <p>In other area this could be a mixed of lower demand and destocking, but I think as far Watches &amp; Jewelry is concerned, it's really the destocking impact, and particularly for Watches that explains the performance.</p>
          <p>For Perfume &amp; Cosmetics, it's very tricky. I think &#x2013; I mean, we had the second quarter which was much better than the first quarter, except for some areas like Russia or travel retail where we still have some issues with destocking. So when it comes to traditional business with department stores, Sephora et cetera, we don't have many issues with de-stocking. They are behind us and they probably explain the bulk of Q1 performance and to a lesser extent Q2 performance. But we still have some pockets of this potential further destocking, like travel retail and Russia, which are not entirely clear for us and should unfold in the rest of the year.</p>

          <p>We now have a question from Mr. Thomas Deitz, RBS. You have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen. Two questions if I may. One, on the CapEx, you obviously had less CapEx in the first half and I was wondering whether you could give us some guidance for the full year. And secondly, in Selective Retailing, I was wondering whether you could give us same-store figures for Sephora and DFS. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. CapEx for the year, it's under, I would say, permanent review, so that the target is not set yet. I would expect we'll end up with something like &#x20AC;800 million, so significantly down from last year.</p>
          <p>Like-for-like figures for Sephora, I think as far as the U.S. is concerned, it's minus 10 &#x2013; minus 10, minus 11 for the first half. When it comes to Europe, it's minus two or three and China is plus 10. And as far as Europe is concerned, if I remember correctly, France and Italy are at two or 3 %, while we have some more difficulties in countries like Poland and Greece which are not accounting for a big part of the business but which are sharply down.</p>
          <p>As far as DFS is concerned, we don't really monitor like-for-like growth in the same way as we do for Sephora due to the fact that the various stores are not homogeneous in terms of concept. So it's less meaningful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you just give us an indication on July, whether the impact of swine flu in Asia was continuing to impact negatively the business as you've seen in May and June?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't have the figures for July for the time being. But what we can see is that the trends don't seem to be any better, maybe slightly better as far as DFS is concerned because we get them on a weekly basis. But slightly better but not significantly better than the ones we had before with big discrepancies between the traditional Japanese areas like Guam, Saipan and Hawaii, and the other destinations, which are doing much better.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>We now have a question from Mr. Dennis Weber from Evolution Securities. You have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Got two questions actually, please. The first one, could you talk a little bit about the out-performance at the retail level versus the wholesale level, i.e., can you assure us that the out-performance have done really reflects the strong consumer demand and that stock levels are not built up basically at your own stalls? Most of my other questions have been asked. One more, actually could you give us some guidance on the full-year reorganization costs, which obviously have been much higher in the first half, versus last year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So your first question on the out-performance of retail, I think it's rather obvious from the figures we've shown that the business in which we fully control the distribution, like Sephora and Vuitton, are doing much better than businesses in which we are dependent upon third parties which have taken their own decision on purchases and stocking in the past and are therefore creating some volatility in purchases. So we think this is a strong factor for us and we should continue to benefit from that. We see that basically everywhere where we have brand &#x2013; I mean, even the brand like Chaumet, for instance, is doing much, much better in its own retail network rather than when they sell through third parties in department stores. So I think it's a strong feature of the semester.</p>
          <p>Second question on reorganization, well, it's very difficult because for the time being we have nothing really significance planned. So I wouldn't expect major things to be added to the 130 million that we have registered so far this year. But these are exceptional charges and by definition they are not fully predictable.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question is by Mr. Antoine Belge from HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Antoine Belge, HSBC. Three questions. First of all, when I look at your financial documents, I see that the decline in A&amp;P was 16%, which is quite a significant number. Can you tell us, first of all, if this was broad-based and especially what was the decline in Wine &amp; Spirits, because even though A&amp;P were down, we saw that the margins were hit quite a lot? Obviously, if you expect the same decline in the second half, I think when you are &#x2013; and there's a tie-up with the fact that one of your targets is to benefit from this downturn to take market share so this in theory would imply not getting too much on A&amp;P.</p>
          <p>Second question is on the working capital which includes 518 million in the first half. From your comments, you see hopes at the end of the tunnel, so can you &#x2013; can we expect that working capital could be in fact have a negative number contribution to cash flow in the second half?</p>
          <p>And finally, are you working on any special contingency plan regarding the swine flu, and which of your businesses do you expect to be the most impacted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm a bit confused on the first point you mentioned. Advertising and promotion if you take it from the financial documents page 39, if I'm not mistaken, is minus 10%. It's probably further down if you add up the currency, the currency impact, but I don't get to minus...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is on page five saying 16% at constant...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay. Sorry, page five, all right. So, what we did there was various things, but we cut mainly &#x2013; first of all, we benefited from lower rates from media. As you know, the situation being what it is, I mean, those rates have decreased fairly significantly over the semester, so we benefited from that. On top of it, our volumes were also down; not in all businesses, but you mention Wine &amp; Spirit, and in light of the top-line context, some of the programs we had in mind were not worth implementing and we postponed them to the second half of the year. So, there were a few postponing or cancellation of programs which explain this figure.</p>
          <p>Second, on working capital, I wish it were true. That's what we are trying to achieve. That said, it's not that easy. We have a little bit of headwind connected with the two points I mentioned in my presentation, one being that the el a minimum, I mean, this law that prevents us from paying our suppliers more than 60 days, which is going to cost us for the full year about &#x20AC;200 million negative cash flow impact, the bulk being already felt in H1. And secondly, the fact that the Wine &amp; Spirit inventories that we're paying this year are basically founded on decisions that we took in Q2 and Q3 last year before the crisis. And this has cost us about 100 million in the first half of the year. We will try to offset these two, but it's not going to be very easy.</p>
          <p>Contingency plan connected with swine flu, I think there are two different things when it comes to swine flu. One is the impact on the general business and the other one is the impact on the travel business. As far as the general business is concerned, we are not particularly worried. I mean, not that we couldn't feel any impact but what happened in other geographies is showing that the impact on the activity is very severe and very short. So, we are not that worried. On top of that, we would expect this not to happen within a few months and we'll probably get a clearer view on the intensity of the disease.</p>
          <p>As far as travel is concerned, it's obviously a source of concern because you don't need a disease to see a drop in travel just by fear of the disease as we are basically seeing slightly but we are seeing it a bit in June and in the course of the summer.</p>
          <p>Contingency plans that we've implemented are connected with cost. And as I said, we are implementing DFS and Miami Cruiseline severe cost reduction programs, particularly when it comes to concession fees and we are renegotiated with most landlords in order to lower those costs, sometimes by implementing the forced measure clause that we might have in our rent agreements.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So on the first question on Q2, organic growth for champagne was minus 28% and for cognac and spirits &#x2013; I'm sorry, champagne and wine, sorry &#x2013; and for cognac and spirit, it was minus 14. So in line with Q1 and a little bit better for champagne and wines. Actually, the figures for just champagne and cognac are a bit better than that. Champagne did a bit better than minus 28%, but the wine business was not that strong due to two things. One is that ECAM, the failing of ECAM it's fairly unpredictable and there were a lot of sales in Q2 last year which did not materialize this year. And secondly, as far as the wine business is concerned, we have a big &#x2013; usually a big promotion at Chandon in California, which is taking place in June, which has been postponed to September. So you will have less sales in June and more in September.</p>
          <p>As far as cognac and spirit are concerned, the cognac business was, I think, minus 11 and the spirit business was fairly heavily down due to the fact that we discontinued the business of bulk whiskey at Glenmorangie more or less in the course of Q2 last year and we did not restate the figures for this bulk business at Glenmorangie. So it's a little bit of an artificial impact &#x2013; negative impact on cognac and spirit.</p>
          <p>And finally, as I mentioned during the presentation, I would remind you that figures were heavily &#x2013; I mean, particularly for cognac where the figures last year, the basis for comparison was fairly demanding with cognac being up &#x2013; cognac and spirit being up almost 20% in Q2 last year.</p>
          <p>DFS sales growth ex-ForEx, we don't really disclose it, but it was negative mid-single digit in H1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And would you have the like-for-like sales growth overall figures for the champagne and wines and the cognac and spirits for H1, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For H1 it's minus 30 for champagne and wines, and minus 14. Both quarters are equivalent size so you can make a straightforward average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Warwick Okines, Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions, please. Firstly, in champagne, what do you estimate the gap between sell-outs and sell-in to be in H1? Secondly, what do you expect to happen to pricing in Wines &amp; Spirits in H2? And thirdly, just to come back on A&amp;P. You cut into it by 11%, could you just give us a flavor business were above and below average to make up that number? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First question is a very difficult one because we don't have really reliable statistics for this. A significant portion of the sell-out of champagne takes place in the on-premise business where we don't get reliable statistics, so it's very difficult to say. If we take &#x2013; for the U.S., if we take depletions figures, which are a proxy for what the sell-out could be, depletions are more or less 15% lower &#x2013; I mean, better than sell-in figures.</p>
          <p>As far as pricing of Wine &amp; Spirit in H2 is concerned, I mean, not much is going to happen. H2 is never a very good period for price increases even in a normal year. So we are not going to do much on this in H2.</p>
          <p>Finally, on A&amp;P, so the pluses and minuses compared to the average, the Wine &amp; Spirit business &#x2013; I mean, it's pretty close. If we take aside the Selective Distribution business which is not significant in terms of A&amp;P, the other businesses are pretty close to the average. I mean, there are pluses and minuses &#x2013; not surprisingly Wine &amp; Spirit and Watches &amp; Jewelry are a bit lower than the average, but that's &#x2013; everybody is more or less on the same trend.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We now have a question from Mr. Krim Delko, Orange Capital. You have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I have three questions about China specifically. One is -- and just for Fashion &amp; Leather, the organic growth in China and how much was the expansion year-over-year? And more importantly, what do you plan to do going forward as far as expansion is concerned; has there been any changes in your plan? And maybe you can give us some color like a couple of years down the road, maybe, I don't know five years, how much will China be of your total sales in this part of the business?</p>
          <p>Second, can I assume that you make money in China, or differently asked, top line growth equals profit growth, is that a good assumption? Can you maybe give us some color on that?</p>
          <p>And third, can you talk a bit about the risks that you're seeing in China? And I could just think of a couple of things. I mean, once the stimulus package goes away, do you think that that could impact your sales there, some of the pensions we've seen recently or maybe on the positive side, the current fee which everybody expects to depreciate at some point, how do you think about the risks both from the positive and negative side? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Fashion &amp; Leather in China, well, it's the fastest growing business in the first half. We had growth which actually gathered a little bit of speed in Q2 compared to Q1, but which on average was about 25% growth in each one in local currency. How much could it be of total business in the years to come? I mean, I think nobody knows. I mean, this is a business &#x2013; this is a place where we think that in terms of geographic development, ability for us to open stores in cities we are not in, not only in the fashion business, it's also true for Perfumes &amp; Cosmetics and Selective Distribution. It's a business where the potential &#x2013; it's a country where the potential is absolutely huge. So it's very difficult to really answer your question, and chances are that if I was trying to make an answer, I would be massively wrong.</p>
          <p>If you take Vuitton today, Chinese client base is the second largest client base after the Japanese. They are close to 18% of total business including Mainland China and purchases being made abroad in &#x2013; during troubled time. Nobody would have guessed that even two or three years ago that the Chinese could be that big in the total business of Vuitton in such a short of period of time, so really nobody knows.</p>
          <p>As far as top line versus bottom line, your assessment is correct. We are making money in China. The only business where we are losing a little bit of money is Selective Distribution, which is the last business we developed, but the other businesses, mostly Vuitton, Hennessy and  Parfums Christian Dior, are making money in China. Whether top line and bottom line are moving in the same way, not really. As far as Vuitton is concerned, we don't look in detail at that profits by region, but I would expect that gross being what it is, we have positive operating leverage at Vuitton in China which causes profits to grow faster than sales, whereas for Hennessy should be more or less in line as this is a more developed business and has been present in China for a fairly long period of time.</p>
          <p>Finally, the risks in China. They are mostly, I would say, macroeconomic risks that I wouldn't dare to comment because I'm not a specialist and you certainly know more about that than I do. We don't see specific risks connected to our businesses. The environment is what it is. It's not an easy environment, but it's certainly an environment where we can do business as we are showing with those figures, and we don't expect the markets to change materially in terms of access to the market or in terms of demand. So we are not particularly worried beyond normal risks connected with the general economy that, again, I wouldn't comment on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe just on the expansion in China, are your plans still the same as whatever you planned at the beginning of the year, and how much do you plan to expand going forward? Can you give us some numbers on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. But our plans have not been changed. We still believe this is a very promising market. And when it comes to plans, you're basically talking about store openings at Sephora and Vuitton and we have not changed our plans. We still feel that this is an area where, as I said, there is a lot to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>We now have a question from Mrs. Fran&#xE7;oise Paumard, Exane BNP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I have three questions. The first one, could you update your hedging policy for 2009, 2010, please? The second question is about the 56 million ForEx impact on the recurring EBIT. Is it possible to have a breakdown by business? I remember last year the impact was negative of 170 million and two-third of this was attributable to the Fashion division. And the third question, on the Fashion &amp; Leather business, could you precise if Vuitton and Fendi yet, are profitable, but any of the brands are at a loss or not in H1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The hedging, so, well, 2009 is 100% covered, rates being 1.32 for the dollar and 133 for the yen. As far as 2010 is concerned, the dollar is 50% or 51% with a rate of $1.33 and for the yen it's 57% and the rate is 126.</p>
          <p>The ForEx impact, while the bulk of it comes from Fashion &amp; Leather as it was last year, we had a little bit of negative impact despite the whole impact was positive, but for 1H period it was slightly negative due to the fact that they got very insignificant hedging gains in H1 last year which were not repeated in H1 this year. So they were negative, so basically more than 100% of the currency impact is attributable to Fashion &amp; Leather, the others are not significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to precise, what are your expectation on H2, considering the fact that in H2 last year we have had a good and positive impact on the Wine &amp; Spirit business in H2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you are asking me about my forecast on currency, I mean, you certainly know the answer...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but you have &#x2013; probably you are working on a scenario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, no, never. That's probably the worst thing to do is to work on the scenario, because the only thing you know is that your scenario is going to be wrong. So we never do that. We hedge our exposure depending on market conditions, but that's all we do. So I wouldn't really embark on making comments on the currency situation for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And the third question concerning Fashion business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Whether there were brands losing money. That's your question, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some were &#x2013; a few of them, a handful of them were losing money. Not all of them, but some of them lost a bit of money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And concerning Fendi, can we have an update on how the business is working and are you in line with your target for the profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you won't have a target for the profitability. As far as the business is concerned, the business, like the rest of the Group, is doing reasonably well in the retail part of the business. But the wholesale part of the business, which is mainly a U.S. business, is a bit difficult. So, all in all, as I said, the business is down in high-single digit in organic terms in the first half. It's going to remain profitable, significantly profitable, but I won't comment on margins for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jean, could you tell us, the part of the business which is leather, what kind of sales growth we have in this besides business bags and accessories, if I include Vuitton and the other brands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I can't tell you because we don't do sort of transversal statistics for the various brands in terms of product. And as far as Vuitton is concerned, we don't have a major &#x2013; I mean, accessories is doing better than the rest of the business and obviously leather is in line with the rest of the business; leather being 80% of the business, it cannot materially be different from the average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Mark Yoon, Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, hello. Good afternoon. My first question will be on Sephora. It sounds like the figure you gave us regarding the sales growth as far as I've understood is the organic growth rate, but could you give us more detail on the same-store rates, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The figures I gave you was like-for-like. So I said, as far as Europe is concerned, we are negative a few percentage points, with France being up 1, 1.5% and Italy being up in the same way. Overall, due to the store opening, the organic growth of Sephora was a few percentage points. I don't have it in mind, but it's three or 4% in H1; that's for Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. For both Sephora and Louis Vuitton, you mentioned that sales were up, also recurring   approaching leather, but could you give us the trend for the operating margin for both Sephora and Louis Vuitton, was it up or down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was for both slightly up, but it was a...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Less significant for Sephora in the first half than it is for Vuitton.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, reverse the operating margin out. My third question would be on the Watch business. As far as I understood, the question was already raised asking to which &#x2013; what part of the decline in sales could be attributable to the destocking, and you mentioned that's nearly 100% of it? So is it fair to say that in your view sell-outs figures for your brands are almost flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, they are not. They are certainly not, but they are difficult to assess because there are no merchandise in the stores. The problem is that all our best sellers have been sold for quite a while. And as I said, the replenishment of those best sellers is not taking place due to the fact that the retailers' cash situation is extremely difficult. So that's a little bit the situation we are in, where basically the system, the third-party distribution system is not functioning very well for the time being. So really, that's saying, comparing sell-in and sell-out doesn't mean a lot, particularly in the U.S. in this business. There is not much activity taking place and there is a big inadequacy between offer and demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Another question on Fendi, could you give us an idea of the split in between the retail and wholesale sales for this specific brand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I certainly could, but I don't have it in &#x2013; I think we're talking about 60% retail and 40% wholesale &#x2013; or 65 and 35; that's the order of magnitude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A last question will be on the other operating. You mentioned something like &#x20AC;80 million of values versus trade, both industrial and commercial, as you mentioned, but mostly for the travel retail and Zenith, and Sephora, Sephora, once again -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did say, Fashion and Zenith.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fashion, yes, sorry &#x2013; Zenith. So you could you maybe explain a little bit more on Fashion? And so far you did not expect further restructuring occurring in H2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I already answered the last part of the question. No, I don't expect and will not comment further on restructuring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. I have a question for Mr. Jean-Jacques Guiony -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jean-Jacques Guiony, if you don't mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, oui. I have three questions, but I will do it one by one. The first one is, given the difficulty of the Wines &amp; Spirits in the current environment, would you be tempted to really concentrate on Mo&#xEB;t et Cie and &#x2013; sorry, quite the contrary &#x2013; would you be tempted to sell Mo&#xEB;t et Cie? There has been a lot of information and rumors that Diageo was interested, that Diageo even made an offer, but that the offer was not good enough. Could you please comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. You don't really expect me to answer that question. No, I will not comment. These are market rumors. We said what we had to say on these a few months ago and I'm not going to repeat what we said a few months every week. No, I will not answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second one is, would &#x2013; on the quite the contrary, would you be tempted to buy the share of Diageo in Mo&#xEB;t et Cie and just keep it &#x2013; just keep everything within the Group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you have to be two to dance the tango. I mean, I don't know whether they are sellers of their stake. As far as we know they are not. So I really cannot comment on something which is totally hypothetical today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, you said that before you make an investment it would have to be on something that would have really very, very interesting returns. Were you talking about acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, mostly capital expenditures program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, mostly store openings and factory enhancements and things like that. But to be frank, it will be the case with acquisitions. I mean, if we were to find something at a low price, low risk and high returns, we would certainly look at it. If none of these were present, obviously we wouldn't do it.</p>

          <p>We now have a question from Mr. Luca Solca, Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you very much. Three questions, if I may. We recently heard Monsieur Arnault commenting on the change of legislation on selective distribution by the European Union. There seems to be novelties as far as the proposed legislation is concerned. I was wondering how happy you are with the current discussions and what you see as a potential threat to the industry and to LVMH from this?</p>
          <p>A second question on the cost-cutting measures, I was wondering whether there is a second wave of more fundamental cost efficiency plans that could come to fruition in the second part of the year and could improve the run rate on operating cost reductions?</p>
          <p>And third question on the wholesale versus retail in Fashion &amp; Leather Goods, and I understand that the fall/winter collection of '09 is probably going to be the one with the lowest levels of orders from wholesale clients, but on the other hand, the retail comparables from last year, especially in western markets, would be significantly easier. So I was wondering how you see the two moving parts compare and offset each other, and especially for smaller brands that I think would be more dependent on the wholesale channel, so the weakest brands that were already losing money in the first half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I'm unable to answer your first question. I mean, it's &#x2013; we have a specialist team here working on this. There's been new &#x2013; I'm obviously aware of what they are working on, but there's been new developments very recently which are currently being reviewed and analyzed. So, I really can't answer. I wouldn't comment on particularly on the most recent developments. So, it's &#x2013; if you don't mind, I will skip this.</p>
          <p>As far as restructuring is concerned, which is basically your second question &#x2013; in the second half, probably not you, Luca, but some -- the question was asked for first half, and my answer, if you remember correctly, was to say that we are not going to disclose in any specific way what we intend to do as we have many brands and for each brand we have many ways to reduce costs.</p>
          <p>If you look at what we did in the first half, which in my view was only the beginning of the cost reduction exercise, we managed to reduce costs on a constant currency basis by 5%. We intend to do more. What we won't do is large restructuring plans with costs -- with job cuttings and that kind of thing, as I said, which would be heavily disruptive for the whole company. But it doesn't prevent us from working on any other costs, even the fixed ones, like the rents or things like that we are working on. So, there won't &#x2013; there is not a specific cost reduction plan or activation of specific plans to be made in second half. But we have already made a lot of things which have not fully yield into the P&amp;L in H1 which we'll get the benefit from in H2. And on top of that, we'll be doing more. But there will be dozens and dozens of things that will be implemented by the various brands in order to achieve this cost control exercise which is of paramount importance for us.</p>
          <p>Finally, your question on wholesale versus retail, it's &#x2013; in terms of top line, the situation is fairly &#x2013; it's fairly obvious as we see really wholesale being down, and as I said, and as you said, we expect the fall/winter collection to be the lowest point as the spring/summer did not really reflect the market condition.</p>
          <p>Obviously, this will impact the profitability of the brands that are heavily exposed to the wholesale businesses. Hopefully, they are the smallest within our portfolio. So we shouldn't be too penalized by that. And you should also have in mind that when you are a wholesale brand, the level of fixed cost is relatively low &#x2013; at least lower than the one you might have when you are a retail brand. So basically where you have the highest fixed costs you also have the highest gross and the lowest gross is for the lowest fixed cost. So nature is not too bad in this issue of wholesale versus retail.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Jean-Jacques and Chris. Well, most of my questions have been already answered, but maybe two little ones. First is, at the Group level, can you try to, well, quantify the travel retail impact? I mean, in terms of sales, how much of your sales is done by this network, let's say?</p>
          <p>And second is about the emerging markets. You mentioned that it's to-date 30% of your sales. It's growing at a nice rate obviously. Can you give us this rate? And maybe also to put it in a comparison base, what was it before &#x2013; I mean, five years ago what was the contribution of these emerging markets to yourselves? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, travel retail, it's a tricky question. I think &#x2013; I don't have the statistics with me, but I think as far as Wine &amp; Spirit is concerned and also Perfumes &amp; Cosmetic, we are talking about between four and 6% of sales for both. I hope I'm not mistaken on the expectation -- be about right.</p>
          <p>As far as emerging market growth is concerned, the figure is 7%. It's obviously lower than what it used to be, but it's a euro figure. We used to have figures that were a bit higher than that but in different currency context so they are not necessarily comparable. But for the first half, emerging market grew 7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you tell us what was the contribution maybe five years ago of the emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Contribution five years ago, I would say about half, 15%, something like that, and that's &#x2013; I'm guessing. To be frank, I don't have the figures with me, but it must have been about half of this five years ago.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess that China is the main contributor to that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We now have a question from Mr. Emmanuel Bruley des Varannes, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I've got three question. The first one was to know whether there is a lag in terms of increase of lease expense as well as personnel cost, which were at still double-digit in H1, which were probably the consequence of the store openings you've made in H2 '08 and in H1 '09 at Louis Vuitton, Sephora. Shall we assume that it may slow down with the slowdown of those openings?</p>
          <p>Secondly, have you postponed some A&amp;P investments between H1 and H2 due to the economic environment?</p>
          <p>And third one, lastly, in the normal environment could you remind us what is the seasonality of earnings for Sephora and for DFS between H1 and H2? I believe that Sephora is making the bulk of its profit in H2 while it was a much more balance for DFS. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with the end because you gave the answer. So, yes, you're right. I mean, DFS is very balanced between H1 and H2 whereas Sephora is making two-thirds, if not more, of its operating income in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>A&amp;P investments being postponed, I know that there's been some &#x2013; I mentioned at Chandon, the promotion, the traditional June promotion being postponed to September, but not in view of managing the P&amp;L, it was more an idea that it would be more efficient to do it closer to the Christmas period than doing it in ahead of the summer season. There could be some other examples of promotional activity that have been shifted from one half to another, but I don't really have them in mind.</p>
          <p>Finally, as far as leases are concerned, I think we should be &#x2013; I just said a little bit of time lag in terms of lease expenses rise with the full-year opening, particularly the full-year opening of stores being opened in the first half of 2008. And as we're slight slowing down the rhythm of new openings, particularly at Sephora and to a certain extent at Vuitton, this will have an impact at some point, but it will be very progressive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe one more question. Should we assume on <mark type="inaudible" /> that would confirm what you said before? Should we assume that you started your cost cutting initiatives only last September &#x2013; that you've not seen yet any benefits from the cost restructuring you've booked in H1 '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we started progressively, I should say, because the crisis was not &#x2013; it's obvious from now that in September we were in a crisis, but in September 2008 it was not that obvious. So we progressively started to sort of closing the tap progressively and really searching for cost cutting in, I would say, Q4 2008 and the benefit of it is starting to fit through into the P&amp;L in H1 2009.</p>
          <p>We would expect to have more in H2, depending on how business unfolds in this part of the year, but it's a progressive exercise. I mean, you don't decide from now on this is a crisis and we should be doing all sort of things. It comes progressively evident that you should be doing something about it takes a little bit of time to implement what you think should be implemented, and part of it was felt in H1 and the rest will into our P&amp;L in H2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe one last question. How many store openings are you planning Louis Vuitton and for Sephora during H2 '09, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I should turn to Chris because I don't remember. For the year it's 70 &#x2013; about 70 stores for Sephora, and we have opened, I think, 30 or something like that. So the rough calculation gives us 40 remaining. And as far as Vuitton is concerned, we are planning 35 for the year, and we've opened I think 17 or 18. So it's 35 for the year. You will find in the document how many we've opened in H1 and I leave it to you to make a calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the bulk will occur in H2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The bulk of the openings will occur in H2 for Louis Vuitton?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, half has be done in H1 but there will be some bigger stores to open at the end of H2.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question is from Mrs. Fran&#xE7;oise Lauvin from Cheuvreux.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have basically two questions. One is concerning Japan, maybe you can share with us your outlook in this market. I was wondering whether the reorganization that you are undergoing in terms of distribution Diageo is having some impact, and maybe you could highlight what's happening there?</p>
          <p>And concerning Louis Vuitton, it's obviously the first time you are facing a quite strong decline and prolonged decline in Japan so I was wondering whether you are thinking about taking specific measures for these market, maybe even in terms of store base for Louis Vuitton. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question relates once again to the cost initiatives, because you've mentioned that the cost initiatives that you've taken so far will bear their full impact at the end of this year or even starting into 2010 and I was wondering whether you could help us quantify these cost initiatives and the economies. If you consider all that has been done up to now in terms of cost initiatives, what would be the full-year impact in terms of economies? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on your last question, I wish I could, but it's a little bit more complex. I mean, as I said, we have about 60 brands and each of them are undertaking programs to cut costs, and although we have a fairly good budgeting process, it still depends very much on top line and whether everything will be implemented and activated as expected. So I really can't give you any idea. The only thing I can tell you is that if we have a further drop in sales, we have further drop in costs and if the pressure on sales is to alleviate, the cost base will decrease at a slower rate and in H1 the two have to be connected.</p>
          <p>As far as Japan is concerned, the reorganization with Diageo is the main impact for us is that we'll be lowering the sales force of the business, as we will keep only at the top-end whiskey brand from Diageo, so it's a reduction of our partnership in Japan. And as far as LV is concerned in Japan, we have a lot of plans, but for fairly obvious reasons, I will not share them with you. But there are a lot of things we are going to do in Japan to exit the current situation which is obviously not satisfactory to us.</p>
