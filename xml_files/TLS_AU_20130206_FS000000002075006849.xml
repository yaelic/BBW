        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. My name is Andrew Keys. I'm the Director of Investor Relations at Telstra. On behalf of the company, I'd like to welcome you to our half year result announcement today here in Melbourne, and also those of you viewing the announcement via the webcast, and also joining us on CONFERLINK.</p>
          <p>In Melbourne, I'm joined by our CEO, David Thodey; and our CFO, Andy Penn. At the end of their presentations, we will be taking questions from analysts both here in Melbourne and also over the CONFERLINK service.</p>
          <p>I'd like to now hand over to David Thodey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andrew, and let me just add my good morning. Nice to see you all here. And consistent with previous years, what I'm going to do is just going to give you a brief introduction, give you few of the highlights. And then I'll pass over to Andy to give you a more detailed analysis of the numbers and some of the trends in the business. And I'll come back and talk about strategic priorities, how we're going against our big strategic initiatives.</p>
          <p>So, let's go straight into the highlights. Well, I'm pleased to report that the business momentum has continued in the last six months and very gratifying. We are achieving the objective that we set ourselves. We've grown revenue and profits and we've also delivered strong customer growth in the half. Andy's going to take you through the numbers that I just mentioned. But let me just give you the headline.</p>
          <p>Total income increased by 1.7%. EBITDA grew by 5%. And NPAT, net profit after tax, up 8.8%. Very pleasingly also is we continue to gain share in key products and we added 607,000 new domestic mobile customers. And the fixed broadband business continues to perform strongly with an additional 85,000 retail fixed broadband customers.</p>
          <p>As you know, what's incredibly important for us is keeping the growth as well as the simplification in cost management. And our simplification program continues to drive productivity improvements with benefits of $381 million that we recognized in the half at the gross level. Now, these results have been achieved through what I would say a sustained and disciplined focus on our strategic priorities, and very, very specifically on improving customer service, which is such a key priority. While it's still a long way to go, it's sort of the heart of what we do.</p>
          <p>Also, we've been delivering and investing in real technology leadership. And that's so important for us as we really bring new products to market. We invested $1.9 billion in the half and this investment is contributing both in terms of improving the customer experience, innovate products, and it is also allowing us to have superior network performance. But as I did mention, we still have a long way to go and we think there's still incredible opportunity to do better.</p>
          <p>So let me just try to give you some sense of some of the activity we've had over the last six months. It is always amazing to me, as I look back over six months, just how much gets done in this company. And it has been very focused around improving the ways we interact with customers. It's been about, as I mentioned, product innovation and around the networks. So let me just give you a few highlights.</p>
          <p>So let's look at the customer side first. We now have eight ways that customers can interact with us, which is great. And you can either come in to the 356 retail stores, come in live chat by phone, through social media or online. We're trying to allow the customer to interact with us how they want to interact with us.</p>
          <p>We've also made enhancements to our YouTube presence on social media, where now people can go there and look at the how-to videos on how to use new products and services. So we're trying to use technology to really change the way people interact and learn about our products and services. And on that particular side, on YouTube, we already had 6 million visitors, which is quite astounding.</p>
          <p>I won't go through all the areas on the chart. But if you look at the products innovation space, we've had the new Digital Business product in the business market. We've updated that. We've got new sets of bundles, new NBN offerings. And also in the wholesale area, I'm very pleased to say with new products we're introducing into the wholesale channel.</p>
          <p>To meet the needs of our customers using mobile devices at events like the Spring Carnival. Also at the MotoGP, we've got using HetNet cells now, and also what we call the Cell on Wheels, or the COW, which we can bring in new capacity and actually service customers at that time. These are all great innovations that help us deliver better customer experience. Not to say we get it right over the holiday period all the time, but it is significantly better than it used to be.</p>
          <p>Also, we launched a new IPTV product, the T-Hub 2. We saw the expansion of the 4G device range. And also, you would have seen is we got the new NRL digital and sponsorship rights in the half. But also, we continue to invest in our networks. We're on track with our 4G network expansion to 66% of the population by the end of June this year.</p>
          <p>On the fixed side, we completed an upgrade to almost 2,000 sites, enabling around 480,000 customers to access ADSL2+. Now, that was an enormous project and has been very well received in local communities, right across Australia. And of course, on the NBN side, we continue at a pace in building out the transit network and a very strong working relationship with NBN Co.</p>
          <p>And of course, on the Next IP Network, which is the one that's so key to many of our large customers, we've grown out into the Pilbara region. And of course, as well as that, as we move into client services, we've announced too, that we will be building four new data centers. So you can see right across the product portfolio, the network and in customer experience, enormous number of initiatives, a lot of hard work going right across the company.</p>
          <p>But as I often say, none of this is worth much unless you really have great people. And in Telstra, it's at times like this when you've got so many disasters across the country that you really see the very best come out. And you see the passion, the commitment of our people in terms of keeping customers connected.</p>
          <p>And the extraordinary lengths that they go to to really serve our customers, and I don't say this lightly, it really is something that's the very heart of this company. You would be aware that we had the Warrnambool fire down in Southwest Victoria. And the efforts in that restoration was just truly outstanding.</p>
          <p>So let me just take you through a few of these. The exchange you see there up on the chart, this was one of the a-once-in-a-hundred-year event. We've never really had an experience like this before. You probably don't know, but to build a new exchange usually can take anything up to two years. And what we had was a group of guys &#x2013; now, of course, we didn't have to build the building again. But we had these guys who went down there for two weeks, worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, completely restored the services.</p>
          <p>Now, it had an enormous impact on the community. But the work of this cross-company effort was just outstanding and they did really what would normally take six months in a restoration, they did in two weeks. Really outstanding. Then in Tasmania, the Tasmanian fires actually had more of an impact on power supply. And so, we had to get our guys out there to get power back into the base stations, et cetera. But they were so much a part of the local community.</p>
          <p>On this particular one here, I think this says it all really. If you've ever been to a fire area and you go in, and our technicians go in first. I mean, they don't go in. They go in in with the emergency services guys. When you see the distressed animals there, I mean, you normally wouldn't think about it. It's actually quite moving. And the guys take in hay bales. I mean, I know it sounds a bit unusual, but it really is just something that the guys do of their own volition. And that's the sort of workforce we have.</p>
          <p>Then with the floods up in Queensland and New South Wales, again, incredible commitment. We had some really severe impact on our network. One of the local team managers, Warwick Foster, who's in Bundaberg, he firstly sandbagged the exchange. And then he slept there overnight to make sure that if the floods came in that he'd keep the services going.</p>
          <p>And then the other guys here who were working on a RIM. When the RIM gets water in it, it's technology. And of course, most of the time, you think you got to replace it. But they're very innovative. They just put it out in the sun and it dried within about two hours, put the cards back in and hey, presto, she was up and going. And that's the sort of &#x2013; some of you don't realize that that's what keeps this company going every day.</p>
          <p>So real great credit to our field guys and then all the support guys back in the global operations center as well. So it's a real privilege to really feel the connection they have with the local community. I know there's high expectations on them as well, but they really do a great job.</p>
          <p>So that's a little bit of the introduction. So I'm going to get Andy to take you through the numbers. And then I'll come back and talk about our core strategic priorities. So Andy, over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, David, and good morning, everybody. So these are the results for Telstra for the half year ended 31st of December 2012. I'm going to cover five topics in my presentation.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I am going to take you through the overall results and comment on how we tracked relative to guidance. Secondly, I'll take you through the performance of our key product groups: fixed, mobile, data and IP, as well as media, NAS and international. And I'll also comment on some of the early revenues from NBN or relating to NBN.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, I'll comment on the continued progress we're making in relation to our productivity program and the efficiencies we're delivering into operating expenses. Fourthly, I'll provide an update on our capital position. And finally, I'll conclude with some comments on the outlook for the balance of 2013 including comments on guidance.</p>
          <p>So sales revenue for the first half was up 1% to $12.5 billion and I'll take you through the key drivers of that in a moment. Total income was up 1.7% to $12.7 billion. EBITDA was up 5% to $5 billion. This included the $130 million impairment for TelstraClear which was related to the loss on the foreign exchange over the period that we owned that asset.</p>
          <p>EBIT was up 10.8% to $2.8 billion and earnings per share up 9.3% to $0.129 per share. On a guidance basis, total income was up 2.5% and EBITDA up 8.7%. The guidance basis excludes the impacts of TelstraClear. Accrued CapEx for the period was up 10.2% as we increased our CapEx to sales ratio to 15%.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was up 20.1% to $2.2 billion, including the sale proceeds from the sale of TelstraClear. Excluding TelstraClear, free cash flow was down 17% as we invested to grow the business including in working capital. Finally, the board has declared an interim dividend of $0.14 per share in line with guidance.</p>
          <p>Across the business, we've maintained our sales growth, which was up 1% to $12.5 billion. Although fixed revenues declined 4% and media declined 7%, including a 12.6% reduction in Sensis, our strong performance in mobiles continued with revenues up 4.6% or $200 million. Our other growth businesses also performed well, with revenue up 10.6% or $61 million for NAS, and 10.8% or $82 million in international.</p>
          <p>The other bar on the chart includes revenues from NBN including infrastructure, the amortization of the information campaign and migration deed, and other miscellaneous free revenue. These revenues have been offset by the sale of TelstraClear.</p>
          <p>In fixed, growth in fixed broadband slowed the rate of decline in the overall portfolio and revenue was down 4% to $3.7 billion. PSTN revenue declined 10.8%, with the number of retail lines declining 178,000 to 6.7 million. Fixed broadband was up 4.4% to just over $1 billion. Retail fixed broadband revenue was up 10%, driven by customer growth which was up 85,000 to 2.7 million and a 2% improvement in ARPU.</p>
          <p>The strong margin performance that we've seen in our fixed portfolios continued in the first half of 2013. This was driven by our increasing scale and the benefit of sharing our networks over our growing customer base. It also reflects the benefits from our productivity program and the positive impacts of higher bond rates.</p>
          <p>Finally, our strategy to migrate customers to bundled plans continues to deliver and we added a further 117,000 bundled customers in the period. We now have 1.5 million or in other words 56% of our fixed broadband base is on a bundle.</p>
          <p>We've continued to see profitable customer growth in our mobiles business. This is notwithstanding an overall slowdown in them market. Revenues were up 4.6% to $4.6 billion, equating to a 7.7% compound growth rate over the last three first halves. Revenue was up 7.7% in prepaid handheld and 16.8% in mobile broadband.</p>
          <p>Revenues were also up marginally in postpaid handheld. This was notwithstanding a small reduction in ARPU, excluding MRA, which was caused by a lower contribution from international roaming and early termination charges. And of course, whilst the latter impacted ARPU in the period, it obviously leads to higher lifetime customer value, as illustrated by the significantly improved customer churn in the period which was only 10.3%.</p>
          <p>The profitability of our mobile portfolio continues to grow with EBITDA up 12.3% to $1.7 billion, and this is a compound growth of more than 20% over the last three first half periods. The EBITDA margin for the half year was up 3 percentage points to 37%. And during the half, as you heard from David, we added a further 607,000 domestic mobile customers to take our total mobile customer base numbers to 14.4 million.</p>
          <p>In data and IP, we continued to see a transition from legacy data products to IP Access. Overall, revenue was broadly flat at about $1.5 billion. IP Access was up 8%, underpinned by migration to higher grade services, including IP MAN, where revenue was up 14%. Growth was also supported by success in Telstra Business, which was up 17%, and also our growth in NAS.</p>
          <p>We saw a strong profit performance from the portfolio in the first half with the EBITDA margin up 2 percentage points to 65%. And finally, growth in the IP managed networks customer numbers are up 8.2% reflects our focus on selling higher value network services.</p>
          <p>Turning now to NAS. NAS revenue for the half year was up 10.6% to $636 million. Over the last three first halves, we've seen strong growth as we've continued to invest in this important area of our business. We continue to see strong performance in both unified communications and cloud computing.</p>
          <p>Cloud computing in particular, as you've heard from David, is an important push at the moment, and we saw revenues up 25% in this half year period on top of an increase of 33% in the prior comparative period.</p>
          <p>Looking at our core Australian telecommunications business through the lens of the customer, total retail revenue grew by 1% to $9.8 billion. In consumer, revenue was up 2.1% to $5.3 billion. And this was underpinned by strong performance in mobiles, up 7%, and fixed broadband, up 11%.</p>
          <p>In Telstra Business, revenue was down slightly by 0.4% to $2.4 billion. Encouragingly, the rate of decline in the business segment has slowed from a decline of 1% for the full year of fiscal 2012 and 1.3% in the second half of fiscal 2012. In enterprise and government, revenue was up 1.3% to $2.1 billion supported by strong growth in NAS which was up 7%.</p>
          <p>And finally in wholesale, revenues <mark type="audio gap" /> (17:29) slightly 1.1% to $1.1 billion. Wholesale NBN revenue partly offset the impact of lower usage in fixed, lower roaming values &#x2013; sorry, <mark type="audio gap" /> (17:39 &#x2013; 17:44) Sensis. Sensis performance for the half year was in line with our expectations, with revenues down 12.6% to $479 million. Print revenue was down 27.9% to $202 million. This comprises a revenue decline of 8% in White Pages and on an adjusted basis, a revenue decline of 22% in Yellow Pages.</p>
          <p>The point of the adjustment is that revenue recognition aligns with the timing of the distribution of books in Sensis. In 2013, we have deferred the distribution of the Brisbane book into the second half of the year, whereas it was included in the first half in 2012. I should also remind the market that the timing of book distribution is such that approximately two-thirds of the Sensis revenue and 80% of the EBITDA will arise in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In digital, we have seen an acceleration in growth as clients transition their spend to Yellow Pages and White Pages digital assets, search engine marketing, customer websites, and social media advertising. Overall, digital revenue is up 11% to $201 million, 42% in White Pages and 9% in Yellow Pages.</p>
          <p>The trend in the margin followed the same point that I mentioned in relation to book distribution, and was therefore down 5 percentage points to 23%. Adjusting for the timing of the book distribution, the EBITDA margin was approximately 28%, although we do expect the margin to decline year-on-year with the revenue reduction that we anticipate.</p>
          <p>In FOXTEL, the first half of 2013 included a full six months contribution from the acquisition of AUSTAR. We have therefore provided here the prior comparative period on a pro forma basis. Revenue was up 7.2% to just under $1.6 billion, whilst EBITDA was up 12.1% to $463 million. The AUSTAR integration is progressing well and this is driving significant cost synergies, which is assisting EBITDA growth. The growth in revenue is driven by a combination of higher average subscriber numbers and higher ARPU.</p>
          <p>The key focus of FOXTEL continues to be on the growth in its subscriber base, which was up 1.7% in the period to just under 2.3 million subscribers. During the period, we received a $55-million distribution from our investment in FOXTEL. There was no distribution in the prior comparative period because FOXTEL has moved to a pattern of paying distributions biannually from historically paying them annually. The distribution is the only aspect to be clear of these numbers that is actually consolidated into Telstra's results.</p>
          <p>In Telstra's other media assets, revenue was broadly flat at $430 million. Cable revenue, representing income from FOXTEL, was up 5.2% due to a customer mix shift away from satellite to cable. In PayTV and IPTV, which includes IPTV Content, BigPond Movies, FOXTEL resell and FOXTEL on T-Box, growth was just under 1% to $333 million. The other digital content, which includes a number of feature phone services that pre-date the introduction of smartphones, declined 12.2% to $36 million.</p>
          <p>Turning finally to our international portfolio. Revenue was up 10.8% to $844 million with strong performance across all of our businesses. CSL revenue was up 13.3% to $494 million, or 13.8% on a local currency basis. CSL, as you heard from David, added 321,000 new customers in the first half, with EBITDA up 1 percentage point to 25%.</p>
          <p>In our China portfolio, revenue from Autohome was up 63%, albeit this was offset by the inclusion in last year of revenue from ChinaM and LMobile, which were businesses that we exited in the second half of 2012. Autohome has established a very strong position in digital marketing in the Chinese auto market, which as you will appreciate, is growing rapidly. Finally, the Global Connectivity business was up 9.9% to $277 million or 11.6% on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>Before making a couple of comments on productivity, I'll take you through the key revenue items relating to NBN, which were accounted for in the period. NBN-related revenue was $176 million. Of this, $4 million and $90 million represented the proportional recognition from the cash receipts received last year for the Retraining and Information Campaign and Migration Deeds.</p>
          <p>The TUSMA Agreement became operative from 1 July, 2012 and income accrued under this agreement for the first half was $56 million, which replaced the revenue received last year under the Universal Services Obligation. Finally, $26 million was received in relation to the early infrastructure build.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to productivity and our simplification program. During the half, direct variable costs increased approximately $200 million, whilst underlying inflation added a further $100 million to our cost base. Expenses also increased as a consequence of our growing portfolio of increasing customer numbers and transaction volumes and investment in new businesses. Expenses were also favorably impacted on a relative basis by bond rates which had $100 million impact.</p>
          <p>Against these movements, our productivity and simplification program delivered $400 million of expense benefits, enabling us to modestly reduce our operating expenses half year on half year to $7.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to capital management. Our approach to capital management and the strategic framework that we presented to you last year remains unchanged. Applying this, our cumulative excess free cash flow declined slightly from $1 billion at 30 June, 2012 to $900 million as at 31 December, 2012.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow from business operations of $2.2 billion, including proceeds from the sale of TelstraClear, were offset by the full year 2012 dividend of $1.7 billion and interest costs of $530 million. Our free cash flow profile is such that we expect to generate excess free cash flow in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>I also advised the market last year that when we presented this that we expect to generate $2 billion to $3 billion of cumulative excess free cash flow over the next three-year period. That effectively takes us into the second half of 2015. Our position in relation to this remains unchanged, subject of course to the rollout timetable of NBN.</p>
          <p>We will continue to communicate our cumulative excess free cash flow position in conjunction with our results. We will also obviously continue to advise you how we're tracking against the $2 billion to $3 billion that I quoted to you last year. Having said that, to be clear, I don't propose to continue to update that outlook on a rolling basis.</p>
          <p>Turning to some of the more detailed capital movements. As previously mentioned, our CapEx was up 10.2% to $1.9 billion. The CapEx to sales ratio of 15% is in line with our guidance. And we are on track to accelerate our LTE Mobile Network expansion, as David mentioned, to two thirds of the population by the 30th of June 2013.</p>
          <p>During the half year, we repaid approximately $2.1 billion of debt. We issued new debt of $750 million via a very successful Australian five-year bond issue and a further $50 million via private placement. We have run down our liquidity to $2.6 billion bringing our net debt position at 31 December to $13.6 billion. Average borrowing costs reduced in line with lower interest rates to 6.4%. And through refinancing, we extended our average debt maturity to 4.9 years.</p>
          <p>A key aspect of our capital management framework is to operate with balance sheet settings consistent with a Single-A credit rating. We continue to operate at the conservative end of these parameters and enjoy a Single-A rating from all of the key agencies. You will see from the bar chart on the right-hand side of this slide that we have a further $1.2 billion of debt to repay in the second half of 2013. We also have a Spectrum renewal to finance and subject to the outcome of the upcoming Digital Dividend Auction, further potential Spectrum financing commitments.</p>
          <p>As we have previously indicated as part of our overall capital management framework, we will predominantly finance Spectrum through debt in the first instance. And hence, we will have an active debt program in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Before handing back to David, let me just make a couple of comments on guidance for 2013. Our guidance for 2013 remains unchanged. This includes low single-digit growth for both total income and EBITDA and a CapEx to sales ratio of 15%. Whilst we have delivered EBITDA growth on a guidance basis of 8.7% in the first half, for a number of reasons, this growth will not all flow through to the second half. In particular, the bond rate impact, some of the NBN impacts are both likely to be more significant in the first half than in the second.</p>
          <p>And in addition, we also expect to see most of the year-on-year EBITDA decline in Sensis, as I mentioned before, occur in the second half of the year. Having said that, our outlook for the business does show that EBITDA growth is at the top end of our guidance. In addition to the other guidance measures, we expect free cash flow to fall within the range of $4.75 billion to $5.25 billion, consistent with which we've previously advised.</p>
          <p>And finally, of course, subject to the board's normal approval process for dividend declaration and there being no unexpected material events, we expect to pay a fully franked dividend of $0.28 per share in fiscal 2013.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much. That concludes my comments. And I'll hand it back to David.</p>

          <p>Okay. So what I'd like to do now is just to give you a bit of an update on our strategic priorities. Now, you'll understand all our operational delivery is really underpinned by our four strategic priorities around improving customer satisfaction; critically important, retaining and growing the number of customers; driving simplification into what is a very large and complex business; and also finding new growth businesses. And these will remain our key focus items as we go forward.</p>
          <p>So let me take you through each one of these in turn. Firstly, customer satisfaction. As I said, it really is at the core of our strategy. And we really have this ambition to change the way everybody talks about Telstra. And we have made progress, but we have a long way to go. In the past six months, we've done a number of things. Firstly, we've had a company-wide rollout of the Net Promoter System. Now, NPS is both a system, but is also a cultural change. And this has been one of the largest change programs that we've really ever undertaken in the company.</p>
          <p>We've, at this stage, trained over 7,500 people, mainly managers, given them new tools, new skills. Tried to change the mindset around how they approach their job no matter which part of the company they're in in terms of really thinking about the impact that it has on the customer to create what we call our culture of efficacy.</p>
          <p>And of course, we need to get real feedback from our customers and we do welcome feedback. So far this year, we've conducted over 5 million customer surveys. That's a lot of data. So really important you get underneath it, analyze it, and make real changes.</p>
          <p>Also, we continue to make process improvements to improve the customer experience. In terms of some of the backend side, provisioning times, especially for our bundles are reduced by 38% meaning that our customers do get connected sooner, not perfectly but sooner. And also, we've got new web interfaces between front and back office, and a number of other things to try to reduce bad volumes in the business.</p>
          <p>We've also enhanced our online capabilities and enabled much of our customers to transact with us online, as I mentioned before. We now have 2 million customers who take an electronic or digital bill. The new 24x7 app you can get on your mobile phone has been downloaded by over 1 million of our customers. In fact, it's 1 million times because some people may have multiple devices.</p>
          <p>We've got now 150,000 live chats every month taking place where people can interact with us online rather than calling us in our call centers. And we've had 2 million visitors to our CrowdSupport site, which just means we can get immediate feedback. And it's great to see us using technology to really interact with our customers.</p>
          <p>And then of course, I think we mentioned last time, but in terms of our shops, trying to reduce wait time in the shops is so important. So we've reduced the transaction time from 20 minutes to 3 minutes to activate a new postpaid mobile service. You see, it's that sort of detail you need to get into. Now, I know it's not always perfect, but really these are significant improvements. So we've still got a lot of work to do to really improve the customer experience. But I do think we're on the right track.</p>
          <p>TIO complaints were down 10%. Now, that's sort of a lagging indicator of how we're going. But it's still a very good indicator. Core volumes were down on the last six months and that's really important because while we like talking to our customers, often it's to try and fix a fault. So, we prefer not to have to talk to them often. And churn levels, as you saw from Andy's presentation, are very low. So that means that customers are staying with us.</p>
          <p>So we cannot deviate from our commitment to improve customer service and satisfaction. And really, as I said, changing the way people talk about Telstra, hopefully talking about the good stories, not the bad stories that it has often been. And of course, you know that customer advocacy is more than just an altruistic objective. Customer advocates buy more products, recommend Telstra to their friends and family, and stay with us longer. And of course, they have become more loyal. So, really important.</p>
          <p>And interestingly, when you have a real customer-centric culture, it unifies the company around a single purpose. Everybody in this company, everybody, whether you're in credit, you're in accounts management, in finance, is focused on serving the customer. And I can't overstress how important that is. It is not just the sales guys or the guys in the call centers. It's every one of us who is involved in this. So, very important.</p>
          <p>Second one was about retaining and growing the number of our customers. As Andy's already gone through the numbers, I'll just sort of try and touch on ones that really strike me. In terms of the mobile base, it's over 3.8 million new customers since July 2010 &#x2013; 3.8 million new customers, close to 4 million. That support has been wonderful &#x2013; put a lot of strains and stresses on the networks. We had to really have the engineers working hard. But it's gone very well.</p>
          <p>We've invested $800 million in our mobile network last year and we're investing $1.2 billion this year. So, really important. We are seeing a good return on this investment. As we've said, 607,000 new domestic customers, 321,000 new mobile customers in Hong Kong, and 1.5 million 4G customers on the network now, 1.5 million. So the 4G network, LTE network is going very well.</p>
          <p>Mobile broadband continues to grow strongly. We sold 218,000 mobile broadband devices in the half, taking the customer base to over 3.3 million now &#x2013; 3.3 million mobile broadband customers. And that includes 790,000 people who use the iPad. So you're seeing this really big swing in terms of tablet technology. Wonderful how it seems to invent new categories. We like it. On the fixed side we had 85,000 fixed retail broadband customers and that takes us to 2.7 million fixed retail broadband customers.</p>
          <p>Also on the enterprise and business side, really strong growth in terms of IP customer growth. Interesting, remember we talked about cloud computing? I'm afraid the chart's wrong. We now have 16,000, 1-6, 16,000 cloud customers. And we've had over 3,000 join us in the last six months, 16,000. So cloud computing is no longer a gleam in our eye. It is actually a very critical part of our business.</p>
          <p>In the media space, we have sold over 450,000 T-Boxes and 456,000 T-Hubs, about the same. Our customers have downloaded now over 2.4 million movies, 2.4 million movies in the last six months. So this whole video-on-demand is a wonderful growth opportunity, which we think we're just touching, just the beginning of. As we get to subscription model we think it'll be very exciting.</p>
          <p>And as I said before, the take up of our digital products at Sensis is on track. Even though we've got a lot of change to go on in Sensis, we now have 130,000 of our customers taking up a digital product, 130,000. That's been a very big focus of the Sensis team and they're doing it well.</p>
          <p>So it's encouraging to see this growth across the business, and, of course, we take &#x2013; the last six months is the last six months. The next six months is all I'm worried about now. So we've still got a lot of work to do.</p>
          <p>Third area is simplifying the business. And as you know, this is all about really delivering financial improvements to the company and improving customer service. And it's challenging because we have a target of about $1 billion a year to take out in terms of at the gross level and each year, it's continuous improvement and keep driving in terms of simplification. And it's great to see that expenses are flat to slightly declining while we've got top-line growth.</p>
          <p>As Andy said, productivity benefits were $381 million at the gross level. And this has been across a wide range of initiatives that the whole team have been working on, including &#x2013; coordinated by Robert &#x2013; but the process improvement, we've seen great improvements in credit management. Our contact centers, field service and a large range of corporate offices have continued to reengineer how they provide service to the business, which is so gratifying.</p>
          <p>And of course, working with our partners, our suppliers, trying to really make sure that we're aligned in terms of what they can deliver for us. And we're reworking key contracts across the network, IT, International and the Sensis areas. So this remains a critical part of our strategy and we will never, never lose focus on productivity improvement. It's in our DNA. It's all about cost management. We are a frugal, focused company and that's what we'll always be.</p>
          <p>It's because what we do, as we do that, it allows us to re-invest in the business or to take it to the bottom line and that's what's so important. But as I keep saying, one of the things about productivity improvements is as you peel back the orange, you always find more and more and more opportunities to get at the bad volumes and really change the way we run the business. So that's the third area.</p>
          <p>The last area is about building new growth businesses. As you know it's around this Network Applications and Services area. It's around international and it's also around the media portfolio. So let me just talk a little bit about some of the highlights.</p>
          <p>In the Network Apps and Services area, it's been very gratifying to see the growth. Cloud revenue is up by 25%. Unified comms, which is mainly in the enterprise and business space, up 11%. And as I said before, we're building four new data centers, which will house all of our cloud computing capability. Obviously, we've got a lot of capability already but we're building new capability right now.</p>
          <p>Also, last month we announced the new Global Applications and Platforms business unit and that's about taking advantage of the incredible growth we see in the future around software and new platforms. We've already got &#x2013; you may not realize &#x2013; we already have significant investment, be it in financial services networks, through to health data solutions, even Ooyala which is in the media platform. And now we really want to pull that together into a focused area, and, of course, the software industry by definition is global.</p>
          <p>In media, you've already heard and I think that Andy took you through a very good explanation of what's going on in Sensis. But it is performing as we expected. Remember, a year ago it went a little bit faster than we had expected. But it's right on target and the guys are performing well.</p>
          <p>But I do want to say, we are only, what, a year-and-a-half into three-year transition. We've got about three phases in this. We will continue to restructure that business. We must. Moving from print to digital is a fundamentally different model. Anyone in the media industry understands that. So we've got a lot of work to do. We've only really just started on this journey. And so we'll be focusing in on that as we really make this a leading digital advertising company in Australia. And we, of course, will be reinvesting a lot of that into digital capability. Selling digital media products is very different to print product.</p>
          <p>As you have seen, we did the TrueLocal acquisition. And that's really given us a strong proposition for our Yellow property. And it really increases the number of people coming to our site each month. This is still subject to the ACCC approval, and we've still got to go through that. But it is very important in terms of our competitiveness as we move forward.</p>
          <p>Andy's already touched on the FOXTEL numbers. The integration of AUSTAR has gone very well. I've been very pleased with how that's gone. Richard and the whole team are really driving that business well. You know he has already come out and said that it's about growing market penetration in that market. But getting that integration done ahead of the plan we'd set was very important. We're going to discuss our media strategy in April. We've got a date set or being set to give you a bit of a deeper insight into media and NBN in late April.</p>
          <p>So finally, our investments in Asia are also performing well. As you saw 11% up which was really very good. CSL is obviously the engine of growth there. They had 13.8% growth in local currency. That's very strong.</p>
          <p>Our Global Connectivity and NAS revenue was up 10%. And the Autohome business continues to rip along at a pace with 63% growth. Now very small, admittedly, but a very good little property.</p>
          <p>I'm also very pleased with the management team we've got up in Asia now. Tim Chen's settled in very well. He is got a great knowledge of the Greater China Asia Group. It's great to have a local executive there, leading the business and I think we will continue to see good prospects in the region as we go forward.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, we're delivering on our commitments with continued revenue, profit and customer growth, which is just great. And it's been a solid, strong first half. Our strategic priorities continue to deliver good results for our customers and, most importantly, our shareholders. We're focused on our key priorities for next year and we're on track for full-year guidance.</p>
          <p>As Andy said, low single-digit in total income and EBITDA, low single-digit probably the upper end of that. Free cash flow between $4.75 billion and $5.25 billion and the $0.28 per share dividend for the full year. Thanks for your time. We are very &#x2013; Andy and I are very pleased to take questions and Andrew is going to emcee. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Richard Eary from UBS. Just three questions. Firstly just on 4G, obviously, some good numbers out there in terms of sub-numbers. I don't know whether it's possible for yourselves or Gordon to share some stats in terms of actually traffic metrics to give us an indication in terms of actually differences between 4G and 3G...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...as we go forward? The second thing was just on PSTN. PSTN retail numbers have obviously accelerated in terms of losses. Can you give us a feel of why that's happened? It looks as though that, obviously &#x2013; I don't know whether fixed to mobile substitution is accelerating, but a feel for where that is?</p>
          <p>And lastly, just on CapEx as we think into 2014, you've obviously said 66% 4G coverage by June. Obviously, we're sitting in February. I mean clearly I would have thought we'd get some clues in terms of where that goes beyond that, but is that conditional on 700 MHz spectrum would you look to use regional 1800 MHz spectrum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I'll take you in order. 4G, look we do have some stats. I don't have them with me today but we can get them to you. Look, we've been very pleased with the take up. Remember as the first justification around getting the LTE is that it's a far cheaper way of carrying data. So we're actually trying to migrate as many people from 3G to 4G because it takes the pressure off the 3G, but I don't have the numbers off the top of my head and I don't have my brief notes but can we get them to you later on? I think it would be probably better because otherwise I may not get it all right, okay? So that's that one.</p>
          <p>PSTN, yes, look $170,000 loss, $70,000 about, we think $20,000, $30,000 &#x2013; well, we do know the exact number went to wholesale. Remember we put prices up at the &#x2013; in terms of rental and that's been, as we're trying to rebalance to move customers more to a rental model with included calls, it's pretty much in line with what we thought.</p>
          <p>Look, there's still a lot of growth in wireless only homes. Fixed to mobile substitution, calling is down and will continue to be like that, so it's managing the portfolio. We think we're sort of pretty safe side. Do you want to add much on that, Andy, PSTN decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't. I mean, look, I think it would be too hard to conclude from a single six-month period any sort of trend on fixed to mobile as David said. At the wholesale level, the numbers were down $151,000 so I think it's something we need to watch for. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think more to your question, is there a step change in behavior? No, though mobility is still a very strong proposition that's being going on. I think it's pretty much steady as we go. However, we continue to look at ways in the bundling of the offer to make it still attractive offer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx on the 15%, we're going to continue to keep building that but not out the network but we're not giving any guidance on that in terms of next year. We fundamentally believe in network supremacy, both coverage and speed. We've done a lot of work in the first half getting the network ready for the rollout to 66% of the population and I think you'll see continuing us doing that.</p>
          <p>The spectrum issue &#x2013; remember a lot of the spectrum doesn't come available for a couple of years so it's the transition of managing when we're at the 1800 MHz. So the guys are doing a lot of work on how we can better utilize the spectrum. We're looking at a couple of trials and some different ways to do it, but we're going to keep investing. It's very important. The return on investment is really the bigger question and that's right at the top of my mind.</p>

          <p>Hi, Ian. Ian?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian Martin, CIMB. Two questions from me. First on mobile broadband, another period of very high growth, nearly 17%, but in previous periods we've seen when you break that out by segment, that has been very, very high in enterprise, quite good in consumer but a lag in business and I wonder whether that's still going on. I couldn't see any breakout there and whether you're any closer to addressing the issues in getting that business segment to pick up mobile broadband?</p>
          <p>And secondly, in relation to the spectrum auction, we've now got the reserve price at $1.36 per megahertz per pop. Quite a high price. The value of picking up that spectrum of the company to some extent depends on what the other carriers do and who gets what spectrum. We saw in the 3G auction back in 2000, the spectrum that wasn't sold at auction got picked up quite cheaply by One.Tel after the auction and I don't think they used it as a carrier, but they were quite disruptive for a while. So I wonder is there any way to get some assurance on what will happen to the spectrum that isn't sold and how that affects your &#x2013; the company's valuation of the spectrum that you might acquire at auction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm not sure how much I'm going to answer the spectrum question, we're under such confidentiality agreements. Let me go to the mobile broadband. The numbers are pretty much the same. I was just going to say, I don't know if I've got the segment breakout. Have you got the segment breakout here?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There's no question &#x2013; there's I think two things that have taken place. You've seen a higher growth in consumer because we count the tablets in there, so that's the rebalancing. We definitely led mobile broadband both in terms of the dongle, but also these Wi-Fi hotspots that are so prevalent in the business market and they are very, very successful especially in the construction, manufacturing just sort of come and throw it on the table.</p>
          <p>TBs picked up enormously, but then there's been a strong consumer growth with tablets as well. So I think we can get you the numbers. We don't have them today. Do you want to talk generally or have you got the numbers off...</p>

          <p>Great, so going well. Look in terms of the spectrum, could I just say I'm acutely aware of that issue and that's about all I can really say. It is very important to the company and we think having a fair and equal playing field is just what you'd expect.</p>

          <p>Morning, Raymond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, David. Morning, Andy. Raymond Tong from Goldman Sachs. Just three questions, just firstly on post-paid ARPU, just wanted to see can you discuss the underlying trends there. I think it was down 2%, underlying down 7% including MRO. How long do you think the impact of the MRO is going to last? Is it going to get better next half or in the next year?</p>
          <p>Just secondly, just in terms of Sensis, Andy, you were saying that it is going to be 80% weighted to the second half now for EBITDA. Can you give a sense of, I suppose, what the pre-selling and forward bookings are for the print books in the second half how they're tracking?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, just in terms of the cash flows, excluding TelstraClear down 17%. Can you just maybe give a bit more detail on some of the investments that you made to drive that cash flow down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Look, I'm going to get Andy to answer all three. Maybe a little comment on the cash here. Look, we're very conscious that it was down at the operating level. I mean a lot of working capital to just fund the business going through, but I'll get Andy to give you a little bit more on that but we're on target for full year but first half a little bit more than we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and David may want to add a comment to this in a second but let me go through but in relation to post-paid mobile ARPU, the two key drivers, excluding MRO, were international roaming and lower early termination charges. Obviously, early termination charges being down is a consequence of churn being down which is an improvement to overall lifetime customer value which is a good thing. International roaming is what it is. I think absent those two factors, it was actually up slightly.</p>
          <p>Having said all of that, which is the point David may want to come back to, is I think as we move into the new world of mobiles, ARPU is becoming the less relevant measure but nonetheless we'll continue to report it.</p>
          <p>Your other related question was MRO, how long will that have an impact? Well, I still think it's going to be a couple of years before that sort of washes through to a more normalized basis, not least of all because of the strong growth that we obviously had in the second half of this year, and then also &#x2013; sorry, re-contracting was up this year relative to half year by more than 100,000 as well which sort of goes a little bit to the point around cash flows, which I'll maybe sort of touch on now and just adding to David's comment. So it really was just the investment in working capital in a couple of areas, mobiles.</p>
          <p>We bought more than 0.5 million, or rather we sold and bought more than 0.5 million iPhone 5s, for example, in the first half obviously. So a lot of money going into support, a lot of working capital going into supporting the mobiles business. And we also advance purchased quite a lot of equipment in relation to some of our bigger NAS contracts which we've signed recently which you'll see an increase in inventories on the balance sheet across the period. I mean I think seasonally we'd look to cash flow being stronger in the second half obviously in the first half and that's obviously a strong focus for us in the second half.</p>
          <p>Just switching back to the point on Sensis just to try and make sure I'm crystal clear on that point, the numbers that I quoted weren't a prediction of this year's numbers. It was more trying to generically indicate that what tends to be the trend is we see about two-thirds of the revenue and about 80% of the EBITDA in the second half of the year. That wasn't a forecast on Sensis. It was just a generic comment. Notwithstanding that, that's roughly what the dynamic is and sorry, I can't remember there was one last piece to that question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the book's forward sales, yes. So in terms of the forward sales, I mean most of the forward selling in relation to those books is done. So from our point of view, as David said in his comments, the outlook for Sensis for us is as we expected. So we're not expecting any surprises, albeit it will be a decline year-on-year in both revenue and EBITDA terms.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yes, so I think in terms of the books, it's just now a matter of getting them printed and out the door and we've been &#x2013; I can give you a bit of a feel. I mean the regional side has been very strong and a little bit better than we expected actually as we went through.</p>
          <p>Yes, look, the ARPU story on post-paid, it has been primarily the focus on international roaming and, of course, both &#x2013; if there's change in dynamics in the mobile business it's less about voice and now more about mobile data roaming and how we manage that going forward. I think that we've got some ways we want to &#x2013; it's going to continue to climb but I think we're looking to stabilize it over the next 6 to 12 months, but that's the big one from our focus, is how do we really get our hands around that one.</p>
          <p>I mean I think the expectations of people are enormous in terms of using of tablets when you travel now and then you come back and a lot of you would be aware of bill shock and so how do we get something that is reflecting the costs that we've got to incur when dealing with other operators when you're roaming, but also allows us to give a good experience and a reasonable price for our consumers. So it's a tough one but I think we've got some ideas going forward that will address that, but that's the biggy for me.</p>
          <p>Of course, remember &#x2013; I mean ARPU will always be important but it's yield on data that &#x2013; I mean is the metric that we all got to start looking at more per megabit because the whole changing dynamics of our industry and voice over IP, et cetera. Make sense?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, I have two questions to ask. First one's on COGS and the second one's on the NBN payments. On the cost of goods sold, they were up 18% year-on-year. I was wondering, if you could give us a sense for what's driving this and how we should be looking at trends into the second half of this year just on the COGS line?</p>
          <p>The second question just on the NBN, the receipts from the ISA were $26 million, it's a little bit softer than perhaps where I was sitting and I was wondering if you can give us a sense for magnitude of numbers that we can expect on infrastructure payments in FY13 and FY14?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay, thanks, Sameer. I'll get Andy to add a little bit of color on each one but let me give you a couple of comments. Firstly on COGS, as you know, and I think I can remember you saying, Sameer, it's big re-contracting six months and Apple iPhone 5 has really been very strong within the half and that's been really the key driver. There have been a little bit more in the enterprise space, we're doing this big mainly services contracts but it's primarily the driver of by these smartphones are coming through.</p>
          <p>In terms of the outlook, I think pretty much as we go we've got a lot of focus on it at the moment. Andy, I don't know, do you want to &#x2013; anything on the COGS side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think on a relative basis year-on-year, we wouldn't expect them to be up to the same level in the second half or rather on the whole year compared to the half year, but nonetheless your points are right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So that's been the big one, Sameer, and something that gets our attention.</p>
          <p>In terms of the NBN and the ISA payments, I'm not sure what you had in your forecast but this is primarily driven by the rate and pace of NBN Co. more than by us where, as I said, we're very pleased with the working relationship, the guys are working hard, we're getting the transit bill done, got the exchanges all ready and we continue to travel well on that and I think that obviously they want to ramp it and we'll be just following them. I don't think there's much more on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's just purely timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So it's just timing, but yes, nothing untoward in there at all from our perspective. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll take the next question from the phone as well. Thanks, operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Sameer, thank you for your question. The next one is from Vikas Gour from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. Look, a good result from a cost perspective. I was hoping you could provide some color around cost trends that you're seeing in the second half. Obviously, a favorable impact from the bond rate, adjusting for which I think we've got labor costs down only 2.1%, but is labor cost tracking at a similar rate to first half? And given the FY guidance, would you expect the cost to creep up in the second half similar to last year?</p>
          <p>The second question is just relating to NBN payments, if there is a change of government in October/November, if the coalition does decide to look at the feasibility of NBN, would you expect the NBN payments to proceed as per plan and could you provide a bit more detail around the transit backhaul build?</p>
          <p>And lastly, great result with most mobile margins as well. Was LTE a key contributor to this and are you seeing a positive impact from customers moving onto Android and Windows operating systems?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Vikas, they are good questions. So I think I'd better give them to Andy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look in relation to costs, you're right, Vikas, the bond rate impact sort of &#x2013; when one looks half year on half year, it gave us a sort of a $100 million benefit and the reality is we would expect our costs in the second half to be higher. So year-on-year the outlook is for a small increase. As David said, the productivity challenge is a never-ending one and we will continue to focus very, very hard on that. But you're right, we'd expect to see year-on-year costs up a little bit which is not the position at the half year, they're down ever so slightly.</p>
          <p>In terms of mobile margin, that was attributed by that cost impact and also the impact of the bond rate which you pointed out. So that added about a percentage point just the bond rate impact to the mobile margin, but nonetheless the mobile margin was 37% compared to 33% last year. You might recall it was 39% in the second half of last year, 36% for the year overall, so we still think that the trend is up.</p>
          <p>And of course, the other factor is that we've been growing our subscriber base, fortunately, very strongly which is a great performance from the team and including in fixed broadband. So basically, with the higher number of customers a lot of the infrastructure costs, a lot of the backhaul costs are actually able to &#x2013; network costs are able to be shared over that bigger customer base, so that actually gives us a leveraging effect as well.</p>
          <p>But you also see the dynamic of that occurring in our fixed portfolios, margins which we're managing to sort of maintain on PSTN quite strongly, notwithstanding the fact that revenues are coming down, that's because of the growth in fixed broadband customer numbers and also mobile customers as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of the transit build, I mean, that is basically going on plan or according to what we expected. We're a reasonable way through the build of that. I don't think there's anything &#x2013; I mean any sort of link to the previous question from Vikas in relation to the infrastructure server access payments as well, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because I don't think there's anything more we can add. We're right on target for what we need to do with &#x2013; if anything slightly ahead and so we're just building out to the NBN schedule. So no, it's all good on that side.</p>
          <p>Then there was costs &#x2013; yes, if I could just make a couple of editorial comments. Yes, look, the second half, the critical thing for us is actually to get the volumes really under control because that's what really drives a lot of costs into the business across every part of the business. And we've &#x2013; we had a good first half. We're seeing the decline &#x2013; not increased decline &#x2013; flattening a bit in the second half, so we've got a lot of work underway and that's what we've really got to get to and that's sort of the real changes in the business, helping people to have online bills, to do more online. Those things have enormous impact on our cost base as well and that's across TB, TIG and other consumer market as well.</p>
          <p>Also there's just the normal pressures in the business and so it's going be &#x2013; I think there is a little bit of pressure there but we're going to manage it very tightly as we go through. So that's why with &#x2013; it's fair to say that the EBITDA, single digits, sort of the upper end of our guidance. So that's where we're at on that.</p>
          <p>NBN, I talked to and, yes, look, we do a lot of work and maybe we can pick this up maybe at some of the briefings, but in terms of the cost base in the network, at how efficiently the mobile network is running. If we can get people more across to 4G, no, unquestionably it's a better return for us. And so we're going to keep working that. But we also have a big investment program on the mobile networks because we are very committed to really driving that technology leadership. But maybe we can pick that up because it's quite a long discussion that one.</p>

          <p>Well, look, I mean we are focused on working to the current legislation and the current contracts that we have in place and that's all I can work to. Look, the problem with any speculation around change of government is there's so many variables. I just can't &#x2013; I could think of about another 30 questions to ask about that and it just isn't of value because you just get into speculation.</p>
          <p>You can look at it, there are &#x2013; certainly there's contractual commitments that will stand. There are some variable ones in there that are dependent on the rollout of NBN. That's all that you can work with and you have as much information as I have, really. We have a contract, we have legislation and that's what we live by. Do we &#x2013; are we totally apolitical into what we do? Absolutely, but I don't have any more light to shed other than that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just sort of three housekeeping questions, first is on tax, second is on pension and the third one is just on FOXTEL. Just on tax, I mean tax rate again is nearly 32% for the first half, are we expecting that to sort of unwind in the second half, and looking at 30% for the full year?</p>
          <p>On pensions, given obviously we've had a bit of a rally in equity markets, I couldn't see anything in the accounts in terms of where we were and in terms of deficits and what we should expect for pension payments throughout the year and what was actually paid in the first half.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, obviously FOXTEL, we're now going to a biannual capital management distribution, can you just update our thoughts in terms of sitting on the board what the capital management strategy is inside FOXTEL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All those questions sound like Andy's questions to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. I did say they're housekeeping.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure tax is housekeeping. I'm not sure the commission would agree with that. But nonetheless, so, yes the tax rate was about 32% in the first half, so we would expect that to be close to 30% for the year overall. You might recall in our franking position late last year was mildly negative and we would expect that to be the case for the full year taking into account the guidance on dividend.</p>
          <p>As regards pensions, I think there is in the accounts, which Mark Collis and he can probably point you to, but basically the improvement in the liability is about $350 million from an accounting point of view. The improvement in the liability from a vested benefits point of view would be smaller, but that would actually imply a much smaller deficit. In fact, the deficit is quite small from a vested benefits point of view. In terms of our current contribution rate to the fund, we haven't adjusted that and don't anticipate adjusting it this fiscal year. And we'll decide that obviously on an ongoing basis, but the fund is in a healthy position.</p>
          <p>In relation to FOXTEL, I can't talk from the perspective of being a director of FOXTEL, I'm here in my capacity as a CFO of Telstra, but FOXTEL have moved for us, as I said before, paying a dividend distribution twice per annum, and yes, I'm not sure I can say much more than that to be honest.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, guys. Just a couple of questions from me. I just wanted to run through the mobile business. And so, we're seeing the rate of subs growth slowing, we're seeing the rate of revenue growth slowing, you talked about recontracting, pushing out big cash costs of iPhones in the first half really depressing the cash costs and margin there. So when we're thinking about second half mobile margin should we be expecting above 40% for that business given all those factors culminating in the second half? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is just on the really great result in the other revenue line, well ahead of my expectations and look some of it was NBN, some other things around FOX, so I was wondering if you could give us a guidance or some range for that other revenue number for the full year? And then just thirdly, around the NAS kind of what the trailing expectations for revenues are with that plus 10% in the first half, are we expecting a lift to sort of tail into the year two and year three as some of that revenue growth &#x2013; that revenue starts to come in? That would be very useful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, Justin. Let me give you some color on probably the mobile side and the NAS side and then I'll get Andy to sort of give some maybe some numbers behind it. Look, on the mobile side, it's pretty much consistent with everywhere around the world except we're doing well. The subs growth was consistent with our expectations. As you know the market of new entrants has slowed, but it's actually we think a very strong result, and actually a little bit ahead of where we expected.</p>
          <p>The revenue slowing is a whole mix of things, but remember, the industry, I think that &#x2013; I can't remember if it was you, Justin, but the industry is in negative at an industry level. So you look at our performance you'd say, well, gee, that's pretty good in terms of share gain. The question is the maintenance of that in terms of the &#x2013; and the cash costs on the iPhones, the gratifying thing about the iPhones is we've seen good take-up of the higher end plans on the iPhone 5. And that's been what's been so gratifying. Because we look at that very closely, I mean, if we were getting iPhone 5s on sub $50 plans, we'd say hey, this doesn't look attractive, but the actual returns on the plans, even though there's a bigger cash cost upfront are actually very strong.</p>
          <p>And I think that last at the &#x2013; our strategy session, we did take you through some of those metrics in terms of the returns on per plan. So overall, we're feeling reasonably positive about all the variables we're managing in the mobiles business. I'm not sure where you got the 40% margin from, but look, we are managing this thing for good returns, and that's what we'll continue to do. Andy, do you want to add any more comment to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Just to sort of &#x2013; I thought Justin was sort of &#x2013; he's sort of sounding quite negative. And I think we've had a fantastic performance in our mobiles business again in the first half. I mean, I think the fact that the growth is not quite as strong as it was last year, I think is just a reflection of how stoop last year was but to your point, David I think margins in the high 30s is what we're aiming at, and there's a lot of factors that are going into play on that including the volume, the scale, the sharing, the network costs, the productivity programs, et cetera, so but we're still looking at above 35%. Obviously 36% last year so we'd expect to see an improvement on that, but I don't think as far as 40%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. And the other thing I'd just say on the mobiles business for those of you who've been around a while &#x2013; I mean, I can remember the end of the 2G era and revenues flattened and industry growth slowed, and then 3G came along and everyone didn't think it was going to happen, and whoosh, off she went, and now I think we're &#x2013; at the beginning of a whole new phase of growth, but I think it's maybe a year away. So in terms of the overall dynamics of the business I still remain incredibly positive.</p>
          <p>Not for anything other than the compelling nature of mobility and the dependence of people on mobile phones and mobile data. It's just the way it is. So while there's always challenges within the portfolio &#x2013; that portfolio, I'm pretty pleased with the prospects, but we are in a period of slower growth.</p>
          <p>I'll answer the NAS one next. Yes, look we're very pleased with the sales momentum in that part of the business that I think will flow through into the second half. We think there's still some good upside there. Remember this is a business that you need to sign these big contracts, there's a period of bidding them in and then off you go with the revenue. So they usually have a &#x2013; the sales cycle can be 6 months to 12 months and then you've got a period even after you've won the contract, another three to four months before you get the revenue going.</p>
          <p>So we've got a couple of big ones that we're trying to wrestle to the ground at the moment, so we think the second half of the year looks pretty strong. And the wonderful other revenue line that I like as well, Justin, I'll let Andy just maybe say a few things on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the key things that are in the other revenue line are the accounting for the information campaign and management deed from NBN infrastructure access plans and then offset by obviously the impact of the exclusion of TelstraClear which essentially sort of &#x2013; you can look at the receipts that we received in the half year from the amortization, the revenues from those deeds, and assume that they're going to be amortized on a linear basis. The infrastructure access payments were 26 million in the first half, Dave has already sort of responded on what the trend on those as it's really subject to the rollout, and I think we've provided you the numbers on TelstraClear. So that ought to be able to give you what you need to sort of come up with the right number there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gents. Two questions from me. Just hoping you could clarify the overall P&amp;L impact from the lower bond rates. And we note there's a fair value hedge in the finance costs line relating to lower bond rates. So between the other expense line and the finance costs, the overall impact on the P&amp;L. And secondly, David, just in terms of Sensis, you mentioned three phases and you're in &#x2013; still in the early phases of the transition, but I note the White Pages print &#x2013; decline is starting to accelerate. Just whether you're confident that you can still stabilize the business in three years, and kind of what the second or third phases are? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me &#x2013; do you want to handle the bond rate P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. The first one is in relation to the bond rate insofar as how it impacts to the expenses. So the impact was predominantly last year, so let's say it's a relative basis, so it's $103 million basically, the difference between the impact on the bond rate, last year's expenses compared to this year's expenses. In relation to financing, it's about &#x2013; again the year-to-year movements about $120 million, and it's effectively valuation impacts of some of our interest rate hedges effectively which fall out of the fair value accounting basis on which we deal with them. So, that's $120 million and that's in the financing costs &#x2013; that's increased financing costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yes, Sensis, look Brad I mean your points are well made and the White Pages is very much in focus, as is in the Yellow. Look, what the overall strategy is, first of all in such a major shift in an industry like advertising and printed digital, the first thing you've got to do is to shore up your customer base, and put a good product that they can see is going to serve their needs and that's been a lot of what Rick and now John Allan have been doing.</p>
          <p>Also in that process you also have to really find a different way of working with your customers. So, we've had a lot of big training that we've done with the sales force and continuing on even now. But then, you're running your print business and your digital business, you've got to build all that digital capability. Then you've got to start to really look at your cost structures on your print side, so you can pull that down in line with the demand. And with both White and Yellow, you've got to keep innovating the product and making it attractive to the advertiser. So we're sort of at the really coming into the phase where we've sort of put new products in the market, even on the White Pages side. We've got to now go and really restructure and get the cost base appropriate to go forward. Then in the third phase is really about building new capability as an online digital business.</p>
          <p>Now, there'll be continued decline, we've always said that. But we still do think that from what we can see at the moment within 18 months, a couple of years, we think that we'll be able to see &#x2013; we can see the potential to stabilize the business.</p>
          <p>Now, that's a lot of execution, it's not forecast, but that's where we're at and that's where we've got the team focused. And we think more than we were a year ago where it did &#x2013; there were some surprises in the business how quickly people moved from print to digital, it's sort of in line with our expectations. So a lot of hard work still to go, no promises but definitely we think that we've got our arms around it and the team are working really hard on it, but a lot of work to do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Just a quick question on mobile. We've sort of seen the more rational pricing environment for probably a good 12 months or so now. Just wondering if you think you're sort of getting closer to the point where it can maybe be a little bit more aggressive in pushing prices up perhaps and be getting towards ARPU growth or do you think we're unlikely to see that any time soon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we want a price per value, Fraser. You've seen us move already in terms of data allowances. So, we will continue to try to differentiate our offer, and if we can find that sort of nice equilibrium in terms of the value we give our customers and there's a number of different ways you can do that, I think you'll see us move in that direction. That was the end of the answer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next, we'll go to the phone for the next question, please.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Paul Brunker for JP Morgan. Go ahead, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you all. I want to ask about data and IP since it's about 20% of the business, so you saw a bit of a margin improvement in that segment. Perhaps you could just talk through that? Is that a mixed shift from legacy products and therefore you'd expect it to continue or is competition going to essentially cap out margins in that segment.</p>
          <p>And a second question on postpaid churns. You alluded to a 10.3% churn rate for postpaid. Can you give us a sense of where that's come from and therefore how much is contributed to subs growth and where you think in the longer term that is likely to settle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. IP, look it is a &#x2013; that network and the demand for that product is very high. And we're seeing IP products moving into the business segment with the product called Connect IP, which basically allowed small business operators to really have everything down one pipe. It's &#x2013; that investment has been very strong. We've got many points of presence. It's a &#x2013; by far the most robust and resilient and expansive network of IP network in Australia. And I think that there's still enormous opportunity to continue to see that growth, and I think the margins are sustainable.</p>
          <p>Now you do hear there is some price pressure in the market, mainly from the lower end operators. And we're looking at some options in that end of how we can really package and bundle the product appropriately. But in the digital business product, it's very strong.</p>
          <p>So, yes, I think it's sustainable. And as you know, I mean, we've taken out some of our legacy products, but ISDN is still a very &#x2013; is a wonderful product. And &#x2013; but it will have an end one day. It's a bit like, maybe some of our other products we keep on saying we think it's got a finite life, but that keeps going forever. Long may ISDN live for a long time. But at the moment, we're really focusing on IP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, David, maybe I could add in as well. Within the context of that as well we've seen a slight improvement to IP MAN from IP WAN. Also we're sort of looking to build higher value services in our networks. And so IP access was up 8% overall, but up 14% in IP MAN. And then finally, of course, the IP, like all of the networks benefits, as I've mentioned a couple of times this morning from just the increasing scale of customer numbers we're able to spread the cost of our networks over a much broader base of businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Then, on churn, I like low churn. And it's definitely our objective to keep it as low as possible, because it's such a waste when you have high churn. Your question, Paul, was it &#x2013; so is our objective to try to manage churn as low as possible. Yes, it is. But your question was more about why is churn low? Is that where you were going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess where it comes from and where you think it will go. So do you think it's as low as it can get or will it likely drift up from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's pretty world class today. If I can hold it around where we are today, I'll be very pleased. And that is a whole range of things from customer service, the offering itself, performance of the network, the way we engage with our customers, the product, the handsets we provide. It's getting all that mix right together, and doing recontracting, winning the new customers at the right time. It's a whole mix of things, so Paul, there's no one magic answer. I wish there was on churn. But you've got to get all the ingredients right, and that's where we're focused. So I think at world class churn levels now. I doubt whether you're going to see a significant improvement, but if we can hold it where we are, we'd be doing very well.</p>

          <p>Raymond, thank you for waiting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two questions related to NBN. Just firstly payments about $176 million the first half, and I think you touched on it before, Andy. But how should we be thinking about these levels of payments in the second half and for the full year?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just maybe if you could talk about some of the CapEx and OpEx investments in the NBN to make the copper network ready. I think you made some announcements sort of in the last few months in terms of some contracts out there. Can you expect a pickup in OpEx, I suppose, because of this in the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In relation to the NBN payments and how to think about those &#x2013; I'll just refer us to the page. I mean, basically, you really just need to go by payment-by-payment. So the &#x2013; as I mentioned, the &#x2013; it's page &#x2013; I can't see the page number. It's page 19, sorry &#x2013; $176 million, so if you go down that list, the $4 million and the $90 million is just a pure amortization of cash payments that we received last year. And you can assume that they will amortize, broadly, similarly than as to which they are for the first half of the year because both of those payments were received prior to June 30.</p>
          <p>The TUSMA likewise, that started with effect from the 1st of July so, again, that's sort of a full six months. The Infrastructure Services Agreement payments, I think we touched on a couple of times. They're really &#x2013; over the longer term, obviously, on an annualized basis they are higher, but that's really subject to, obviously, the rollout of the NBN network.</p>
          <p>And then finally, of course, what's not on here is the PSAA payments which are, effectively, the payments which are associated with disconnection of copper lines. There is, obviously, a time lag, if you like, from a connection to when those payments eventually sort of flow through and are accounted in Telstra's accounts. The numbers are still quite low.</p>
          <p>I think NBN, separately, have quoted that their plan is to get to 54,000 homes connected by June 30. If that were the case you wouldn't see disconnection payments in relation to that full 54,000 in the June 30 accounts. We wouldn't account for it until a little bit after that. So you can sort of &#x2013; you'd need to draw your own conclusions from there and &#x2013; based out on your perspective of the rollout. And sorry, the other question was on CapEx. I don't know if you want to touch on that.</p>

      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, more the Telstra investment to get your copper network ready, I suppose.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, I saw a lot of commentary. It isn't anything new or &#x2013; it was more an extension of what we already do today, so &#x2013; but a lot of people read into that about the &#x2013; were we trying to do more in the copper network in the pits and ducts. There's a little bit of that in terms of NBN preparation, but nothing significant. There's no forecast increase beyond what we normally would put into the plan, so no, there's nothing there at all.</p>

          <p>Daniel Blair from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, David, thanks, Andy. I just want to come back to the mobile question. I mean, David, you mentioned that as we left 2G, moved to 3G, there was obviously a pickup in ARPUs, I think about $10 on a blended handset basis. I guess what's different this time is now there's more threats from over the top. So can you give us a sense, firstly, of what you're seeing in terms of LTE ARPUs versus 3G?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, are you seeing, in terms of that OTT risk, are you seeing any de-tiering across plans as a whole? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I just wanted to clarify on census. David, you said, if I'm right, that you expect the business to stabilize in 18 months to 24 months. Are you saying that that's &#x2013; that revenue will stabilize or just that the &#x2013; operationally, the business stabilizes, i.e. you expect the current decline to stop in 18 months to 24 months?</p>
          <p>And then, thirdly, just on capital management, can you give us an update on the timetable where you'll update the market? Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me just try to take both those questions for you. On the mobile side, a lot of the LTE sales have been two-fold. One has been the dongles, and then there've been a lot of the iPhone 5s. As I said, we've had a good take up of high-end plans, but the ARPU is not significantly different yet, from what I can see. A little bit up. I'm just looking at Gordon. But it's not a $10 up yet. So I think there are some other factors playing.</p>
          <p>The over the top threat you allude to, it's an interesting one. The &#x2013; yes, the structure of the industry is changing, and that's why the return on your data &#x2013; how much data you're carrying is becoming so important. And that's really the reorientation of the plans that we're putting into market now. That, for all operators around the world, will be what you've got to do. So I think that that is what is going to really allow us to go through this period. I mean over the top players are really innovative and there's some really good product. I'm not &#x2013; and if it elect &#x2013; gives a customer a good user experience we're not about to fight them because we don't think that's useful at all. What we're about is how we accommodate them within our current pricing regimes.</p>
          <p>We haven't seen a lot of de-tiering in terms of rightsizing of plans and things. Some &#x2013; still we try to manage the data allowances very tightly. There's not a big movement there. If anything, people are saying hey, I need more data and I want to get predictability in terms of what I've got to spend. So there's not a big challenge there from what I've been able to see in the market.</p>
          <p>So yes, some differences is there from 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G, but then you add in there the growing connectivity to machine to machine. You look at how wireless technologies are becoming ingrained in fleet management, manufacturing, supply chain. Even you look at what's happening at retail level in terms of the use of these bytes. Now, all &#x2013; some of them smaller bits of data, some big when you start looking at the incredible usage of mapping and geo-positioning.</p>
          <p>You see these applications coming that just improve people's lives. Now, mobile apps sort of come and go a bit, but they still aren't changing the way we operate, and that's what gives me the confidence about this industry having a future. I mean &#x2013; so our job is to find ways to create a strong enough value proposition for the customer to say that this is worthwhile, and so you'll always have different price tiers in the market. But I think that that's what we're focused on.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of Sensis, look, my focus is on return on investment, so I'm talking about really EBITDA, and that's where I focus. So when I talk about stabilization, I think, operationally, we're reasonably stable now. Still lots of work to do to reorient and restructure the business, but when I talk about the next 18 months, 24 months I'm talking about EBITDA, okay.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you. I have three questions. Firstly, in note 11 of the financial accounts there's reference made to the dividend payable creating a $745 million franking debit. I'm just wondering if you could update us on the franking account balance.</p>
          <p>Secondly, with regard to the NBN and the second release sites, there's been a lot of commentary in the press around the delays in, particularly, Western Sydney and the Riverstone area, relating to getting pipe remediation work. And I'm wondering to what extent those reports are accurate and, more generally, if the delays in NBN rollout are, in fact, due to a reassessment of the degree of work that you need to undertake there and what the cost impacts of that would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thirdly, I'd also like to ask about the upcoming spectrum auctions and the reserve pricing, particularly the high megahertz per POP unit price. And I'm wondering to what extent you could reassure us that you may have some ability to offset, particularly in terms of a return through an adjustment in mobile retail prices, but also on the CapEx side through a more intensive farming of spectrum. We can change a CapEx profile and reduce the demand for spectrum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, thanks, Mark. I'll let Andy cover the franking credits, which is obviously very important to us. On the NBN at Western Sydney, if there's a problem, we're not aware of it. I think that's all I can say. We're not aware of any issues at all. We're delivering on everything we said we did, and so I don't know what the press are saying now.</p>
          <p>And now look, on spectrum, as you know, it's just hard to comment at the moment, but I can assure you &#x2013; let me talk about the mobiles business as a whole. One of the great things that &#x2013; in terms of Mike Wright and our engineers is that they have always been some of the most innovative engineers that &#x2013; in the mobile industry. And we have always looked at re-farming a spectrum. I mean look at LTE on 1800, look at 3G on 850. I mean they were first in the world really to drive the effective and efficient use of spectrum. So we spent a lot of time on that. We look at the higher end spectrums and look at TD-LTE, FD-LTE. We look at all the options and &#x2013; so re-farming and maximizing return from spectrum is a very high priority for us.</p>
          <p>And of course, as you've seen, our focus on EBITDA on the mobiles business is always, always front and center. So I think that that's all I could say in relation to the spectrum auctions themselves. That's the lens we look at it. And we think that there are options within that. So I think that's really probably said more than enough on that subject. So Mark, we'll have to leave this last spectrum. Now, you're going to come back to franking.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just quickly, Mark, on franking. The balance at the June 30, you might recall, was about negative $54 million. It was slightly positive at the end of December with the obviously, with the payment of the final dividend and obviously, tax payments in that period. And we expected to be mildly negative again at the end of the full year with this year's fully &#x2013; confirmed $0.28 fully franked dividend.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Andrew. Look, firstly, thanks for coming. As you see, I think a good first half, and it's gratifying to see sort of all &#x2013; number of parts of the business performing well. Never without our challenges as we go forward. And that's what we're focused on. And we'll continue to do as we really are focused on those four strategic priorities. So thanks for your time, and we'll look forward to catching up with many of you over the next few weeks. Thank you.</p>
