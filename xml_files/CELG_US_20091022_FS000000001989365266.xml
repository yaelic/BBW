          <p>Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Celgene Third Quarter Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to the CFO of Celgene, Mr. Dave Gryska. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I am Dave Gryska, Celgene's Chief Financial Officer. And I would like to welcome you to Celgene's third quarter 2009 conference call. With me are Celgene's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sol Barer and President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hugin.</p>
          <p>The press release reporting our third quarter financial and operating results was issued earlier this morning, and is also available on our corporate website. In addition, today's conference call webcast will include a presentation, which you can access by going to the Investor Relations section of our website at celgene.com. Sol will begin our call today with a strategic perspective on 2009. I will then review our third quarter results and Bob will wrap up by discussing our operational and commercial results for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Before we start, we want to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Our actual results, performance or achievements could be materially different from those projected by these forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ from our forward-looking statements are discussed in our filings with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission such as our Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Also, our discussions during this quarterly conference call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of our earnings release at Celgene's website in the Investor Relations section.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Sol Barer.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Over the course of the last several years, Celgene has delivered unique science and transformational medicine towards our mission of improving the lives of patients worldwide. We are continuing to advance our commercial and regulatory initiatives, strengthening our rich pipeline and expanding both the depth and the breadth of our global outreach to patients as we work single-mindedly to become one of the world's preeminent biopharmaceutical companies.</p>
          <p>Today, we are pleased to announce that the third quarter continued our robust growth towards meeting our short and long-term strategic, operational and financial objectives. I'll provide a short overview of our strategy and our business with a view of our anticipated near-term progress. We had another record quarter, with non-GAAP total revenue of $692 million and non-GAAP net income of $260 million or $0.56 EPS, an increase of 40% year-over-year and 22% over the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>While financial achievement is an important measure of our success, Celgene remains focused on the patients that ultimately benefit from our innovative science and disease altering therapies. During the quarter, we advanced a broad range of therapies, achieved international regulatory approvals as well as reimbursement approvals and continued our global commercialization progress resulting in the achievement of record financial results.</p>
          <p>I'll briefly focus on our global commercial progress. We have established a presence in all major markets including the U.S., Canada, Latin America, the European Union and Eastern Europe, Australia and Southeast Asia and are currently advancing our commercial infrastructure in Japan and are on track to have our products available in nearly 100 countries by 2013.</p>
          <p>Our commercial presence is recognized throughout both the U.S. and EU as being in the very top tier in hematology, reflecting our unique science, disease-altering products and our extraordinary people. And we are successfully commercializing REVLIMID and VIDAZA worldwide with continuous gains in market share.</p>
          <p>Focusing on REVLIMID, its long-term trajectory continues to be driven by global expansion, market share gains and increase in the duration of use. REVLIMID's international growth was galvanized with recent myeloma launches in the United Kingdom and Canada. REVLIMID has now been approved in multiple emerging markets and the reimbursement process is now underway on a country by country basis.</p>
          <p>We also continue to maximize our global opportunities with the commercial roll-out of VIDAZA in Europe and Latin America in addition to the continued growth in the United States. As we have often stated, clinical data is the lifeblood of innovative biopharmaceutical companies. We are fortunate to announce that at the upcoming American Society of Hematology meeting in December, we anticipate an unprecedented volume of data surrounding our promising compounds in a wide range of clinical indications.</p>
          <p>Of particular note, we expect to see data on REVLIMID across all stages of multiple myeloma from smoldering to salvage therapy, including preliminary results of the first interim analysis of MM-015, our Phase III international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.</p>
          <p>In addition to myeloma, our strong hematology franchise continues to expand. We are particularly pleased with our upcoming data for VIDAZA in both higher-risk MDS and AML, the randomized placebo-controlled REVLIMID trial in Deletion 5q MDS and the quite exciting studies of REVLIMID plus Rituxan in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</p>
          <p>Our marketed products are now truly global therapies, which in turn support a deep pipeline with substantial global potential which will additionally bolster our future growth. For example, we are leveraging the biological and clinical activity of REVLIMID with our next-generation IMiD compound, pomalidomide, an extremely potent agent with the potential to treat a number of hematologic malignancies.</p>
          <p>Other hematology-oncology pipeline products range from small molecules such as kinase inhibitors to biologics such as ACE-011. In addition, cognizant of the significant unmet needs and the very significant global commercial potential in the area of immunologic and inflammatory diseases, we have developed a dedicated franchise that will leverage our science and compounds in this critical therapeutic area.</p>
          <p>Our lead compound, Apremilast, with recent psoriatic arthritis data, is currently in the planning phase for potential Phase III registration trials in 2010. Bob will review this further in a few moments. This is an exciting area for the company, with significant clinical trial data encompassing a number of compounds including both small molecules and biologics to be released over the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>In summary, our strategy to become the preeminent company focused on the treatment of serious and debilitating diseases is progressing through global expansion, record commercial performance and excellence in human resources. Critically balancing this success with the longer term value of advancing our clinical trials and our pipeline, Celgene is well-positioned to further secure its leadership role in the BioPharma industry.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave Gryska, who will provide more detail about our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sol. Now, I'll take you through our exceptional financial results. Non-GAAP total revenue for the third quarter 2009 was a record $692 million, an 18% increase versus the third quarter of 2008. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, non-GAAP total revenue was $1.9 billion, a 19% increase versus the same period in 2008.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.56 as compared to $0.40 per share during the third quarter of 2008, an increase of 40%. Total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $665 million for the third quarter, up 19% from $561 million in the year-ago quarter. This is an increase of 12% over the second quarter of 2009. REVLIMID net product sales were $450 million for the quarter, an increase of 31% over the third quarter of 2008 and a 13% increase over the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to VIDAZA, net product sales for the quarter were $103 million, an increase of 62% from the year-ago quarter and a 12% increase over the second quarter of 2009. The launch of VIDAZA is progressing well and by the end of this year, we'll have launched VIDAZA in a large portion of Europe.</p>
          <p>THALOMID's net product sales were $110 million for the quarter, down 17% as compared to the year-ago quarter and up 5% over the second quarter. The increase as compared to the previous quarter is a result of our ongoing launch of THALOMID outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter of 2009, sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were 273 million and international sales were 177 million, representing an increase of 12% and 15% respectively on a sequential quarter basis. REVLIMID International sales represented 38% of total REVLIMID sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Going forward, we expect REVLIMID International sales to be a higher percentage of total sales.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP gross product margin for the third quarter was 92.5% compared to 92% during the second quarter. We are forecasting a 92% gross margin for the full year. The gross margins have improved quarter-over-quarter due to a higher percentage of REVLIMID and international VIDAZA sales, which have higher margins.</p>
          <p>Turning to expenses for the third quarter, non-GAAP R&amp;D expense was 178 million as compared to 169 million for the second quarter of 2009. For the remainder of the year, we expect R&amp;D expenses will stay at this level as we continue to advance our rich and deep pipeline and accrue multiple late-stage clinical trials in such areas as NHL, CLL, inflammation and small cell lung cancer.</p>
          <p>We expect R&amp;D expenses to be in the range of 680 to $690 million for the year. Our non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses were $172 million during the third quarter as compared to $157 million during the second quarter of 2009. The sequential increase in expenses can largely be attributed to the timing of our contributions to patient assistance programs. We expect SG&amp;A expense to be in the range of 650 to $655 million for the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to taxes, our year-to-date non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.1%. We're forecasting an effective tax rate of approximately 22% for the year. As you are aware, we hedge our balance sheet foreign currency exposures, inter-company foreign currency transactions and exposure related to certain euro-based revenue and expense. We are hedging approximately 80% of our euro net earnings exposure through the end of 2010. The impact of foreign currency on top line revenue on a sequential quarter basis was immaterial. In addition, during the third quarter, we realized approximately 14 million in hedging revaluation gains, which is included in other income. Our hedging activity is incorporated into our overall planning process for the year, and our goal is to neutralize the impact to earnings from FX volatility.</p>
          <p>We ended the third quarter of 2009 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.8 billion. We continue to invest primarily in high-grade U.S. government and government agency securities and money market funds. In addition, we repurchased approximately one million shares of common stock during the quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased 3.2 million shares.</p>
          <p>In summary, the overall fundamentals of our business and financial position have never been stronger. Our global financial performance continues to benefit from strong operating leverage, operating efficiencies, an improving tax rate and gross margins, and growing cash flows. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for 2009 to be in a range of $2.05 to $2.10. We are updating our REVLIMID product sales guidance to a range of 1.650 billion to 1.7 billion. And we expect non-GAAP total revenue to be in a range of 2.6 to $2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hugin, who will expand on our global commercial, clinical and regulatory plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave, and good morning. The results of the quarter were outstanding. Across markets and functions, our teams performed superbly. Our products delivered significant top and bottom line growth, supporting meaningful investments in research and development. The results of the quarter accurately reflect our commitment to both near-term execution excellence and to the advancement of key corporative initiates designed to drive sustained long-term growth and value creation.</p>
          <p>In the next few minutes, I'll provide my perspective on both the strong commercial performance and the important progress made on key value drivers during the quarter. I'll also highlight some of the important milestones for the remainder of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our businesses performed well across geographies, producing substantial product sales growth. The very positive REVLIMID and VIDAZA revenue increase outlined on the slide reflect strong performance in both the U.S. and European markets. REVLIMID revenue in the United States increased by 12% quarter-over-quarter and by 15% internationally. International REVLIMID revenue accounted for approximately 39% of total REVLIMID revenue, in line with our expectations of 35 to 40% for the year.</p>
          <p>Significant progress was achieved across all areas of the company. New regulatory and reimbursement approvals contributed to the global expansion and growth of REVLIMID and VIDAZA. Important pipeline advances were achieved in all therapeutic areas, with clinical trial accruals accelerating in major programs.</p>
          <p>Let me give you an update on our progress in our most important market: multiple myeloma. Our products have market leading positions and substantial growth opportunities. Market share increases, longer duration of therapy, international market expansion and enhanced reimbursement and market access are all key revenue growth drivers. During the quarter, significant progress was achieved in all of these important categories.</p>
          <p>Market share is an important measure of both performance and future prospects. 12 month rolling data indicates substantial market share gains in all lines of therapy in the United States, with total REVLIMID share now 34%, up from 31% last quarter, and total REVLIMID and THALOMID front line share growing to over 64%.</p>
          <p>In Europe, significant market share gains are also being achieved with second line market shares now approaching 30%. Duration remains a key driver of long-term REVLIMID revenue growth. Average duration in the U.S. increased over 11 months during the quarter. Duration trends in Europe were also quite positive.</p>
          <p>The REVLIMID revenue drivers outlined on the slide highlight the attractive future growth opportunities. Positive new clinical data is far and away the most important long-term growth driver for oncology products. 2009 has been an exceptional year for Celgene products in terms of data presentation. Year-to-date over 150 abstracts have been presented at major medical meetings and nearly 75 peer reviewed articles have been published highlighting Celgene products. The outlook for new data is also promising. I'll soon show a slide that outlines the significant presence that our products and pipeline will have at the upcoming American Society of Hematology meeting in December.</p>
          <p>With commercial launches commenced in the United Kingdom and Canada this past quarter, and the Australian launch planned for later this year, our focus is now on preparing for the potential launch late next year in Japan, the world's second largest individual oncology market.</p>
          <p>The profile of REVLIMID as a highly active oral agent with manageable toxicities provides the opportunity for continuous treatment. We have numerous trials underway examining its potential in a range of indications and patient populations. Let me now give you an update on one of these key trials.</p>
          <p>In late July, we reported that MM-015, our randomized, double blind, placebo controlled Phase III trial, which examines REVLIMID plus melphalan and prednisone followed by continuous REVLIMID versus melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed myeloma patients, the continuous REVLIMID arm demonstrated a highly statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival versus the MP arm. This pre-specified primary efficacy comparison crossed the O'Brien-Fleming boundary for superiority at the first interim analysis, just 50% of planned events, and with only a 10-month median follow-up. This result is all the more compelling in light of the relatively small trial size and the high bar for efficacy required in the trial, a pre-specified improvement in PFS of at least 50% for the completed trial. These results further illustrate the potential for sustained disease control which can be achieved by continuous REVLIMID therapy in myeloma.</p>
          <p>It should be noted that a third arm, melphalan, prednisone, REVLIMID, followed by continuous placebo was included in the trial to provide the opportunity to fully characterize the benefit of continuous or continued REVLIMID therapy. Based on our extensive knowledge of REVLIMID's activity, we look forward to this data to even further support the value proposition of continuous REVLIMID therapy. To enhance the value of the data in this study, the trial has remained unblended &#x2013; sorry, the trial has remained blinded.</p>
          <p>As regulatory strategies have been finalized, planned events have now exceeded 65%. And the regulatory strategy in different markets has been advanced. Preliminary discussions in some markets have begun, with discussions to be held in the U.S. in the near future. Though ASH is only six weeks away, we do expect the presentation of the unblinded data from the initial interim analysis at the meeting.</p>
          <p>MM-015 is the third REVLIMID Phase III trial demonstrating a statistically significant advantage for REVLIMID in the newly diagnosed myeloma patient population. Coincidently, the ECOG continuous Rev-Dex Phase III trial has been published in The Lancet Oncology journal today. The clinical trial program on the slide is designed to establish REVLIMID as the foundation therapy for all myeloma patient settings, from smoldering myeloma through to relapsed refractory patients.</p>
          <p>The global MDS markets are becoming an increasingly important component of our revenue growth as we seek to capitalize on the unprecedented VIDAZA survival data and REVLIMID's potential in MDS. VIDAZA global sales increased 62% year over year and 12% quarter over quarter, in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>In the United States, VIDAZA is the clear market leader in Intermediate 2 high-risk MDS, and in Europe, we made excellent progress executing our commercial plan in launched markets. Based on our increasing knowledge of VIDAZA's unique biological activity, we're identifying specific indications and drug combinations that merit additional studies. To date, there are nearly 60 studies worldwide in various stages of planning and enrollment evaluating VIDAZA in combination trials with REVLIMID and other new therapies in MDS, AML and other cancers.</p>
          <p>Based on ten years of orphan drug exclusivity, the European markets make up a large proportion of the VIDAZA growth opportunity. Our European launch is well underway. We expect positive reimbursement decisions in all major European markets by year end, with the exception of Italy where negotiations will likely extend &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; into the first half of 2010 and in the United Kingdom, where the NICE process is unpredictable and could extend well into 2010.</p>
          <p>To maximize the VIDAZA opportunity, we must continue to successfully penetrate launched markets and increase the awareness of the benefits of active therapy and MDS. Multiple strategies are being employed to effectively communicate the extraordinary survival advantage of VIDAZA treatment. The third quarter results reflect the significant progress that we are making.</p>
          <p>While REVLIMID and VIDAZA in myeloma and MDS are our principle near term growth drivers, this slide illustrates that these indications are only two components of our overall strategy in hematology and oncology. We've made excellent progress throughout the year advancing a number of these promising programs, including accelerating the accruals of a number of key trials and initiating several regulatory track studies with REVLIMID in a range of indications. We're exploring a number of additional important indications that offer exceptional growth potential for REVLIMID. Phase III trials are underway in MDS, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</p>
          <p>Our chronic lymphocytic leukemia clinical development program has the objective of establishing REVLIMID as a standard-of-care for the treatment of multiple patient segments within CLL. CLL-008, the ORIGIN trial, a global Phase III SPA approved study of REVLIMID versus Chlorambucil in previously untreated elderly patients, is the first registration quality trial examining the potential benefit of therapy specifically for elderly CLL patients. Excuse me.</p>
          <p>As with our CLL development strategy, our lymphoma development plan is exploring REVLIMID's potential in a range of patient subtypes within lymphoma. Our program is targeted to establish REVLIMID as a standard-of-care for the treatment of relapsed refractory aggressive lymphomas and to establish REVLIMID as a standard-of-care for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who respond to first line treatment. Enrollment is now underway in the Phase III GELA REMARC trial in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Excuse me.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline extends well beyond REVLIMID with important trials underway with VIDAZA, Amrubicin, pomalidomide, ACE-011 and other compounds. Our special protocol assessment Phase III trial comparing our third generation anthracycline Amrubicin versus topotecan in second line small cell lung cancer is accruing rapidly, with accrual more than 80% complete with full enrollment of 620 patients expected to be completed either late this year or early next.</p>
          <p>Our next IMiD, pomalidomide, is enrolling 212 relapsed/refractory myeloma patients in a multi-center controlled Phase II trial. Additional data on pomalidomide is expected at this year's ASH meeting.</p>
          <p>ACE-011, our Activin inhibitor being developed in collaboration with our partner Acceleron, has completed a Phase II trial in myeloma patients examining the agent's effect on hemoglobin and on bone lesions. Data from this trial may be presented as early as this year's ASH. We've also recently initiated a Phase II study in chemotherapy induced anemia breast cancer patients with ACE-011.</p>
          <p>As Sol mentioned, clinical data is the lifeblood of a biopharmaceutical company. Our clinical studies continue to generate impressive data, demonstrating new potential uses for our drugs. The American Society of Hematology meeting has always been a highlight for us and this year should be no exception. We believe that a record number of abstracts on Celgene products have been submitted, certainly more than 130. Multiple presentations illustrating REVLIMID's potential for sustained disease control in myeloma, including data from all patient segments from smoldering myeloma to newly diagnosed through relapsed/refractory patient groups, are expected to be presented. REVLIMID's potential in CLL, NHL, MDS and AML will also be highlighted. New data from VIDAZA, pomalidomide and ACE-011 trials will be presented. It will be an informative and exciting meeting in New Orleans in December.</p>
          <p>Presentations at major medical meetings are an essential opportunity for physician education on emerging therapies. Peer-reviewed publication of presented data is also an important resource for physicians as they stay current with advances in clinical treatment paradigms. Year-to-date, peer reviewed journals have published 71 articles providing data on Celgene products. This slide illustrates some of the important articles published this year, including survival data from VIDAZA and REVLIMID studies.</p>
          <p>Our inflammation clinical program has progressed significantly in 2009. Multiple programs are advancing. I'll discuss Apremilast in a moment, but do want to highlight that other immune inflammatory programs are also moving forward. As an example, we recently completed accrual and dosing in our Crohn's disease clinical trial with PDA-001, our proprietary placental stem cell product. Based on the analysis of this trial and encouraging preclinical studies, we expect to begin a broad Phase II program with this novel cellular therapy in 2010.</p>
          <p>As we press released on Tuesday morning, updated Phase II Apremilast data was presented earlier this week at the American College of Rheumatology meeting. The data presented demonstrate a sustained response at 24 weeks with ACR 20, 50 and 70 scores of 40, 20, and 15% in the 20 milligrams twice a day arm. The activity of Apremilast, which compares very favorably to approved oral therapies, which by the way account for approximately 85% of prescriptions, combined with its highly encouraging safety and tolerability profile has the potential to create an extremely attractive value proposition for Apremilast.</p>
          <p>Additional data is also expected from Apremilast trials in recalcitrant psoriasis and moderate to severe psoriasis early next year. We're expanding our knowledge of the drug's full potential in dermatological, rheumatological and inflammatory conditions through a wide range of Phase II studies, including trials examining the activity and safety of higher dosing. Based on the product's attractive profile and clinical result to-date, we are planning to initiate a Phase III program commencing next year.</p>
          <p>Hopefully, our presentation has provided you with an insight on our results and additional perspective on the key objectives and programs that are essential to our continued rapid growth. We've made significant progress in accomplishing many of our key 2009 corporate objectives. We have exceptional people worldwide focused on capitalizing on this momentum. I hope you can sense the enthusiasm that we have for our prospects. We continue to believe that we are strategically positioned to accomplish our mission of building a preeminent market-leading global biopharmaceutical company focused in hematology, oncology and inflammation.</p>
          <p>We thank you for your interest. Operator, we can now open the call for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you outline your plans for top line growth over the next few years as we wait for execution on your front line multiple myeloma strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok. Bob, could you take that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, I mean the growth strategy, I think is consistent with the strategy that we've had for the last few years. Clearly, there are three major areas. We'll continue to benefit for the next couple of years for expansion geographically, both in terms of regulatory approvals and importantly, reimbursement approvals. As we mentioned, Japan is the second largest individual oncology market. We filed in accordance with our plans on time at the end of the second quarter of this year in myeloma, we expect to file in MDS late this year. And we are expecting about a 12-month review and look to commercialize in Japan late next year. That's a very attractive market. It's one that clearly has a focus on oral therapies with important &#x2013; the ability to manage side effects, very important in that marketplace. But we have reimbursement approvals staggered fortunately or unfortunately over the next couple of years in different markets, in some of the Eastern European markets and some of the Asian markets and Japan. So, global expansion both from regulatory and reimbursement market access approvals will be a driver for the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>Importantly, we will continue to also see market share gains, we believe, in all of the markets that we've launched. In Europe, we are making good progress in second and third line. But we're not anywhere near where we think the potential is of fully capitalizing on the existing data and the approvals that we have from both regulatory and reimbursement authorities in Europe. And in the United States, frankly, the success that we've had over the past year to continue to grow market share, improve the profile of the drug and its positioning in the marketplace, has &#x2013; in fact, our internal targets as to where we think ultimately we'll play out in the U.S. is higher than we would have thought four or five years ago.</p>
          <p>So, geographic expansion, important market share gains in all of our markets we think we'll be able to achieve over the next couple of years, and importantly, the theme that we're seeing more and more and hopefully you can sense it from today's call, is that when you look at the profile of REVLIMID as an oral therapy with extended duration of response, with tolerability that allows &#x2013; there are patients that we're aware of that have been on the drug now for seven, eight years, continuous treatment offers an upside for patients and for us also to extend the duration of therapy.</p>
          <p>So, forgetting new indications, which we are incredibly committed to, as you've seen from all the investments we're making in expanding in CLL, NHL, MDS, plus the pipeline of pomalidomide and other therapies that we believe, we're certainly hopeful will come to market over the coming years, the existing program of REVLIMID plus VIDAZA to get fully launched in Europe, we think the growth profile over the next couple years is one that we're always looking to improve, but we think is a very bright one for the next several years with the potential for acceleration after that.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. A question for you on REVLIMID duration of therapy, you do see a big gap U.S. versus OUS and I'm wondering what the key driver of lower-duration OUS is. I know &#x2013; you probably assume less first-line use OUS, but I'm just wondering the impact of reimbursement and maybe guidelines. And then I have a follow-up.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a couple of issues here, Geoff, that I think are important. One, clearly, we launched in Europe after we've launched in the U.S. so we've got less time in terms of developing the marketplace. And as you mentioned, we have probably a higher market share in the U.S. in front line than we do in Europe. But I also think we have to be aware that we have better data in the U.S. because of S.T.E.P.S. and RevAssist, so we really can understand the duration. In Europe, it's more challenging because in most markets we don't have that kind of data. So a lot of it's estimates and we are going to be doing more chart studies to really strengthen the solid nature of that data.</p>
          <p>The trend is a positive one outside the United States. But I do think you highlight &#x2013; your question highlights the point and the importance of all of the investment that we've been making in these key trials, whether it be MM-015, IFM-0502 or the CALGB trial that looks at continuous treatment, because MM-015 really is the first trial that demonstrates the very clear benefit of continuous treatment with REVLIMID to patients. And when we get the data from IFM-0502 at this year's ASH &#x2013; at next year's ASCO and next year's ASH &#x2013; we think that all of these trials will continue to reinforce the value proposition of long-term, continuous treatment.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's a combination of factors that one, we don't have as good data. Two, we haven't been launched as long in Europe as we have in the United States. And we do need to continue to make that argument and show people new data about the value of continuous treatment, and we're in the very fortunate position of having invested in these significant trials over the last few years so there should be a steady flow of data that will reinforce that message of the value and importance of continuous REVLIMID treatment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then a bigger-picture question for you, you guys had a tough start to the year but obviously you've seen acceleration of late, and MM-015 is definitely a driver going forward. I'm wondering if you can speak to maybe the sustainability of growth on the back of this quarter and looking forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the sustainability of growth is an issue that &#x2013; we've maintained high growth for a long period of time, and we're optimistic and committed to achieving high growth for a long period of time. And we think that historically, there really isn't a change in our mind to the trend that we've been establishing for growth. It isn't a straight line. Historically, we've seen new data come out, and we've seen increased adoption of different therapies which have benefited our products and you see a rise in prescription and a rise in revenue. And we've seen that over the past six to nine months, and then things can plateau and then elevate again.</p>
          <p>And so I think we feel very good about the prospects, but we do have to recognize it's not a straight line. We feel very good about where we're going to be over the next three to five years in terms of revenue growth, and the trajectory looks good. But we do have to be realistic to understand sometimes, some quarters will go a little bit better than others. But when you put the picture together, putting aside quarter-to-quarter and some factors that one quarter can be slower than another and we'll see some plateaus from time to time, we do think, over the next couple of years there will be a steady flow of data. And there are some very important facts, like getting that front line approval in Europe will be very important and getting the continuous therapy treatment from IFM and the CALGB out there will be important.</p>
          <p>So, I think we have to be cautious in the sense that it is not a straight line. They're all &#x2013; and it has never been a straight line. We've had ups, leveling off, rise again, and we're going to see that going forward. But in the theme of the trend of where we see the business going, we feel good about it. We're always nervous. But we've got a lot of data that we've got to continue to put out in the marketplace to give us the opportunity to grow to where we think we can.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions related to MM-015. Bob, you mentioned that you've been in discussions with regulators in some of the ex-U.S. markets. I was wondering if you can give us a sense of where you're thinking right now in terms of front-line multiple myeloma filing strategy in Europe? And then I was also hoping you could clarify exactly what we should expect to see from 015 at the ASH study, in particular, whether or not we should expect to see data from the noncontinuous REVLIMID arm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll start and everybody else will jump in. First, I do want to make sure that I did say, as I incorrectly said on the call unblinded. The study does remain blinded, but that will ultimately, as we do go forward, will be unblinded.</p>
          <p>I think the second part of your question, I would think that you'll see relatively complete, though it'll be early data from the initial interim analysis that will give perspective on the different arms in the trial. And that's why we feel very good about getting the data out there. Because we do think that it's very clear from REVLIMID's profile that staying on the drug is very important to its continued response or a patient's continued response. So we think the trial is going to really demonstrate over time the messages that we want it to, which is very much that we know that you should treat as early as possible. A number of trials have demonstrated that; ECOG and SWOG and other trials will continue to show that. But this is the first trial to really say how to use the drug. You must, if you really want to maximize patient response and benefit, you must stay on the drug continuously.</p>
          <p>But I think that the primary analysis, as you know, both from a regulatory point of view is the MPR with continuous REVLIMID versus MP.</p>
          <p>From a regulatory point of view, I think the trial, as you know, did receive scientific advice from the EMEA before it was started. There were changes made to the design before it was started in conjunction with guidance from the EMEA. We did not have guidance from the FDA and that's why we'll have discussions with the FDA in the near term to look at the whole package of ECOG, SWOG and MM-015 for regulatory approval. Certainly, the EMEA approval is our first priority, but getting worldwide frontline approval with continuous therapy for REVLIMID is a key corporate objective.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. I just wanted to follow up on the last question. I guess I'm confused a little bit on the sequence of events. When you meet with the EMEA or the FDA, will you have unblinded the study or have unblinded data? So will those meetings take place after the ASH meeting? Can you just help us with that and when the filing actually might take place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As a general rule, we think it's much preferable to discuss the data with the regulatory authorities before it is fully presented in a marketplace, whether it be a medical meeting or elsewhere. So, the expectation is in our strategy is that when you discuss with the regulatory agencies of a real substantive nature about the programs and how you're going to proceed, it would be with unblinded data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, your best guess on when you would file?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our objective clearly is in 2010. A lot of it will depend on exactly the guidance that we get from the regulatory agencies in the coming month or two. So, as we &#x2013; as it becomes clear, it is in our interest to give you as much guidance as we can as to the time lines but we can't be at this time, until we have finalized those discussions, be more specific than that, though it is clear our priority is to ensure that our first filing would be a European filing. We want worldwide filings and worldwide approvals in newly diagnosed myeloma; our priority first will be the U.S. and as soon as we can give you the clarity on what those timelines will be, we certainly will do so.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. One, can you just help us understand just a little bit what was the mote inventory with REVLIMID this quarter? Were there any changes? And then the second question really has to do, help us understand a little bit, the MM-015 study and what both the FDA and EMEA might want you to do in terms of actually unblinding this early. I mean, it seems like the MP arm has almost all progressed so why not the MPR maintenance arms blinded and contiguous and maybe unblind the MP arm alone early. Is there an option to protect the integrity of the study? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. On the first question, Yaron, it's Bob, on the inventory levels, the change in inventory between the end of the second quarter and the end of the third quarter for REVLIMID in the United States was negligible, completely immaterial. So, I'd say virtually unchanged is the inventory number for the third quarter in the U.S. And in Europe, we really only book revenue based on throughput sales. So, we don't have a significant inventory issue in Europe on an on-going basis.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we do have specialty pharmacies that can have inventory and we do see approximately a little less than two week inventory out there, but in the third quarter, there was virtually no change to inventory in the U.S.</p>
          <p>On the MM-015 question, would you repeat it to make sure that we have the full issue of what you want us to cover?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely. So, the &#x2013; some of the questions or the concerns are that the Europeans or the FDA are going to ask you to unblind the data early based on the success of the interim analysis. And then, as a result, we're not going to have maybe a good enough separation given that the study is still pretty early between the MPR versus MPR maintenance arms.</p>
          <p>So, the question, one would imagine that by now, most of the MP patients have progressed. So, why not only unblind that arm and for those patients who did not progress, maybe give them an option to roll over into another arm, but keep the important arms, the MPR versus MPR maintenance arms blinded so we can actually get the separation. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that, it's an important question. I think we feel very good about what the regulatory strategy will be in terms of the data from this trial. It is early in the sense that you recognize that we can cross the O'Brien-Fleming with a very, very high bar. So, the REVLIMID continuous arm versus MP is clearly no issue as to how that comparison will ever be. It is never going to be an issue of whether there is statistical superiority between the key regulatory arms, the MPR with REV continuous versus MP.</p>
          <p>As far as the other arms go, I tried to mention in the call that since the original analysis, which was a considerable period of time that the number of events have gone up 65%. And which is close to the 70% which was the second interim analysis. And so that we have gotten more data or the analysis that will be used in any regulatory filing if we were to un-blind today, would have a significant percentage of the data. And based on our analysis of the blinded data and our knowledge of the product, we feel very good that not only will the regulatory comparisons be effective for us, but the overall data comparisons will be extremely helpful for us for making the case that continuous treatment with REVLIMID is absolutely the right thing for patients and is obviously then beneficial to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Yaron, the longer &#x2013; the more data we have, obviously, the strength of the label and the strength of the study increases because it did cross the interim at a very early point. This was a roughly 450 patient trial, 150 patients in each arm, very high hurdle which was overcome. It surprised many of us how quickly it happened. So the more data we have finally that will go into the label, I think the better off we're going to be.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of share-related questions. The 3% sequential uptick in REVLIMID share in the U.S., I found to be striking. Maybe, Bob, can you help us understand what drove that? For example, where did the share come from, VELCADE or THALOMID? And then related to that, if it's possible, could you give us first line U.S. REVLIMID market share if that's possible? And then for Sol, maybe, do you expect the 015 data to actually influence U.S. duration in 2010? Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of market share, I think what we've said was just in the short period of time of the last quarter, the overall share for REVLIMID had ticked up from 31 to 34%, which really does reflect a very significant near-term trend because it's not that easy for 12-month rolling averages to change so significantly in a short period of time. And so a big percentage of that is clearly its move earlier in treatment. So there has been a very positive trend there where our data suggest that it's the number one prescribed drug in the early stages of treatment in myeloma.</p>
          <p>And I think the encouraging thing was that the combined data with THAL and REV, that we saw positive signs in total there because THAL is clearly being moved out of front line into the third and fourth line setting. And that's key to our success of having the products positioned appropriately, and that's &#x2013; or used by physicians appropriately. And we're seeing that trend accelerate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second part of the question, Mark, in terms of the potential impact on duration by 015 in 2010, it's kind of difficult to pinpoint the impact. What's clear is what has been happening over the past few years, indeed, and since REVLIMID has been approved in the U.S., there has been a continuous increase in duration of use in patients, as we get more experience with the drug, as physicians get more experience with the drug, and as additional clinical data comes out. So MM-015 is clearly going to be an important piece of the whole overall perspective in that this is really a critical trial in doing exactly what you're suggesting, demonstrating that continuous REVLIMID use, and that was our real objective with this trial, is very beneficial for the patients. That's going to be part of it.</p>
          <p>In addition, there'll be data hopefully coming out on the IFM maintenance trial, there'll be other trials coming out, smoldering. And I think, together, that's going to add up to a very positive perspective for patients, whether it's going to be the first part of 2010, the second part. I think that the trend is in the right direction, and if we maintain the trend that's currently ongoing, I think we will do very well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of just quick questions. The first one just is on SG&amp;A. What level of charitable support do you think is necessary going forward, just for our modeling? And then when do you think that we'll see the impact of those co-pays on, support on your top line?</p>
          <p>And then second of all, just so we're crystal clear, you will have some &#x2013; I just want to make sure I understand this &#x2013; preliminary data maintenance versus induction at the time of the interim analysis at ASH but ultimately, you'll wait for the data to mature potentially to file with the FDA and EMEA. Is that a fair way of summarizing what you said so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't &#x2013; well, let me clear up what we've tried to say anyway and see if that helps. Our intention is that whatever data is presented at ASH will be whatever is analyzable at the time to make the ASH presentation complete. It would be expected that it would be the initial data from the first interim analysis. The regulatory filing, by the time the filing is complete, it will have as much data as is possible. So, once we lock the database, when we unblind the study, the regulatory filings will have all of the data up to that locked period.</p>
          <p>So it is very possible that a regulatory filing in 2010 would have more data in it than would be presented at ASH. And that's what my expectation would be. And that at subsequent meetings at ASCO and EHA, as that data has been analyzed, you would continue to see updated data that would ultimately then be complete with what is in the regulatory filings. And then over time, you would see presentations of data that would go beyond what is in the regulatory filings because we've got to stop the clock and put the regulatory filings together. So, I think at first, you'll see data that is less than will be in the regulatory filings. Then you'll see data that over time in the coming year that will be equal to what's in the filings. And then you will see more data and more mature data over time that was beyond the filings.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will unblind the study. The expectation is it will be unblinded prior to ASH and the data that's analyzable which will be up to the interim, the first interim, our expectation is that that would be presented. But the data that is from the initial interim analysis up to the unblinding will probably not be fully analyzed by the time ASH comes on. But it will be part of the regulatory filing. So from the 50% of events to the 65% of events or so, wherever we are today or whenever we unblind, that difference is what &#x2013; is the only difference.</p>

          <p>So, on the second question, Steve, on the co-pay, there is not a direct correlation between the co-pay and the top line revenue. What we look at is what &#x2013; where there is support for patients who need to access therapy. So that's what we look at. Typically, in the past years, there's been a little bit more heavy co-pay; in the fourth quarter this year; it was accelerated a little bit more into the third quarter. The increase over Q2 to Q3 was about 18 million. But overall, our budget for co-pay overall is in line with what we thought it was going to be. And obviously what's most important to us is to make sure there's enough monies and funds in these particular entities to help patients re-enroll in 2010 when the deductible starts all over again.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Steve, just one thing to add on healthcare reform. If we do have healthcare reform that includes some coverage in the doughnut hole, we could see a slight impact on revenue, if we do have a 50% reduction in revenue for patients in need in the doughnut hole, but we would have some offset to that from the SG&amp;A line because we wouldn't need to make as much contributions to these third party charitable nonprofit foundations either.</p>

          <p>This question is for Bob. There were a couple of questions early on about growth sustainability. And I want to talk a little bit about REVLIMID outside of myeloma. You guys have shown some really strong single agent use data in refractory patients and the aggressive histological subgroups in NHL. Can you talk a little bit about your NHL regulatory strategy and whether or not you're currently seeing any off label use there? And also, a little bit of color, if you can, about when we gain additional visibility into some of the solid tumor settings like prostate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start out with that. We're actually very excited about the activity that we're seeing in lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in both of those indications, we've obviously learned a lot from myeloma and really aren't that far away hopefully towards meeting our objective of turning this into a chronic and a powerful &#x2013; REVLIMID into a powerful agent for that disease.</p>
          <p>So, in REVLIMID for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we have two trials that are on-going in mantle cell that hopefully will lead to a quicker approval. Timing is very &#x2013; as you know, very difficult to estimate in these cases. But there are really compelling needs here and those are both ongoing. In addition, we have &#x2013; we are working with GELA, the major French cooperative group that was responsible in part for Rituxan's actually first approval, and we're working with them in the largest histology and lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma on a major Phase III trial that is ongoing that looks at REVLIMID following R-CHOP and the REVLIMID again is as a continuous therapy. So, we're quite excited by that.</p>
          <p>And then, as you mentioned, there is a lot of exciting data both as single agent and in combination with Rituxan in both &#x2013; in non-Hodgkin`s lymphoma and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. And we're going to be seeing some of that information coming out hopefully in this ASH. I know it has been submitted. So, there is a lot going on in non-Hodgkin`s. There's a lot going on in chronic lymphocytic leukemia; again trials are ongoing, we are starting new trials. We're excited about the ADCC synergy between Rev and Rituxan, so that's going on as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of solid tumors, there's a number of trials that have been initiated or are being initiated. When we sort of designed REVLIMID and we looked at its activity we did not originally anticipate for it to be a solid tumor drug. However, having said that, we see some promising signs. We're pursuing prostate. We will pursue in combination with Taxotere, colorectal cancer and a few other cancers in terms of exploratory studies. So, it's hard for me to tell you exactly when we're going to see the data. Whether it will be at a 2010 ASCO or 2011 ASCO but nevertheless that's something that is going on and we have selected the tumor types consistent with what we know about the mechanism of action. So that could remain a very, very large upside to REVLIMID. We're not counting on it, obviously. And we're in the exploration phase for it.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the commercial side, myeloma and MDS continue to comprise about 95% of the prescriptions. There hasn't been really any significant change to that for an extended period of time, though lymphomas have risen to be the number three indication but I wouldn't &#x2013; it's not a meaningful impact on revenue at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if we could have two more questions now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we'll take our next question from Jim Birchenough with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi guys. A couple of follow-up questions, just on ASH and the IFM and CALGB post-transplant maintenance data for REVLIMID, just wondering what you're expecting from that data? And we've got data for THAL post-transplants that suggests a benefit. What kind of THAL use do we see post-transplant and what could be the implications of positive REVLIMID data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. We don't specifically know, regarding studies, I'll just give the disclaimer first, that we don't sponsor. We really don't know the details in terms of what's going to be at ASH. We do understand that maybe some initial data will come out on the IFM. I don't know on the CALGB. I do know that 2010 may be a very big year for that trial, be it ASCO or ASH, where hopefully a very significant amount of news will come out. So I really don't know in terms of this coming ASH. And &#x2013; I'm sorry, and the second part of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The THAL maintenance, which really has -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because of the neuropathy and the sedation it really has had limited impact. Though trials have shown some benefit in THAL post transplant and one of the reasons why we think, with the different product profile with Rev being one more active without the sedation and neuropathy it's really an ideal continuous therapy after transplant or even before. So I do think that's why the data is very important. But I don't think you can compare THAL which in Europe has had some use there, less in the U.S., as any kind of road map for us. It really will be a new opportunity for us.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The overall theme that you will be hearing about and seeing again and &#x2013; which we're implying quite correctly, again and again and again, because of REVLIMID's unique activity and clinical characteristics is longer term use in a continuous setting, hopefully having a major impact on patients. So, we have one more question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, our final question will come from Geoff Porges with Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for letting me jump in. Two quick questions, one on SG&amp;A and one on dose. First on SG&amp;A, I just wanted to get a sense of, the comments Dave, about SG&amp;A and the patient assistance. Is it likely to be maintained at this level going forward and will that be enough to offset the seasonal Q1 slowdown that you experienced this year in Q1 next year. And then on dose, as the duration for REVLIMID extends, particularly as you look at continuous dosing, what's happening in the dose trend and what do you think will happen in the future? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Dave?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff, on SG&amp;A, yes, it's enough. We typically have a higher payment in the fourth quarter than the third quarter and this year it got a little bit accelerated. So, we have enough in our plan and our guidance that we gave you in terms of the SG&amp;A range. It does anticipate an increase in co-pay and we've factored that in. We're very comfortable with it. And Bob also mentioned in the previous question before that to the extent that there is some healthcare reform that this co-pay amount may be diminished depending on what happens with healthcare reform on a go-forward basis.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, I think what I also mentioned in the earlier question is that this is obviously helping some of the co-pay foundations get patients re-enrolled in the first quarter of 2010 so they know the funding is there. So they can obviously identify those patients and get them into the program in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Geoff just related to the first quarter, I think last January really was an unbelievable time in the economy, that people were basically paralyzed as to what to do with their savings, the amount of money and the expenditures. I do think for the first three or four years of Medicare Part D, we were very focused on the double donut hole in December, which was a big concern for us and it did materialize but not in a way that overwhelmed the revenue and the prescription growth in those quarters.</p>
          <p>I do think we need to be cautious going forward with the turmoil in January and changing plans and the concerns about co-pay until we really have healthcare reform that really minimizes the size of this donut hole. I do think we have to be cautious and we could see even without the extraordinary economic difficulties of last year that we're going to be a bit cautious because we want to make sure that people have the opportunity for co-payment and make sure we provide the source there for assistance if it's needed. But I do think we could see a little bit of turbulence there.</p>
          <p>And on the dose, we really have seen modest decline in the dose. We do expect to see dose over time decline as duration extends. And there will be data at ASH that will talk about what is the right dose for the first 12 months, what's the right dose after you extend out duration longer term to maintain that response. So, it wouldn't be surprising to see some dose response in long-term &#x2013; dose reduction in long-term responders. But obviously flat pricing is a pretty important consideration to ensure that it doesn't have an economic impact, a financial impact on us.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Geoff. So, thank you everybody for joining our call. It's obviously been &#x2013; it's a very positive quarter. We look &#x2013; we very much look forward to 2010. We look forward to seeing all of you at the American Society of Hematology meeting. We'll have more information on the details of our events, our IR event at ASH, that will be forthcoming relatively soon. So, and we thank you for your interest and for your support. Goodbye.</p>
