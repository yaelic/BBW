        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our 2012 third quarter results. I'm joined today by CEO, Asim Ghosh; our CFO, Alister Cowan; our COO, Rob Peabody; and our Senior Vice President of Downstream, Bob Baird. Today, we will provide an update on Husky's business strategy and an overview of results, followed by a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings, which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR, and our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Asim.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Rob, and good morning everybody. I will get in the third quarter highlights in a moment, but first, I'd just like to take, start off reflecting on our overall perform to date. And I think in summary, I will first show that we continue to build operational momentum. For the first nine months of this year and really since we laid out a strategic plan two years ago, we have delivered on our targets consistently, and we have done this through consistent execution of our business strategy, strong operational performance from all the segments of our business. And within that more specifically greater emphasis on heavy oil thermal, and resource plays in our foundation that have contributed to a more oily portfolio, and also focus on project delivery on key milestones and growth pillars.</p>
          <p>A final part on this is our focused integration strategy what I called are focused integration strategy in the past have helped us to capture more value by offsetting pricing volatility. Overall we remain on cause in executing our business plan and continue to make steady progress and setting the stage for our major growth projects.</p>
          <p>Let me get into some of the operational highlights now for the third quarter. So let me begin with heavy oil. Heavy oil as you'll recollect is a part of our pedigree in Western Canada and we've demonstrated our leadership in this resource area time and again over the years.</p>
          <p>As I've mentioned to you before, we are transitioning this part of our foundation to more thermal production and horizontal drilling to extract greater value <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:55). The Pikes Peak South and Paradise Hill thermal projects both reached the design production rates within two months of first oil. And based on their cost efficiency and performance they will be models for our future heavy oil thermal project developments and my colleague Rob Peabody will speak to more of the specifics of these two projects a bit later this morning. We expect to accelerate more of these long life projects in the future using this modular approach for cost efficiency.</p>
          <p>Currently for example, construction of the Sandall thermal project is progressing with first production scheduled for 2014. And in summary again heavy oils as you know is one of the building blocks of our foundation and thermal projects are giving new life into the future of this foundation.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to Western Canada, we continue to develop and evaluate oil resource play portfolio, getting good results at Bakken, Cardium, and Viking developments, and we're advancing the evaluation early stages yet relative to the others at Rainbow and our Northwest Territories plays and in the Investor Day coming up in the beginning of December we will give you an update on these and our liquids-rich gas play portfolio.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the Atlantic region. We already sent a press release out on this, the SeaRose is back online, well ahead of schedule after the execution of the safe and successful turnaround. The maintenance program in Belfast went of without a hitch. And it really just didn't happen, it's reflected very strong planning and execution. We re-connected and became operational more than three weeks ahead of schedule, production was ramped back at the steady state levels by the end of the quarter also ahead of schedule, but of course we didn't see the benefit of that throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>So keep that in mind as you look at our overall production levels in our oil, gas mix. And we're continuing to moving forward on evaluating potential development concepts for the satellite extension program in the White Rose region.</p>
          <p>And finally, Rob, will bring you up-to-date on our plans on exploration program in the Atlantic.</p>
          <p>In the Asia-Pacific region, our Liwan Gas Project has made great progress over the past quarter. Overall the project is now about three quarters complete, as we draw closer to first gas in the 2013, 2014 timeframe, which is the timeframe we'd indicated to you earlier. The shallow water jacket has been launched and installed on the ocean floor in the South China Sea, and that is the foundation for the central platform from that we'll work with CNOOC partner to develop the Liwan field.</p>
          <p>Construction of the top size component remains on track. We expect it to be floated over to the jacket in the second quarter of next year. And more than half of the two, it's about almost 80 kilometer long deepwater pipelines had been laid already from the gas field to the central platform area. And finally within Asia, in Indonesia we're continuing our exploration drillings in the Madura Strait Block and evaluating initial results from new discoveries. This is one more thing that we should have more information to share with you by Investor Day in early December.</p>
          <p>So in summary on Asia, Liwan is progressing well and we're advancing our developers in Indonesia to hit our target of 50,000 barrels a day equivalent from the Asia-Pacific in 2015 and looking in good shape for that.</p>
          <p>I'd finally turn to the Sunrise Energy Project within the upstream area, remains on track, we're getting ready to deliver production in 2014. And overall the project is about 50% complete at the end of the quarter. The biggest single building block you'll recollect of this is the Central Processing Facility. And in this sub leg of the project, the modules are being delivered regularly to the site along with major equipment. We'd already given you an update on the fact that the drilling was complete, the field facilities are well advanced. So, overall this project looks to be in good shape as well.</p>
          <p>I'd now turn from Upstream to Downstream. Our Downstream operations continue to deliver on both performance and reliability. In the quarter, they continued to allow us to capture additional margin, to get near Brent pricing for most of our liquids products from upstream, and that underpins the value of what I call the focused integration strategy in the choppy markets that we have seen.</p>
          <p>So in summary overall, we are positioned about where we want to be at the end of this quarter and are executing on our key performance targets. The transformation of the Western Canada foundation is well underway with the strong focus in oil production and our major projects are making substantial progress.</p>
          <p>On that note, let me turn you over to Alister.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Asim. As Asim has just mentioned, consistent operational excellence that was demonstrated in the quarter and the strong balance sheet that we have provides us lots of flexibility to capitalize on the opportunities and exact most value from the large resource portfolio that we've outlined to you before.</p>
          <p>We did begin the year with some clear expectations that are in &#x2013; what we would achieve that are in approved production, reliability, earnings and cash flow. And we've been delivering it all four even though and taking into account the two planned FPSO offstations. The net earnings for the quarter were $526 million or $0.53 diluted per share, compared to $521 million or $0.53 diluted per share a year earlier.</p>
          <p>And cash flow from operations remains stronger at $1.27 billion or $1.29 per share as compared to $1.3 billion or $1.39 per share a year ago. If you look at our production, we were averaged 285,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter and that was up from the 282,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. There is production total as Asim has mentioned reflect the new heavy oil thermal projects, the recently completed SeaRose FPSO maintenance as well as the ongoing Terra Nova offstation.</p>
          <p>As you all have noted the natural gas production is lower and that's due to a deliberate reallocation of capital away from gas to dry gas to oil developments during the year as the gas prices remained low.</p>
          <p>In downstream, we continue to benefit from the strong operational performance and throughput. The upgrader contributed $68 million to net earnings in the third quarter and that was compared to $42 million last quarter and $78 million a year ago.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. the refining operations added $195 million to net earnings, compared to $84 million in the second quarter and $82 million last year. Now as we disclosed in the MD&amp;A there was a FIFO after-tax gain of approximately $34 million in the quarter, and year-to-date there is an FIFO after- tax loss of approximately $6 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at pricing, the details are all in the MD&amp;A and on the website, but here is a few points. The realized average price for the company's production as a whole was $52.52 per boe in the quarter. And that was lower than last year's $60.80 per boe, but certainly comparable to the $51.88 we achieved in the second quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>On the $2 pricing, the average realized price of $70.14 per barrel down from $78.70 per barrel a year ago and $71.61 per barrel in the second quarter. Again this reflects the impact of the Atlantic region offstations, which is high price Brent crude slightly higher commodity prices and higher product on Western Canada discounts.</p>
          <p>There is not much new unfortunately to report in the natural gas front, although we have seen a slight uptick lately. The third quarter saw prices of $2.48 per mcf compared to $4.12 per mcf in the same quarter a year ago and $2.05 per mcf for the second quarter of this year. And as you all know commodity prices have been quite volatile over the last couple of weeks, whether WTI <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:33) per barrel and Brent at US $108 per barrel yesterday.</p>
          <p>And these will have impacts on the realized price for Q4 production. And in addition, if these prices are sustained, we expect to see a FIFO loss on our 60 million barrels of oil inventory for processing through the upgrader and the refineries.</p>
          <p>Now, over time FICO gains and losses <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:56) but certainly FICO accounting does gives some volatility to the quarterly results. The US mid-continent crack spreads are certainly choppy in October and do reflect the regional, seasonal downward trend that we always see in Q4.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet and diametrics remained strong. That was the operational performance as I mentioned earlier, and makes us confident, we have the capacity and ability to deliver on all of term commitments with financial flexibility to pursue further opportunities as they emerge.</p>
          <p>And finally, the board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. So, I'll pass you over to Rob, he is going to give you an update on the operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alister. As both Asim and Alister have mentioned, the SeaRose offstation program has concluded safely, successfully, and under budget. And we have the added bonus of returning to production more than three weeks ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>We ramped quickly back up to approximately 40,000 barrels per day net production. The work we did in managing the White Rose reservoir, including drilling an infill production well has paid dividends and allowing a rapid return to pre-shutdown production rates.</p>
          <p>Looking into our operations during the quarter and starting in Western Canada, overall we continue to shift the focus to more oil drilling. Over 95% of the wells we drilled in the quarter targeted oil. We were active across our portfolio of resource plays. These includes six key oil plays the Bakken, the Viking, Cardium, Lower Shaunavon, Rainbow Muskwa as well as the Slater River play in the Northwest Territories.</p>
          <p>In total, we drilled 32 horizontal oil resource wells over the third quarter bringing our total number to 66 over the first nine months of the year. This includes a horizontal well at our Rainbow Muskwa shale oil project in North West Alberta. It's still early, but we have plans to drill up to six more wells this year to better understand the sweet spots of this play.</p>
          <p>And in the Northwest Territories, at our Slater River Project, this is &#x2013; the work there is proceeding on schedule pending further regulatory approvals over the next few weeks we're planning to build an all-season access road this winter. And further evaluate the two vertical wells we drilled there last year.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we're expecting to drill another 31 wells across our oil resource play portfolio over the remainder of the year. This reflects our commitment to develop and de-risk our extensive resource play portfolio as we transform the foundations of Western Canada.</p>
          <p>In our gas resources plays we're continuing to pursue liquids-rich gas opportunities, but given the current price, gas price environment as Alister alluded to, we are further focused on our efforts on high-grading our capital spending.</p>
          <p>Current activity has restricted to place the generate competitive returns at today's gas prices or where we believe this potential exist as we drive down costs. At Ansell in west central Alberta we resumed drilling over the quarter after a long spring break up. We drilled a total of 14 wells on this play over the first nine months of 2012 while completing another 38 net wells, up to four more wells are planned at Ansell for the remainder of the year. We still consider Ansell as the core asset and it certainly has lots of potential. However, with the current price environment we have been shifting some of the capital into our oil plays.</p>
          <p>In the Duvernay, we completed and tested our second horizontal well at Kaybob. We currently have one well producing in this play. Overall we remain on track to meet our goal that we set out in 2010 of having one third of our production from Western Canada coming from resource plays in 2016.</p>
          <p>Our heavy oil business achieved some major strategic milestones in the quarter with both Pikes Peak South and Paradise Hill reaching full production capacity. As Asim mentioned we're making great progress on repositioning our heavy oil foundation to focus more on thermal projects. This is certainly been a high performance area of our business.</p>
          <p>Over the next &#x2013; our next two thermal projects are the 3,500 barrel per day Sandall thermal development, which is currently under construction and the 8,000 barrel per day Rush Lake project. We're also advancing reservoir evaluations on additional commercial heavy oil thermal projects.</p>
          <p>The capital intensity of these thermal projects is very attractive, their modular design and small scale means we've been able to reduce the cost per barrel to develop. In heavy oil we also drilled 49 horizontal wells in the third quarter. In total 99 horizontal wells have been drilled to date out of &#x2013; around 140 to 150 well program we have planned for this year.</p>
          <p>Well we're focusing a greater amount of our energy on thermal projects and horizontal wells, our legacy approach using cold heavy oil production with sand is continuing to provide value. We're on track to drill approximately 265 of these wells this year in areas where they provide the best economics. And we're also progressing a number of solvent EOR projects.</p>
          <p>Turning to the growth pillars in the Asia-Pacific region, the Liwan Gas Project has really hit its full stride as we approach first production in the late 2013, early 2014 timeframe. We've realized some significant milestones with our partners over the past few months. Asim mentioned earlier, the jacket for the central platform, which is at the heart of the Liwan Gas Project, has been anchored to the seabed.</p>
          <p>We're finishing up construction on the top sides of the platform, which is due to be floated out and installed on top of the jacket this spring or &#x2013; next year, in the spring. All the wells at Liwan have been drilled and we have confirmed the deliverability of the gas.</p>
          <p>Looking at Indonesia, we're anticipating first gas from the Madura Strait Block in the 2015 timeframe. We have an approved development plan and gas sales agreement in place for the BD field. And we're advancing the development of the combined MDA, MBH fields towards production.</p>
          <p>We're continuing exploration work on a five well program in the Madura Strait Block, with additional new discoveries now under evaluation. In the oil sands, the Sunrise Energy Project is continuing to advance as planned and is about 50% complete.</p>
          <p>In the Atlantic region, we continue to progress engineering work on the White Rose extension projects. We've excavated a new subsea drill center for the South White Rose extension over the past quarter and continue further development drilling at the North Amethyst satellite field.</p>
          <p>Let me just update you on our exploration program; our Searcher prospect has been spudded in the southern Jeanne d'Arc Basin and we're also participating in the Harpoon exploration well near the Mizzen discovery in the Flemish Pass, which should spud by the end of the year. And you'll recall we hold a 35% interest in this well with our partner.</p>
          <p>Turning to the downstream, at our refineries at Lima and Toledo, we're nearing completion of two projects which will further increase product flexibility and reduce cost. At Lima, a new kerosene hydrotreater will give us enhanced stability to swing product production from gasoline over to diesel and jet fuel and vice versa, depending on market conditions.</p>
          <p>At Toledo, a new continuous catalytic reformer unit will replace three older units and enable us to address new environmental regulations while significantly reducing energy consumption and operating costs. We had another good quarter of operations across the downstream, throughput edged up to 328,000 barrels per day at our refineries and the upgrader, compared to 323,000 barrels per day at this time last year.</p>
          <p>Our focused integration strategy, which includes infrastructure assets and marketing expertise, continues to give us the flexibility we need to maximize our suite of upstream opportunities. So just to wrap up, we're continuing to deliver on our performance target safely and reliably. Our foundation in Western Canada and heavy oil is undergoing rejuvenation and we're positioning our business for significant near and mid-term growth, in the Asia-Pacific region, the oil sands, and the Atlantic region of these coast.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn you back to the operator.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question today comes from George Toriola from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning guys. I have a couple of questions. The first is on the economics of your thermal projects, could you just quickly review that in terms of the capital cost, the operating cost, payback period, recycle ratio, those types of things just on your thermal projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>George, I think we intend to cover this more exhaustively at the Investor Day. So if you just be patient for a few weeks more, we do intend to have a comprehensive discussion in greater specifics on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, certainly. And then the other question is just around, Robert mentioned this. As you transition your portfolio &#x2013; as we look towards 2016, is there anyway you can fast track this or sort of hasten this and move this closer than 2016?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the present, I mean, if you're talking of heavy oil, I think the profile that you are seeing today is already considerably fast-tracked from what we &#x2013; from the targets we gave to you a year ago, Rob, do you want to take up on specific of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Asim, has covered kind of heavy oil, and I think George, you kind of know our game plan a little bit around that. I think on the resource play front, I think we're still comfortable with our original target of one-third of our production coming by 2016. As we go through these, as I've emphasized before the need to sort of work through these plays and do your homework before you sort of really apply lots of capitals to them.</p>
          <p>And I guess the only other thing I'd say as we look at the overall capital plan for the company that fits well with our overall capital plan. So we have lots of opportunities and sort of the pace we're going there both technically and overall when we look at the rest portfolio feels about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Agreed. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Greg Pardy of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Good morning guys. Wondering just how relevant the fact that you are still negotiating the gas sales contract on Liuhua 34-2, just wondering if you can provide a little color around that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, given the &#x2013; given the push in terms of Western Canada, I think at last year's Investor Day, you suggested you could hold volumes flat, but I'm wondering if on the oil and liquids side now you would be looking for growth. And then lastly just any color around the Rainbow Muskwa would be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think I'll start with the last question first. Again I think we &#x2013; this is a subject for the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...for the Investor Day disclosure, and we expect to have more information. But this is a major project, but in its early stages of gestation. And we will have that &#x2013; what information we think is in the bag we will disclose to you -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...at Investor Day. On the Liuhua pricing, I think that's just basically work in progress. And we have given you guidance on the first part of the project, which is quite significant. There are a few development options, and market options being discussed for the second part.</p>
          <p>But it's under 10% of the volume. So really you have reasonable disclosure on 90% of the volume. And it would be really &#x2013; now we discussed &#x2013; you got the dog, you're looking at the tail. And there was &#x2013; if you ask so many questions, I'm going to forget, which are the three you asked -</p>

          <p>... of our overall roadmap. So the first mega project that comes on stream is the South China Sea and we've given you a timeframe on that. The next one is Sunrise and then we are advancing work on the East Coast. And in the context of this overall strategic plan, we are looking at transformational projects for Western Canada as the next leg past that. I'm sorry I always miss the fact that, the transformation of heavy oil is already well underway.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And what I don't want to fall into the trap of is stripping the &#x2013; stripping the gears by trying to do shortcuts and having the company running in every direction at the same time. Just by phasing our efforts properly, we've kept to ship on track now pretty well since I took over 2.5 years ago, and we want to stick to a predictable steady well thought through pace on the development of this company.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Andrew Potter of CIBC. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, I've got a few questions, but first, just on Sunrise, if you just &#x2013; get a lot of speculation in the market about potential cost overruns here, so maybe you can comment a little bit in terms of how confident you are in the cost or if it is under some pressure, what magnitude we're talking and then I have a few other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe we've given some guidance on that in some meetings recently, but overall, I think this is again an update subject for the Investor Day when we expect to have concrete information for you. But you know, here we are, I mean, we are about overall, probably 50% complete, still facilities about 60% complete, detailed engineering complete, and we have the reasonable handle on where we are. So we see nothing in terms of what we have, which indicates a blow out either in money or in timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure and how do &#x2013; I mean whatever inflationary pressures you are seeing on Sunrise 1, what does that sort of indicate to you about economics for Sunrise 2, is it starting to make in situ growth look more challenging going forward, just with the inflation you're seeing, or does it still seem like its economics are robust enough and inflation is under control?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anything we are seeing so far does not give us any concern about the economics of the project versus our sanction plan. We are very comfortable with our sanction plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I am sorry l was talking more about, how you think about Sunrise 2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, Rob, why don't you take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it's almost the same as Asim just said. We, as you know, we're proceeding and have been doing the front-end engineering work around Sunrise Phase 2. So we have a good idea of how this is developing, of course it has the advantage that some of the infrastructure was put in place as part of Sunrise Phase 1, so we still believe those projects are going to have robust economics going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I do want to make the point, Andrew, I think our contracting strategy on Sunrise has turned out to be very sound and has been a good learning from us &#x2013; for us. And of course as you go into any project, there are additional learnings, we will incorporate those into Sunrise Phase 2, but if anything, they will lead to greater efficiencies, not less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And then just on the in situ side as well, what are the steam-oil ratios on Pikes Peak and Paradise -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll give you better information at the Investor Day, but they're certainly under three.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. And very last question, completely unrelated. There was announcement, I guess, last week or the week before, about LNG exports on East Coast Canada, I mean, I know this has always been a very long-term thing for your guys, but does this make gas development from Terra Nova and White Rose a possibility this decade, or is that still more of a next decade type thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe I'll let Asim catch up on this, but just &#x2013; I would say that our focus on gas development on the East Coast is to actually aid in our oil development. So that's &#x2013; in terms of our utilization of the gas, we're actually using it right now to enhance our oil production going forward and given sort of the gas prices in the market out there, it seems like a sensible thing to do now. In the long-term, there is a resource there that's going to be valuable for, I'm sure Newfoundland, valuable for ourselves and in the long-term, I'm sure it will get developed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mike Dunn of FirstEnergy Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning everyone, Just a question on your Saskatchewan thermal projects and Asim, you may be deferring me to the Investor Day, but just in general, I wanted to just reconfirm, my impression is that the reserve life on these types of projects are somewhere sort of 15 years to 20 years, so much longer than conventional, but not maybe quite as long as some of the Athabasca oil sands projects, is that sort of ballpark I mean, in the right range there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer to that is yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And on the Muskwa, I'll try for one in the Muskwa, are any of those wells that are completed, are they tied in and producing yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is definitely for the Investor Day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last one on the Lima Refinery, can you just sort of review what you're looking at there to get &#x2013; I know you are getting a bit more sort of inland discounted crudes in there than you were in the past. But are you investigating any initiatives to sort of make a longer term solution, or are you kind of thinking that you don't want to invest any pipelines because two years or three years from now, those differentials may be closed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no actually the overall strategic thrust of our &#x2013; what I call our focused integration strategy, is to create flexibility and optionality, okay. So we actually have made commitments to pipeline capacity, whether they are pipelines or whether they are dedicated outsourced capacity is irrelevant. But fundamentally, I remind you of what I said to you in earlier meetings, there are three strategic focus areas on our overall integration plan. Input flexibility, i.e., including options on where we get feedstock so that we can switch from WTI to Brent, to Canadian stock as the occasion demands.</p>
          <p>Product flexibility, which is improving options on what we make, reacting to product market pricing at any point in time. And finally, market flexibility, including options on where we sell product and that therefore includes greater connectivity with the Atlantic Seaboard from our Midwest location.</p>
          <p>Okay, so it's around those three areas that we've driven, and we've actually made substantial commitments in improving pipeline connectivity and are constantly looking at low-hanging fruit investments in terms of product flexibility.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. A very good quarter. I just wanted to ask a question with reference to the South China Sea project. I recall reading some time ago that the ODP was still pending, has that been finally granted or is that still in process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is a long pipeline of ODPs for several companies in the South China &#x2013; in China, in general at this point in time. And we are in very exulted company, because pretty well every super major is in that as well. But basically, we have received permitting for all the appropriate stages of our project so far.</p>
          <p>And the overall ODP process, it's just something that's &#x2013; that's the process in China right now. But there is no reason to change our guidance because of that. That's how the regulatory process works in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I appreciate it and very good job. Thank you.</p>

          <p>This concludes the analyst Q&amp;A portion of today's call. We will now take questions from members of the media. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question from media comes from <mark type="ph" /> Jeff Jones of Reuters (35:08). Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I have two questions. The first relates to the economics of upgrading, and I'm wondering how that is being affected by the boom in light oil production in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, why don't you take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's why, as Asim had related earlier in terms of our flexibility at the refinery and feedstocks, our investments in the Lima Refinery will allow us to have &#x2013; to continue to operate as a cracking refinery and to have flexibility for heavy crudes when they &#x2013; when we want to use them, and if they're economic. So we've actually looked at flexibility of the feedstocks and we feel that we're well-positioned there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, but are you being squeezed in the Western Canadian upgrading environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's just a question of value moving between upstream and downstream for us. Okay, we've got an upgrader, bought years ago at very attractive book value. And then &#x2013; and you know &#x2013; so basically that's just value moving up and down the chain. Bob, why don't you just speak to the asphalt point while you're at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, don't forget we do have the upgrader in Lloyd as well as our asphalt refinery that provides us about 29,000 barrels a day, 30,000 barrels a day of upgrading capacity where we get high returns for our asphalt business. So, as Asim alluded to it just now, we move that value up and down the value chain as we see fit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just one more question if I might; obviously refining margins in the interior of North America were pretty strong in the quarter, how long do you see that continuing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we just have to go back to the flexibility point because if those refining margins go down, it's presumably because WTI, off which we price Western Canada product, is going up and then the value comes back upstream. So, broadly I don't have a crystal ball any better than anybody else's. But I am just positioning myself, as a company, to be in a place where, in choppy markets, I can move up and down the value chain and provide some overall stability.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, thanks for taking my question. There was a mention earlier on the call about focusing drilling and focusing gas activity on projects that can deliver returns at current gas prices. I'm just wondering whether Husky has a forecast for gas prices, whether you think the forward strip is accurate, whether we'll see higher or lower prices going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are of the firm view that, as I said a moment earlier, there is no extra magic in our crystal ball than anybody else's and we don't &#x2013; we don't give guidance on future pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you everybody for your questions and for joining us on this call. So, I remind you again, our Annual Investor Day is scheduled for December the 4th, at the new Four Seasons Hotel in Toronto, which I am told is a spectacular venue.</p>
          <p>I'll leave you with a few thoughts until then. We've had a busy and productive year, have continued to build on the progress we have achieve to-date. We are consistently meeting or exceeding all our key performance goals and it's been a very key focus for us internally to make sure that we have a predictable machine and we have a machine focused on execution, because I think the strategy that we laid out two years ago continues to be &#x2013; it's standing the test of time.</p>
          <p>We are within that strategy, rejuvenating our foundation in Western Canada in heavy oil to extract the greatest possible value from our oil resource plays and thermal technologies and continuing to set the stage for our major growth projects at Sunrise and Liwan while advancing, like clockwork I'd like to think, towards delivery over the next 12 months to 18 months.</p>
          <p>The only thing I'd like to leave you with finally is, remember that in all of this, I just remind you of what Alister said that, part of the price we've paid for this focused integration strategy is that we've got the FIFO volatilities from quarter-to-quarter that is not really fundamentally operational, but it affects our reported figures. And just keep that in mind as you look ahead. Any &#x2013; okay, thank you very much.</p>
