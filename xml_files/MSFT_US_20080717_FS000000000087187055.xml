          <p>Thanks Colleen, and good afternoon everyone. I'll start today's call with a few highlights from the year. And then give you an overview of our expectation of fiscal year 2009. Quarter four results capped off an outstanding year for the company in terms of both operating and financial performance.</p>
          <p>All three of our key financial measures met or exceeded the guidance we provided entering the year, despite a challenging economic environment. For the year our revenue, operating income and earnings per share increased 18, 21 and 32% respectively.</p>
          <p>Furthermore the 18% revenue growth represents our first annual revenue growth in almost a decade. These results demonstrate the breath of our business model, revenue growth being fuelled by strong customer demand for our products and services, across all of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Our core businesses of Client, Microsoft Business Division and Sever and Tools turned out fantastic results, growing revenue a combined 15% in the year. The Online Service business grew revenue 32%, while Entertainment and Devices Division was up 34% for the year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the fiscal year results from a geographic perspective, revenue in the U.S. increased approximately 15%, other mature markets were up 16%, and emerging markets grew a tremendous 35%.</p>
          <p>Now for a couple of key points on our outlook for fiscal 2009 with our planning and budgeting process in place. Our regular operating income growth ranges remain relatively consistent with what we told you in April.</p>
          <p>Specifically, we expect revenue growth of 11 to 13%, operating income growth of 17 to 20% and earnings per share growth of 13 to 17%.</p>
          <p>Since we last gave you guidance, we've increased investments in three ways. First we've continued to make a number of important inorganic acquisitions.  We take the view that the current environment is in fact a positive one to acquire companies if you're in the fortunate position of having a strong balance sheet and the willingness to take a long-term view.</p>
          <p>Second we've increased organic investments in operating expenses driven in particular by a deliberate decision to invest more aggressively in our online services strategy.</p>
          <p>Last we remain committed to invest in ourselves through our ongoing share repurchases. For the year, we repurchased over 12 billion of our stock with 5 billion of that amount clearing in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>One final comment before we get into the details. Clearly we're disappointed that our strong financial results are not reflected in our share price, because of general market turbulence combined with Microsoft specific issues including the uncertainty of the outcome of Yahoo! discussions.</p>
          <p>In this environment we remained focused on driving the factors inside our controls, in particular from my perspective, improving long term earnings per share.</p>
          <p>I am satisfied that despite difficult economic conditions should we achieve the middle of our guidance fiscal year '09 we will have increased our earnings per share from $1.42 to $2.15 in two years an increase of 50% over that period.</p>
          <p>With those high level things for 2008 and 2009 I am going to turn the call over to Colleen, now for more details on how we closed out last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Chris. The fourth quarter was a solid finish to an outstanding year. For the quarter we met our top and bottom-line guidance driven by 18% revenue growth. Let me provide you with details of our financial performance starting with revenue.</p>
          <p>I'll discuss top line financial and business momentum points and then follow with revenue performance for each of the business units. Then I will review the rest of the income statement. All growth comparisons are related to comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified.</p>
          <p>Revenue grew 18% to $15.8 billion with every business growing in the mid-teens or higher. Our annuity sales mix which is approximately 40% of our billing revenue, continued to grow on both a year-over-year and sequential basis with enterprise agreement renewal rates in line with historical trends.</p>
          <p>The remainder of our product billing for the quarter was approximately 25% from OEMs, around 15% from license-only sales and the balance from our other businesses. Our unearned revenue grew 21% to $15.3 billion over $600 million above our high end guidance.</p>
          <p>Our contracted not-billed balance increased both sequentially and year-over-year to over $13 billion about $3 billion above when we started the fiscal year. When taken together with reported revenue, total bookings for the company grew 23% driven by over 20% bookings growth for our core businesses of Server and Tools, Client and the Microsoft Business Division. Overall, changes in foreign exchange rates added about 4 percentage points to our revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment starting with Client and its biggest driver the PC market. We estimate that the PC unit growth rate for the quarter returned to the 12% to 14% range that we experienced in the first half of the fiscal year. This is about the three points above our forecast due to improvement in the mature markets including in the United States. This helped to drive Client revenue growth of 15% to $4.4 billion which was over $150 million above our high-end guidance.</p>
          <p>During the quarter our OEM license units increased by 22%, about nine points faster than the overall hardware market. OEM unit growth outpaced that of the PC market primarily driven by a couple of factors. One our OEM partners always have channel fluctuations with this quarter we estimate were a combination of replenishing the channel from lower Q3 levels as well as buying ahead some pricing tiers during the quarter.</p>
          <p>And two we returned to the trend of making gains on piracy including in Asia.</p>
          <p>OEM revenue increased by 13%, the difference between OEM revenue and unit growth is due to three trends which you are already well familiar. One volumes mix shift towards emerging markets, which generally have lower ASPs.</p>
          <p>Two channel mix shift towards large OEMs with volume pricing and three premium mix shift towards consumer premium offerings. Specifically, while business and consumer premium units were up year-on-year, and the overall OEM premium mix remained unchanged from the prior year at 72%, the premium mix composition shifted down four points of business premium and up four points of consumer premium.</p>
          <p>The remaining roughly 20% of Client revenue comes from commercial and retail licensing. This portion of the business grew over 20%, driven by continued strength in Client annuity licensing, as business customers continue to demand our enterprise offerings, including those that help them more efficiently manage their desktop infrastructure.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we surpassed the 180 million mark for Windows Vista licenses sold today. And Windows Vista has driven client revenue to an average growth rate of 16% since it became generally available.</p>
          <p>Moving to Server and Tools, revenue was $3.7 billion, growing an outstanding 21%, on top of the string of Q4 double digit growth quarters and this quarter marks the groups 24th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Next for annuity contacts covering our Sever and Tools offering continued during the quarter driving Sever and Tools unearned revenue increase 37% since the beginning of the year. This customer commitment to annuity contacts demonstrates the increasingly critical role our sever products perform in information technology infrastructure as well as an increasing interest in the value offered in our long term product roadmap.</p>
          <p>The demand for our consulting and support services remains strong, driving associated revenue growth up 30%.</p>
          <p>On the product front during the quarter, we released our eagerly anticipated virtualization feature, Hyper-V, two months ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>We also made significant progress on SQL Server 2008, which is targeted for release during this, the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Online Services business grew revenue 24% to $838 million. Online advertising grew 18% including $33 million of ad revenue from aQuantive.</p>
          <p>While both search queries and page views were up and inline with expectation, monetization lagged driven by tightening advertising budgets combined with a more competitive display pricing environment.</p>
          <p>We continue to attract users to our properties with Live IDs hitting 460 million up 80 million from last year and we grew the number of advertisers utilizing our advertising platform by 28% during the year.</p>
          <p>We closed the acquisitions of Farecast which offers technology to aid in the purchase of online tickets at the lowest price, and Navic Networks, which develops tools to deliver target ads to television set top boxes.</p>
          <p>In May, we announced the Beta launch of Live Search Cashback. Since then we have 680 merchants participating in the program with about 200,000 registered users.</p>
          <p>Microsoft Business Division revenue was up 14%, to $5.3 billion. The business element of MBD revenue grew almost $700 million or 19% on both strong enterprise agreement signings and license only sales.</p>
          <p>Consumer revenues declined $66 million down 7%. This reflects both a difficult comparison to last year's quarter following the Office 2007 launch, and a continuation of a shift towards our lower priced consumer SKUs.</p>
          <p>Our emerging business product momentum continues with SharePoint revenue up over 30% and Unified Communications revenue up over 20%.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Fast Search and Transfer expanding our spectrum of enterprise search solutions for customers. Our Dynamics business also had a good business with customer billing growth of 22% and two product releases: DynamicsAX2009 and DynamicsCRMOnline. DynamicsCRM continues to deliver the function of flexibility customers want, evidenced by over 120,000 CRM seats being sold in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Entertainment and Devices Division grew revenues 37% to $1.6 billion. We sold 1.3 million Xbox 360 consoles representing 88% growth over the prior year and passing the milestone of 20 million consoles sold life to date. In May we announced that Xbox 5 reached 12 million members roughly doubling in membership for each of the last two years.</p>
          <p>Software attach rates continued to lead the industry at 7.7 software titles per console. As it was evident at E3 earlier this week the Interactive Entertainment business was extremely busy during the quarter featuring industry leading media content providers such as NetFlix, NBC, Universal, Constantine, MGM International, as well as developing innovative new gaming and social experiences that will continue to expand our audiences.</p>
          <p>The mobility business within the Entertainment and Devices Division completed the acquisition of Danger and released System Center Mobile Devices Manager 2008, which has created the opportunity for our sales force to partner with customers' IT departments helping them manage their mobile device assets and capabilities similar to those already used to manage PCs. And Microsoft Surface moved into early commercial deployment in AT&amp;T stores and in Harrah's Rio Casino.</p>
          <p>Now for the rest of the income statement, adjusting last year for the impact of the $1.1 billion charge related to the expansion of the Xbox 360 warranty policy, cost of revenue as a percent of sales increased 1 point to 18% driven by increasing Xbox 360 console sales, costs associated with the growth of our consulting and support services as well as data center, equipment and online content expenses in our online services business.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased $1.1 billion or 19% driven primarily by head count related costs, acquisition related expenses, and marketing related expenses. Expenses came in $500 million higher than our guidance, split rather evenly between cost of revenue and operating expenses.</p>
          <p>First cost of revenue, we sold more Xbox 360 consoles than our guidance had reflected. In Server and Tools the higher revenue growth in our consulting and support services carried higher associated costs than does software revenue. In our online service business we were able to bring servers in our data centers online faster than expected and we invested in premium online content which has higher creative and agency expense associated with it.</p>
          <p>Moving on to operating expenses, we took advantage of the economic environment out there to attract top talents to the company, yielding higher close rates in selling head count openings. Also across a number of our businesses, we spent more in product development in efforts to ready marketing campaigns and foreign currency rates presented some headwinds.</p>
          <p>Operating income was $5.7 billion up 42% or 13% after adjusting for the impact of warranty related charge in the year ago period.</p>
          <p>Investment income and other totaled $284 million as the Microsoft Treasury team continues to successfully navigate a challenging capital markets environment.</p>
          <p>Our expected tax rate for the quarter was 28% a couple of points lower than expected driven by an earnings mix increase in lower tax jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we repurchased 171 million shares or almost $5 billion of company stock and paid out about $1 billion in dividends to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Diluted shares outstanding were 9.4 billion, down 3% from the prior year as a result of share repurchases. Earnings per share were $0.46 in line with our guidance and growing 48% or 18% after adjusting for the warranty related charge in the prior year. So in summary we had our fastest growing fourth quarter revenues since 1999 adjusted for the year-ago Xbox warranty charge, operating income and EPS grew 13 and 18% respectively.</p>
          <p>With that let me turn it back to Chris who'll provide you with our first quarter and full year guidance for fiscal 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Colleen. I am going to spend my remaining time on the call talking about what we see coming for the full year and for the first quarter. Let me begin by outlining some of our key assumptions around the economy and general demand in the industry. The forecast generally assumes a continuation of the economic conditions and demand we experienced in the fourth quarter to continue into the first half of fiscal year '09, with some improvement over the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>We expect PC unit demand to remain healthy with growth rates similar to those in 2008. Specifically, we expect PC units growth for fiscal 2009 to be 12 to 14% for the year, but between 10 to 12% for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We estimate that growth rates will continue to be driven by roughly 20% growth in emerging markets with high single digit growths in mature markets.</p>
          <p>Now let me go through our detailed guidance. For the full year, we expect our revenue to come in between 67.3 to $68.1 billion growing 11 to 13%. For the first quarter we expect revenue of 14.7 to 14.9 billion, which represents an increase of 7 to 8%.</p>
          <p>With that revenue guidance by business groups is as follows. For Client we expect full year growth to be 9 to 10% and Q1 growth to be 6 to 7%. The PC market growth will outpace that of Client revenue because of the continuation of the underlying PC market dynamics, namely the emerging market PC growth outpacing mature markets, consumer growth exceeding business growth and the shift in the system builder channel to large OEMs.</p>
          <p>Server and Tools revenue should be up 18 to 19% for the year, and 19 to 20% for the first quarter. Coming off another impressive year of growth in fiscal year '08 the Server and Tools business is expected to continue to show double digit growth across the breadth of our server platform products and services driven by strong customer demand, with a recently refreshed Window Server and Visual Studio offerings, and the soon to be available SQL Sever 2008.</p>
          <p>We forecast revenue in the online Services business to increase 18 to 20% for the year and 7 to 11% for first quarter. The advertising component of revenue is expected to grow at approximately 25% for the year and 13% for quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Q1 guidance assumes a continuation of the challenging advertise -- online advertising market experienced in the fourth quarter. We expect revenue growth to accelerate through the year as we begin seeing revenue returns from the additional investments we're making in the business.</p>
          <p>Microsoft Business Division revenue should be up 14 to 15% for the year and 15 to 16% in the first quarter. We should continue to see business demand for Microsoft Office 2007, SharePoint and Dynamics products.</p>
          <p>Combined with growth in our emerging Unified Communications Business Intelligence offering, this will drive another year of very strong growth.</p>
          <p>Fiscal 2009 also represents an important year in delivering on our software as a service strategy, with the upcoming releases of Exchange Online, SharePoint Online and Office Communications Online later this calendar year.</p>
          <p>The Entertainment and Devices Division, we expect revenue to be down 4% to flat for full year and down 23 to 26% in Q1. The strong customer demand for Halo 3 following its launch in fiscal 2008 makes a challenging year-over-year comparison in the Entertainment and Devices Division but having said that, we remain committed to a profitable performance in fiscal year '09.</p>
          <p>Turning back to company wide performance, operating income for the year is expected to be between 26.3 and $26.9 billion, increasing 17 to 20% <mark type="inaudible" /> and excluding certain tax and legal charges for fiscal 2008.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter we expect operating income to be between 5.9 and $6 billion. Q1 operating income includes the impacts of increased spending associated with our Online Services business, costs associated with a number of new acquisitions, and investments in our new Windows consumer marketing campaign.</p>
          <p>I'd like to address the overall impact -- overall of level of -- the impact of the overall level of spend on the company margin. To do so, as I've talked to you before, we need to look at the three individual parts of the company that have distinct margin structures.</p>
          <p>The core businesses of Client, Server and Tools and Microsoft Business Division collectively will have an operating margin in fiscal 2009, that's essentially flat. This performance is obviously very good, given that we're making a number of investments to drive the overall health of the business and absorbing a number of acquisitions we've made this year, and growing revenue in mid teens.</p>
          <p>The margin for Entertainment and Devices should also remain roughly the same year-on-year in fiscal year '09, even without a first party game release of Halo 3's magnitude.</p>
          <p>So taken together, businesses representing over 90% of our revenue will grow double digits next year, with the margin structure intact. Clearly the Online Services business has a totally different dynamic, and is in a period of significant investment. We did not make these investments lightly as the loss from this division will be a drag on an otherwise exceptionally good performance.</p>
          <p>However we believe that the additional investment of several hundreds of millions of dollars is worth the short-term costs given the opportunity to participate in a market where the opportunity is measured in the tens of billion of dollars.</p>
          <p>While on the call, I'll take a few minutes to frame our reasoning behind the additional Online Service business investment. I'll start with an overview of our broad strategy and then provide details into the additional investments.</p>
          <p>With the online ad spending expected to reach $80 billion by 2012, this area represents one of the largest growth opportunities for the company. We segment the market for online advertising in four distinct categories: search, advertising platforms, information content and communications and social networking.</p>
          <p>For Search, we're focused on driving query share improvements and business model innovation, specifically in the area of high value commercial search. Our recent release of Cashback is a good example of executing on our strategy which combines innovation and the shopping experience with a shift in the distribution of advertiser economics towards the end users.</p>
          <p>Additionally we'll also seek to win targets of distribution through OEMs, ISPs, ISVs and retailers. Our recently announced deal with HP in the U.S. is an example of this.</p>
          <p>Turning to the ad platform, our strategy can be summarized as consolidate, win and display and there we are focused on integrating our advertising assets into a single comprehensive system that can deliver our publishing partners industry leading yields and our advertisers optimal return on their ad spend.</p>
          <p>In the area of communication and social networking which includes our mail, messenger and social networking assets such as Spaces, we'll deliver the leading end-to-end experiences across the PC, phone and web.</p>
          <p>And finally in the category of information content we plan to invigorate our MSN portal experience with improvements in user experience, social, media consumption, and premium content.</p>
          <p>As well as our overall advertising revenue which is clearly the overall measure of success, we have a very aggressive growth targets in each of the above areas over the next five to ten years. These targets can be broken down in terms of the percentage of share of worldwide page views, percentage of share of internet vendors, the percentage share of search queries and percentage of the growth of online advertising dollars to pass through our platform.</p>
          <p>Clearly the Yahoo! transaction which I'll make some more comments on later would have accelerated our progress towards these goals. However during the quarter our transaction became increasingly unlikely. Further as you know during the quarter Yahoo! has signed a search outsourcing agreement with Google. Given that environment we made some decisions to accelerate our Online Services organic growth strategy.</p>
          <p>Mainly we decided to increase our investment in the high margin scalable areas of search and ad platform. So about two-thirds of the incremental spend that we're planning is related to investments to drive usage of our search offering. We're dialing up our search distribution initiatives with target OEM toolbar vault search deals, scaling search globally with investments in localized engineering and data centers, pursuing acquisitions and partnerships to build vertical content for that commercial strategy, accelerating the rollout of our Cashback program and creating marketing for the business to grow awareness and drive traffic.</p>
          <p>Second we are upping the investment in our ad platform aimed at increasing the number of advertisers and high quality inventory on that platform. Specifically these investments are in the area of accelerating the integration of our ad platform assets, expanding our sales and service capabilities, small acquisitions to enhance platform technology and investments in strategic partnerships to increase third party inventory available to advertisers on our ad platform.</p>
          <p>Returning to EPS our diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to coming $2.12, $2.18 representing growth of 13 to 17%, 2 to 4.5 in revenue.</p>
          <p>The put this performance in context as I mentioned at the front of the call, if we achieved the middle of our guidance we'll have increased earnings per share from $1.42 to $2.15 in two years an increase of 50%.</p>
          <p>But first quarter we expect earnings per share of $0.47 to $0.48 and these earnings assume an effective tax rate of 28%.</p>
          <p>From a balance sheet perspective we expect total unearned revenue to finish fiscal 2009 up 8% to 9%, contracted not billed should also finish 2009 up from current levels. When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from Q4 fiscal year '08 to Q1 fiscal year '09 we expect sequential decrease from Q4 to Q1 to exceed the rate of decline we experienced the last few years.</p>
          <p>As always when thinking about the guidance we provide you should also consider thee risks. These include competitors, legal, execution and general market risk, such as foreign exchange rate movements, fluctuations in PC and sever hardware growth rates, IT spending, changes in the piracy rate and customer acceptance of our new and existing products.</p>
          <p>Additionally, changes in the mix of our billings between annuity and license only can have an impact on revenue, operating income, and EPS by delaying revenue recognition into future periods.</p>
          <p>So in closing, the strong results of fiscal year '08 were the outcome of both business and engineering execution. In addition to the financial outperformance we delivered the final phase in our multi-year product refresh cycle with the availability of Windows Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008 and are well positioned to continue that momentum into fiscal 2009.</p>
          <p>The next fiscal year will be an important year, driving mass adoption across the portfolio of products. With our breadth of product and global diversification, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver double-digit revenue increases, even off our base of over $60 billion.</p>
          <p>And we will continue to use our strong cash flow to invest in our organic growth, inorganic growth through acquisitions, and in ourselves through buybacks.</p>
          <p>Before I hand the call back to Colleen, I wanted to take a moment to clarify the terms of our recent proposal for a search transaction with the Yahoo! Given the upcoming Yahoo! shareholder meeting, I won't be taking any questions on this topic in the Q&amp;A section that will follow this presentation and we won't be providing any additional comments on matters we've already discussed.</p>
          <p>With that let me outline you the key elements of our proposal. Firstly, we are providing significant revenue guarantees, Microsoft proposed a 10 year minimum revenue guarantee, totaling between 19.5 and $26.5 billion. For the first five years the guarantee is $2.3 billion per year. Thereafterwards both Yahoo! and Microsoft have the options to extend the agreement for an additional five year period.</p>
          <p>If Yahoo! unilaterally chooses to extend the agreement the guarantee would be for $1.6 billion per year after the extension. Conversely if Microsoft unilaterally chooses to extend the agreement, the guarantee to Yahoo! would be $3 billion per a year, after the extension.</p>
          <p>These guarantees are not conditional on Yahoo! search queries, rather the guarantees are tied to Yahoo!'s home page performance.</p>
          <p>Our proposal includes an 85% tax rate for the first three years of the agreement and 70% thereafter wards. Microsoft would pay Yahoo! $1 billion for its search assets, provide $2.8 billion of senior debt to Yahoo! on favorable terms and make a significant equity investment in Yahoo! through the purchase of $3.9 billion of Yahoo! stock at $19.50 per share, reflecting our view of the value of the company as a result of our proposed transaction and the distribution of cash and the Yahoo! Asian investments by Yahoo! to its stockholders.</p>
          <p>I should also note that Microsoft's proposal did not and does not include changes to Yahoo!'s governance. We truly continue to believe that our proposal is a compelling one.</p>
          <p>With that I'm going to hand the call back to Colleen, so we can get started taking your questions. And I clearly look forward to seeing a number of you at our financial analyst meeting, which is next Thursday. Thanks.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, just firstly could you give us a little bit of your overview on the macro environment and how that's changed when you think back to giving earnings three months ago?</p>
          <p>And then just on your cash flow, it came in a little weaker than we were anticipating. DSOs were up higher than we have seen in &#x2013; perhaps ever for Microsoft. Was there a collections issue, more back-end loading? And if you could perhaps talk to the weakness there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. Taking those in turn, in terms of the macro environment, it's broadly speaking the same as what we were expecting in April. Clearly people are getting concerned now about the length of softness here in the U.S. But as you have seen for revenue we have taken it up slightly for -- since April.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of the visibility into our products we're actually feeling very good about our position not only here in the U.S. but outside the U.S. I mentioned in my comments if you look at the company overall our sales in the U.S. in the year that we have just completed were up 15%.</p>
          <p>The company overall was up 18%. So clearly we grew faster outside the U.S. than we did inside the U.S. but if 15% given that it's been a difficult environment for a number of companies growing at 15% off our base was very good.</p>
          <p>So going into next year we are clearly cautious like everyone is about the impact of the environment but for our products overall we are feeling very good. I'd say the one proviso to that is in the online advertising space where we are seeing a direct impact. It was weak in the fourth quarter and I think you're seeing from results of other companies sort of weakness in that general space. So there is a direct impact and we are not immune to that in the online space and we'll probably see that continuing certainly for the next quarter. But overall in terms of our core business growth it feels very good.</p>
          <p>In terms of your other questions on cash flow the biggest thing in the cash flow that was probably a negative was the payment of the fine to the EU which was over $1 billion, $1.5 billion. So, that was clearly a big negative from a cash flow point of view. Other than that there really wasn't anything remarkable from a cash flow point of view. In fact, it was quite a strong quarter given the results overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on that DSO standpoint Q4 seasonally does tend to be a little higher than some of the other quarters, we do close a lot of business in our fiscal Q4 as the sales forces is out there, closing deals. But we didn't see anything unusual from a DSO standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But overall I'd say revenue growth of 18% last year, guiding to revenue growth of 11 to 13%. So you combine those and so it's a 30% broadly for the two years that cover what was hopefully the worst of the economic conditions. So we are feeling good about it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon, I was just wondering Chris if you could talk a little bit about the OSB business. Given how far behind you guys are, if you're unsuccessful in getting all or even a part of Yahoo!, can you walk us through how you are going to be able to compete with Google and also are we in a critical period here in this segment where if you continue to go down the path of going it alone that we are going to be seeing this accelerating spending from current levels so that it's going to adversely impact overall op margin. So we are actually not going to see op margin expand for the next few years? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sure, okay, overall clearly regardless of what happens with Yahoo! it's a space that we're committed to. I said that in the prepared remarks. And that's one that we are committed on a long-term basis.</p>
          <p>I would split the market as I did in my prepared remarks into four areas of which search is only one; ad platform, communication and social networking and information content being the other ones and clearly we have a very good position in information content and communications and an ad platform with the acquisition of aQuantive.</p>
          <p>So we feel very good about our relative position in those areas and a number of our investments are going into that. In the search area clearly that's the one we are, relatively speaking we are most behind and that's why we are taking a different approach which, again I mentioned in the prepared remarks where we focusing in particular on the areas of search where there is a strong commercial intent verticals like retail, travel, real estate, local.</p>
          <p>We are looking at different approaches where we might potentially take an innovative &#x2013; a disruptive and innovative business model for example Cashback and than looking at winning distribution deals. On the short term that isn't going to make the division profitable and I think clearly from our guidance that's not the case so as I said in the remarks. If you look at the operating margin structure of the company you really have to look at the three distinct businesses. We feel good about the margin structure for our core businesses in particular growing double-digit revenue. On Entertainment and Devices we're broadly flat but Online is negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, I totally get what you are saying. I guess the question that I am getting asked a lot, is how long are you going to spend? You are obviously performing well on the top line but you are spending the upside so that people aren't getting margin expansion. I guess the question that I am getting asked is how long should we expect that to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to make &#x2013; certainly on this call we're not going to give guidance for fiscal year '10 and '11. Some of these investments that we're making will be multi-year. So it will depend to a large extent on our revenue growth as to when that division becomes profitable. So it will need to continue to grow relatively substantially in order to cover the level of investments that we're making.</p>
          <p>But it is going to be and I think we've made this point on previous calls it is going to be an investment heavy area and in particular things like the ad platform where we see it converging to two natural players over time which we clearly would expect to be one and that's an area where spending in particular on infrastructure is likely to be high.</p>
          <p>So I can't promise you that you're going to a massive turnaround in the short-term and certainly fiscal year '09 which is the year ahead the year we're guiding to today. It is going to be a continuation of investment but again put it in the context of what we would describe as the overall opportunity and the size of our company overall.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Charlie Di Bona with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Chris. I'd like to circle back to the Q4 results and really particularly the margins here. I think the Xbox issue is fairly straightforward but in something like five of the last eight Q4s you guys have had an issue about being disappointing on margins and maybe you can give us some color and comfort on sort of what looks to be like a fairly persistent control issue in Q4. And in some cases it looks like you might be pulling some of the expenses forward. Are we going to see that in the fiscal '09 numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I always distinguish, Charlie, between the costs which were if you like, a function of the revenue, a function of decisions that we made and functions of unexpected low quality spend, if you like.</p>
          <p>But to give you some comfort, the areas that we spent more of in the fourth quarter were more anchored in the first two. For example on the revenue side we sold more Xboxes so we had more COGS. That's good news okay we don't make any money from those but overall in terms of long term health of the business, the more consoles we sell the better.</p>
          <p>In Server and Tools, the higher enterprise services revenue carries higher COGS with it. Again that's just a factor of it so the mix inside Server and Tools might not be as strong as you would like from a revenue point of view but that's just a natural consequence.</p>
          <p>In terms of decisions that we made, we have budgeted head count on people hired to the budgeted levels. That's a good thing in the sense that we actually hired people that we want to hire and we were particularly successful. I think that's a reflection to a large extent of the economic environment and the fact that if anything at the moment we are an even more attractive company than we have been to people. So, again that hits us from an expense point of view but I'd describe it in one of the categories of, it's a conscious decision to hire people.</p>
          <p>In terms of things that are outside our control, FX was a factor. FX has been our friend, pretty much throughout the year in terms of driving more revenue upside than more expense, net net it's been a positive because we have more revenue outside the U.S. than we do expenses.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, it was an unusual quarter, in that we hired a lot of people outside the U.S. and the mix of expenses were such that the FX impact was higher in OpEx than it was in revenue.</p>
          <p>If you look across the year, that's not the case, but in the quarter it was. So, I' m comfortable that there's not any lack of control over spending. Most of the decisions I talked about were either conscious ones that were a reflection of better revenue performance in certain areas.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great thanks, Charlie. Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thank you very much. Looks like stepping up investments in the Online Services business seems like the right thing to do. I am just curious, Chris, I would have expected that to be accompanied by an increase to the revenue guidance yet when I look back over the last 12 months if I exclude aQuantive, I still come up with much faster revenue growth in the Online Services Business.</p>
          <p>So my question is, is the return on these investments going to take more than one year sort of lag to show up in the financials? Or is there some conservatism in how you are budgeting for the revenue productivity as a result of these investments? Is there a longer lag to these OpEx investments?</p>
          <p>Also maybe three or four seconds of your thoughts on Client guidance. I know Colleen didn't want us to ask multiple part questions, but I couldn't resist this. The 6 to 7% growth absolute currency looks to be very low on the 2 to 3%. So I am just curious; what was the thought process that went into that guidance as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay sure Kash, you went blank through the start of your question so if I don't cover it exactly please come back to me; we missed just the first few words of your question.</p>
          <p>So in terms of Online spending is it likely to be more of a fiscal year 10 impact on revenue balances? Yes and that's not only because of the nature of some of the investments that we are making things like marketing Cashback; that's going to take time in terms seeing the real impact from that.</p>
          <p>But also just because as I mentioned in I think Sarah's question, the online advertising area is probably the part of the business certainly in the short term which we think is most challenging. From a economic environment point of view we have actually done remarkably well in our commercial businesses and overall for PCs, getting through difficult and choppy economic waters. The online advertising area is very difficult at the moment, I think that's across the board, that's not just not us.</p>
          <p>So I don't want to promise, you know we might see benefits for example in share, but I'm not sure that share is necessarily is best displayed in the search area, again it translates,  certainly in the first six months, and possibly across the year to significant revenue growth, but I think you could expect to see us make progress in the year as I talked about, which is the underlying dynamics, the driver: percentage minutes, percentage share et cetera.</p>
          <p>That's really how we're going to have to measure ourselves over the next year, I think the second half of you're question was Client specific, is that right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the 6 to 7% yes that is relatively light. To some extent it's because of the very high, strong quarter one that we had last year. You recall we had a very strong quarter one piracy performance in last year. It's also part of the strong Q4 performance in this year which Colleen mentioned in the prepared remarks was from channel inventory. There was a very strong unit growth in quarter four of fiscal year '08 some of that was because of a weak Q3. You recall our Q3 call we talked about some of the inventory issues there and that was one of the reasons why Q3 of last year was weak.</p>
          <p>So, like a bit of borrowing from Q3 into Q4 and also we think a little bit of a &#x2013; some of our customers may have bought forward from Q1 into Q4 as well. That's one of the reasons. The other is we have got 10 to 12% PC unit growth expectations which relative to the year of 12 to 14 we are just seeing that quarter as being one of the low points. So, you combine all of those factors and we think that's going to be the lowest revenue growth quarter for Client in the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from Brent Thill with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Chris the overall buyback for '08 was more than cut in half from '07 obviously that's understandable considering the acquisition strategy but I guess as it relates to the overall plan you only have 3 billion left on the current $36 billion plan. How aggressive at 25 and change will you be with the stock here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Going backwards and then go forwards. Backwards: yes you are right it was lower than the previous year. One of the reasons for that is we were getting to down to a level of cash that we feel more comfortable with so there was some accelerated buying in the previous year.</p>
          <p>The other impact was we concluded the aQuantive acquisition which was relatively expensive this year and last factor is when announced the Yahoo! acquisition earlier this year we went out of the market but from a sensitivity point of view and clearly at that stage we were envisaging having to use a large part of our cash flow for the acquisition. Subsequent to May when it was clear that the overall transaction wasn't going to happen we went back into the market and we're looking at buying at levels that are more like historic levels. So those are the reasons why we've been less in the year. It was $5 billion I believe for the quarter. So it was a reasonably strong buyback quarter.</p>
          <p>Clearly at these prices it's incredibly attractive from a buyback perspective. I can't tell you as I never do on a quarter-by-quarter basis exactly how much we will buy back. You're right that we only have about $3 billion worth of our buyback left. That's good news in the sense that I think we have ourselves until 2012 to complete it. So we'll complete it a little ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>What we do here is we complete the current buyback then we go back to the Board for authorization of any subsequent buyback and that will be exactly the process that we do here and if and when we get authorization from the Board to do to the buyback we clearly announce the amount at that stage. But certainly wouldn't announce exactly the shape of what we do. But clearly the value of the company relative to the last three years is as good as it's been.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon I have a question about Office and MBD obviously Office 2007 has been a terrific product cycle. But MBD has been a little bit light relative to guidance for the last couple of quarters could you maybe talk about where you think we are in the Office 2007 cycle and what gives you confidence that we'll see a reacceleration of growth in MBD next year versus what we saw in the back half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well overall obviously the MBD division did extremely well last year so put that in context but you are right in the sense that Office was slightly lighter than we might have thought mainly to be honest in the consumer area and that's around lower price SKUs in retail. So we're seeing more of a bias in the volumes that we have been seeing . The volumes are very good and business sales are very good. But the volumes in the retail side tend to be more in the lower price SKUs. So that's having an impact overall but the overall volume and the overall adoption and reaction to Office 2007 has been extremely good so we feel good and put it inside a business group which grew at 15 to 20% last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as we look at it next year should we be thinking about Dynamics and SharePoint being the key drivers or should we expect Office to reaccelerate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think those emerging products are certainly going to make a big difference we're guiding 14 to 15%, that's very good. I mean Office is unlikely to grow at 14 to 15%. It's likely to grow at more like a high to single digits. But the other parts of the business will grow extremely well and they're going to average up to 14 to 15.</p>
          <p>So you have got SharePoint, Office Communications, some of the online services that we are bringing in will start to have an impact. Overall, because that's now our biggest division in terms of revenue, 14 to 15% looks very good.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Chris, just looking at the 500 million in expenses that you are talking about, how should we think about that trending through the year? And then depending on any outcome from an acquisition perspective would you look to accelerate that investment or decelerate that investment? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it has fairly different dynamics. In terms of the consumer marketing that is probably going to be front loaded in the year. And one of the reasons for first quarter being relatively light compared to the other quarters would be some of the marketing spend that we see in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of some of the online spending that's probably going to be more progressive through the year. In terms of acquisitions, that's really going to be opportunistic we closed a lot in the fourth quarter and one of the things that is impacting our results is clearly the amount of non-cash amortization associated with acquisitions and that was relatively substantial last year, it was over $300 million.</p>
          <p>We don't pull that out as some companies do and take the benefit of adjusting our results to reflect that. We take that fully through the P&amp;L and next year in terms of the guidance we've given you we expect it to be more than $300 million.</p>
          <p>How much more and exactly the shape will depend on acquisitions. We have an expectation of it that we build in but it will grow progressively through the year. It's all non-cash but we'll continue to take the full impact through the P&amp;L.</p>

          <p>Yes, thanks very much. Chris you talked in the guidance just on Entertainment and Devices about maintaining profitability, given that there is no sort of new cycle, the hardware this year, is there any reason why profitability shouldn't start to trend up as attach rates get better? Is there anything going on in that business that's going to require say more advertising dollars or spending in that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>One of the impacts obviously is, we've dropped prices during the course of last year. So year-on-year we have slightly different, difficult price comparisons, the other thing is there more than just Xbox just sitting in there, there is obviously Windows Mobile which has got a lot of opportunities.</p>
          <p>So there are other areas that we will be spending on. We aren't in the context of today giving any guidance on profitability, my comment was simply that it will remain with a sustainable profitability, but we are not saying whether that's going to be significantly up or down from where it was last year.</p>
