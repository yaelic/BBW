          <p>Good morning, this is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the UBS First Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to UBS, thank you.</p>

          <p>Good morning and welcome to the presentation of our first quarter results. You should be aware that there are forward-looking statements in this presentation and our actual results may differ materially. Additional information can be found in our first quarter report and elsewhere. Please take a moment to read the disclaimer on this slide. We look forward to answering your questions at the end of the presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Tom. As we pre-announced on 1st of April, we are presenting today a quarterly loss of 11.5 billion Swiss francs. Marco Suter, our CFO, will walk you in more detail through the composition of this result, including a summary of all the risk positions.</p>
          <p>In my introductory remarks, I would like to primarily focus on all the actions we have taken in the first quarter to deal with the crisis, reducing risk, reducing balance sheet, managing costs, and strengthening the capital. Secondly, I would like to make a few comments on how we are prospectively going to manage costs and what earnings power we expect from our businesses. Thirdly, I would also like to make a few comments on our short-term priorities.</p>
          <p>Let me begin with what actions we took in Q1. As you are aware, we recently published a report outlining the mistakes we made which led to the current poor performance of UBS. I will not summarize that report as you have already heard my views on this at the last set of results. But what I do want to highlight are the steps we are taking to ensure we grow sustainable earnings in our businesses and do not repeat the mistakes we have made in the past.</p>
          <p>The first step, and one that has been in progress since last summer, is reduction in our balance sheet. We choose to spend a substantial amount of money, approximately 1 billion Swiss francs throughout the quarter in balance sheet and risk reduction. We achieved a reduction of our tradable asset inventory of approximately 160 billion Swiss francs. This accelerated reduction was and is critical to transition the business and the balance sheet as rapidly as possible into a position commensurate with our long-term priorities.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with the progress we have achieved in this regard as this was a key driver to even exceed our expected Tier 1 ratio and to bring it, post the rights issue, to 11.8%. Since year end, we have secured additional equity funding of 28 billion Swiss francs and issued &#x20AC;1 billion of hybrid capital. Taking into account the rights issue, we are back to being one of the best capitalized banks in the world.</p>
          <p>Risk and balance sheet reduction remains a critical part of our ongoing financial restructuring. Since Q3 2007, we have significantly reduced our total balance sheet size, risk weighted assets and our legacy positions. In fact, excluding the effect of positive replacement value growth, we have reduced the balance sheet by approximately 550 billion Swiss francs since June 2007. Marco will provide you with more details.</p>
          <p>We are committed to continue to take down the level of risk and expect to reduce our balance sheet to bring it in line with our long-term plans. We continue to manage remaining legacy risks in a flexible and creative way in the best interests of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on reducing our risk positions; Marco will take you through the numbers in detail. But over the course of the quarter, we have reduced positions in our most important risk categories by approximately 40% through a combination of further markdowns and sales.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we also isolated a significant portion of our real estate related risk positions and created a work-out group to manage these positions. In addition, we are creating a special purpose vehicle where a further subset of these assets will be managed and our intention is to reduce our exposure to this entity over time in a way that reduces the effect of distressed market conditions on the core earnings of UBS and provides the greatest opportunity for shareholders to realize value over time.</p>
          <p>You might have seen some reports about our work-out activity. We are pleased to confirm that we have an agreement in principle to sell 15 billion in market value of U.S. real estate related assets to a newly created distressed asset fund managed by BlackRock. We have reduced costs in all recurring categories, whilst we benefited from favorable currency developments, we are on a clear trajectory to reduce our run rates across the board.</p>
          <p>The combination of risk reduction, strategic change, and capital raising leaves UBS with strong capital and clear path towards sustained earnings growth for the group. Although we have made good progress in Q1, we still have much work to do to restore the profitability, prospect, and the reputation of UBS.</p>
          <p>How do we focus on efficiency? Our focus on efficiency is on three fronts; reduction in head count, reduction in general and admin costs, and the optimization of operating leverage. Cost control has a high priority in 2008. Considering the difficult market environment, UBS has strengthened its measures to reduce costs and increase efficiency. Recurring G&amp;A expenses fell by 20%, personnel expenses fell by 16%; we will continue to manage these costs aggressively.</p>
          <p>In order to resize the group, we are today announcing additional head count reductions. The Investment Bank will eliminate 2,600 positions. These are in addition to the previously announced 1,500 reduction which is now complete. This will represent a reduction of 18% from the peak level in the third quarter 2007. These additional reductions will primarily fall in the U.S. and the U.K.</p>
          <p>In the other business groups, we will achieve planned reductions for the most part through natural attrition. We estimate that by mid-2009, around June 2009, total group head count will be reduced by approximately 5,500 people from the end of March 2008 and this includes the 2,600 redundancy from the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>We want to continue to grow our business and we will therefore add staff to our front office, primarily through hiring financial advisers and client advisers in Wealth Management. We target our cost run rate for the group to be at approximately 28 billion Swiss francs in 2009, or down more than 10% from current levels.</p>
          <p>Let me make some comments with respect to the long-term profitability and shareholder value. I already mentioned at our AGM that our integrated firm will only work well if all its individual parts create shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Our Investment Bank is making rapid progress in its repositioning. After the capacity reduction, we target that it has an inherent capacity to generate approximately four billion Swiss francs pre-tax contribution in a normalized environment. We will continue to invest in our front office in Wealth Management. Due to our significant investment in domestic platforms all over the world, we will now be able to continuously increase operational leverage.</p>
          <p>We will complete the rebuild of some investment management capabilities in global asset management, to rapidly return to net new money growth. It is still one of the most efficient and profitable platforms in the industry.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter we will continue to clean up the balance sheet and rebuild the Investment Banking business. We will continue to spend money in risk reduction and close out of legacy position. If our own credit spread continues to tighten, not unexpected given the increased capital strength and all the actions we have taken, we will of course see a reversal of the own credit adjustment, which we have disclosed separately for the same reason. Conversely, if monoline spreads keep going up they will automatically drive an increase in credit valuation adjustments.</p>
          <p>With these comments on some short-term drivers, I would like to hand over to Marco Suter to guide us in more detail through the Q1 results.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcel. Good morning. Before I take you through the results for the quarter, I would like to highlight the number of changes in our published report.</p>
          <p>First, we have adopted the amended IFRS 2 standard which affects how we account for share-based compensation payments, including share option schemes. The amended standard better aligns the recognition of compensation expense with the performance year. This allows us to recognize most of the cost of share-based payments in the year for which they are awarded.</p>
          <p>Previously these costs were mainly amortized over the resting period. We are presenting results today on a like-for-like basis, having adjusted prior year numbers to reflect the new standard. Second, in terms of presentation we are no longer using the adjusted expected credit loss concepts and instead are now showing actual credit expense or recoveries in the respective business groups.</p>
          <p>Next, we longer show Industrial Holdings as a separate reporting unit. As we have exited the vast majority of our private equity investments, it really is more appropriate to report what is left of Industrial Holdings within the Corporate Center.</p>
          <p>In the Investment Bank you will see that we have altered the way we report revenues. This presentation is more in line with how we internally look at these business activities, and it is also more comparable to how our peer group reports.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have implemented Basel II, plus the new framework for attributing equity capital to the business groups within UBS. In our Business Group results, we have started to report return on BIS risk-weighted assets as well as return on attributed equity on this new basis. I will come back to the new equity attribution framework later.</p>
          <p>When we announced the 15 billion rights issue on April 1st, we also provided you with a preliminary estimate as to where we believe our Q1 results would be. This slide shows the key financial figures for the quarter and compares them to the estimates used in our preannouncement. Overall, the net loss attributable to UBS shareholder amounts to 11.5 billion, in line with the approximately 12 billion loss we announced on April 1st. The results for the Business Groups as you can see were also broadly in line with our earlier estimates.</p>
          <p>Compared with the preannouncement however, we can report significantly better pro forma Tier 1 and total capital ratios. The pro forma ratios are calculated on the basis of our risk-weighted assets as per March 31st. Its regulatory capital is adjusted for the 15 billion Swiss francs rights issue and now also for the &#x20AC;1 billion of hybrid Tier 1 issue which we have completed in early April.</p>
          <p>On this basis, the pro forma Tier 1 ratio now stands at 11.8% and the total capital ratio at 15.6%. This positive development has three causes. First, the overall results came in slightly better than expected. Second, our risk-weighted assets were lower than expected; and third, we have issued during April a &#x20AC;1 billion hybrid which qualifies as Tier 1 capital.</p>
          <p>The overall results for our Wealth Management businesses were affected by sharp declines in world markets, with the MSCI World Index for example, declining by 10% of a quarter in dollar terms. Currency movements, in particular the 12% weakening of the U.S. dollar over the quarter had a negativity effect on our invested assets base measured in Swiss francs. Note that 56% of invested assets in Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking are denominated in U.S. dollars. This led to lower fee based income.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring income also declined as clients reduced activity in falling markets. These factors combined led to total revenues declining by 7% quarter-on-quarter and 2% year-on-year. We have tightly managed costs in these businesses, but our flexibility on a quarter-to-quarter basis is limited. So efficiency gains tend to lack sharp marketing currency movements, pushing the cost to income ratio up during this quarter.</p>
          <p>Compared with the first quarter '07 however, the cost income ratio has slightly improved. Costs declined by 4% from the prior quarter reflecting a slight reduction in personnel expense as well as broad based savings in general and administrative costs. As a result, pre-tax profit in Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking at almost 2.2 billion Swiss francs was down 13% quarter-on-quarter and 2% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Invested assets in Wealth Management International &amp; Switzerland declined by 12% from the prior quarter. 7% of the decline in assets was due to currency, and the remaining 5% reflects market performance. Revenues declined at a slower pace. They were down 7% quarter-on-quarter and 1% year-on-year, reflecting reduced recurring revenues on lower asset levels as well as lower client trading activity in choppy markets.</p>
          <p>Costs were down 1% in the prior quarter. The lower performance based compensation expense was partly offset by increased personnel costs resulting from the hiring of over 240 new client advisers. Costs year-on-year are up 4%. Here you need to take into consideration that over the one year period, our employee base in this business has increased by almost 2,000 people, or by 14%. Pre-tax profit for the quarter at 1.4 billion Swiss francs was down 13% quarter-on-quarter and 5% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Revenues in Business Banking Switzerland declined by 5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to low interest income, with some of the decline reflecting lower interest earned on lower equity attributed under our new framework, and some due to higher interest expense.</p>
          <p>Costs declined by 1% from the prior quarter, thanks to an 8% reduction in G&amp;A expense. These costs reductions more than compensated the 4% increase in personnel expense following the annual salary review process in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>Business Banking pre-tax profit at 540 million was down 10% quarter-on-quarter, but up 2% year-on-year. Wealth Management U.S. pre-tax profit on a quarter-on-quarter basis declined by 2% in U.S. dollar terms. This reflects flat revenues in local currency terms, a commendable result in current market conditions, and a slight increase in the cost base on increased head count.</p>
          <p>In Swiss franc terms, however, operating income was down 9% compared to the fourth quarter, and the pre-tax profit declined 12% to 183 million Swiss francs. Despite the slight setback during this quarter, the cost/income ratio for this business has improved by 2.4 percentage points year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Asset Management, pre-tax profit declined by 32% from the prior quarter primarily due to declining performance fees from alternative and quantitative investments and from our Brazilian business. Revenues were also impacted by lower recurring fees on lower invested assets. Revenues were down 27% compared with the prior quarter. Costs declined by 22%, driven by a decrease in both personnel and general and administrative expense.</p>
          <p>Performance in our Investment Bank has deteriorated during the first quarter. Investment banking revenues fell 58% from the first quarter '07 due to a contraction in global fee volume. Advisory revenues decreased in line with the industry trend of a decline in mandated deals.</p>
          <p>Capital market revenues were impacted by reduced market volumes in all regions. Equities also posted lower revenues in difficult trading conditions, with continued market volatility and limited market liquidity.</p>
          <p>As to fixed income, currencies and commodities, I will discuss the losses and mark downs in a moment. Given this environment, we have worked hard to manage the costs in the business, and we have reduced expense by 19% quarter-on-quarter and 27% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management International &amp; Switzerland reported positive net new money of 2.5 billion Swiss francs, and Wealth Management U.S. contributed 3.1 billion resulting in an overall inflow of 5.6 billion for the Wealth Management businesses. The regional analysis of the net new money flows clearly shows that we have most effective in Switzerland. Here we have experienced outflows during the quarter. This was also evidenced in Business Banking Switzerland, which has experienced a net outflow of 1.9 billion francs during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Outflows in Asset Management were 16.5 billion in the quarter. Institutional business had outflows of 9.6, which were lower than the previous quarter's outflows of 15.3 billion. In the Wholesale business, outflows in the quarter were 6.9 billion compared with only 0.9 billion in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, we believe that three factors contributed to our net new money performance during this quarter. First, personal wealth creation during the quarter was impacted by a decline in what we call liquidity events. These include initial public offerings and M&amp;A activity of privately owned companies.</p>
          <p>Second, our asset management business continues to see outflows in some of the more traditional investment styles. Part of these outflows are clearly of our own making because of underperformance in a number of investments styles, but part can be explained by the industry-wide move towards passive investments at the expense of more traditional investment classes. There was also a more general hesitancy to invest in mutual funds at this time of greater market uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Third, the outflows we have experienced in Switzerland, and reduced levels of inflows experienced elsewhere are, no doubt, also a reflection of the reputational damage that we have sustained over recent months. The capital increase will certainly help in this regard, but we remain cautious as to the near-term net new money outlook.</p>
          <p>In terms of immediate profit and loss impact, however, the net new money performance is of lesser significance. In this regard, the more important drivers are the development of the U.S. dollar and market performance.  And we were pleased to see that in April have seen some positive development in this regard. The U.S. dollar was up approximately 4.5% and the MSCI Index was up approximately 5% in dollar terms and 10% in Swiss franc terms.</p>
          <p>Invested assets declined by 13% to 2.8 trillion. As you can see, currency and market movements made up the majority of the declines. Net new money outflows were offset by assets acquired through the acquisition of the French asset manager, Caisse Centrale de R&#xE9;escompte. As I've said before, in April we have seen a small recovery of the dollar and the MSCI Index. This helps our invested asset base.</p>
          <p>Total operating expense for the Group declined by 12% compared with the prior quarter. The lion's share of this reduction was in personnel costs, which declined by over 16%, or over 1 billion Swiss francs. 926 million of this reduction came from the Investment Bank, a quarter-on-quarter decline of 31%. This is mainly a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling and the one-time credit of approximately 280 million resulting from the reversal of accruals in the fourth quarter '07 following the decline of the U.S. dollar and the share price.</p>
          <p>The reduction of head count also contributed to the decline. The IB personnel costs for the first quarter include the restructuring provision of $175 million for the additional head count reduction program, which we have announced today.</p>
          <p>On first sight, it would appear that we have made little progress in managing our general and administrative expense; this is clearly not the case. Absent an increase of over 400 million in legal costs and provisions, G&amp;A costs are down 20% quarter-on-quarter. I will come back to this in a minute.</p>
          <p>Total head count in the Group has increased by 279 people and now stands at 83,839. As you can see, we have continued to invest into our asset cargoeing businesses. In Wealth Management International and Switzerland, we have grown our employee base by 346, and the number of client advisers has grown by 243. Personnel turnover has not increased.</p>
          <p>In Global Asset Management, of the increase of 276, 165 are in relation to our acquisition in France. The other increases relate to growth areas, such as fund services, real estate and the Brazilian Asset Management business. The Corporate Center head count increase reflects continued hiring into our Indian offshoring operation.</p>
          <p>The Investment Bank shows a net reduction of 612 people. This reduction, plus the over 900 already achieved during the fourth quarter '07, completes the 1,500 job reduction program announced in October last year. Today's announcement of 2,600 further job cuts brings a total cut in the Investment Bank to over 4,000.</p>
          <p>I mentioned before that we have been successful in reducing G&amp;A expense during the quarter, despite the fact that the overall number has only come down slightly from the previous quarter. As you can see from this waterfall diagram, all core controllable expense categories within G&amp;A continue to have a downward trend. Declines were experienced in most categories, and cost reductions were spread across all businesses. Absent the increase in legal costs as mentioned earlier, and these tend to be very lumpy in nature, G&amp;A would have declined 20% from the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Before discussing our balance sheet and capital development during the quarter, we'd like to spend a moment to discuss our new equity attribution framework. This new framework reflects our objective of maintaining a strong capital base and to guide businesses towards activities with the best balance between profit potential and capital usage.</p>
          <p>Previously, we reported return on allocated regulatory capital. Allocated regulatory capital was determined in an entirely formulaic way, and was calculated as 10% of risk weighted assets plus 100% of goodwill and excess intangibles. The new framework is less formulaic and involves more senior management judgment and involvement as to the appropriate level of equity required to underpin our various businesses.</p>
          <p>To begin, goodwill and intangibles are attributed to each business on a one-for-one basis. With regard to attribution of tangible equity, the Group Executive Board considered a variety of observable inputs. First, we review the results of our internal risk-based capital model. Second, we review regulatory capital requirements, which are based on risk weighted asset usage, and also take into account differences in the Tier 1 ratio seen as appropriate for different businesses. Third we consider the balance sheet consumption of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Based on the review of these quantitative inputs, the Group Executive Board determines the final equity attribution to the business groups. Any difference between the amount of equity attributed to the business groups and the total equity available is shown as a surplus or shortfall in the Corporate Center. We believe that senior management involvement and judgment is superior to a purely formulaic approach, and it emphasizes that focus on risk-adjusted profitability and free cash flow generation is a high priority at UBS.</p>
          <p>Marcel has already highlighted that our program to shrink our balance sheet has delivered. Absent an increase of almost 150 billion in positive replacement values, which was matched by a corresponding increase on the liability side, our balance sheet would have reduced by almost 200 billion during the quarter. This balance sheet reduction, shown as the blue line on this chart, has also led to reduced risk weighted assets, which is illustrated by the bar graph.</p>
          <p>From the bar chart, you can also see that the introduction of Basel II has resulted in a lower level of risk weighted assets for Global Wealth Management and Business Banking, and an increased level of risk weighted assets for the Investment Bank. On a like-for-like basis, however, the Investment Bank has reduced its risk weighted assets.</p>
          <p>This now marks the third consecutive quarter where we have reduced our balance sheet. I would like to remind you that we have already achieved a reduction of over 200 billion in the fourth quarter '07, and over 50 billion in the third quarter. Adjusted for the increase in positive replacement values, we've now reduced our balance sheet by approximately 550 billion between the end of June '07 and the end of March '08. During the first quarter, we have reduced our trading portfolio assets by almost 160 billion Swiss francs. This was the result of a concerted effort to reduce our inventory both in FICC and equities, and we were also helped by the development of the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet reduction also had a positive effect on risk-weighted assets. As of January 1st, 2008, the Basel II framework became effective. As anticipated, this resulted in an overall decrease in risk-weighted assets for UBS. As I've already said, however, for the Investment Bank, Basel II led to an increase in risk-weighted assets, while risk-weighted assets in Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking, almost halved.</p>
          <p>The chart shows the movement in risk-weighted assets for the group under Basel I from December to March, and then the impact of Basel II. The 20 billion risk-weighted asset reduction on a like-for-like basis between December and March was entirely achieved in the Investment Bank. Risk-weighted assets under Basel II for the quarter were 333 billion Swiss francs.</p>
          <p>The reduction between Basel II and Basel I primarily reflects lower risk weightings for high quality, highly collateralized loans in Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking, which contributed the most of the reduction. These were partly offsetting the declines via increased weightings for derivatives and for trading portfolio assets within banking book treatment.</p>
          <p>Also, there is new chart for operation risk, which Basel II introduces. We will look at the components of the capital in detail on the next slide, but as you can see from this chart, Basel II had an overall negative impact on our Tier 1 ratio of approximately 20 basis points, despite the reduction in risk-weighted assets. Pro forma Tier 1 and total capital ratios based on March 31st risk-weighted assets increased significantly, as you can see from this slide.</p>
          <p>On the regulatory capital side, you can see the main drivers for the development of Tier 1 and total capital ratios. As we already communicated, the gains from our accounting effects are not eligible for capital adequacy purposes, and did include the 3.86 billion Swiss francs related to the MCN, mandatory convertible note, and 1.7 billion reflecting the after-tax effect of own credit.</p>
          <p>Further down on this chart, you can see the impact of Basel II, which I've already covered. On the risk-weighted asset side, it was a reduction of approximately 18 billion Swiss francs. On the eligible capital side, the impact was negative 2.2 billion Swiss francs, and is due to the deduction of intangibles and other items as introduced by the new framework.</p>
          <p>The MCN became effective in Q1, after the approval from our shareholders. It added 13 billion to the eligible Tier 1 capital. The remaining 3.2 billion reduction in eligible capital came mainly from foreign exchange and other deductions, which include the acquisition in France.</p>
          <p>The risk reduction initiatives in the Investment Bank, together with the foreign exchange effect, led to 21 billion decline of risk-weighted assets on a like-for-like basis. The proceeds from our shareholder approved and fully underwritten rights issue should boost our Tier 1 ratio by approximately 450 basis points. In addition, we have further strengthened our capital position, as I already mentioned, by issuing a &#x20AC;1 billion hybrid capital.</p>
          <p>Looking at the exposures most directly affected by the U.S. residential mortgage market, you can see that we have reduced our risk profile very substantially. This was achieved by means of asset disposals, but is also a result of further write-downs we have taken in Q1.</p>
          <p>In the appendix, we are providing you with additional information on most of these exposure buckets, there, for example, you will see how our current marks have reduced since year-end, and you will also receive vintage and ratings information.</p>
          <p>Let me start with subprime. Here, we reduced our exposure over the first quarter to $15.6 billion, down from 27.6 on December 31st. Our residual subprime position consists of 6.6 billion in super senior CDOs, 8.9 billion subprime RMBS, and 133 million in warehouse and retained RMBS CDOs. The average marks in our subprime super senior CDOs were reduced to $0.33 on the dollar, compared with $0.58 on the dollar at year-end. For our subprime RMBS positions, the average marks now are $0.50 on the dollar, that's down from $0.74 at year-end.</p>
          <p>Alt-A positions were reduced from 26.6 billion to 17.1 billion. Our residual Alt-A positions consist of 317 million super senior CDOs, 14.5 billion in AAA rated first lien RMBS, and 2.3 billion in other Alt-A RMBS. The other category includes all second lien positions and first lien positions rated below the AAA level. Our average marks for these positions are also significantly lower: The marks for super senior Alt-A CDOs were reduced to $0.30, down from 74 at year-end; the marks for our AAA first lien Alt-A positions were reduced to $0.77, that's down from 96 at year-end; and our marks for the other Alt-A positions now stand at $0.44, down from 60 at year-end. Again, you can see all the details in the slides we have included in the appendix.</p>
          <p>As the downward spiral accelerated during the first quarter, we've also experienced some losses on positions related to U.S. prime residential mortgages. 229 million of these losses relate to prime super senior CDO positions, and 633 million to prime RMBS positions. Our fundamental analysis as to the impairment risks of these positions has not changed, but market sentiments have clearly deteriorated during the quarter making these value adjustments necessary.</p>
          <p>Regarding our credit exposure to monoline insurers, here we were confronted with a reduction in the market value of the underlying assets, which we had bought protection from the monolines, particularly subprime assets. This has led to a 4.4 billion increase in the value of our credit default swaps, and hence of our contingent credit exposure to the monolines. The increase in our potential credit exposure combined with credit spread-wise and in further monolines, has resulted in an increase in our credit value adjustment of 1.7 billion to 2.6 billion. Again, you will find detailed information, by ratings, in the appendix.</p>
          <p>Our U.S. reference-linked note program has resulted in further losses of 1.6 billion in the quarter. During the last quarter's presentation I explained the mechanics of this program in detail. Basically, as spreads in the reference pool have widened, the value of the assets we hold has declined. The value of the credit protection has increased, but not in the same amount. This has led to a loss of 1.6 billion in the first quarter, 1.2 billion of which came from subprime-related assets.</p>
          <p>Our aggregate loss attributable to commercial real estate exposure was 443 million in Q1. Of this amount, 202 million came from CMBS-related super senior positions. You will see in the appendix that we have further split our exposure into super senior and U.S. CMBS/CMBX trading positions. Our total commercial mortgage-related exposure was reduced to 6.3 billion at the end of March, down from 7.7 billion at year-end.</p>
          <p>Our exposure in leveraged finance was modest to start with, but we have continued to reduce it. It came down from 11.4 billion to 8.6 billion. The majority of the reduction was achieved in old  deals. The average mark for old deals are now at $0.90 and $0.97 for new deals. Again, please refer to the appendix for a detailed breakdown.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, our inventory in student loans contributed approximately 1 billion to our losses. Here we have seen a 2.7 billion increase in our exposure compared to year-end. This increase resulted from us supporting the auction rate securities market, up until mid-February. We have since stopped supporting student loan ARCs in line with our competitors.</p>
          <p>The markdowns taken mainly reflect different duration assumptions for the underlying assets. Prior to the market dislocation, these securities were traded and valued based on a very short-term average duration, 30 days or so. As a result of the market dislocation, however, and for the purpose of valuing these securities, we are now assuming an average duration of five years.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to hand you over to Jerker Johansson, who will summarize his plans for the Investment Bank. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marco, and good morning, everybody. As you know, I joined UBS a month ago, and I wanted to take this opportunity to share with you today some of my initial impressions about the business.</p>
          <p>What immediately struck me were the key strengths of the Investment Bank, specifically the global coverage and distribution capabilities, our tremendous emerging markets operations, and the overlap and linkages with the wealth management business. I've been really impressed by the quality of our client relationships, with both investors and issuers, and the strength of our equities and IBD business also stands out, as does all of the client-facing parts of our foreign exchange rates and commodity businesses.</p>
          <p>As the incoming CEO, my first objective is to review the portfolio of activities conducted by the IB. In doing this, we are guided by the following principles: First, each business should have the capacity to achieve its return on capital targets; second, it should have future growth potential; and thirdly, it should fit our client focus strategy.</p>
          <p>One tangible example of our portfolio review is our decision to exit the institutional side of the muni business, by either sale or closure, which we are announcing today. We will make further strategic decisions of this nature as we continue our review.</p>
          <p>In parallel to the portfolio review, we're also resizing the business, and we have today announced that there will be a further reduction in personnel numbers at the Investment Bank. The people affected by this are in the process of being informed, and I am sure you will appreciate that this is not something that I, or anyone else, regards as a good thing. But it is necessary, and it's necessary that we have the appropriate scale and allocation of resources, including our people, for the business we want to be in, today and in the future.</p>
          <p>As has been covered, we will reduce head count by a further 2,600 people, mainly through redundancies. These reductions will be equal across the seniority structure. This aspect is important, because it assures that personnel costs will be reduced in proportion to the head count reduction.</p>
          <p>The second principle we have used is to be tactical about where we reduce head count. As an illustration of this, IBD and equities numbers will fall by about 9%, whereas FICC numbers will fall by about 26%. And within FICC, reductions will be much lower in strategic client businesses and much higher in businesses that are focused on capital rather than on clients. After this reduction, and allowing for some recruitment, the number of staff in the Investment Bank will be about 18% below the peak of the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>So, how will we measure our performance? As Marcel has mentioned, the group's overall ambition is for the Investment Bank to return to pre-tax profitability of approximately 4 billion Swiss francs annually. In addition to the announcement regarding head count reductions, we are pleased to confirm the agreement in principle to sell U.S.$15 billion of market value of U.S. real estate related assets to a newly created distressed asset fund managed by BlackRock. When this transaction is completed, it will allow us to both reduce the overall risk, and to shift risk capacity to our client-driven businesses.</p>
          <p>So, what is the immediate outlook for our business? Well, while client activity slowed during the quarter, the medium to longer term outlook is for revenue opportunity in these areas to continue to grow. My first priority is to make sure that the UBS Investment Bank focuses singlemindedly on continuously enhancing our client franchise.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we believe that the fastest growth in client opportunities will be in those geographies which are still relatively underdeveloped from a financial market perspective. We are exceptionally well positioned in these markets, being one of the top investment banks in each of Asia, Latin America, Russia, and Eastern Europe. I expect business with issuers and investors in these markets to continue to outpace business elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, it is clear that UBS Investment Bank benefits tremendously from the strength of the group's Wealth Management operation. These benefits come partially from cost synergies, but those are fairly modest. The main advantage is that ultra-high net worth clients need investment banking advice and products. This overlap on the client side has its greatest potential in our fastest growing geographical segment, Emerging Markets. I'm therefore convinced that the integrated model positions us ideally to capitalize on the need of our clients.</p>
          <p>It's also clear that each business has to be conscious of the return it is making on resources. That is, realized return, net of cost, on capital, and that those returns need to be higher for riskier activities. I don't suggest that anyone at UBS ever really thought otherwise, but I have found that people had somehow lost sight of this fundamental requirement, being driven by revenue growth and the cost income ratio.</p>
          <p>So, we're now in the process of introducing a performance measurement system that properly measures and assesses businesses in this context and rigorously allocates capital on this basis in line with the group strategy.</p>
          <p>So, these are my current strategic priorities. In conclusion, I'm setting the framework for defining the portfolio businesses and I'm implementing changes in response to the immediate business outlook.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand it back over to Marcel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jerker. I will now conclude the presentation today with our outlook and some closing remarks.</p>
          <p>The year started with very tough business conditions for the financial industry as a whole. Recently we have seen credit spreads both for UBS and peers begin to normalize, indicating that market confidence is improving. Yet for 2008 we expect the environment to remain difficult with a continuing unfavorable global economic climate, deleveraging by institutional and private investors, slower wealth creation and lower trading and capital market activity.</p>
          <p>Along with the decrease of our invested asset base already seen in first quarter 2008, this will weigh on revenues in the coming quarters. As explained, UBS will focus on managing its resources in a highly disciplined way and we will direct all our efforts in strengthening our client-driven businesses.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter we will continue to clean up the balance sheet and rebuild the investment banking business. We will continue to spend money in risk reduction and close out of legacy positions, and I've already mentioned the short-term influence of credit spreads and monoline spreads on our earnings.</p>
          <p>In summarizing where we stand today, we have taken the first step in leaving the crisis behind us by making an open and honest review of what went wrong. The circumstances which led to the creation of the legacy positions will not be repeated. We have put in place measures to reinforce our capital base and we will remain very strong. And we will improve the operating efficiency of our group by taking the necessary actions to reduce our costs. And we will not rest until we have fully restored trust of our clients, our shareholders and our employees. Tom?</p>

          <p>First question is from Mr. Derek De Vries, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I've got a couple of questions actually. First off, on your private banking business, I'm wondering if you could tell me a little bit about change in turnover amongst private bankers? So we're four months into the year, have you seen a different turnover rate amongst private bankers this year versus '07, '06, etcetera? And then maybe a little more detail on the BlackRock disposal. You mentioned $15 billion. I guess I have two questions. One is if you could give a little more detail on which $15 billion of assets. And the second is if you could talk a little bit about basis risk.  So is BlackRock essentially lifting out the $15 billion net exposure you see? Or are they going to take all the gross exposure and the hedges? And I guess the concern is, if they're just taking the net, they're going to leave you with a load of basis risk that investors might not be comfortable with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let me start with question one on CA turnover and then I'll hand over to Jerker on the BlackRock transaction. On the turnover, we can actually say that it has not changed to previous quarters. And additionally, we have actually increased our numbers of financial advisers in Wealth Management International in Switzerland. We've added 243 financial advisers in the first quarter. In Wealth Management U.S., it went down a little bit, just a tick, and so nearly flat. And both of these pieces of information together indicated we are still on the, on normal track there. Then on BlackRock, Jerker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, as you said, it's a $15 billion sale of assets that come out of our U.S. subprime and U.S. Alt-A portfolios. They have a nominal value of approximately $22 billion. The basis risk, the way this transaction works is that we are selling the bonds to the, to the new fund once that has been established. We will then partially finance that fund. But from an economic standpoint, this will substantially reduce the risk that we have in the assets. From a basis risk standpoint, the way we looked at evaluating this transaction was really to look at the price we get on the assets and then also obviously look at the risk that we're left with in the remaining portfolio. And we're very comfortable with both of those.  And I think that really addresses your question about the hedge as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so, so essentially they're lifting out the net exposure. And if we assume 50% of your gross exposure is hedged, essentially you're left with that, with gross exposure, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are buying the bonds outright. They're not take, they're not buying a long and a short position; they're buying the bonds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But what I'm saying is that when we look at the remaining positions we have, we're comfortable with it.  And in evaluating the attractiveness of the transaction we've obviously looked at what the portfolio looks like once we've done it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and will selling those assets to BlackRock result in a gain for UBS?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi everybody. I had a question about the investment bank. The four billion pre-tax run rate that you highlight as the ongoing sustainable run rate, if we ignore the tax credits for a moment and tax out of the Group run rate, that's about 11% post-tax ROE. Where do you think that needs to be to get to your target of divisions covering their cost of equity? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me answer here. I think the calculation is correct. It is based on our current equity attribution. We obviously see this equity attribution to come down in line with bringing the risk to where it should be in the long term. As you have already seen, the transactions as announced today, once completed, will have an impact on risk-weighted assets and once the work-out portfolio is addressed, this will obviously take a considerable amount of time. Our equity attribution will come down and so will the return on the allocated equity come up. We believe that 13% to 14% hurdle rates are appropriate with a long-term level of risk and we do think that we can clearly exceed that in the long run with the inherent earnings capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up, then, I mean, what do you think that equity might come down by? Or look at it another way, what's the sustainable revenue run rate of the investment bank business, post-deleveraging? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, can I have some questions on the Tier 1 capital and the equity base and something on the private bank? On page 62, when you talk about your Tier 1 ratio, you said that you've got a one-off benefit of not deducting the treasury shares. And you said that could go at some time in the future. It's four billion, so it's relatively significant. Could you talk about when, and whether that would just bring the Tier 1 ratio down to 10.6? And then on the mandatory convertible, I'm a bit unsure, but I think it's not allowed to be put in your stated equity, because your stated equity looks very low. Could you confirm that? And then on the Private Bank, the International net new money was quite low. Could you talk about whether that, whether there's something unusual in there, deleveraging, or whether that's where you're also seeing some impacts on the franchise, because I thought that that would be more resilient. And then, sorry, I'm, just to round up, you talked about risk weighted assets going down further, I mean, could you be more specific? Because I'm a bit confused as to how the BlackRock sale will help risk weighted assets when I think you've still got some part in the financing. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with net new money and the risk weighted assets and then I will hand over to Marco for the questions on capital. Clearly, the net new money was lower everywhere; as we have outlined there were impacts from deleveraging in these very weak markets as we have seen them in the first quarter. There were also substantially lower numbers of these so-called liquidity events, IPOs, which drive net new money in emerging markets, and these two elements clearly have influenced it. I would still believe that the number is lower than it would be in a UBS normalized environment, so that in my assessment there is an additional impact from the whole situation on that.</p>
          <p>The risk weighted assets treatment on BlackRock is, works as follows. What we now have is, we have these assets in a, from a capital perspective in a banking book treatment that will attract, or would have attracted 75% risk weight at the end of June. This is according to the standardized approach, as they are treated from a regulatory perspective. Now if we sell them, and get, and finance part, we have through the equity in this fund, obviously a substantial &#x2013; you could say economically it's a first loss protection, so a very large first loss protection. So it's nothing else than a repo financing from an economic term or a collateralized lending from an economic term. And that obviously has a substantially lower capital charge than it has if we just outright hold it. That's an example of how risk weighted assets come down, and that will apply to the entire workout portfolio as it's going to be reduced over time.</p>
          <p>In addition, there is still a large tradable asset book, which we feel that we have still potential for the more liquid assets. That takes time, and all of that will not have an impact on the identified underlying core earnings, but it will help us to reduce risk weighted assets, and therefore lower the attributed equity. Now on capital, Marco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You had one question regarding the mandatory. You're correct that for financial accounting terms the mandatory is not an equity instrument, but it is treated as a debt instrument. For regulatory capital, however, the full 13 billion of mandatory is counted as core Tier 1 capital. Upon conversion obviously, the financial accounting view and the regulatory view will re-align and it will receive full equity treatment. With regard to treasury shares you will remember that in the fourth quarter, following our losses, we had announced that the shares originally repurchased, and of the plan to cancel them, we no longer cancel them. We kept them as treasury shares. And rather than selling them and having to repurchase them again in the market to satisfy delivery obligations we had under various employee share-based compensation schemes, we basically used the majority of it for that purpose. So, that will not going to have a negative impact, as you indicated, on Tier 1 capital going forward. There is always some movement on treasury shares as it relates to our Tier 1 capital, but it's not significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just come back to the mandatory convertible? I think what I meant more was obviously you had that technical write-up of 3.8 billion went through the P&amp;L but that's not &#x2013; you're not allowed to put that into equity, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is in equity, but it's not in Tier 1 capital. So both the accounting gains flow through the P&amp;L and are therefore a benefit to our net profit line, but the regulator takes a different view. He basically then excludes from our net profit the own credit 2.1 billion, net of tax, so that then translates into 1.7 billion, plus the 3.86 billion of MCN, which is allowed for capital purposes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry to go on about this, but obviously the book value is quite important for valuation. It's just that when you go to page 73 of your financial statement, you've got attributable equity of 16.4 billion, which I understand is obviously before the rights issue and the mandatory convertible, the money that you will get in, but I'm just-so you're saying that already includes a mandatory convertible technical gain, and the fair value of own debt?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Perhaps I could just ask Jon Peace's question other way round. To get to a 4 billion run rate of pre-tax profits in the Investment Bank, if I assume you want to hit at least a 15% post-tax return, that implies about a 25% reduction in the Investment Bank.  Is there any chance you can maybe share some color on how much of that shrinkage would come from shrinking legacy assets and how much is more from portfolio decisions like these, the mini-bond decision today? And also perhaps just if it's significant proportion from legacy assets, would it be fair to say you'll carry on selling legacy assets, irrespective of the fundamental value that your models predict, and therefore, the potential for write-backs in the future will be curtailed? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Huw, I would say this, that the majority of that reduction will come from the reduction of legacy positions. The review that we're currently undertaking, when we look at these different businesses &#x2013; there are a number of different factors, and the muni business actually is not an intense capital user, so the issues there are different issues. But when you look across the balance sheet, we see substantial opportunities to reduce capital in a number of our businesses, and the main one, obviously, is the legacy positions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Yes, just a couple of follow-up questions actually, firstly on the Investment Bank. Within that profit target of about CHF 4 billion, what sort of cost income level or what profit margin level do you see as sustainable on a normalized basis? And then second question really is just about Wealth Management. Could you talk a bit more about firstly, among the Swiss clients, whether the reputational damage in the outflows are sort of getting worse or getting better, whether there's any change in that at the moment? And secondly, outside the Swiss clients, if we look at the other European clients, are you seeing any negative impact at the moment, following the problems that happened in Liechtenstein? Not for you, but more generically in Liechtenstein has that impacted the European offshore money?</p>

          <p>Let me start with the second question on Wealth Management and then we'll hand over to Jerker for cost income ratios and how such a normalized run rate would be composed. First, on the Wealth Management, what we have seen, not surprisingly, is that as the crisis has accelerated these negative impacts have accelerated throughout the first quarter to the end of the quarter and obviously found that most significant impact shortly around the announcement of the large writedowns. And so we'll expect that this takes time to recover, so it will clearly take a while. It's hard to say, but the more quickly we return to more normalized levels of activity and the more quickly we reduce our risk exposures and are back on track, the more quickly we will recover from that, I'm convinced. And I think as such, the very strong capital position although the substantial reduction in risks are evident and really important to achieve that. The Liechtenstein issue does not have any specific effect, up and beyond the discussions which went on for many, many years around this issue. And especially this is a very specific Liechtenstein issue around the foundations and the way they work. Basically, to come back on this one thing on the remaining assets that Huw continues to mention that we will lose recovery potential, as Jerker has said before, this transaction with BlackRock is always the balancing between what we sell and what we still have and should address this issue with respect to the inherent value on assets. And on run rates, I mean, basically the way you should look at it is what is like repeat client flow business on the revenue side. And then on the cost side, it is how could it look like post reduction, so once that's all through and we are back to normalized territory. Jerker?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the cost income ratio that we were looking at is somewhere around 75%. Now that's obviously higher than the cost income ratios we've enjoyed during some of the past periods, and I think that reflects two things. One, it reflects a slightly more realistic outlook for the industry, which I think we and a number of our competitors are getting to terms with. And secondly, it reflects a change in the mix of the business. Obviously, businesses which are capital intensive typically have lower cost income ratios because the capital is not typically costed in a traditional cost income ratio. So as we move in to less capital intensive businesses that cost income ratio will naturally go up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, a couple of questions, similar themes. Firstly on the head count cuts, could you give a bit more detail about what associated revenue cuts and cost cuts you expect to be linked to those both in the Investment Banks and other divisions? Secondly, are you able to give an absolute figure for the risk-weighted assets associated with the legacy portfolio or the equity allocated at present to that legacy portfolio? And then finally, can you give a timeframe for when we should expect the prospectus for the rights issue to be issued and details of the discount, etc.? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me answer the first one on the job cuts and how that impacts. That's a cost measure, we do not expect from where we are now that this has any impact on the revenue side. In particular as revenue issues they have the drivers which we have already mentioned short-term in the Investment Bank. And I think the way it is going to be implemented is in a very tactical way, which is actually supposed to protect exactly those businesses and those activities where we see the sustainable run rates for our business coming from. And on the Wealth Management side we actually continue to add people to the front office. We do this through internal labor markets; we do this through hiring. And in that sense the revenues are not driven by that, they are obviously exogenous factors driving the revenues as the asset base, which is driven by currency moves, driven by equity moves and all these other things, but not by these cost cuts. As I've said, we expect mid-2009 to be 10% more lower to today's run rate. Then on risk-weighted assets with respect to specific portfolio, we do not disclose that on that level of details. The rights issue timetable; on the 27th of May, that's basically the X date for the rights and it's the start of the rights trading and exercise period. And it is three days before that I think when the terms of the...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions actually. First on Global Asset Management, you did have a slide in the presentation, you talked a little bit about it, but the outflows continue at a fairly high rate. Could you maybe update us in a little more detail on the overhaul of that business? And then the second question Jerker you, I think you said you are exiting the U.S. institutional muni business and you talked about where you thought the Investment Bank was well positioned such as emerging markets. Could you just qualitatively tell us what you think about the Investment Bank's competitive positioning in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on Global Asset Management, we've said that last year that we expect a few quarters to go by until we have fully overcome the performance issue. The management changes have been effected, the new teams have been put in place and they just need time to establish track records, such that we can revert at that trend. The one thing we did see is that on the institutional side, it appears to slow down; we are confident that this trend will continue. What we did have though on the other hand is we had on wholesale funds outflow, I think this was also a reflection of the generally very difficult market environment. And last but not least, we think that is a fundamental issue that we see some bifurcation of traditionally managed assets into more index-linked products and into alternative assets where we have actually seen positive developments in newly created investment platforms. So for us it really means that the alternative investment platform with infrastructure, real estate and other assets is going continuously to be expanded to respond to that trend. Now on the IB, Jerker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, your question was in reference to the IBD franchise in the United States. I will start by saying I've been actually positively surprised by the position of IBD in the U.S. It's a new organization, it's hungry, I think that the franchise is very much built on a corporate advisory strength that they've traditionally have had and less on leveraged finance and some of the other areas that were obviously very big over the last couple of years, but perhaps will be less important over the next couple of years. So I think it's a franchise that, I have good hopes that will continue to get stronger as we go through the next phase in the cycle here. The second thing I will point out is that it's a franchise that's very well integrated with our global franchise, and that's something that I see as one of the key strengths of the Investment Bank. I see tremendously good communication and cooperation across the Global Investment Banking franchise and I think that that's something that we will make sure to build on. And I think it will become even more important as the capital-market conditions changes around the globe.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Chris Malmer, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi, it's Chris Malmer from Goldman's. A few questions: just on the head count reductions, if I understand correctly there's 5,500 in total; 2,600 from the Investment Bank, plus the 1,500 already completed, that leaves another 1,400, just an indication as to which division we should expect that head count reductions to occur in? Secondly, the hybrid component in your Tier 1, up to 25% at the moment fully credited, goes to about 19%, if I calculate correctly, on a pro-forma basis after the capital increase. Could that go back to 25%, or is the 20% mark now something we should expect going forward? Thirdly, and finally, just on the topic of basis risk, I think it was touched upon previously, slightly. From what I understand what we're seeing in the credit markets at the moment is strengthening of credit indices which have typically been used for the short position, if you like, on the hedges, whereas the cash prices aren't necessarily acting in the same way. Is that something you see as well, and are there any areas where that discrepancy between cash and hedges, i.e. indices, is particularly worrying at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me do question one and three and then I'll ask Marco to cover the hybrid issue. First of all, I have to make clear the head count numbers. The 5,500 are on top of the 1,500; they do include the 2,600 from the IB, but not the 1,500 which we have already reduced. So there is a balance of 2,900 and that balance is, over the next 15 months I should say, coming largely from the Global Wealth Management operation, but also from Corporate Center and from Global Asset Management across the board, which is &#x2013; simply because of the relative size, the largest contribution is from Global Wealth Management. But as I said, this is extending over a  period of 15 months, which is longer than the Investment Bank where the redundancies are made now and completed over the next few months.</p>
          <p>Then on the basis risk, I mean the most prominent example is indeed the value of the ABX with a lagging cash market. That's what we have seen in the first few weeks of the quarter, and it is difficult to predict at the moment to what extent these prices will align. Marco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the hybrid, I do not have the exact number, but I think your math of 19% seems approximately correct. On a pro-forma basis I believe we have approximately 3.7 billion of hybrid capacity left. We do have a limit of 25%; within the limit of 25% we have a limit of 15% for innovative hybrid capacity. I think most of our innovative capacity has been consumed so you should not expect anything more there. And on the other hand, we said we want to manage this Bank to the strongest capital ratios possible, and if we deem the markets are right, we could be seeing further hybrid issuance of UBS in the market. That should not come as a surprise.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, can you just tell us about the strategic review that's meant to be taking place over the summer? Does the 5,500 job cuts include some results from the strategic review, or will that be the strategic review actually be in addition to that sort of number? And secondly, can you actually give us some revenue indication in Swiss franc billion terms how much of the Investment Bank actually receives from the Wealth Management business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me respond to the strategic review. I think what we have seen, as the new Chairman has announced, is a very clear governance on roles and responsibilities of the Board and of the Group Executive Board on the other hand with a strategy committee which includes independent Directors. I think that was a very important part of it, and naturally the strategy committee will continuously review the way we implement our strategy. We are progressing in this implementation and that's basically why we have set ourselves a set of clearly measurable targets in terms of value creation from all the businesses and the Group. And this is subject to this continuous ongoing review process. What was the second?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the synergies between the business groups, I apologize. We have not disclosed any specific quantification of the flows between the business groups, but what I can say as a clear benefit which does accrue within the Investment Bank, a clear synergy benefit that is, on the one hand, the transaction flow from Wealth Management on this very significant asset base, which goes in many ways on the best execution basis through the Investment Bank. That's a very successful collaboration. And secondly, on the one hand Wealth Management is operating on a fully open architectural platform. However there is a significant and very successful collaboration with respect to structure products for Private Wealth Management clients between the Investment Bank and Wealth Management. By the way, a strategic advantage we have in expanding this business also to other financial intermediaries outside UBS is because we operate an open architecture is actually a very, very significant strength of our business model. Last, but not least, there are a number of clients that actually do business directly, although they're booked with Wealth Management. There are semi-institutional clients or other clients such as family offices which operate like large institutional clients. There are external asset managers in some cases. There are active traders and other ultra-high net worth individuals who access the Investment Bank directly. And that's where all or some of the benefits accrue.</p>
