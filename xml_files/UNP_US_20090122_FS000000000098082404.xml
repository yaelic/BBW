        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone, welcome to Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Rob Knight, our CFO, Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, and Dennis Duffy, Executive Vice President of Operations. Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings grew 41% year-over-year to $1.31 per share, as operating income totaled 1.1 billion, up 32%. We are posting strong earnings for the quarter as we completed an outstanding year for our Company. The fourth quarter was clearly a challenge with car loadings off nearly 12%. Our profitability was driven by improved safety, productivity, great service for our customers, positive pricing and lower energy costs. Falling steel prices were a nice reversal after paying higher diesel fuel prices over the last seven quarters.</p>
          <p>Looking back at 2008 we achieved these results despite facing the challenges of a weak economy and record high fuel prices. Our success stems from consistently executing our long-term strategy. Although rail is already the safest form of ground freight transportation we are committed to improve, which we did across the board in 2008. We provided our customers with excellent service as we offered truck-competitive products in key market corridors. Through employee innovation, technology and hard work we increased the efficiency of our railroad and we made strategic capital investments that support our long-term growth as well as drive further safety, service and efficiency. These efforts produced record financial results for our shareholders, increasing returns through a two-for-one stock split, a 23% dividend increase and share repurchases totaling now 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Our 2008 results were one for the record books, providing a solid foundation for the challenges we face in 2009. Obviously one of the biggest challenges we faced this year is economic uncertainty. Jack, Dennis and Rob will all give you some perspective on 2009. And as you'll see from their comments, our ability to forecast demand is very limited. As a result we will not affirm or provide specific financial guidance for the year. Although our confidence in the long-term opportunities for Union Pacific is undiminished, the current environment will be very difficult. With that I will turn it over to Jack to talk to you about our revenue results. Jack?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Well, our revenue grew 2% to a fourth quarter record $4.1 billion as price improvement and fuel surcharge tailwinds drove a 16% improvement in average revenue per car, more than offsetting the sharp decline in volume. The economic problems that dominated the news throughout the quarter clearly impacted volume, with the greatest declines in the groups most sensitive to the strength of the overall economy. Each of our groups set best-ever or best fourth quarter records for average revenue per car, but only Energy and Ag products were able to overcome the volume shortfall to post revenue gains. It was an anticlimactic end to a year that saw revenue climb 11% to a record 17.2 billion. Automotive was the only business group failing to set a new full-year revenue mark. All six groups set records for average revenue per car and Energy posted record car loadings as well. So, now let's take a closer look at how the fourth quarter played out for each of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Ag Products revenue grew 10% as the 16% improvement in average revenue per car more than offset a 5% decline in volume. We indicated in October that we expected to see our grain volume soften from the very strong levels we saw during the previous crop year. During the fourth quarter feed and wheat shipments declined in both the domestic and export markets, with overall whole grain volumes down 16%. On the positive side, growth in ethanol and DDGs continued, with both up more than 20%. Expansion of our Produce Railexpress product with the start up of the California origin early in the quarter, drove volume growth of nearly 70% for this truck-competitive refrigerated service.</p>
          <p>I doubt there is any surprise in the weak showing of our Automotive business during the fourth quarter. About the only good news was that our progress in renegotiating legacy contracts helped drive a 12% improvement in average revenue per car, partially offsetting the 26% volume decline and holding the revenue shortfall to 17%. For the quarter, Finished Vehicle volumes were down 29%, while Parts declined 21%.</p>
          <p>Our Chemical revenues were down 1%, as the 14% decline in volume was nearly offset by a 15% improvement in average revenue per car. The residual impact of the September hurricanes and the downturn in the economy drove weakness in the two largest segments of our Chemicals business, Liquid and Dry, which declined 21%, and Plastics, which was off 18%. Refinery issues resulting from the hurricanes, volatile crude oil prices and economic conditions impacted Petroleum products. Fertilizer volume was down as industry sales declined, driven by tightening credit and unstable market prices that led many farmers to delay or even to skip their fall fertilizer application. Sulfur carloads increased 26%, largely the result of some new unit train business. And a strong export market drove increased soda ash volume, even as domestic shipments declined due to continued weakness in the housing and automotive markets.</p>
          <p>Energy revenue grew 20% on the strength of a 22% improvement in average revenue per car. Strong demand and continuing productivity improvements in our network performance drove a 2% growth in Southern Powder River Basin tonnage, establishing fourth quarter records for cars, for tons, for trains and tons per train, in closing out a record year for the SPRB. Unfortunately, widespread problems among the Colorado mines led to a 5% decline in Colorado/Utah tonnage and resulted in the overall 1% decline in volume.</p>
          <p>In Industrial Products we saw a 15% falloff in volume, partially offset by a 14% improvement in average revenue per car. Unfortunately, mix worked against us and resulted in a 3% reduction in revenue overall for the quarter. Our Lumber volume fell 30% as housing starts dropped to their lowest level since the census bureau began tracking 50 years ago. The slump in housing and commercial construction is also impacting roofing, cement, and stone, and the latter two were also hit by reduced funding for highway projects. Market softness cooled the steel and scrap markets that were running strong earlier in the year. Industrial Products saw customers across many of their markets take extended holiday shutdowns to allow for inventory adjustments during the quarter.</p>
          <p>On a brighter note, frac sand and other drilling materials provided some good news, with volumes up over 20%. Intermodal revenue was down 7%, as the 16% decline in volume offset a 10% improvement in average revenue per unit. As we've highlighted in the past, significant portions of the International Intermodal business are tied to the housing and automotive industries. The deepening contraction of the overall economy was the primary driver of a 19% decline in our International volume. The weak economy also impacted the domestic side, where volume declined 9%, despite the continued success of our EMP revitalization effort, which drove volumes with Intermodal marketing companies up over 20%. If you exclude the contract loss that we incurred early in the year, our improved service helped hold truckload volume flat versus last year, which is actually pretty good performance in this economy.</p>
          <p>We closed the year with record setting customer satisfaction as our customers recognized the value being delivered, given our significant service improvements. Satisfaction came in at 85 for the fourth quarter. That's the highest quarterly score in the 22 years we've been measuring satisfaction. For the full year we improved 4 points to 83, which is also our best-ever mark.</p>
          <p>Okay, a look into the future. I thought maybe a good place to start was with a recap of our legacy contract status. Last year, including contracts that expired on December 31, we renegotiated legacy contracts totaling about 8% of our revenue base. So, at this point we have now been able to re-price 82% of our business. Unfortunately, 2009 will take a little less than one percentage point off the table, but we will get the benefit of the price improvement from those December 31 expirations throughout the coming year and we'll also have a nice carryover price impact from the other contracts we re-priced earlier in 2008. On the right, you can see the mix of business side to our remaining legacy deal. Half that business is still in Energy; 29% is in Intermodal; Autos and Chemicals are both 10%; and Ag and Industrial Products shared just one percentage point between them.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we are going to have our work cut out for us in 2009. On the chart, we've highlighted some of the biggest hurdles that we face as well as opportunities that will guide some strengthening as the year plays out. Looking at the full year, let me take you through how we think these and other factors are going to influence growth potential in each of our groups. Start with Ag Products -- Ag Products is going to face some tough comps, at least until the new crops are harvested. Increased world grain production will impact whole grain exports and a decline in animal feeding will slow the domestic grain business. As a result we expect whole grain volumes to slide back closer to the levels we saw in 2007. The soybean crush is forecasted to be down over 6% for the crop year. But we do anticipate that ethanol is going to grow, although the pace may be a bit slower, as lower gasoline prices and higher corn prices squeeze margins. Continued market softness and production cutbacks drive the automotive outlook for 2009, but it should run better than it is now. The ramp-up, however, is going to be slower than normal this year, as some plant shutdowns will extend all the way into March.</p>
          <p>In Chemicals, the poor economy will likely lead to some further softening of Plastics, and Domestic Soda Ash will continue to mirror demand in the building and automotive markets. However, we remain cautiously optimistic about Export Soda Ash. We think that Liquid and Dry is going to hold its own, and Fertilizers should see an uptick with the spring planting season. Continued low crude prices could also create some opportunities for us in Asphalt. Our Energy volume in 2009 is expected to decline slightly from last year's record-setting performance. We successfully renegotiated quite a few legacy coal deals last year, but there were a few that wound up not going our way. The good news is that continued demand for SPRB coal should allow us to offset most of that loss. Coal quality has been an issue for Colorado/Utah, but that production is going to ramp up as the mines start to get squared away with those production issues.</p>
          <p>With housing starts expected to decline somewhat from their already low levels and overall economic weakness impacting many of their markets, Industrial Products faces a real uphill battle. The one bright spot is still energy-related markets, which appear to maintain their strength. Growth with IMCs driven by the EMP revitalization program and continued service improvements is expected to spur growth in our domestic Intermodal. But the weakness in the overall economy is still going to take its toll on the International side. Current economic projections anticipate growth in imports by the fourth quarter, although admittedly against 2008 depressed levels.</p>
          <p>So, with the freefall in economic indicators over the past few months and uncertainty about how quickly the new Administration can get their plans in place, let alone how quickly those plans will have an impact, an honest assessment of 2009 is that at this point we probably have more questions than we have answers. Our volumes have started off slowly, but as I just outlined, they should strengthen. Extended shutdowns, inventory right-sizing, combined with a comparison against a relatively strong first quarter volume a year ago, makes things look weaker right now than we believe they really are. It seems likely that an economic stimulus bill will be coming. Across much of our business, a successful stimulus package offers some upside to the extended focuses on rebuilding infrastructure and energy development.</p>
          <p>Ultimately the key to strengthening demand is job creation. The government stimulus check, more money in your pockets from low gas prices, low mortgage rates, and zero percent financing for automobiles, probably isn't going to make much of a difference if you're not employed. We still expect that our core price improvement will be in that 5 to 6% range for the year, although it appears the impact of that improvement is going to be masked by the decline in fuel surcharge, when you're looking at it from an average revenue per car perspective. Keep in mind that that from a customer's point of view, that decline in fuel surcharge is going to result in lower transportation charges year-over-year.</p>
          <p>So, with that I am going to turn it over to Dennis for the operating review.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Jack and good morning. Today I'd like to wrap up the operating team's performance in '08, as well as talk a little bit about our plans for '09. Let's start with Safety. We think of Safety as it relates to our key constituents: employees; public; and customers. And over the last several years and in '08, we made significant improvement in each category. The tools we use to improve safety: communication; technology; process improvement; engineering and investments, are universal across the three areas and all contribute to our gains. Of course, our goal with each of these categories is to reduce to zero, so we'll continue our efforts in '09 to operate an even safer railroad.</p>
          <p>Turning to Service, as with any year, we had some bumps along the way with an assortment of natural disasters, but the resiliency of our infrastructure and our network resources allowed us to quickly recover and achieve record performance levels. Velocity finished at 23.5 miles per hour for the year, and 25.1 in the fourth quarter. In a declining volume environment like we've experienced the last two years, Operating's role is critical in driving cost out of the business through streamlined operations and increased asset utilization. These objectives must be balanced, however, against our customer commitments.</p>
          <p>Our 2008 Services Delivery Index, a composite metric of all customer commitments set all-time records for the year and the fourth quarter, 84 and 89 respectively. The increasing levels of customer satisfaction that Jack just discussed, mirrored the improvements in FDI [Foreign Direct Investment]. Lower volumes have certainly contributed to these results, but we have significantly improved the fundamentals of our railroad largely due to our Evergreen Unified Plan process, a continuous focus on inventory management, and technology also plays a big role. Increased usage of distributed power locomotives, which currently move about 55% of our gross ton-miles, allowed for a more efficient use of our locomotive improvement resources as well as saving fuel. Finally our work to operate as a volume variable network -- volume variable means managing our costs in line with our demand volumes even in a down economy, and the results can be seen in productivity.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter we reduced our total starts by 9% compared to 9% fewer gross ton-miles year-over-year. For the full year our start reduction was more than proportional to the volume decline. This was achieved concurrent with improving asset turns. You can see freight car cycle time, the number of days between loads, reached record levels in 2008. Our train size initiatives played a role, a key role in our productivity results by reducing train starts. The manifest network was a particular challenge, where we managed to increase train size and service levels despite the declining volumes. The end result was leveraging lower volumes into fewer starts, and also lower fuel consumption. For 2009, we have a menu of productivity initiatives covering all major classes of spending and asset utilization, all managed under the umbrella of our operating productivity council process.</p>
          <p>The combination of falling demand and greater efficiency has generated extra resources. When you compare year-end 2008 with '07 we have reduced our working level of critical resources significantly. From a locomotive standpoint, we have reduced the working fleet by more than 1,500, consisting of lease turnbacks, retirements and storing more than 1,200 locomotives, partially offset by 179 new deliveries in 2008. Likewise on the freight car side, our working inventory has been reduced by more than 67,000 or 21%, including 48,000 cars in storage. Demand for the train and engine workforce, shown in the upper right, is down by nearly 3,900 including approximately 3,100 furloughs. It is our intention to get these folks back to work in the near future, but that will be driven by volume demand and attrition. We continue to make short-term adjustments in our critical resources to reflect current economic conditions. However, as we've discussed before we have built some level of surge capability into our network to handle network outages and volume spikes.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital for a moment, our proposed '09 plan will total around 2.8 billion. Nearly 80% of the spend represents replacement and renewal of existing capital assets. This includes 125 new locomotives for nearly 290 million. Current market demand does not warrant this purchase, but they conclude the third year of a three-year purchase agreement. We will put these to good use expanding distributed power usage and retiring older, less efficient locomotives. The engineering spend continues our commitment to hardening the core infrastructure for safety, productivity and performance business reasons.</p>
          <p>With soft demand we are reducing gross spending by more than 300 million in capacity and commercial facilities. We are slowing down spending on the Sunset Route, while making strategic investments for long-term growth. An example is the new Joliet Intermodal facility, which we will continue to work on in 2009. Emerging market opportunities such as ethanol, wind power and drilling materials, are protected in our '09 plan. The technology portion includes strategic investments in computer-aided dispatching and positive train control systems.</p>
          <p>Our operating plans for '09 build upon the progress made in 2008, specifically solid safety improvements in the employee, public, and customer areas. The service records set in 2008 are now the benchmark and we will make further gains from here. We will remain volume variable in an uncertain environment. And finally, we will be disciplined in our efficient use of capital.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Rob for the financial review.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dennis and good morning. We start today with a look at our fourth quarter income statement. Quarterly operating revenue grew 2% to nearly $4.3 billion. Fourth quarter operating expenses came in at $3.1 billion, a 6% decrease versus 2007. The primary driver of the expense decline was lower fuel expense, which decreased 19% in the quarter. As I'll discuss more in a moment, lower fuel prices contributed to the decline, but the sharp falloff in business volumes and our efficiency efforts also played a major role. Higher revenue and lower expenses resulted in fourth quarter operating income of $1.1 billion, an increase of 32%.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter freight revenue totaled 4.1 billion, a 2% increase from 2007. Against a 12% drop in car loadings, our pricing gains and increased fuel surcharge recovery drove the yearly growth. Core price increased roughly 6 points in the quarter, and although our fuel prices actually declined year-over-year, the two-month lag in our fuel cost recovery programs drove higher year-over-year recoveries.</p>
          <p>Similar to the third quarter, our mix of business was positive, adding 6 points of growth to our average revenue per car. Turning to the expense detail, slide 27 shows fourth quarter compensation and benefits expense, down 2% in the quarter to $1.1 billion. Increased productivity and a significant decrease in volume were the primary drivers of the year-over-year decline. As Dennis described for you, increased velocity as well as our efforts to increase the efficiency of our crews drove savings in the form of lower crew costs. We also continued actions taken throughout 2008 to better align our workforce with demand, reducing both operating and non-operating personnel a total of 4%. Offsetting some of the productivity is the ongoing wage inflation associated with the 4% increase that became effective for our union employees on July 1. There were also added costs in the quarter related to pension and post-retirement benefits. For fuel expense our costs declined by 19% to $732 million, as fuel prices declined 6% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter average diesel price per gallon was $2.46, compared to $2.62 per gallon in 2007. This lower price paid roughly $47 million in the quarter. Although lower prices helped drive quarterly fuel expense, the 9% decline in gross ton-miles was actually a bigger contributor, saving $77 million in the fourth quarter. A 5% improvement in our fuel consumption rate also contributed to the savings. As we move through 2009 we should see the benefit of lower year-over-year fuel prices. In fact, we are currently paying about 40% less than the $2.84 per gallon we paid for diesel in the first quarter of 2008. Our customers are also seeing the benefit of lower fuel in the form of lower surcharges.</p>
          <p>Purchased services and materials expense totaled $458 million, up only $2 million. Although below third quarter levels, year-over-year cost were higher as a result of component price inflation. This increase was largely offset by lower expenses related to our improved productivity and volume decline. For example, expenses for crew transportation and lodging, as well as Intermodal ramp fees, declined year-over-year. Equipment and other rents expense decreased $13 million in the fourth quarter, or 4%. Lower freight volumes, particularly for Finished Vehicles, Industrial Products and Intermodal shipments, resulted in less car hire expense. Locomotive lease expense also declined year-over-year. Fourth quarter other expense declined 1% or $2 million. There were a number of pluses and minuses in this expense line during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Adding to the quarterly expense were several unfavorable year-over-year changes such as an increased provision for bad debts, higher state and local taxes, while equity income was lower in the quarter. We also received an insurance settlement in 2007 that contributed to the tough year-over-year comparison. Many of these items should be considered quarter-specific and do not indicate a change in our expense trend. Balancing out some of these unfavorable changes was a reduction in our casualty expense. We continue to see solid improvement in our safety performance, as well as a benefit of lower estimated settlement costs. We also completed a review of our asbestos liability in the fourth quarter, which demonstrated better than expected claims experience. Together, casualty costs were lower in the quarter by roughly $65 million.</p>
          <p>Looking now at our operating ratio, the bars on the left illustrate year-over-year fourth quarter progress. The bars on the right show our full-year improvement. As we discussed with you in our May Analyst Meeting, we are using project operating ratio to focus the entire organization on our efficiency. These efforts enabled us to drive steady improvement culminating in a 73.4% operating ratio in the fourth quarter, a best-ever mark. Lower fuel prices certainly contributed to our improvement, although offset somewhat by the volume declines. Our efforts to drive greater efficiency and improve the returns on our business enabled us to make a nearly 12-point gain since the fourth quarter of 2005. On a full-year basis, we also made great strides. The 77.3% operating ratio in 2008 was the best annual mark that we've achieved, and 9.5 points better than 2005. This performance really highlights all the hard word that's taken place across our Company to improve profitability.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the full income statement, fourth quarter other income was $15 million lower year-over-year, primarily as a result of lower interest income. Interest expense increased $2 million to $127 million, driven by higher average debt levels in 2008. Fourth quarter income tax expense increased 31% or $90 million. Although taxes were higher year-over-year as a result of increased income, the effective tax rate was slightly lower at 36.4% in 2008 versus 37% in 2007. Fourth quarter net income totaled $661 million, up 35%. Earnings per share increased 41% to $1.31 per share, reflecting both stronger earnings and the impact of our share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Slide 33 shows our full-year income statement. Operating revenue grew 10% to nearly $18 billion. Operating expense increased 8% to $13.9 billion. Higher year-over-year fuel expense contributed nearly 90% of this increase. Other income was $24 million lower in 2008 as a result of fewer real estate sales and less interest income. With the tough credit market likely to continue in 2009, our real estate sales could be challenged in that market. Interest expense grew 6% to $511 million. The driver of this increase was higher average debt levels, offset somewhat by lower interest rates. The combination of higher income and a lower effective tax rate for the year produced 2008 income taxes of $1.3 billion, a 14% increase. Our 2008 tax rate was 36.1%, was &#x2013; which was 2.3 points lower year-over-year, primarily related to a change in Illinois State Tax Legislation in 2007. 2008 net income grew 26% to a record $2.3 billion. Full-year earnings per share was $4.54, a 31% increase.</p>
          <p>From an overall financial standpoint, one of the key measures of our performance is the cash we are generating. In 2008, cash from operations increased $793 million, a 24% gain. As we improved our returns, increased productivity and drove strong bottom line results, we are generating more cash. In 2008 cash from operations was also favorably impacted by bonus depreciation, which added about $225 million. On the flip side, we made a $200 million voluntary pension contribution at year-end.</p>
          <p>Cash generation is especially important in today's tight credit markets, as we will rely more heavily on this cash to sustain our business going forward. In terms of our uses of this cash, we will continue to take a balanced approach. Obviously in this uncertain environment, we will be conservative with our cash management. In fact we ended 2008 with more than 1.2 billion of cash on the books, which will help us with our payment obligations in the first part of 2009.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about some of the other uses of cash in 2008. We closed our 2008 capital spend at roughly $3.1 billion. The breakdown on this spend was nearly 2.8 billion in cash capital and 350 million in non-cash capital for equipment leasing. As Dennis just mentioned our current plans target 2009 capital at around $2.8 billion, likely all in cash.</p>
          <p>Looking at share repurchases we bought back 3.4 million shares in the fourth quarter, returning nearly $200 million to shareholders. This run rate is slightly down from previous quarters, reflecting our desire to maintain liquidity in the current environment. On a full-year basis, 2008 repurchases totaled $1.5 billion, bringing the program total up to $3 billion of cash returned to shareholders since January 2007. Although the price of UP shares are certainly attractive today, we are not currently buying back stock. We are monitoring our cash flows as we start the year to ensure adequate liquidity. As we start to generate more cash we look forward to making additional share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Slide 37 illustrates UP's adjusted debt balances at year-end, which totaled $13.9 billion for a 47.4% adjusted debt to CAP ratio, consistent with how our ratio is viewed by the credit agencies. Increased debt levels, as well as higher pension and <mark type="inaudible" /> liabilities, contributed to the year-over-year increase. Throughout the current credit crunch, UP has maintained good access to the credit markets. We do have a $250 million debt retirement coming up in the next couple weeks and we will fund that from the cash we currently have on the books. So, to wrap up 2008 it was a great year for UP in many ways and our financial performance was no exception.</p>
          <p>We made tremendous progress with our efficiency and returns and significantly increased our profitability. As we turn the discussion to 2009, we are no less optimistic about the potential for our Company. We do, however, face tremendous uncertainty. As Jim mentioned, we will not provide specific financial guidance for 2009. Instead I'd like to spend the next couple of minutes talking qualitatively about our approach to the year. As Jack discussed, the demand forecast is very uncertain, and our current volume levels are weak. In fact, we believe we may be seeing the toughest comparison for the year right now in the first quarter. When you consider that the first half 2008 volumes were down a little more than 1%, while the second half volumes fell off 8%, we should at least see an easier comparison in the back half of the year. Another factor to consider for 2009 is that our reported revenues could actually be lower year-over-year due to the combination of declining volumes and less year-over-year fuel surcharge revenue. For example, in January 2008, our rate-based surcharge was 21.5%, versus only 16.5% this January, a 5 point difference.</p>
          <p>And as we move to February, the year-over-year decline grows to 9 points. It's important to keep in mind that although the absolute dollar amount of revenue may be lower, the quality is higher, since we do not have 100% fuel surcharge recovery, lower fuel prices actually help our bottom line. In fact, less volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue could mask the impact of the 5 to 6% core pricing gains we still expect for 2009. We have already priced the bulk of our legacy business for 2009, and will see the benefit of that pricing throughout the year.</p>
          <p>From a productivity stand point, we know we have further opportunities ahead. Dennis discussed with you how throughout 2008 we operated our railroad to match resources with demand. Although it's clearly more of a challenge to increase productivity with declining volumes, we are working to operate as a volume variable railroad. From an earnings standpoint, the key variable is the economy, which will drive volumes. For the first quarter, with volumes running well below last year's levels, it's unlikely that we'll be able to reach last year's first quarter earnings of $0.85 per share.</p>
          <p>Beyond the first quarter, if volumes improve, earnings should also improve. We are clearly in a very strong position to utilize our network resources more efficiently in a stronger demand environment. But, of course if current volume trends continue it will obviously be a challenge for us. We're being very cautious in our approach to the year. Although we are still very confident about the positive fundamentals of our business, that optimism is clearly tempered in the near-term by the economy. We also believe that the key long-term goals that we established last May are still intact. Our volume growth will be challenged even if you assume some reasonable level of economic activity returns. But a lot can happen over the next four years and we are unwavering in our commitment to improve. In particular, the objective of obtaining a low 70's operating ratio by 2012 is still our goal.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn it over to Jim.</p>

          <p>Thanks Rob. I'd like to add a couple points to the discussion on 2009. First, although this will be a difficult year for our Company, our customers and employees, we will act carefully to avoid short-term decisions that could impact strong long-term opportunities we see ahead for Union Pacific. But we are responding aggressively to the significant shortfall of demand we see today. Building off our success in 2008 we'll make further improvements to our safety and productivity, also providing customers with great service. Quality service supports our pricing plans, generates assets for our customers and opens up new markets. Part of that service commitment involves our capital plans. As Dennis discussed, the majority of this investment is going &#x2013; for ongoing track replacement and renewal, supporting safety, service and efficiency. In addition, we'll continue to make strategic investments for long-term growth.</p>
          <p>Although we aren't providing specific guidance, I can assure you that we are challenging ourselves to deliver another strong year. We've set the bar higher in every category during 2008. In 2009 and beyond, we're focused on delivering an even higher level of performance than ever before.</p>
          <p>So, with that we'll open it up to your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, Jim.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am wondering if you can comment a little bit on the tradeoff between volume and price. In the past you said, hey, we would be willing to walk from business and do the right thing for returns and margins, but with volumes doing what they're doing at some point the negative operating leverage from volume, I would think is going to have to play a role in your thinking, can you just talk about how that's evolving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Bill, we're still sticking with our philosophy here. If it doesn't meet our minimum return we're willing to walk from the business. And we have lost some business. We've won some when you look backwards here. Of course, when you're running down 18% on volume, which is what we're running right now, we're going to take a hard look at the future here. But our concentration right now is efficiency, getting costs out, making certain we are still very competitive. But again, I think long-term we have to be very careful here in terms of taking a short-term view at the expense of the long-term viability of our Company here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, does that apply as well to the cost side, so if you're dealing with down 18 to 20% volumes now, what are you re-sourcing for in terms of a volume change? I would think not that level because that would mean taking out quite a bit more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't -- listen, 18% right now through 21 days with full startup of the auto sector, many of our customers -- autos are obvious, but we saw really across our whole customer group there was a real slow startup going forward here. I've said before, again to try to predict the future here, I don't think 18% is realistic and where we're going to end up the year here at all, but you could end up with a smaller network with higher quality revenues and better returns. We are being very aggressive. We are assuming right now that this &#x2013; again it's going to be a very tough year, we are aggressive on the costs, but I'll also tell you we've got to protect for when the business does come back and it will and as you know we learned a pretty hard lesson in 2003 and '04 where we were short resources, so we are managing this thing to be aggressive, but be smart when business comes back.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Just one quick question on the end then, I guess two. Stockpiles, how are they? And number two, how much of your revenue is locked in for 2009 and for 2010?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Stockpiles are about where they should be at this time of the year and maybe across our broad base I would say they are about where they should be. We have some customers that have more coal than what they want at the moment. We also have some customers that would be interested in taking a little more coal, so it's kind of a balanced look. At this point in time we think coal demand is going to be fine and the second question was...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Revenues that are locked in, I would say at this point in time, Bill, we probably have 80% locked in and 50% -- 53% is just new legacy deals that we dealt with in 2008 that have a 2009 impact and then the balance of that would be either pricing decisions from the fourth quarter or previous legacy contracts that have escalation clauses that kick in at various points and times throughout the year. So, we are probably 80, 85% of our price in the market where it should be at this point in time.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Jason.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple quick questions here. You mentioned you weren't entirely successful on some of the coal contract pricing. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit &#x2013; was that the reference to the Great Plains energy ruling and maybe a loss in a little bit of business to CP or it that something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, I didn't say we were unsuccessful on pricing. What I said was that some of the contracts didn't go our way. In the old legacy deals that we had &#x2013; we had some business that basically was a winner-take-all deal that ended up on our franchise that when you really look at the rev structure and everything else that goes into it &#x2013; it's not our strong suit. So, the fact that we lost some business was not surprising. There were a couple of contracts that we didn't renew, some of it CP, others, it just kind of plays out over the life of the deal. We'll get another shot at those in a couple of years, but overall it really wasn't a surprise for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, and we do, as Jack indicated, even with some of that loss, it looks like we're going to be able to offset a big piece of that long-term. Again &#x2013; it boils down to the return. Some of these deals, you've got some pretty big spreads on the original legacy price than we are today and we're going to stay disciplined on what we accept in the railroad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So some of this is just you guys showing a willingness to walk away from some business at a certain price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as I said earlier we've lost some and we won some last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right, that's good color. If I could go back to the fuel surcharge lag, I don't know if I had missed this or not, but did you guys give the amount of lag impact for the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't believe we did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Jason we did not. It was a contributor, clearly, but we didn't give that number specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair enough. Also, in your capital spending outlook, I know you are down a little bit here from 2008, but if you don't see volumes recover, how quickly can you cut again and -- in other words, how much of this spending is going to be in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you run out of time here on your ability to cut it back, we may have a little more room out here, but again, we've got to be careful. This is a great time to put capital investment in the business. The efficiency, track time availability, price of materials that we see will start coming down. We are going to take a hard look at it here, but we will be smart about it. Keep in mind we've got 125 locomotives, about $250 million in that spend that, as you just saw from Dennis's chart, I don't need a locomotive next year and maybe next couple of years, but we are going to take them and try to get some value out of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, one more question and I'll hand it off to somebody else. How much push back have you been getting from some of the customers on some of the price increases, I mean obviously the environment out there is not too good as we've all seen the numbers out of the railroads, I'm just curious on sort of a real-time update from you guys on pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, obviously, and I've said this consistently, I haven't met a customer yet that said thanks for the price increase. But, what we are selling is the value proposition here. In terms of our service products we are delivering service that our customers haven't seen in many, many years. There is a value proposition there. So, again it's about service. Our customers are under pressure, but we've got to continue to help them take out cost. Jack, you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, you covered it pretty well -- as you said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, there is one other item here, Jason, which is the decline of fuel prices. At the end of the day, customers, they don't separate fuel surcharge from base rate. They just see their total rates. And we had a lot of pressure when fuel hit $150 a barrel last year with the run-up. Right now they are seeing their prices, real prices are moving down with the reduction of fuel surcharge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair point. Gentlemen, thank you so much for the time, as always.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jim. Can you talk a little bit about RCAF and what percentage of your contracts are RCAF right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to have Jackson take that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Ed, if you look at our book of business right now only about 10% uses RCAF as an escalator. Most of that is in the remaining legacy deals that we haven't been able to touch and for better or for worse, quite honestly, those don't include 100% of RCAF. So, as it turns out, RCAF is not a very big issue for me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that mostly coal at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, pretty much coal, there is up -- if you looked at that pie I showed you, coal and Intermodal are the two biggest players and that's where you see the RCAF impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay when you look at the pricing that's already complete for this year you obviously have pretty good visibility into it based on what you said. What does the RCAF look like, both net and gross of fuel? Obviously it's going to be negative gross, but what does it look like net of fuel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not certain we can give an answer to that, in terms of detail. So, I mean what -- you know obviously RCAF is moving down in total, that's out here, but there is a strong fuel component of that. I think core inflation in the railroads, though, is still going to be positive. Again, when you look at labor increases that have come through, some contract pricings that still have some pretty healthy price increases that are out here. So, I know that -- I can't give you the percent change here, but the components, clearly are moving opposite directions. Jack, do you want to add...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you just look at the first quarter RCAF, Ed, you see &#x2013; I think RCAF was down probably year-over-year in about the 3% range, but ALIF, which is RCAF without fuel, was actually up about a 0.5%. So, I think that kind of points out to you the fuel differential and says that the overall cost still had some inflationary impact for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed you know to me RCAF should be a zero-sum game over time. Right? And you've got a link, if your inflationary costs are going up or down, you're covering 100% -- that's the theory, 100%, unfortunately with some of our contracts we don't have 100% recovery of RCAF.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I get the zero sum game. The reason I'm asking is we've gotten a lot of questions since B&amp;E's call yesterday. They apparently reported, when you look at your 6% pure pricing that you talked about for the quarter, they had historically looked at that number including RCAF gross of fuel. When you look at that number at 6%, do you have included in that the RCAF contracts, and if so is it included &#x2013; I would guess it's net of fuel, not gross of fuel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My 5 to 6% includes the contracts that are escalated by RCAF and that's a core price increase. That does not reflect what happens on the fuel side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it's cosmetics, but I think it's important just so that people understand the yield, so that's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the operating ratio direction, I know you haven't given earnings guidance, but if we look at first quarter directionally, I'm guessing the operating ratio is going to be down year-over-year as you lose some of that headwind on the fuel. Is that a fair assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the operating ratio actually will, year-over-year, if you look anytime going from fourth to first, it tends to go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I'm looking year-over-year and first-over-first. So, if I look in my model in first quarter '07 your OR was 81.3. I am assuming it's going to be higher or deteriorated from there given fuel. Is that a fair assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, we are not providing guidance here on first quarter, but there will be some pressure, if you, again when you look at what's happening on volume that's out here that will be tough to offset.</p>

          <p>Okay, Jack you talked about extended plant closings in, over holidays and things like that.

          <p>Sure, we probably the most visible at this point in time is the automotive industry, given the concern that everyone has. Today in total we look at about 60 plants, today, this week we see probably 37% of that is still shut down, 63% open. That will decline over time, but it actually is a fairly moderate decline and it extents all the way into early March. We actually still believe, based on what our customers tell us, that we could have about 12 plants shut down that first week in March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and so by the end of March you think all 60 are open?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the end of March, of course there is a lot of time in between this and it depends on if people are going to start buying cars again but the indications are that people intend to reopen those facilities and have them operating, so that's what we're counting on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How about verticals, chemicals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The chemical plants are just starting to show some life. We just recently got some information from some plastic guys that they're resuming production and that's a pretty big decision on their part from the perspective that &#x2013; once you take a cracker down you don't open it up until you're feeling pretty good about your business model. So, we take that as a positive sign. The lumber side of the business, still we're not seeing much of an interest in opening up, although you have periodic pieces of information. At this point of time inventory levels are so low but the thing that offsets that, if you look at the ratio of inventory to sales. We were making some great progress all the way down into November and then that ratio went way up again and it wasn't because inventories spiked, it's because sales disappeared. So at the first sign of sales I think you could actually see some inventory rebuild start up and things could be a little better than what everybody thinks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you have any utilities that are shut?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't think of anybody that's shut down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the chemical side, once somebody makes the decision that we are going to reopen, how long does it take to physically reopen, give or take?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know the specifics on that, Ed. I think it depends on what the facility is, if it's fertilizer, if it's plastics, if it's whatever. And I don't know the technical side of how long it takes to open but &#x2013; the one experience we had, it was about three weeks from the time they told us until the time things started moving, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very helpful directionally. Can you talk a little bit about the timing, Dennis, the Sunset line completion now that that's been pushed out a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you remember, Ed, we were looking to target that somewhere in the 2011 timeframe. What we have slowed down is the double tracking of that. So, we'll do this 11 miles, finish off the 11 miles that we had started from '08 in '09. That leaves us at about 300 miles left to do, 60% done. And obviously we'll take a good hard look at that. Now we will be grated ahead about 80 miles, so that we can &#x2013; if we see business come back, go back out there and lay some more additional double track. So, we're probably pushed out at least two to three years, I would say, Ed, right now, but we're still going to be working on some of the terminal aspects of it, particularly some of the run-through facilities that we see are current bottlenecks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and last question. Total FTE is down about 4% year-over-year, what should that look like as you continue to right size towards volumes, is that a fair number going forward or is it going to be even lower when we look at first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the first quarter number probably is going to be in that 4, 5%. Again, Dennis had shown you we've got over 3,000 employees furloughed, number's probably going higher where we're at. That's out here. And again what you try to predict here is when you think there is going to be some turnaround. I'm not real optimistic this year, so we're being pretty conservative on our assumption about a return, but again you have to be prepared for when this thing comes back. You don't just automatically turn it on and off, but, so you'll see first quarter probably 4, 5% down.</p>

          <p>Okay. I'm sorry. I said that was my last one. One real last one. Jack, you talked about losing some coal business because you're sticking to pricing, the legacy stuff, which is part of the plan.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on, just one clarification, you mentioned around 80, 85% of your 2009 book is contracted or is priced in. Ballpark what percentage of your total book is contracted and balance that off against the remainder that is tariff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at our mix of business we have between 40 and 45% that's under a long-term multi-year contract. We have about, okay, I am going to start guessing here, about 20 to 25%, and it's probably closer to 20%, that is one year contract kind of letter quotes and things, and then the balance, 30-some percent would probably be in the tariff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's good. Next question is just on the some of the modal shift that you might be seeing regarding truck fuel prices coming down significantly, that you mentioned that's going to be a lower top line cost to your customer and clearly the truck reductions because of the higher fuel consumption on that mode is probably going to be even more pronounced. To the extent that you might have seen some traffic flow over to truck when we saw 140 oil, are you seeing any of that traffic going back to truck now that oil's &#x2013; now that fuel costs have come down significantly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have lost some business to truck here recently and it's interesting, it's for two reasons, one of which is the lower fuel prices have actually breathed some life into some small trucks that had been on the verge of going away. So, they now have new hope. So, they've got some pretty sharp rates in the marketplace. We've seen that particularly up and down the I-5 corridor and some of those locations. So that's one factor that has impacted us and the rest of the business is holding pretty solid. We are all kind of watching to see what happens here in terms of registrations. They have to get a new license for their tractors at about $4,000 a copy so we will see the staying power that we have there, overall. The other factor that we've seen that's probably been interesting for us is some business that shifted to truck and when we pushed back on the customer to determine the reason, they basically said, well we can put four truckloads in one rail car, but in today's financial markets I don't really want to carry the inventory from four truck loads. So I'll just buy it a truckload at a time until things &#x2013; things improve. So we've seen both of those, we've lost some business, but we are watching it pretty carefully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's good color. Now moving sort of to the inter-rail competition you've mentioned that one of the contracts didn't go your way, is there any sense of risk here that we are seeing increased price competition between the railroads based on what you've seen out there today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are not going to get into a lot of details on the specific pricing here. Clearly there are some markets that it's softer, I mean as Jack said the domestic Intermodal you've got some pressure there. That's out here but we are, we stand firm on what we require. It -- we had a great year in 2008. You start looking at the capital needs, you look at replacement costs of assets here, these returns need to go up. And we're going to be smart about understanding our, where our sweet spots are in our network and our margins here, but so far I'm not, we're not seeing a lot. There are just &#x2013; there is pockets that are out here, but we're sticking to our outlook here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...actually relate to the pension plan. You started the year underfunded like a lot of folks with a heavy equity allocation, I think you were close to 70%. Can you give us an update on the status of the pension, expected funding in '09, when you need to start thinking about that and positioning for it and I guess it still is early, but a rough estimate would point to a significant contribution needed to top off the plan, any thoughts or updates there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, as I mentioned at the year-end '08 we put a voluntary payment cash contribution of 200 million, in '09 we will work through that during the year, likely will be a contribution, but we haven't determined how much and exactly when.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keep in mind, though, our pension applies, again, the number of people, it's a pretty small proportion, it actually, I think applies to about 10%, 9% of our total workforce here.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, second piece of the question, was the debt raise you did late last year was the largest I believe of the class Is at 7.9%, a little higher than what we've seen from you guys in the past, does that debt raise cover what you've got expiring in 2009, will you need to swap out that debt when it comes due, or are you covered now, given the size of the raise late last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got -- as I mentioned we've got a $250 million payment due in the next two-three weeks and we are covered with that. Beyond that we will look at it and determine what the market is at the point in time that further debt is due.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, you haven't talked about the 3,000 employees you're going to furlough or have furloughed. What is the process there, how long do you keep them in furlough, do you have &#x2013; is there a contractual agreement that you have to keep them in the furlough for a certain amount of time before you can reduce your staff overall? Just wondering what kind of ongoing costs furloughed employees have relative to your on-book employees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, it varies by group, but I'll have Dennis talk &#x2013; the majority of those folks  right now are train and engine crew, but go ahead, Dennis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, on the TE&amp;Y side, which is the preponderance of that number, they come off the direct costs obviously right away, and we don't incur anything there. Now, there is some continuation of benefits out there for several weeks that, which would be somewhere close to probably $1,000 a month, something like that, per employee. And then we also have a temporary work arrangement that we put some of these under that we call AWATS, it's an alternative work and training that we pay them eight days a month, plus their benefits, so that we  always have a ready reserve and what we tie that to, the anticipated attrition rate for the next six months, is what we are working to there, so that if things do change, we do have that ready reserve that we can put them right back in play immediately and we make adjustments to that on a monthly basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, we chose to do the  AWATS, that was not a requirement in the agreements, and again, as Dennis said, it is an attempt to try to bridge the time there that we furlough and get them back to work. Now we also have our attrition, while it has slowed down a little bit, we are still going to probably see 5, 6% this year. So, again as we've said before with an aging workforce as you have and attrition rates kicking up, we are hoping we can, again, we literally are stopped hiring other than a couple specialized areas here. We can &#x2013; we can get people back to work as quick as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then is there, just wondering, if you are really seeing some increased costs from some of your competitors? Is there, is this an increasing amount of pricing competition you're seeing, you noted on the coal side, why not started calling out some of these, I guess losses to whoever is being the more aggressive, so investors can understand who is starting to see the -- or lead the pricing competition within the group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ken, it -- it is against the law here. I mean I know you don't literally mean call out what we are seeing here, but we are very careful in terms of what we do internally here. And again I don't see any dramatic change. I want to be careful here, you're seeing pockets we compete. At the end of the day, again, we've lost some but we've won some. And, but I don't see a huge change right now in terms of price pressure at this point. And, again, volumes in the railroad industry have been weak for three years. If you look at it, the recession started quite some time ago. So, we're just &#x2013; we're going to be smart about where we go here in terms of our returns long-term.</p>

          <p>A question in terms of productivity going forward, you've already had a very good trend in head count reduction, your fourth quarter, I guess Train started down 9%. That's a pretty impressive number and you're not quite keeping up with the decline in volumes, but you're not that far away. Is there risk that it's -- you're not able to keep up the pace of productivity and you've already kind of, you're getting a little bit to the end of some of the momentum on that, or do you think that there is really continued ability to have the productivity momentum in 2009 that you had in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tom, reduced volumes are going to put pressure on the business. There is just no question about it and running 18% down year-over-year on volume is going to put pressure on productivity. We're focusing on a lot of things. You recall we've got a project OR, operating ratio initiative that we're looking at and that's been in place for several years now. We're putting a lot of pressure there to take a look at our costs. <mark type="inaudible" /> had great success there, that's out here. We have technology deployment that we're continuing to push on. Dennis showed $150 million technology investment this year, part of that's productivity. Our process initiatives we have, as you know, really it's called Lean Management, industrial  engineering, that is, really continues to show us opportunities for productivity.</p>
          <p>I will tell you, the head count reductions matched with volume, we have to continue to do, but long-term our target here is we want to be handling more volume with fewer resources. And -- you got to struggle, this whole industry, if the pace of falloff continues, we're not going to be able to keep up with it. We're going to be very aggressive on it, we're going to prepare ourself for when this thing turns back, that we don't wake up someday and realize -- I don't have enough people to move trains, so we're going to keep at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a way that you can think about the kind of ratio between the two, and I know part of it is, how well you can actually forecast the volumes so you can set the resources accordingly. But if volumes end up down 10% on a full-year basis, would you expect head count in, let's say, Train starts to be off at half that level, or can you be closer to volume down 10, Train starts down 8 or 9?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our rule of thumb is probably, I think variable costs may be 30 to 50% when you think about it, all right? Again, fuel is going to be highly variable to, highly correlated to volume, our other costs will be lower. So, our rule of thumb is 30 to 50%. I'll tell you one of the things we're seeing right now, not only capital investment, the productivity, re-crew rates, cycle time, you're generating assets here, that's out here. And we're just going to keep very aggressive on our costs, we will be smart about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think there is maybe upside to, I think you said maybe in the first quarter head count down 5%, but if you're down 10% in volumes for full year, do you think you can be down further than that in head count?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I think we would -- we're down 10%, we're going to be down more than 4 or 5% on head count.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And as you look at '09, you've got to get some obvious unfavorables, but a few favorables. So you got &#x2013; you're saying that you're still going to get 5 to 6% price, you've got under-covered on fuel surcharge. So, you should get some net benefit from lower fuel, and then you got the operating leverage and lower volume. Is there a volume level where you'd say if we're in this range, we think those positives and negatives offset and we can have kind of flattish earnings? Is there a way you can think about that that if it's kind of down 5%, maybe you can get flat-on earnings? If it's down 10, then that becomes a lot harder.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, I said I wasn't going to provide financial guidance here, but I would just ask you to think about the positives, you just listed them, that are out here. Pricing, productivity, out here, energy costs. Don't forget, you not only have diesel costs, but we've got a lot of other energy costs in the business that are coming down. How that plays against volume, it's a tough call. We're going to do everything we can to have, relatively speaking a very good year for us financially.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of my questions were asked, so just a few housekeeping questions. On the locomotive purchases in '09, can you just run through those numbers, I saw the 400 million in Locomotive and Equipment, but I missed the number of locomotives and the dollar spend on those standalone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's 125 locomotives, bigger price tag, about 2.1 or so, 2.2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gotcha. And then you had talked about some of the modal shift you're experiencing in Intermodal losses to truck. Can you talk about -- is that pure price? In other words, traditionally, we've thought about railroads being priced at some discount, and we've heard ranges anywhere costing to 15 or 40% relative to truck. The modal shifts that you are experiencing, is that purely based on price? In other words, are the trucks coming down to the traditional rail rates, and then losing it or is there a service element there as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jackson, you want to take the price question there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, for the most part, as I said to the earlier question, some of it is price, some of it is, they just don't want the inventory carrying costs associated with the much larger shipment. The one thing we have going for us is our service and the service improvement that we've seen. So, if you're looking at discounts to market, if you look at something like over the Sunset corridor, L.A. to Dallas and things like that, our discount to truck is probably in the 10 &#x2013; Chicago to Laredo, our discount to truck is probably 15%, something like that. L.A. to Chicago more like 20% today. So, we're watching the marketplace very carefully. And I think that our service improvement plays very strongly in our favor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no question on the service piece when you look at, we put new products into the market. But also keep in mind with customers, you've got to prove it over time. You've got to be consistent in terms of your service delivery. And I will tell you it's making a big difference in terms of how our customers are viewing the rail products that are out here in the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then one last question, you talked about the percentage of your business to roughly 20% that are on one-year contracts. When we think about 2010, when will you start talking to those customers about the 2010 pricing on that 20% of your book of business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It goes all throughout the year. I can't tell you that it's any one quarter dominates. I would say a lot of it probably comes most closely to year-end. But, I wouldn't say, it's any more than 30, 40% of that amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it safe to assume that that piece of your overall book of business is, those discussions might be more vigorous in terms of repricing? I think you had mentioned earlier you never met a customer who didn't like a price increase. But, are those &#x2013; are those the toughest conversations? Is that where you get the most pushback or is it pretty consistent across your book of business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all of my pricing discussions are vigorous with lots of pushbacks. So, I don't see it very different. They are not a heck of a lot different than negotiating a multi-year contract or a tariff increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, the key on the discussion, again keep in mind some of these, where you -- is, where is the value, not only the service product, but what other products should there be   &#x2013; what does it mean to the customer. When you're turning assets, and many of these quarters like we are today, you have customers that, who may own a real assets, but step back and  look at it where they can take millions of dollars out of their logistics costs. So, all that comes into play and as Jack said, none of them are ever easy in the discussions but we've got some great products that we have out there today that really do provide value.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>More questions for Rob. The tax rate this year was around 36%, can you give us some sense as to 2009? And then you mentioned about the $250 million or roughly that number that you got sort of accelerated depreciation, how should we think about these deferred taxes for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randy, from a cash tax rate going forward I would just use kind of similar to what we had experienced in 2008. From a bonus depreciation -- what I'd mentioned on the benefit we got from -- bonus depreciation in 2008, I think that's what you're referring to, is about $225 million. Looking forward we haven't given that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you see, like for modeling purposes, when we think about sort of &#x2013; what we should put in the deferred tax line. Can you give us some help in terms of &#x2013; should we go back to what we used in 2007 or should we assume that the ratio of deferred to the total accrual stays the same.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Congratulations on the safety performance &#x2013; you guys have made tremendous strides over the last few years on safety. Looking to 2009, is there some opportunity to again reduce the accruals for safety, or for workers compensation &#x2013; or not workers compensation, but for the whole sort of accrual process that you've got for employee injuries, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randy, there is and again, we've got to continue to focus on our performance, Dennis has set some aggressive goals. We've got good programs in place, our total safety culture is one that we have introduced and we are hoping we can -- we should see good trends.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randy, I am going to stay away from that in terms of order of magnitude, I would just tell you, though that you still have within, in our company, a pretty substantial cost item related to safety failures whether you're talking about employees, whether you are talking about derailments, whether you're talking about public safety, and we've got great progress, we're going to continue at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack, one question for you, there is a lot of skepticism about the railroad industry's ability to get 5 to 6% based on price increases. When you think about your 5 to 6, how much of that 5 to 6 would be re-pricing of legacy contracts from last year in terms of the year-over-year comp issue? And I guess, the other thing I was kind of looking for was some sense of granularity in terms of the 5 to 6, so for example, do you still see getting 5 to 6% in Intermodal or do you make more in some category and less in others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as we look at it Randy, we've said before in our conference with security analysts last year, that we expected to get 3 to 4% plus a 2% pick-up from legacies, and so in total that's kind of the way we look at it. Our 5 to 6% right now, about 55% of that comes from new legacy renewals that we did in 2008, and that's their impact in 2009. So, it's about 55% of my 5 to 6% for this year. And then also in there you would have other legacies that were done before 2008 that have escalation, and plus our tariff pricing and our other pricing. In terms of the individual groups, it's pretty difficult to say. It's really market-by-market, lane-by-lane that's looks -- and so in some pricing corridors we're able to get more than 5 to 6, and others we're taking less and we are just watching the market very carefully and working with our customers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Last question. God, I think, was short your stock last year in terms of floods, landslides and hurricanes. You guys mentioned to getting insurance recoveries as a benefit for previous years. Looking at 2009, are you in disputes with any of your insurance companies and do you see a situation where you're going to get an insurance settlement in 2009?</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randy, I still have my Board Meeting in a couple of weeks. But at the end of the day we had a great year, one of the best years in the history of the Company. We're going to reward the management team for that performance that's out here. 2009 is a different situation, in terms of how you look. So, there were no changes in bonus accruals in terms -- for fourth quarter and we're taking a hard look at &#x2013; we're making some tough decisions right now in 2009.</p>

          <p>Just a quick clean up for maybe Rob or Dennis. When you talk about the &#x2013; the folks on furlough, I assume the folks in the AWATS program are immediately available, that's the whole point of it. For folks that aren't, how long does it take to get them back into active service, do they have to go through a full training regimen again?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, Gary it depends on how long they've been off, but I'd say a maximum 30 days. We usually try and get them back and get them back into the fold. So, that's why we try and peg the immediacy of AWATS to the &#x2013; to the anticipated attrition rates, so that we can have them readily available, as you said, and then the rest would probably be about a 30 day lag.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then just two for Jack if I could, just wanted to clarify, you said earlier, I think it was Ed Wolfe asked you about whether or not RCAF &#x2013; if I can phrase this right, the impact of fuel on RCAF is included within your 5 to 6% core price increase and I think, I heard you say 'No'. So, that means, whatever fuel does to RCAF, positive or negative, that's not going to affect what you report to us as your core price gain. Is that accurate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we try to exclude fuel and try as best we can to come up with the core price calculations. But again, RCAF is not a very big factor in our book of business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then &#x2013; so good segue into the last question. When you think about the business that is not RCAF, can you give us any color for what that is? Is it RCAF ex-fuel plus the surcharge? Does it have nothing to do with RCAF? What's in there when you think about contracts that are not rolling, that are progressing year-to-year, how do we think about what the escalation clauses in there are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is an RCAF component that's about 10%, you've got an ALIF plus fuel surcharge component, and then you have fixed price increases that we've negotiated with customers in terms of just how, over the length of the contract, we would escalate the pricing of the deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Any sense of what ALIF plus fuel surcharge is? Is that a significant percentage of the non-RCAF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would &#x2013; okay, my guess is ALIF plus fuel surcharge is probably in the neighborhood of 10% &#x2013; 10 to 15% of our base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so 10 for straight RCAF, 10 to 15 for that, and then the rest is other escalation clauses you have negotiated over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
