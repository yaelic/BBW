          <p>I am pleased to be back in London with you today. 2009 has been a strong year for us, not only regarding the financial results, but also in qualitative terms. Above all is the completion of the Genentech integration, but also in terms of strengthening our industry-leading pipeline.</p>
          <p>As you have seen this morning, we have achieved the targets we have set ourselves last year. We have outgrown our respective markets in both divisions, in Pharmaceuticals and in Diagnostics, just grown twice as fast as the market, with 10% growth in local currencies on a Group level. The growth in Pharmaceuticals, of course, was very much boosted by Tamiflu. However, if you look into Oncology, which now accounts for more than 50%, you also see a very robust growth there with 8%. Seen an excellent growth in Diagnostics, if you consider that the market is growing between three to 4%, this is an outstanding result.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the P&amp;L, you can see that the operating profit before exceptional items, the underlying business has grown by 14% in constant currencies, that is stronger than the sales, so again we improved our operational efficiency. I would like to point out that the net income before exceptional items attributable to Roche shareholders has already been up by 9% in the first year, so the Genentech transaction indeed was already accretive within the first year of this transaction. And you see this also reflected on the core EPS line, with a 10% growth in Swiss francs and a 20% growth in local currencies. So, let me stress again the huge impact we have seen for the 2009 results, due to the Forex fluctuations. Since the core EPS in Swiss francs, only half of what it has been in local currencies, and you see a similar development for the growth in operating profit for both divisions, Pharma and Diagnostics. Now I point this out because we are the only company, which reports in Swiss francs. All our peers report in other currencies, be it U.S. dollars, pounds or euros, and of course results look very different in those reporting currencies.</p>
          <p>As part of the Genentech integration, we have reviewed our supply chain management and we decided to reduce inventories at our wholesalers. This has led to a destocking in key markets in the U.S. and other markets, with a substantial impact on the sales growth in the fourth quarter. You can see here a 4% impact in terms of fourth quarter Pharma sales, but what is important to emphasize is that the <mark type="inaudible" /> data remain very strong, if you look at the IMS data, the trend is very solid and we also had a good start into 2010 after this process has been completed at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>The sales growth, of course, is and remains the starting point, but it is equally important that we bring it down to the bottom line and you will note that we have again over-proportionally increased our operating free cash flow in 2009 and you can observe the same fixture for core EPS. And, of course, we remain committed to further productivity improvements.</p>
          <p>Let me just say a word to the Genentech integration, which we have completed at the end of last year. We are extremely happy about the progress which we made within a very short time. And I think the secret behind the success of this integration was really the clarity in terms of how we wanted to go ahead with this integration.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, keep a diversity of approaches, in the early part of the value chain for research and early development, and on the other hand, bring together in the line, the global functions make use of our global scale of our global reach in product development, marketing and manufacturing. And I think this clarity, which we brought into the organization from day one was also a key reason why the top people from Genentech stayed on board.</p>
          <p>And I'd like to share here a slide with you, which is one of my favorite slide actually, and that shows you the results of an external survey, which Genentech regularly does. On the qualitative side, when we actually talked with this external company, they were double-checking the numbers because they couldn't believe it. They literally said they have never seen such data in the face of an integration.</p>
          <p>I want to work here for a long time, 86% of the Genentech people said that this. This survey was done end of quarter three last year. That puts Genentech into the league of the top hundred companies in the U.S. And I intend to stay with the company at least one year. I'm committed to the success of the merged company, ratings with over 90%. This is really outstanding and I believe it speaks to the success of this integration. You can also see it in quantitative terms. Fluctuation rates are today lower than they have been before we did the announcement of the Genentech transaction.</p>
          <p>I said this is one of my favorite slides. Probably now here comes my most favorite slide and that is about the portfolio and the progress we made in the pipeline. I believe this is really a unique picture in the industry. There's no other company in the industry which could show you a pipeline with ten new molecular entities in late stage development. This is ten out of 59 new molecular entities and we have an additional 30 important line extensions, new indications for existing products in late stage development.</p>
          <p>Now this development, you see from 2007 we had still two NME's, to ten NME's now over the last three years. This development of course resided in a substantial increase in research and development. Naturally as you move the programs forward into late-stage, costs go up. And this is also reflected in the strong increase which we have seen in 2009. Having said this, this increase is also influenced by impairment, which we took in the context of a <mark type="inaudible" /> of our combined portfolio between Genentech and Roche. And importantly, as we look forward into 2010, we have now seen the peak in the ramp up for important products, namely in Oncology and Metabolism, above all Avastin, where a number of important new indications have come to an end in terms of the Phase III trials, and that makes us confident that we now can stabilize R&amp;D costs as we go forward. Actually we guide you for a slight decline as we go into 2010.</p>
          <p>Let me just take this opportunity also to do a bit of promotion for our Investor Day in March when we will have a possibility to talk about the strategy in more depth, also about the progress in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>As we go forward into 2010, we intend to grow our sales for the Group and Pharma in the mid-single digits, again in Diagnostics significantly above the market. We expect to realize our synergies, as we guided you last year of 800 million in 2010 and then reach one billion Swiss francs on an ongoing basis as of 2011. As I mentioned, R&amp;D investment should slightly decline for 2010, core EPS should grow again in the double digits and we will step by step reduce our debt until 2015 and also maintain an attractive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And with this, I would like to hand over to Pascal.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Severin, and good afternoon, everybody. It's really a pleasure to be here, first of all to experience a little bit of this beautiful English weather, but also because 2009 was really a great year for us in the Pharmaceutical division, it was a great job from a financial viewpoint, but also was a good year from the point of view of the data, the data flow, the clinical trials that we delivered throughout the year. And Severin was referring to the merger with Genentech. I think it is easy to forget the amount of disruption that this merger, of course, created. I have to say, now it's all behind us. And as Severin told you, everybody is on board very well motivated, but of course, a merger of this magnitude creates a lot of change. And in the midst of this change, we actually didn't see any project being delayed. And that's really a testimony to the people both at Genentech and Roche and the passion they have for the work they do developing these products.</p>
          <p>So, maybe starting with the financials, you have, by now, probably seen them already. The Pharmaceutical division grew by 11% in local currency. And you see here good growth across the various regions. Now, one question, of course, that you would ask yourself is about &#x2013; is what about Q4 and especially what about the Q4 excluding Tamiflu. So let me address this up front. We actually prepared a little chart here that reconciles what the underlying growth of our business is, if you exclude Tamiflu, but also if you exclude this inventory adjustment effect that Severin was talking about a minute ago, but also the one-off impact of losing CellCept to patent expiry. And if you actually recalculate this, you have a growth rate of 5%.</p>
          <p>Let me say a few words about this inventory adjustment in Q4. Now, as we actually went through the merger in the United States between Roche and Genentech, one of the things, of course, we had to look at was our manufacturing capacity on a global basis and also our supply chain as a consequence, our supply chain all the way down to our customers. We had to talk to our customers and we had to, in fact, to reassess things that we had been doing for many years without really trying to rethink completely the way we were actually distributing our products. And clearly, our customers don't really want to run very high inventory, our products are expensive, cash is king and they don't want high inventory. And we found that we could actually run the whole business in the U.S. with lower inventory.</p>
          <p>We harmonized our policy across Roche and Genentech and that led to a lower inventory level at the wholesaler and specialty distributor level. So that reduction exists for the Genentech products, the Genentech legacy products, but it's more limited, but Roche used to run slightly higher inventory levels. So for the Roche legacy products in the U.S. the impact is greater.</p>
          <p>So having concluded that we actually should do this in the United States and run a leaner supply chain and a more efficient business, we actually looked at it around the world and decided that in no country we wanted to have more than 30 days of inventory at the wholesaler or distributor level. And there were a few countries like Mexico, Brazil and others &#x2013; and China and others where we had historically run 40 to 45 days of inventory because historically that's what the market needed, but we concluded we can live with less. And so we harmonized those policies on a global basis. That leads to a one-off impact in Q4. And I really want to emphasize a one-off impact. Of course we've reset our policy and it doesn't mean that our Q1 sales or next year's sales will be positively impacted, it is just resetting the policy and moving forward we'll run on lower inventory in the U.S. but also in a number of countries around the world.</p>
          <p>So that's the 4% &#x2013; 4.4% impact on growth in quarter four that you see represented here. And of course, again if you exclude CellCept and Raptiva, you have this growth rate of 5%. And this is very much in line with the guidance that we gave you for 2010. So we believe that the underlying business is actually still on track. And I will come back to this in a minute, looking at more demand data, prescription-driven data.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at our P&amp;L, this 11% growth in sales led to a 15% growth in operating profit. What I think this P&amp;L here tells you is, it actually tells you what we are trying to focus on. We're trying to actually control our cost of goods, and our people in 2009 did a great job managing these manufacturing costs and the cost of goods. We're also trying to manage our M&amp;D expenses. As you can see here they grew by 6%. And we also are working hard on managing and reducing our G&amp;A costs everywhere we can. You see here a reduction by 11% and in great part this is linked to the synergies we could identify between Roche and Genentech. The fact that we relocated the commercial organization to one site and then leveraged our systems across the United States.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, we have been investing very heavily in R&amp;D. Our model is very focused on innovation, we are very focused on developing drugs that really make a difference and are differentiated, and we've been investing not only in research but also in development, as you know very well, so that is reflected in the 13% increase in R&amp;D you see here. And net net of all of these a 15% growth in operating profit.</p>
          <p>Now if I look at a little bit of the data that we actually released in 2009, you can see here that it was a &#x2013; 2009 was a very rich year from the point of view of the data. I won't go through this entire slide. I'd just like to signal a couple of very significant ones. PRIMA, that certainly will help us boost the growth of MabThera/Rituxan in iNHL first line maintenance, more in Europe and the rest of the world than in the United States, I have to say, because we already have some spontaneous adoption in the U.S. in that setting. But certainly a nice boost for the rest of the world. Also Avastin, the RIBBON-2 in 2nd line mBC, HER2-positive gastric cancer. As you probably saw, we got approval in Europe a few days ago. So this was a fast track approval and certainly a very &#x2013; an indication that we will have a very substantial impact on the Herceptin outside Europe in the United States, especially in Asia and China and Japan. In Japan we expect two to $300 million out of this indication, Korea, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Maybe let me mention also Taspoglutide of this very rich chart. Only want to say that every single study that read out late last year hit its primary endpoint. So, so far, so good and we are well on track with Taspoglutide, we'll have more data later this year, but we're very happy with what we saw so far.</p>
          <p>Now we had also a very substantial number of filings. First of all around Avastin in breast cancer, RIBBON-1 and AVADO in the U.S. and RIBBON-1 in the EU. You will probably remember AVADO was filed in the EU this fall and we actually have a approval for docetaxel in the European label already. We filed in the U.S. and we're expected to hear from the FDA later this year.</p>
          <p>CLL, first line and CLL relapse in the U.S. and Europe. We are expecting to get approval from the FDA in the United States for these indications any time now. It should really come any day. We are very hopeful that it should not be delayed too much.</p>
          <p>Gastric cancer, Herceptin, I've talked about it for Europe and certainly it will follow in the U.S. later. Now, if I actually look at the Oncology franchise for a few minutes, Oncology now represents about 50% of our global sales. That franchise is growing by about 8%, essentially driven by Avastin of course, but certainly also by Herceptin, <mark type="inaudible" /> the other products. You can see here that we certainly expect strong growth for all brands in the international regions outside the U.S. and Europe. I say all brands because Herceptin is still growing very strongly in non-U.S. and non-Europe, MabThera too and Avastin has a long way to go, a lot of potential outside the U.S and Europe. In the U.S. and Europe, certainly the growth of Herceptin and MabThera will be more moderate as we move forward and we would have to rely on Avastin to a greater extent. MabThera still in Europe as I mentioned, we need to grow, has upside in Europe through the CLL indication, but also the maintenance indication later on.</p>
          <p>Now interestingly, if you look at Avastin, Herceptin and MabThera, and you compare what we sell in the U.S. and also outside the United States, you can see here that on the left-hand side of this graph, Avastin in 2009 grew by 31% outside the U.S. and 14% in North America. And you can see also here a stronger growth rate for both MabThera and Herceptin outside North America.</p>
          <p>And on the right-hand side what this graph actually reflects is the fact that Herceptin sales are generated about &#x2013; two-third of the sales are generated outside the U.S., only one-third in the United States, and we're still experiencing strong growth outside the U.S. The 9% growth outside the U.S. you see here for Herceptin reflects a slightly lower growth rate in Europe and certainly much higher growth rate in the rest of the world. So, we still have more to go with Herceptin. But essentially the point of this graph is to show you that if we were able to do the same with MabThera and Avastin that we've achieved with Herceptin, I grow those products outside the U.S to the same extent we still have a lot of potential. And I have no doubt that we can do it with both MabThera, but also Avastin. So this franchise still has quite some way to go.</p>
          <p>In the spirit of transparency, we decided to show you what we call the OUT, and the OUTs are reflecting the demand sales, the kind of prescription sales, if you want, that we track on a routine basis, actually on a weekly basis in the United States and I've reflected here four products Avastin, Lucentis, Herceptin and MabThera, I should say Rituxan. And the point here is that you can see, of course, Herceptin and MabThera have more modest growth rate. They are growing, but growing more slowly. And you see here Avastin is still growing. You see at the end of the year a great volatility, which is linked to the number of days of invoicing days. You see a rapid ramp-up of Lucentis, which is in part due to the fact that at the end of last year, CMS challenged the way that we are reimbursing Avastin for a period of time and Lucentis definitely benefited from this.</p>
          <p>But I guess the message here for you is, when you look at the minus 3% of quarter four and you hear our explanations about stock variations, of course it would be good to have a certain level of skepticism. So, you can see here the world is not falling apart, MabThera and Herceptin are growing, slowly of course, but they are growing in the U.S. &#x2013; in the United States. Avastin is on a good trend and Lucentis is also on a good trend. So those demand sales certainly reflect the fact that the ex-factory sales you saw are influenced by these inventory valuation we were referring to before. Now, for Avastin and Rituxan you see here on a quarterly basis, the ex-factory sales growth compared to the prescription, the demand growth. And you can see here that in quarter four Avastin grew by 11% from a demand viewpoint, a prescription viewpoint, even though the ex-factory sales reported to you only showed a 3% growth.</p>
          <p>And for MabThera/Rituxan we showed a decline and ex-factory sales even though from a demand volume viewpoint in the marketplace, we experienced a 1% growth rate.</p>
          <p>Now, so if I look at Avastin and look forward to 2010, we still have a rich news flow to come. 2010 will be a very busy year for Avastin, we have data coming out for gastric cancer, we have data coming out for adjuvant colon cancer &#x2013; it's our second study and the Avon study that we will read out in 2010.</p>
          <p>And we have data in ovarian cancer and prostate cancer that we'll also read that in 2010. I just want to attract your attention to one very interesting study on this graph, the GOG-0218 study in ovarian cancer because that study compares two different lengths of treatment for Avastin. As you probably remember, we are very convinced that the treatment duration is &#x2013; a longer treatment duration with Avastin will deliver better patient care.</p>
          <p>And that study has a six month of Avastin arm and the other arm with 15 months. And so, we think it is a very intriguing study that should bring some additional light to these discussion around the appropriate treatment duration for Avastin. You look at Rituxan now, as I said a bit earlier, we have growth opportunities in the international region, but in the maintenance setting in the EU, we only have 10% penetration today in maintenance.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; in the EU &#x2013; in the U.S., sorry, the spontaneous adoption is almost close to 70%. So that really tells you that in Europe, we have quite a way to go in a maintenance setting, we also have growth potential in CLL, less because we already been growing in Europe, we had about 55%, but we still have some way to go.</p>
          <p>And finally, in Rheumatoid Arthritis there is some way to go too in Europe and in particular we have about 30% of these so-called biologic insufficient response segment, and we now need to move MabThera to earlier lines of treatment and extend that penetration as a whole. So the major growth opportunities for those products, for Avastin, as I mentioned we need to grow ovarian, prostate and gastric. We have communicated before peak sales potential of about 9 billion Swiss francs for Avastin in approved existing indications. Those three additional indications &#x2013; ovarian, prostate and gastric &#x2013; each have depending on the strength of the clinical data, clinical results have a potential between 250 million up to 1 billion. So a very substantial, potential, of course this is science, this biology medicine, you can never say what is going to work or not work. So those three studies may not all work, or may not each work, but certainly, a very substantial potential for Avastin here.</p>
          <p>With MabThera, I've talked about CLL and the maintenance and we just sit and talked about the emerging market and certainly the potential of the gastric indication in Japan, in Asia overall, and still in Europe, even though in the United States the potential is more limited.</p>
          <p>If I move on to inflammation and the auto-immune transplantation franchise, we were negatively impacted in 2009 by the loss of patent for CellCept in the United States. The team there did a great job and we actually stabilized our prescription share to 30%, it is still declining, but slowly. But despite this, of course we had a substantial impact on sales of CellCept in the U.S.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, ACTEMRA is doing very well in Europe. We got approval early 2009. We got a major <mark type="inaudible" /> in Germany. So the only real example of a market where we've had full commercialization for a year is really Germany, because the other countries in Europe, got reimbursement later in 2009. And in Germany we're doing very well and we just got approval in the U.S., as you know.</p>
          <p>Let me just say a few words about ACTEMRA because I'm sure you are interested in knowing how it's going. As I said in Germany, it is doing very well. We have by Q4 2009, we have secured 14% share of the biologic IR market, which is a pretty substantial result in a short period of time. And in totality today in Germany, in between MabThera and ACTEMRA, we have close to 50% of the biologic insufficient responder segment. And in fact ACTEMRA has not negatively impacted MabThera. They are both growing, the product that has been the most impacted in Germany is actually Orencia.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. we have a label, which we consider a good label. The one thing that we are really pleased about is we have a <mark type="inaudible" />, which is kind of a standard <mark type="inaudible" /> if you want. We could have had a more restrictive one at some point. We have a very standard one for this, so this is very good news. We only have TNF-IR's indication, we don't have yet DMARD-IR. This is really not a problem in Europe. In fact we see that as we expected, most of the use today is in TNF-IR, for biologic IR for ACTEMRA, we expected the same in the U.S. In fact the benefit of this indication, to be frank, is really that the sales force is going to be able to focus completely on this TNF-IR indication. There's a lot data supporting ACTEMRA and the danger is to kind of get lost a little bit in that forest of data. So very focused. The sales force very motivated. We launched two weeks ago and so far the feedback is very good.</p>
          <p>In virology, the franchise was essentially driven by Tamiflu. 3.2 billion francs of sales in 2009. And in 2010, we expect about 1.2 billion. So it's a decline of 2 billion, which of course has a substantial negative impact on our top line in 2010. Of this 1.2 billion, a little bit more than a half, about 55% should be coming from pandemic sales, the rest is seasonal.</p>
          <p>This is a busy slide, I don't want to go through it. I just wanted to say with Taspoglutide, we have a very broad program, as you can see here, lots of studies. Every study that has read out so far has hit its endpoint, as I said a bit earlier. Maybe the second key message for Taspoglutide on this chart is that the carcinogenicity study didn't show us anything that prevented us from progressing this compound in Phase III. So we are full steam ahead, moving through our Phase III program, and very happy with the way the product is developing. Of course now we have to wait for the results of T-emerge-8, our cardiovascular sepsis study. It will be driven by how fast we recruit and the event rate, but I can tell you that the team is very focused on getting this recruitment going very quickly.</p>
          <p>We have 10 new molecular entities in going <mark type="inaudible" /> to start late-stage this year in 2010. I won't go through this full list. I think the message here I want to leave you with is that all these products are either first in their class or best in their class. And in fact most of them are first in their class. If you look at pertuzumab, if you look at T-DM1, if you look at GA101 and CLL, NHL, if you look at dalcetrapib, with dalcetrapib, one study that is not here represented is our study on atherosclerosis. We have another study in also high risk diabetes patients with ACS, and looking at atherosclerosis, the effect on atherosclerosis and we could then extend our indication. So all these products really are first in class, best in class. And what that reflects is our focus on moving forward into Phase III products that really are differentiated. So that's the &#x2013; that is going to be moving forward &#x2013; has been, but it would be even moreso in the future our focus, and our focus will be prioritizing our portfolio and only moving those products that really can make a big difference to the way patients are treated.</p>
          <p>In 2010, these are our key objectives. You can see a very rich year, maybe attracting your attention to Avastin and those studies in ovarian, gastric and prostate. And also one thing that is not listed here is the fact that we expect approval for Avastin in China. So this is going to be great news for Avastin and then for our Chinese products to be able to launch and the patients there to be able to launch this product.</p>
          <p>We are going to file also &#x2013; planning to file second line breast cancer, ovarian, gastric. We would file our PRIMA data in first line maintenance, Ocrelizumab in RA and Xeloda in adjuvant breast cancer. So as you can see here, another very busy year for us in the Pharmaceutical division of Roche, Genentech. Overall, if you exclude Tamiflu, we expect single digit &#x2013; mid-single digit sales growth and of course we will have to on top of this absorb the negative impact of Tamiflu.</p>
          <p>Thank you so much, and I will hand over to Dan now.</p>

          <p>Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's indeed a great pleasure to be presenting to you here today, for many of you for the first time, on the financial results for Diagnostics for 2009. And I know I have a challenge here, I have a challenge because perhaps most of you are most interested in the Pharma sector, that's the first reason. And secondly, because it's a late Wednesday afternoon in February. Well, what I'd like to do is have you leave here caring more about Diagnostics and not less about Pharma, but more about Diagnostics and for two reasons, because I believe Roche is uniquely positioned in the field of Diagnostics to take advantage of the trends in in-vitro diagnostics. And the second reason is because I think there is a true competitive advantage to having Diagnostics within the Roche group and being able to share really the science, the innovation, access to clinical trials and there's benefit I believe on both sides of the equation. So in the next 15 minutes, I will try to expose you a bit to Diagnostics at Roche and also explain some of the financial results and what we expect for the future.</p>
          <p>The first thing to say is that Roche Diagnostics is the clear worldwide leader in in-vitro diagnostics, by far in fact, in terms of the marketplace. And in 2009 in fact, we grew more than two times the market rate. So the market rate grew at about three to 4% and Roche Diagnostics grew at 9%. And you can see that all of the businesses that we participate in led to that growth and contributed to that growth. Probably the most significant of course was our Professional Diagnostics business, which is our clinical chemistry immunoassay business in the large central labs, which grew at 9% around the world.</p>
          <p>I'll explain a little bit more about the rationale behind the growth in the next couple of slides. Quickly turning our attention to the P&amp;L, we grew our operating profit by 12% in 2009 and this was driven by a couple of key factors. Number one, the growth in sales, of course, the top line growth. But in addition, we had several efficiency programs, cost improvement programs within the division that you see here have contributed to cost management in several of our P&amp;L lines, like G&amp;A, M&amp;D and also the R&amp;D lines.</p>
          <p>Now we had some intangible asset impairment that affected both our R&amp;D line as well as our cost of sales line. And the other thing that affects our cost of sales line for 2009 was the placement of our instruments. We had very successfully placed new instruments in our Diagnostics business and that of course does affect the cost of sales line, but I'll show you also the competitive advantage that it brings us in the marketplace. Now we're firmly committed to continuing to improve the profit margins in the Diagnostics business, and the initiatives that we started this year, we will firmly continue on for this next year and I expect this profit margin to continue to grow into the future as well.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of what drives our business in each of the business areas, as I said before Professional Diagnostics, our largest business had the immunoassay reagents growing three times the marketplace. That was due to a large extent to the introduction of our HPV assay on the Professional Diagnostics platform, which allowed us also to have complementary menu put out there on our instrumentation in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>In our Diabetes Care business, in a market that was affected significantly by the economic environment, it's a consumer business, it basically had a flat growth rate in the market for 2009, we grew by 6%. And that was thanks to the continued placement of our Accu-Chek Aviva and Performa lines and more and more of the concept of this continuum of care in diabetes care, which allows for both diabetes monitoring and insulin delivery to be integrated into a patient's care.</p>
          <p>In Molecular Diagnostics, we grew by both continuing to penetrate the blood screening segment and we were successful at launching our cobas 4800 platform, which is the platform that we will compete with with HPV and CT/NG, major areas of growth for the Molecular Diagnostics business. And this platform will also become the platform that we'll use for Companion Diagnostics and Microbiology in the future.</p>
          <p>And then we see our Applied Science business, another part of the Diagnostics business that was affected by the economic environment, predominantly because that's sales of instruments into the academic and research centers, which had some reduction in spending, particularly in the United States market in 2009. But we were able to continue our placement of instruments in that, grow that business by 15%, and particularly take advantage of being fast to market with an influenza assay for the swine flu, the H1N1 virus, which was a research use assay, used out there in many countries around the world to track of the influenza virus.</p>
          <p>And then finally Tissue Diagnostics, Ventana, as it was called, grew more than 29%. And this was due to the strategy behind the acquisition, which was really twofold. One was to bring a new technology into our group, a technology that's also very important to our Companion Diagnostics business, because tissues are obviously the primary sample base in Oncology. But secondly it was to take predominantly US business and use our commercial infrastructure and grow that business outside the United States. And that's been very successful with growth rates of more than 30% outside the United States for our Tissue Diagnostics business and still at the beginning stages of penetration.</p>
          <p>Our strategy remains the same. It's focused on testing efficiency on the one hand, the ability to have instrumentation that meets our customer's needs. Our customers are consolidating out there. They have more and more demands for increased automation, they had demands for higher throughputs and they have demand for reliability of results. And that's what I'd say is the prerequisite in our business and something we have to do and have done in 2009 and we'll continue to do.</p>
          <p>Where I think we have a really unique advantage at Roche on diagnostics is on the medical value side. Because here is where we can put more than 9 billion Swiss francs of spend into research, into innovation, into biomarker discovery, and to clinical trials to use for both sides of the business. And it's benefited both sides of the business greatly to be able to share information between the two disciplines, Diagnostics and Pharma, at a very early stage in the research cycle without having to worry about IP confinement and really the ability to work very freely together to determine what are the best biomarker pathways we can pursue on both sides of the business, and how can we then progress assays and Pharmaceutical products that allow us to deliver on personalized healthcare and personalized medicine. And I'll give a couple of examples of that as well. But I believe that it's a distinct competitive advantage for Roche to be able to have this access and this knowledge of science and patient needs and bring it into the marketplace.</p>
          <p>You see what drove our more than two times the market growth rate in 2009 was again advancement on the testing efficiency side. So the instruments you see on the left hand side here providing our customers' need in terms of automation. But the right hand side, you see the menu, and for menu it's important to both have a breadth of menu of our assays and tests, but also innovative menus.</p>
          <p>And we often talk about personalized healthcare in Companion Diagnostics being something only in the future. And certainly it is a journey and we will continue to progress in that direction. But you can see even in the menu that we have launched in 2009, there are many different assays that will be used today or will be used in the future for personalized healthcare. So you see the anti-CCP inhibitor, which is a potential measure for rheumatoid factor. You see the KRAS assay on the Molecular Diagnostics, which as you know is used to predict the EGFR inhibitors in colorectal cancer.</p>
          <p>And then you see also the HER2 SISH and gastric assays, which we'll be also be rolling out to allow us to further identify patients that will benefit from HER2 Herceptin therapy in the future through our Ventana and Tissue Diagnostics groups.</p>
          <p>So there are a number of assays we continue to launch in this segment that are being used and taken up in the market place. And in addition to this we have more than 40 programs between exploratory research and late-stage development that are focused on specific companion diagnostic programs within Roche at this stage, including products like EGFR for Tarceva, BRAF for Plexxikon compound in melanoma and of course the HER2 assays that I have already mentioned up here.</p>
          <p>Now I'd just like to take two examples of this to indicate why it's also important in the environment and why we continue to be the world leaders in diagnostic by applying each one of these platforms and menu in a different way. And the first example I would use is just to articulate again, as most of you know, the business model for a diagnostic, which is really a razor-razor blade model. So the way to succeed in this business is to have a large installed base out there in the labs and then to supply that base obviously with broad menu and innovative menu.</p>
          <p>And this is just one example from our lead business, our Professional Diagnostics business, but it's true in all the businesses we work in, which is to say that we are &#x2013; we have a very large installed base. And you see up here from what we call the cobas 4000 to the cobas 8000, which are higher, higher in volume instruments and throughput instruments.</p>
          <p>You can see that we're very successful in having a large installed base. In fact in 2009, we installed the 6000 &#x2013; cobas 6000 module and we also introduced the new high throughput cobas 8000 module in clinical chemistry and will be rolling those modules out for immunoassays next year. And this has two advantageous, number one it gives us competitive advantages in-vitro diagnostics in terms of our ability to have competitive barrier to entries relative to other companies. And the second thing it does is it makes us the partner of choice for companion diagnostics because at the end of the day, as you launch companion diagnostics products, what you want is you want easy accessibility for patients to be able to access a reliable and reproducible test out there in the marketplace. So this installed base gives us both, and the quality and quantity of our menu also adds to that.</p>
          <p>Now, in addition to that, we are also investing significantly in medical value in in-vitro diagnostics and this is just one example I'd take from our Molecular Diagnostics group, which takes the HPV assays. And we have now completed enrollment on what is the largest diagnostics trial ever done. We have enrolled 47,000 women into clinical a trial, so we'll be evaluating not just the utility of HPV DNA assay but a DNA assay that also has the capability to look at genotypes 16 and 18 independently from the other 13 genotypes that we normally look at in the HPV arena. And as you probably know, the HPV assay is one of the largest assays today in Molecular Diagnostics, growing at a very rapid rate and still in early stage of penetration.</p>
          <p>Our intention with this product that we launched Europe in 2009 and we'll file in United States in 2010 is to really advance significantly the clinical treatments and the clinical prevention of cervical cancer by being able to better identify patients that will move on to CIN3 or pre-cancer lesions and be able to identify them early by having the specific clinical and automation to identify patients with the 16 and 18 genotypes. And we will be rolling out this data at a variety of HPV conferences this year, starting with Eurogen actually in February of this year. But I'm absolutely convinced that this type of investment in meaningful clinical, meaningful Pharmacoeconomic data, will be critical to the future. And just as one example, because of the high sensitivity of HPV genotyping assays, you can take what is normally a low sensitivity annual pap-smear screening program in many countries and convert that potentially to a once every three year, much more specific HPV DNA assay and have a greater propensity to be able to intervene on cervical cancer early and therefore reduce mortality.</p>
          <p>So these are the types of things that we're working on in medical value in the organization and we will be pleased to continue to report on this, as we have data and roll this out.</p>
          <p>So in summary, as we look forward to 2010, as Severin mentioned, we are firmly committed to continuing to grow above the marketplace in 2010. We're going to do that with the rollout of the products that you see up here, which contain both continued emphasis on our testing efficiency and automation standpoint, and also new and innovative menu as we roll this out into the future.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much for your attention. I hope I piqued your interest a little bit more in Diagnostics and certainly look forward to the conversations after this. So thank you, I'll turn it over to Erich Hunziker for the financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dan. Ladies and gentlemen, I know at this time of the day, it's always a little bit difficult to tell you much news about financials, but I will still try to give you a little bit more background now that I'm sure you have totally digested the figures. These are the highlights and this is the P&amp;L, I will now address here and this is the core part of the P&amp;L, which is operations.</p>
          <p>And I hope that you had, during the day when you really duck, after the conference call, into the various elements with this extensive range of information you received, I hope that you had a positive experience that you say, hey, wait a minute. Here they had headwinds. Here they had headwinds. So this was a tough goal to achieve these results, because in comparison with 2008 where we on several opportunities really had backwinds, you know, we had quite some nice income from sale of products, of tail end products, and in this year it was totally the opposite.</p>
          <p>I think there were one-time items, which in a majority went against the results, which means to achieve these results we had to overcome this. But this is of course exactly what we try to bring across to you year-on-year that we are working not just on one project, but on many, many, many projects. To bring our cost structures continuously over the years down and that we remain competitive. And this is also quite visible and I think if we wanted to pay reverence to our two former colleagues, Bill Burns and Jurgen Schwiezer, I mean, the Pharma ramp up of the margin over the last eight years was very impressive.</p>
          <p>We have now achieved, as I said this morning, definitely industry top quartile margin in Pharma, but we are still committing to improve share and as you just have heard from my new colleague, Dan O'Day, he is fully committed to actually make this part, which always looks a little bit just proportionally small, actually starting from this basis to look good and of course you have the advantage that one percentage of your operating profit is in absolute terms a little bit less, so your growth will be steeper.</p>
          <p>Coming to the Genentech transaction, and we read and we take very serious what you write. And there was of course, we gave you this line synergies of a transaction. 300 million achieved last year, 800 million until the end of this year and then going to the 1 billion by the end of 2011. And I respect that some of you wrote hey, now they have merged, really six months on this and nothing has changed on these figures. What I beg you to understand is that we are not in a we/they mentality anymore, we have become one. So for instance, if now the best brains of formerly Genentech and formerly Roche stay together and streamline the value chain and come out a success, should we book this just to make a sale to you as additional synergies. I think for us, it's not a matter of how we label the progress. In the end, it all has to fall through to the bottom line, so I think what's important for you is, there is absolutely no doubt that Genentech as a transaction delivers the 1 billion we were committed when we announced it in the half-year of last year.</p>
          <p>But all the &#x2013; what is additional, this spirit and also this joint learning, I think it would be wrong if we wanted to impress you by each quarter to say, and by the way, we have found out there is 200 million more there, I think this would just label things which are normal for a globally grown together company to show the proof will be on the bottom line. And whether it comes from one side or the other side, it is essential that we bring this company ahead.</p>
          <p>What you can see, the good news is for you that the value may increase, but actually the costs have not increased. This is exactly the figures you have seen at the half-year result, I think we always from the beginning even one year ago, we told you, usually you have about to take the one-time costs into three times the synergies you get out. And we have now booked 2.4 billion in 2009 and there will be a small end in 2010. Why is this? Maybe also sorry for bringing a little bit of accounting here.</p>
          <p>If we take out a whole factory like Vacaville II or the Palo Alto site, the accounting allows us to take a full charge on the announcement of the decision, so a Palo Alto and a Vacaville is fully in this 2.4 billion and the only effect for 2010, and maybe there are a little bit of warnings, if we then finally pay out the salary packages to Palo Alto employees leaving. There will be a little cash out, but you are protected against too much influence on the cash flow 2010 by our clear announcement already at the half years that a vast major part of this 2.4 billion was actually not cash effective, it was just impairment of former investments there.</p>
          <p>The only thing which will hit the P&amp;L this year as a minor amount. But I just want in a order of fairness, to mention it's here, is that, for instance, now in my area of responsibility, if we bring the two IT systems together, as an ongoing effect of the transactions, the cost of these special projects to align software and so on, they will show as an extra item in 2010, but again, a very minor amount. But to have a close picture here and I hope that we will actually not have to talk about Genentech integration too much, it is from now on new Roche, in which Genentech definitely is a very important part.</p>
          <p>Forex, maybe complex, but on the other hand, it's also very easy. You know our philosophy is natural hedges. And of course, if you have a United States market with a lot of sales successfully and a lot of cost, you'll have the natural hedge. So you can be assured and you have all the details in the financial report, that the U.S. dollar is not the currency which has the largest impact on our bottom line situation in Swiss francs.</p>
          <p>By far, the most important currency is the euro. Why is this? We have a very strong market position in the European Union, so the income streams is very strong there, but our cost structures are relatively modest. Our cost structures are, to a large extent, in Swiss francs. So whenever the euro goes down or these currencies go down against the Swiss franc, we get a hit to the bottom line. And what you can see is that in the first half year, the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen have compensated a little bit, the effect. But in the second part of the year, a lot of currencies weakened against the Swiss franc and only the yen counterbalanced, and a little bit of comfort is that the dividend of Swiss francs is paid out in strong Swiss francs. So if you calculate it back into your currencies, it's quite a nice increase, I would say.</p>
          <p>If we come to the financial income and that's really a commitment from my side. If you see this huge block of interest expenses of the Genentech financing, you could think that my whole team is only focusing on this part, and it's forgetting about optimizing and fighting for every single franc on the other areas. This perception will be totally wrong. As you may remember, we have raised all these bonds and only the short-term bonds have floating rates, which has proven to be perfect up to now, everything which is three years has all fixed interest rates over the whole period. And as you also may remember, we have just swapped all the currencies into U.S. dollars because this was a U.S. dollar transaction and we generate enough cash to repay all this debt in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>So there are no currency elements in the Genentech financing any impact, and also the interest rate, you can more or less calculate what's happening. You have all the details on every single bond, you have it all in the annual report, in the financial reports.</p>
          <p>What we did, we will of course always pay down bonds at maturity, we have paid the six month bonds in September. We will repay the one year bonds now in February and March, and for those who take the time to go through the small print of the financial report, you have also seen that if we get the opportunity to buy 300 million of our own bonds back at good conditions, we also do this. So we have also bought back some of the longer-term bond earlier than maturities because the liquidity situation allows us.</p>
          <p>So this element of course, the big, one looks dominating but it's by far not dominating the activities and the focus point of Roche Treasury. We are very committed to focus on the interest and debt securities income, and there again I can report to you that we had the final cleanup in last year of anything. I can really stand here and tell you, you don't have to fear that there is a lot of value at risk in the remaining asset portfolio. Everything is cleaned out, we even closed the final lawsuit we had in this area, and in the pension plans that's what I announced to you 12 months ago. I mean, through the financial crisis of course the absolute amount of the assets in the pension fund has come down and in the lower interest environment the returns have come down.</p>
          <p>Forex was very well managed with 98 million positive, and there is a number of overall factors which then come here. Tax rate. Complex of course, very interesting manner, but you always I think are on the safe side, if you take my advice, the group tax rate if nothing exceptional is happening should be in the range of 22 to 24%. Yes, now we were successful, we were a little bit below this corridor due to many positive impacts, but what you of course can see is that these exceptional items, each of them had a different tax situation, so that the statutory, more or less the effective tax rate, as an exception was now this year at 16.8. But forward-looking, if you are modeling the situation overall, I think on the 22 to 24 corridor you are on the safe side.</p>
          <p>The overall picture, and just two numbers, a little bit central here, I mean, no longer comments, no more comments on the 20% core EPS. What's very nice is, of course, and that's what also is an argument that we shouldn't talk about Genentech too much anymore, this transaction was accretive to the Roche shareholders from day one. If you take the exceptional items to buy the synergies out of this transaction, so as an indirect share buyback, buying the income from the minority shareholders and guiding it to the Roche shareholders, this was already successful from the first day of the closing.</p>
          <p>Coming to the group cash flow, we started the year with 16.7 billion in our cash box, and I think that's an impressive number, of 15.7 billion of operating free cash flow. And we had a relatively limited outflow this year so that the free cash flow was at a record level of 8.9 billion. And then you see of course, what we have cashed out to the Genentech minority shareholders, but we have ended the year with 23.9 billion net debt. And if we look into the liquidity situation, I think we can be &#x2013; we're never relaxed, but this is a situation which is very comfortable because, yes we have 6.2 billion of maturities coming up in the next month. Yes, we have the dividend the outflow of 5.2 billion, if the shareholders' meeting approves the six francs. And yes, that's another element for those guys who want to model the cash outflow. Please bear in mind, and you have all the details in the financial report on each bond. Some of the, especially the U.S. bonds only have the interest paid once a year, so accounting-wise all the interest expenses you have seen in this red bar, but cash wise, the interests are only paid exactly one year after the bond emission, but we have all these details there, but I just want to make sure that you catch these points when you &#x2013; should you want to model the situation. So altogether, very comfortable situation, not surprisingly, because we were planning a very clear financing of this transaction without any single Swiss francs of Tamiflu in our minds and this was of course an additional <mark type="inaudible" /> for the cash situation.</p>
          <p>Equity looks not so typical, to use the term. My accounting team always actually tells me not to use these kind of terms, but it is this accounting which most of you are familiar why there was no acquisition accounting, because we already control the majority of Genentech. And if you control the majority, you have all the goodwill and all the intangibles 100% already on your books. So if you take the rest of the minorities out, the difference of what is not material there and the purchasing price goes against equity. Good news here for those who have seen the same picture at half year 2009, we have already increased our equity by 5 billion through the strong net profit. And if you look back now we are already at 13% equity and together with this extremely strong liquidity situation we are absolutely not worried that this has not actually &#x2013; that this would have weakened our position for instance, for strategic transactions.</p>
          <p>And this is the picture and I could even give you 22 years more to make it more impressive, but I think this company has been committed to the equity holders for 23 years, if it's approved and as I said, you can do it in British pounds and then it looks even more impressive. And in the interest of time I will not go through the outlook, nothing has changed since Severin has gone through it.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Erich. Before we go into the Q&amp;A, let me just apologize, after my introduction when I sat down, I realized that I didn't introduce Pascal and Dan, who have been working so closely together since September already that I didn't realize that the two faces are eventually new faces that have been here the first time in London. So just as a &#x2013; it's not an introduction, it's an after-duction probably: Dan has been the head of Molecular Diagnostics before he took over the Diagnostics division. And beforehand he has been in a number of leading positions in the Pharma division. So from this backgrounds you can see that he is in a privileged position to also make the link between Diagnostics and Pharmaceuticals, a point which we actually touched in his presentation.</p>
          <p>Pascal has been responsible for the Commercial Operations worldwide and he took over the lead for the successful integration in Genentech over the last year before he took over the Pharma division. So sorry for not introducing you, but that I think opens the floor for your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Andrew Baum from Morgan Stanley. Three questions if I may. Firstly, a couple for Erich, could you just break down that 450 million? One obvious thought that crossed my mind at least was whether Genentech was stuffing the channel in the first half of the year and you had to destock <mark type="inaudible" /> why they might think about stuffing the channel?</p>
          <p>Second, could you just make some comments about what kind of CapEx we should anticipate post the Genentech acquisition compared to last year?</p>
          <p>And then finally a question for Pascal, GSK just had TYKERB approved for use in combination with aromatase inhibitors. Could you break down the current acceptance sales and give us an idea of what percentage of that number comes from exactly that indication and how you view the competitive threat? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Erich, you want to start off with the question on &#x2013; I think it was the inventory adjustment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Actually I don't want to escape, but just to make clear for us it's extremely difficult just to hear it. Your question was to have a clearer transparency on the fourth quarter impact on the sales by the inventory adjustment; is this the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second half of the year, or fourth quarter, second half. To what extent is the 450 million inventory correction which has taken place, and you explained that you put in place new systems, how much of that came from a potential destock of the Genentech product, which may have been stuffed in the first half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first of all, yes, we confirmed a figure in the range of 400 to 450 this morning in the conference call, we didn't announce the figure like this and I think Pascal is much more able to give you the details. As we went into it this morning, it was a worldwide activity and it was not a specific destocking of specific products. But Pascal, would you take over? I think you gave a clear indication this morning already, in which major market this was happening and to a certain extent, which products were affected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, the U.S. was very big, as you would imagine, a very big part of this total number. But as Erich said, it also impacted a number of countries around the world. As I mentioned it before China, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, where historically because the distribution system was not as effective as it could have been, we had higher inventory, 40 to 45 days, which is nothing abnormal, but it's probably on the high side.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., the answer is a clear no, actually, on all &#x2013; Genentech didn't really stuff the pipeline before the integration. It actually doesn't &#x2013; this reduction doesn't relate to <mark type="inaudible" /> reducing inventory built by Genentech. It's more that the two companies had different approaches, I mean, in fact Genentech was running lower inventory. I mean Roche was running inventory that were totally in the norm, completely in the norm, but maybe on the higher side, and we actually looked at how do we manage the supply chain and decided to go for lower inventory, because it's good business practice. If we can have lower inventory out there in the trade, it positions us much more &#x2013; much better for the future, running low inventory. So the impact on the Genentech products was probably a couple of days of reduction for those Genentech products in the U.S., not more.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To build on your second question, CapEx in general, what I gave you here was a cash indication, just some warning signs on your cash flow modeling. With regard to CapEx, I think the good news is, if you look at the value chains of both divisions and of course, my colleagues can then go into details should you wish.</p>
          <p>But the good news is that we're coming to a certain end of an investment phase. If you look at the Pharma production sites worldwide, we have the most modern and the most advanced biotech production network worldwide and we have constantly optimized it. And there is no major facility under construction or planned and the same is &#x2013; please correct me Dan, but Dan's team and the <mark type="inaudible" /> today also have really focused on various key sites and have built the infrastructure up and therefore also I think, we came to the end of a certain investment cycle in CapEx with regards to production sites. And we are fully committed with everything with the cash flow monitoring to keep cash under control and of course net working capital is at the core of these kind of activities. What this also has led the initiative which Pascal has initiated with the new teams of course also goes into the whole area of account receivables. These were some topics, which from time to time come up in the media, if countries are on the discussion line, whether they still can pay their debt or not. So I think it's a very prudent approach to have things very tightly controlled around the growth and to manage it on a very tight line. <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the last question is very specific one. So the answer, I can't give you a specific percentage, but part of the answer to your question is only 50% roughly for HER2-positive patients, are also hormonal, HR-positive patients, so only 50% of those. And of those, a very small fraction actually receive hormonal therapy. And the other thing is that in fact those patients who are HER-2 positive have a very bad prognosis in any case, regardless of their hormonal status. So the answer to your question is that in fact a very small fraction of Herceptin patients is actually receiving hormonal treatment. We will actually, if you want, we can probably go back and look at the exact percentage, but it's quite small in fact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Question for Daniel and Pascal, please. First of all, if you are trying to highlight Diagnostics again, I was wondering if you can tell us maybe you'd like to focus on oncology for example, what percentage of your clinical trials for new molecular entities actually have Companion Diagnostics driving patient selection, because it's still quite surprising these days how few oncology trials actually do that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, what do you think you can do maybe different with Taspoglutide, should you launch it, having got the diabetes care franchise running alongside that? How can you think about that being a competitive advantage to you in the future? And then just lastly on pertuzumab, you highlighted getting some more proof-of-concept data there this year in breast cancer, but you have some discontinuations there, I wonder if you can tell us a bit more about your confidence behind that product? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to start with the pipeline and I'll speak to diabetes care?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the question was with <mark type="inaudible" /> in diabetes care, and the synergy between diabetes care in our <mark type="inaudible" /> franchise. Yeah, we looked at that actually and what we found is that the synergies that exist are more kind of operational, if you want to call them that way, operational strategies between the two businesses. Because fundamentally those are very different businesses, in a way, because if you sell diabetes care products, Diagnostics products, I mean, you want patients to be tested for glucose control as often as possible, of course, because that's really what delivers the glucose control and the patients who <mark type="inaudible" /> disease. Taspoglutide, we're really more coming from an angle of trying to keep the treatment of disease as simple as possible and treating patients early on before they get to a stage where they have to be monitored very intensively.</p>
          <p>But there are a number of operational strategies, for instance, we have very large centers, call centers, in diagnostics and diabetes care in the United States, but also in Europe. We're now building an integrated call center in Europe and we can certainly rely on this because when you sell a product like Taspoglutide, you have always typically have programs that are devised, have problems with the device, with the way patients use it. So, certainly a very strong asset to use from an operational viewpoint.</p>
          <p>We can also leverage presence at congresses, we can leverage our respective sales force. We are constantly sharing competitive intelligence, market knowledge that will help &#x2013; the knowledge that exists in diabetes care will help our Pharma colleagues ramp up their expertise because clearly we have to accept diabetes is a field we have been absent from for a very long time. So we are now recruiting people, we just recruited someone in the United States. So we are recruiting the right type of people to prepare, but we will transfer some of that knowledge. Do you want to add something, Dan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One other thing I will add and then I will go into the oncology portfolio, I mean in Germany for instance we have the sales force promoting &#x2013; the Pharma sales force also promoting the diabetes care product and vice versa. So on a tactical level, particularly when we get into diabetes care, I think there is tremendous synergies and advantages as we look at the Taspo launch.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question on oncology, I'm just looking at the slide that both Severin and Pascal showed, BRAF, we have obviously a very active companion diagnostics program. In fact, it's a molecular assay that's very specific to the use of that product.</p>
          <p>We also have a four or five genetic assay being used in the pertuzumab program and we have biomarker work going on obviously in all the oncology programs that I would also probably point out, hedgehog is another example.</p>
          <p>So in fact in most of our late stage oncology programs as well as our inflammation programs, we're looking actively and have active companion diagnostics program. When we get into the areas of metabolic and CNS, the pathways are a little less known there and there is less active hypothesis and involvement there.</p>
          <p>So we tend to be focusing more on inflammation, oncology and virology because the ground is more fertile there in terms of the ability for demonstration. Would you like to -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe to add, I think the one thing that is important to keep in mind with personalized healthcare is that we're dealing with biology, so these things don't happen overnight. I really believe we are at the beginning of a big change in the way patients are going to be treated and the way drugs will be developed, but it's taking time. So we come from an angle where we had like one or two examples to quote like Herceptin to a stage where we now have a few, like Dan just did, to, by the middle of the decade, we've set ourselves a goal to come close to 50% of our drugs being developed with a test. And maybe by the end of the decade, it will be even greater. So within the next 10 to 15 years, I think we'll see a dramatic shift in how drugs are developed.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> here a comment in terms of the Genentech integration, there is something which I really appreciate a lot, that we are now also establishing the links between the GRED organization, the Genentech Research and Early Development organization and the Diagnostics division.</p>
          <p>And for me, this was a bit of a balance to strike because I always emphasized, and I keep emphasizing that it is an independent unit. So I didn't want to force them to have to work together with Roche Diagnostics because that would have been completely against my belief. And actually what I did over the last year, I kept Dan O'Day almost out of Genentech, because the Diagnostics people were so eager to fly over to San Francisco to work together with them, that I was worried that the Genentech folks in San Francisco feel overwhelmed by all these Diagnostics people coming in.</p>
          <p>And what happened was, exactly the contrary, so that now Richard Scheller, the head of the Center in San Francisco said I mean why are there not more Diagnostics people coming in. And he started to go over the ocean, the other side. And in the meantime we have a well-established network, we have a number of pilot projects starting and this is very satisfying to see.</p>
          <p>I think there was a third question on pertuzumab...</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> we have some more data coming out this year, interestingly we have a study <mark type="inaudible" /> breast cancer treatment that, that certainly would be very interesting and we expect to read out this year.</p>
          <p>So <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; this product looks quite interesting, there is a couple of things we stopped of course, but in the breast cancer arena, in combination with Herceptin is looking quite promising.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> from Merrill Lynch. Few questions please. At firstly just wondering with the R&amp;D process, you talked about the rationalization of the pipeline and the R&amp;D impairments this year. Can you just give us bit of color as to where you are in that process, and whether we could expect further impairments in the same magnitude of 300 million that we've seen this year for 2010?</p>
          <p>Secondly and a related question, you talked about in the morning conference call, setting a higher bar for Phase III progression and referenced the IBFR project. Do you have any other examples of compounds that have been stopped because of high hurdle rates? And in that vein could you talk about the SGLT-2 program, which is what you see as differentiators of that product? And then thirdly and finally on emerge-8, just a bit of color as to what are you looking for the interim analysis; the number of patients, the endpoint the FDA is looking for? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. The SGLT-2 question was referring to the hurdle rates, you referenced high hurdle rates for Phase III. What other examples of products that are being dropped and just reference hurdle rates for SGLT-2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your last question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question on emerge-8, just to get details on the interim analysis number of patients and the endpoint that you are looking at? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perhaps I can take the first question on the R&amp;D impairments and what we project in terms of impairments as we go forward. Now this is very, very difficult to predict. As you know, we have many external collaborations and typically, if you have upfront milestones et cetera what happens is you take them on the balance sheet as intangibles. Some of those projects of course will fail and at that very point when the clinical data read out, then you take the impairment, or if you come to the conclusion that you want to stop the project anyway.</p>
          <p>So what we had in the fourth quarter last year is that we reviewed the portfolio, the combined portfolio of both organizations Roche and Genentech, and we took some conscious decisions to stop a number of projects and that led to impairment. Now, what will it be in 2010? I don't expect another review of this kind because we did this review in 2008, but as we go forward of course clinical data will read out and depending on that we will stop certain projects and again we will have impairments. So this is difficult, difficult to predict, but overall our guidance is very clear, we have picked a number of very important programs in 2008. We are consciously managing the huge R&amp;D spend which we have and therefore we expect a decline for 2010 as we go forward. Pascal, can you take the two other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you have &#x2013; I think I was checking, you have in the appendix, you have the list of projects we stopped out of the portfolio and many of those &#x2013; most of those we stopped because they didn't meet the endpoint and we didn't think they could be differentiated. <mark type="inaudible" /> is one of those.</p>
          <p>With regards to the specific question with SGLT-2, clearly if you look at our portfolio, I have to be candid here and it's probably one of the most challenged project for sure, because we are not going to progress it to Phase III if we cannot convince ourselves there is enough differentiation in this product. We're not going to move forward a product simply because we have one more product in Phase III. So we're waiting for the results of Phase II and we will see what the profile looks like from the point of view of delivery of efficacy and a one-tier reduction, and the effect on weight loss and of course the tolerability and safety profile, and at that point or so reevaluate the competitive environment, and because this is changing constantly.</p>
          <p>But it is clear that it is one of those projects that will have to hit the strong hurdle we set for ourselves in terms of differentiation. You know we stopped ADPP-4 antagonist this last year, and so we try to stay true to our mantra here. In terms of T-emerge-8, the endpoint is a composite endpoint. There are about 2,000 patients enrolled in this study. We started it not long ago, in fact we just started it. And then the question is when will we get the results? That answer as I said before will depend on how fast we recruit and the event rate. But it's going to be sometime &#x2013; sorry, sometime in 2011, late this year, 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Alexandra Hauber from J.P. Morgan. This annual report has more and more information, so it gets harder and harder to get through on time. So the question is on the one-time effect looks to me that in Pharma and in Diagnostics combined, you had 380 million intangible write-offs and you had another 70 million one-time effects in the corporate line, so that's 550 sort of negative one-timers. And everyone uses core EPS right now but not everyone defines it exactly the same. So I just want to confirm that, none of this has been added back to the core EPS, all that is actually fully reflected in the core EPS number, question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two is Diagnostics. HPV, what exactly does the ATHENA study show that makes you confident or which will help you drive doctors to move away from the pap smear to the DNA test? And could you just put a dollar value if you wish that the pap smear market if it was all DNA tests? And can you also comment on the competition &#x2013; competitive situation here?</p>
          <p>Thirdly also on Diagnostics, you said that the cobas 4800 is the base for the companion &#x2013; I might have to think will also be the basis for Companion Diagnostics. And I'm a bit confused to see this all companion diagnostics is mostly coming out of Tissue Diagnostics or &#x2013; I mean, how is that going to work? Does it just mean the huge installed base in Molecular Diagnostics of the cobas is resulting in huge leverage because you actually don't have any costs from the installed base?</p>
          <p>And final question is on Pharma, and it's on Avastin, surprisingly enough. Could you just go through, for the three indications, prostate, gastric and ovarian, what's the $250 million outcome and a billion dollar outcome, you <mark type="inaudible" /> that range? And also from the filing dates you're giving that is ovarian and gastric this year and prostate next year. Should we assume therefore that ovarian and gastric are quite close in terms of reporting?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take one at least. Core EPS is quite straightforward, we eliminate all of the things that we call exceptional items, so that's in the income statement, that's the costs of the integration, Genentech, any major legal cases, and we eliminate all intangible assets, amortization and all intangible asset impairments. They are not part of core EPS, okay. So, if anyone is trying to model core EPS for next year and you're anxious about intangible asset impairments, you don't need to be because if there are any, they will be taken out of core EPS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that means in the P&amp;L for R&amp;D, it is included the impairments, so if you look at the operating profit before exceptional items or after exceptional items either way, it is included. But, impairments are not included in the core EPS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the extent that there are small one-time effects part of regular results, the costs of <mark type="inaudible" /> and so on. Those are all part of the deal. They're part of core EPS.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's a little early to give you the results of the ATHENA trial, we've finished enrollment of the patients, we're starting to get some early data, but we haven't released it yet. To your question, why we have some confidence in this is, is that we know today that genotypes 16 and 18 are more than 70% responsible for CIN3-plus. And the way we've designed our trial is to look at, yes, competitive HPV assays, but also vis-a-vis cytology. So, we'll have to see exactly how the results come out, but we do have some confidence that given the size of the trial, given the way this is powered that as we roll this out that we should be able to show a significant difference here between cytology and between the other tests on the marketplace, particularly because of genome citing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If it false positive or what's the different cytology you want to show?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean basically, particularly with cytology you have two factors. Number one, the specificity of cytology is around 55%, whereas the specificity of an HPV DNA assay is about 95%. So that's the starting point. The other thing you have with cytology is you have a lot of equivocal cytology. It's a manual process, you have pathologists reading it, and what we found even in our trial is that two different pathologists can call the same cytology results positive and negative, and often they have to go to arbitration. So it's going from a highly subjective, low sensitivity process to a highly specific process, number one. And add on top of that the genome typing capabilities. So that's why we have some confidence, but will more to come on the data.</p>
          <p>You asked about the market, I mean today the market is predominantly in the United States. It's growing elsewhere, the HPV DNA market, not the cytology market, and it's predominately used today in ASC-US triage or adjuvant screening, where you use both a cytology result and a HPV DNA test. And just to give you a feeling for the magnitude of this, I mean in terms of the number of HPV tests in the U.S. the potential of the market, there's probably about a million tests used in triage. We expect an adjunct setting to have about 28 million tests, and then if you were to move to a primary screening where we used the HPV test upfront that would probably more than double the adjuvant potential in terms of number of tests could take it up to 50 million in terms of the number of tests per market. I'll let you do the calculation on the potential cost of test.</p>
          <p>And from a competitive standpoint, again there is not a product in the marketplace today that can do genotyping. The product in the market today has the capability to look at just all 13 high-risk subtypes. And there isn't a product today that in one workflow can do both the 13 high-risk subtypes as well as identifying specifically the 16 and 18, and that's the unique feature of the cobas 4800 as you see in your slide set. So we feel we'll have a very competitive product out there in the marketplace, both from an automation perspective and clinical data perspective.</p>
          <p>And then on the Companion Diagnostic program, didn't mean to confuse you, let me explain, yes, both tissue diagnostics and PCR today are used to Companion Diagnostics and Oncology and they both will continue to be used in the future. In fact, in many cases complementarily because you'll take a tissue sample, use it, stain it, determine a particular nature of the sample and then you may take a biopsy from that and put it into a PCR reaction to get a more finite measure. So both the installed bases will benefit from us and the cobas create 4800, particularly the back end, which is the life cycle for ADIBD version. That will become the platform where we will have things like EGFR, K-RAS, BRAF and other PCR assays on there that will be used complementarily with the Ventana, BenchMark, and Ultra in the advanced staining side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see one of the big benefits if you have full-fledged diagnostics operation within the Group, because from a Pharma point of view, the scientist would only be interested in a specific biomarker. But they would not be knowledgeable or even interested on which platform do you measure this biomarker. And if you have a partner with a broad portfolio of platforms, then you come to this partner and you say, well, I'd like to measure this biomarker, now choose the right platform to do it or even a combination of platforms. And that is very difficult if you have to work together with a number of external partners because, obviously they have a conflicting interest in terms of collaborating with you. We had one more question on Avastin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Avastin, in terms of the dates, I don't think I'm going to be able to be much more specific for two reasons. One is that we've learned too many lessons in the past and I'm sure you've learned the same. These things are very much event driven and they can change. And the second reason is we haven't communicated anything as to potential timelines before. So I'll have to ask <mark type="inaudible" /> a bit later what he wants to say about this. But you're right that directionally, ovarian and gastric are likely to come before prostate. I could not be more specific than this and <mark type="inaudible" /> you want to be &#x2013; I really think it would probably not even help you because it could even change again. We see that quite regularly based on events developing. And in terms of the potential in ovarian, for instance, we have studies that are based on <mark type="inaudible" />, you will also &#x2013; you will depend on the hazard ratio, the strengths of the clinical signal.</p>
          <p>I wouldn't want to be too specific either in terms of what kind of hazard ratio correspond to what kind of sales. Needless to say if the endpoint is not met the potential would be zero. And then, I guess, you would have to make your own guesses as to what could lead us to a billion. We've kind of judged this when we see the data in their totality.</p>

          <p>So, in the last quarter, the growth was lower than the previous quarters. That is true even if you correct for this event, I mean, basically that's in line with the guidance we are giving you as mid-single-digit growth rate for 2010.</p>
          <p>And the reality is that if you look at the franchise, the oncology franchise, we would get strong growth for Herceptin, MabThera in the emerging regions, in Europe and the U.S. we would still have growth, but certainly slower growth than in the past. So we have to accept that we have high penetration with Herceptin and MabThera in Europe and U.S. There are still some opportunities for growth, as I shared with you, but certainly slower growth in those markets.</p>
          <p>Avastin is still growing nicely and is driving our growth rate. I have to say in quarter four in the United States, we had a slight slowdown with Avastin and it's essentially due to the fact that we're focused a lot on breast cancer. And we have made very good progress actually in breast cancer in the U.S., our market share &#x2013; our patient share is growing very strongly. But in the lung cancer segment, we actually plateaued because the whole team was focused on breast cancer.</p>
          <p>Now, we had last year two sales forces promoting Avastin, like Genentech always did it. What we've done is in the course of the last quarter, and we started in January this year, we've decided to ask the Xeloda team and that is a true synergy of Genentech and Roche. The Xeloda Roche team is now going to promote Avastin in the colorectal cancer segment and we also have the Herceptin team promoting Avastin in breast cancer.</p>
          <p>So in 2010, we will have four sales forces promoting Avastin in all those indications. So, we're really confident that we will see accelerated growth in lung cancer where we have been plateauing a little bit. So I expect Avastin to accelerate, but overall five, 6% is essentially what we saw in the last quarter and what we expect in 2010. At some point we will see ACTEMRA accelerate and that will have an impact in 2011. Remember in 2010, we also have to absorb the end of the &#x2013; part of the expiry impact on CellCept, so that still has an impact on our business. But starting in 2011, ACTEMRA should start having an impact and also the launches of our new products by 2012 and beyond.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now in terms of the profitability on the Diagnostics, we traditionally have actually a lower profitability in the second half of the year. That's predominantly due to a number of things. First of all, the placement of instruments is usually generally higher in our business in the second half of the year. There are often institutions that want to use up their budgets at the end of the year and we place generally more instruments in second half of the year. That was also exacerbated by the fact that we launched the cobas 8000 in August of this year, so that rollout also occurred in the second half of this year and the cobas 4800 was launched just in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The other thing I would just point your attention to and it's in the financial details as well. We had intangible asset impairments of around 80 million, 57 hitting our cost of sales line and 23 on the R&amp;D line. So that also had an impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just to add here also, because I think you also addressed the performance of Pharma in the second half, you also should see that all the impairments on the Pharma side all affected the second half of the year, which then gave a special hit, huh?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just to share some numbers going back to this question because I know I've heard this comment a few times, is Avastin going to be able to grow the &#x2013; you've got more and more competition. We think we have a lot of data coming forward &#x2013; coming up, I'll just share this with you. But I'd like also to give you a couple of data points. If you look at colorectal cancer, in the U.S., we have a 70% patient share penetration. In Europe, even if I only include the top four markets, excluding the U.K. where we don't have reimbursement, as you all know, we only have 40% patient share in colorectal cancer, so &#x2013; and we're growing. So we still can go from 40 to 70 or beyond.</p>
          <p>In breast cancer, as I said in the U.S., we've made a lot of progress and we now have a 55% share coming up from maybe 30 or so. And in Europe, we only have there 25, 30%. So a long way, I mean long way to go. And finally, in lung cancer, we have about 40% or 50% in the U.S., from memory and only 10, 15 in Europe.</p>
          <p>So even if I only look at Europe, Avastin has a lot of growth potential and now if you project yourself outside of Europe in the emerging regions, there is enormous potential there as I've tried to show you. So I really think Avastin has a long way to go even with the existing indications.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Pascal. We are running out of time, I'll take two other questions from the back, but I'd like to inform you that after those two questions, we will split up. Erich and myself, we will stay in this room for the strategy session and Dan and Pascal will be in separate rooms. So if you have specific questions for Dan and Pascal if you then join the other group, so I just get the signal, we also have an accounting workshop under the leadership of the Corporate Finance team, Ian Bishop will join that shop as well. So if we take question please over there in the last third one row, yes, and then on the other side.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. Two questions please, the first one on T-emerge-8, could you just elaborate a little bit more on the stopping criteria, is it a certain number of events and maybe what's the number of events? And also is there a pre-specified efficacy &#x2013; efficacy hurdle like P-value that you need to cross i.e., is there actually a risk that upon interim analysis, the data is not good enough to file and you need to wait for the final analysis in like 2013 before you can actually file Taspo?</p>
          <p>And my second question just relates again to destocking, two quick questions on that. One, can you just confirm that the entire 800 basis point differential for Avastin between prescriptions and sales in the U.S. is due to destocking or are there other issues as well with the, say, lower net effective realized price because of reimbursement issues in breast cancer, whatever?</p>
          <p>And also can you just confirm that when you harmonize the inventory trade policies between Roche and Genentech, in the U.S., you actually went below the lower level that Genentech always had? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the easy one first. The inventory level and the difference between ex-factory sales and demand sales, the answer is yes, the difference between the demand growth rate we showed you of 11%, which by the way, as I said in quarter four was I think, I mean, could have been higher and we will turn this around in 2010. The difference between this 11% growth rate and the 3% ex-factory rate is purely inventory related.</p>
          <p>Now, the second part of your question is the answer is also yes. We actually went with the Genentech products lower than what had been done before. We established new ranges. We have ranges. And we establish &#x2013; established new ranges and we've reduced them for both the Genentech products and the Roche products. Just like to say again the reduction for the Roche products is of greater magnitude than it is for the Genentech products.</p>
          <p>But you know when you are dealing with products of that size, a few days of inventory at the level of a quarter, of course, has a substantial impact. Three days, it's 5%, for instance, so it goes very quickly. So, the first question to be honest, I'll have to pass on that one unless <mark type="inaudible" /> can help me, although I would just have get back to you on the stopping rules.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We would come back, I'll get back to you for that specific question. We have then also a question on the right-hand side to you, lady here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions, you have invested 196 million in licensing, capitalized R&amp;D in Pharmaceuticals this year, 360-odd million last year. So that 500 million, the strength of R&amp;D that hasn't gone through the P&amp;L, and if we add back all of the amortization, never gets captured in core EPS. Can you give us some idea of that what's a reasonable level we should be thinking of there because if we want to treat you fairly like other companies to expense, who have done their R&amp;D internally, and who don't add back all of the amortization, we need some help as to how we should call you to account for that level of spending?</p>
          <p>And the second one is, just on your synergies, you're going to get a billion of synergies, so that's excellent. Can you give us some of your ideas of where you might have new investment initiatives, or should we really expect that one billion to hit the bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perhaps I can take the first question on the in-licensing, I mean, I completely share your concerns and when the accounting guidelines changed for IFRS, I can tell you that we were not happy about this at all, particularly that IFRS has changed to the system and that we don't have the regulations as we know it's from U.S. GAAP. But you're absolutely right, we have to take it on the balance sheet, and by the nature of the business, unfortunately you get volatility into the right of the impairment. This is of course very different to the accounting treatment as we were used to it in the past, where you gradually wrote off your intangibles and of course you flatten the line and it was much less volatile as it is today and we are exposed to such a volatility.</p>
          <p>But having said this, it is by the nature of our business that I could not give you an answer how much of that really has to be impaired. We take a provision for impairments every year then we do a budget, but this is a rough estimate and the reality is always different because it is always depends on what is actually happening on the clinical side. I'm sorry, I couldn't give you an exact number, but I share your concerns on the accounting side, but this is something we all have to live with.</p>
          <p>The second question was on the synergies. If I understood you correctly the question was is there more than a billion in synergies or did I misunderstand you?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I think Erich I touched on that point. The synergies which we described to you, those are really the synergies which immediately came out of the planning phase in the first half of last year when we did the integration. So these are really synergies directly related to bringing the two organizations together. And most of that was actually on the administrative side, tied to very, very concrete tangible events which the integration triggered. Namely, the two headquarters being combined in San Francisco. And to production, where we reviewed the production capacities, also the supply chain in a more general sense, as you have seen it today, which led to very, very concrete decisions like closing Vacaville, like closing Nutley, like closing other sites. And those were the type &#x2013; or Palo Alto, we decided to close the Palo Alto site and transfer the respective projects to Nutley and we had the savings of the infrastructure.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the synergies, those were the synergies directly triggered by events out of the integration planning process. And that's also why we have this good side of line because we completed the planning integration mid of last year. Then, of course, on top of it, I think we have the potential of economies of scale, when we bring the two companies together, and as we did in the past, we're chopping away every year across all the functions. And if I say all the functions, I mean all the functions. We continue to work on our administrative functions, we continue to work on our manufacturing network, we continue to work on our efficacy and efficiency in the R&amp;D function. We continue to work on our commercial operation. So, the synergies are really related to the Genentech integration, that is tangible with concrete projects and on top of it, we will continue to work on our operational efficiency as we did in the past.</p>
