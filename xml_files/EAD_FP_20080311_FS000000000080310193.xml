          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the EADS Conference Call regarding the Full Year 2007 Earnings Results. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. The floor will be open for questions following the presentation.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the floor over to your host Louis Gallois, Hans Peter Ring and Pierre de Bausset.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is EADS' 2007 earnings conference call. Louis Gallois our CEO, and Hans Peter Ring, our CFO, will be presenting our results and answering your questions. This call is planned to last about 1 hour and a half and should conclude absolutely at 2 PM Continental European Time, which is 1 PM London Time. This will include Q&amp;A following the initial presentation.</p>
          <p>This is also webcast. For access, we've set a special banner for full year earnings 2007 on our home page. Playback of this call will also be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service. The supporting information packet was will e-mailed to you this morning around 7'o clock with slides, which we will now walk through and financial statements.</p>
          <p>Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contained a Safe Harbor statement, which applies to this call as well. We believe you should read it carefully and now I turn to Louis Gallois.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Pierre. Good morning, to everybody. Welcome all to our 2007 year-end results call. As you know, by now, this call comes at an exciting time for EADS. With our partner Northrop Grumman, we have been selected as a supplier of the US Air Force KC-45 aerial refueling tanker.</p>
          <p>This event of course, does not impact our report for 2007. Yet, it certainly demonstrates that EADS continues to be a strong innovator and a vigorous global competitor. We have many exciting possibilities before us. Unfortunately, our strong forward promise is not represented in our stock price. I hope that the investor community will not overlook our long-term strengths while overstressing short-term issues.</p>
          <p>Let me be clear. I am not content and I'm sure that, Hans Peter will say the same, with our numbers. We can and we must deliver better. However, I think we have succeeded in notable ways during the past year. I believe that the strengths of our business will allow us to be a strong performer as we move forward.</p>
          <p>I would like to now turn your attention to some key factors for your consideration. 2007's EBIT was indeed unsatisfactory, though in line with the latest guidance we have provided for you. Yet, if you look closely, our underlying business is performing well in revenues and profit and the free cash flow is undoubtedly exceptional.</p>
          <p>You need to understand that our legacy programs, which are many, are doing well. It is a cost associated with specific areas. The A350 XWB therefore, has been delayed and the restructuring provision of Power8 that dragged performance down. Clearly, we have to focus on them and overcome the challenges they raise. Hans Peter and I will discuss them in this call, but I want to make sure that they do not hide the long-term EADS value story. I also want you to understand that we are bringing the cost side increasingly under control.</p>
          <p>Then, please turned your attention to our Space, Defence and Eurocopter businesses. They show increasingly improved commercial and profit performance. These trends, we believe, define the dynamics of our future portfolio. The A380's now on-track and is that much closer to showing its earnings potential, the NH90 program is progressing and while the A400M delay is unsatisfactory, we have our arms around the situation and feel we are closer to resolving the causes of the delay with our partners.</p>
          <p>I am very confident in EADS management's improved ability to focus on execution, and thereby, on improved results. The reason is clear: we have resolved our corporate governance and management issues. Decision-making is simpler, smoother and more transparent. We can now concentrate fully on realizing EADS' business potential and on creating a brighter future for the company and its shareholders.</p>
          <p>On page two, please remember that all forward-looking statements such as in our guidance are based on assumptions. As conditions may change, so may our projections and plans.</p>
          <p>I will now turn towards the main 2007 business achievements. Hans Peter will follow with the group and division performance, then I will close with discussion of our outlook and guidance.</p>
          <p>Now, on to page four. In 2007, Airbus made progress on every front. Setting new records, Airbus won 1,458 firm new gross orders, valued at US$181 billion at catalog prices. This represents 51 shares of the relevant market, both in terms of unit and value.</p>
          <p>Net orders, after accounting for cancellations -- mainly the past A350 -- stood at 1,341. This represents 49% of the market by units, and 48 by value. Demand was very robust through 2007, and so far this year, the market remains very brisk. As importantly for the long-term, Airbus made significant progress on its two flagship the programs on the Long-Range segment.</p>
          <p>A380 has started an ambitious production ramp-up. The first delivery to Singapore Airlines occurred in October 2007 and the third one is scheduled today. It collected outstanding comments from the Singapore Airlines and its passengers. It is the game-changer we were expecting.</p>
          <p>A380 also one, 33 new firm gross orders, as existing customers placed additional orders and new customers confirmed the aircraft's strong appeal. At year-end, backlog stood at 188. The A350 XWB received 290 firm orders from 12 customers in positive response to the design refinements and its adequacy to long range requirements. The development plateau was organized, receiving suppliers, including the first risk sharing partners for systems. The architecture was defined and designed for us. The strengthening of the A350 competitive position in 2007 is probably the most significant improvement for Airbus long-term competitiveness.</p>
          <p>The A330 made a remarkable comeback, proving very attractive to airlines as they wait for the new generation aircraft to deliver, which is still years away, but also to freight operators and the air forces as it were for tanker operations.</p>
          <p>Regarding the integration of the company in the cost reduction effort aiming to fight against the declining dollar, Power8 delivered above targets. Our new transmission organization is up and running, and we realized significant cost saving in overhead through hiring freeze. It is a start of a changing program, but first results are encouraging.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we will have to make progress across the board, so pace of the overall overhead cost reductions will be checked toward year-end, and we will see in a few months if we are able to ink deals for our site disposals. We will have to manage a very volatile currency situation. Airbus is pushing on additional measures to Power8 to protect itself against the persistent weakness of the US dollar, at more than 1.50 for &#x20AC;1.</p>
          <p>Let's speak about the other highlights of the year on slide five. The US tanker selection is a monumental achievement and firmly establishes the A330 as the state-of-the-art air refueling system. The A330 MRTT platform now has won five consecutive global competitions and is clearly the standard for new generation tankers worldwide. It is an important step towards the balancing of our business toward more Defence, in line with our Vision 2020.</p>
          <p>We announced a six to twelve month delay of the A400M program, triggering action to tackle the root causes of slow development progress in the engine and elsewhere, and to reestablish certainty in the aircraft delivery schedule. Following the appointment of Carlos Su&#xE1;rez, MTA launched &#x2013; MTA is our Military Transport Aircraft Division -- launched a major business transformation to make its operations more integrated and to improve project management. I want to say that we are sticking to our &#x2013; for the first flight of this airplane to summer, even if we know that we are at risk.</p>
          <p>In the buoyant worldwide helicopter market, Eurocopter deliveries and new orders reached record levels, following a 75 rise from 279 to 488 helicopter deliveries over the past three years. Management continued to reorganize industrial base to prepare for future volume increases under the leadership of Lutz Bertling. The NH90 medium-weight, multi-role military helicopter was of particular focus. Six type certifications have been achieved so far by Germany, Greece, Italy, Finland, Sweden and Australia. Eight aircraft were delivered in 2007, but the large number of model variance has caused great complexity. The program is being reorganized and for the naval version, progress and solution to technical issues is linked to discussion with customers to secure deliveries. But I have to say that our partnership with Agusta, in charge of the mission system, is improving.</p>
          <p>At Astrium, two contracted Skynet 5 secure telecommunication satellites of Paradigm were launched, removing considerable risk. This will allow EADS to provide more capacity to the UK Ministry of Defence and to exploit further opportunities with third parties. In Space Transportation, Arianespace captured the highest number of launch orders in the accessible markets.</p>
          <p>Satellite also won a significant share of this market, becoming number one worldwide for telecommunication satellites. The European Union reorganized the Galileo program, and the European Space Agency de-risked it, so it is now back on track.</p>
          <p>Defence &amp; Security benefited from the Saudi Arabian order for 72 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft. Important successes were achieved in Security; it's a promising arena, including global security and secure communications. Important steps were taken in areas of potential high growth such as unmanned aerial vehicles and lead system integration.</p>
          <p>Now Hans Peter, you have the floor to discuss the financials of the full-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Louis, and good afternoon, everybody, and good morning to the ones in the US, where it is still very early. I hope I can keep up with my voice during this call because of my cold. It's not because of the results. But as Louis said before, we are not content with the performance we achieved 2007, and obviously, we will work hard to improve that in the future, but you will hear that in the later part of this call.</p>
          <p>I start on page &#x2013; or slide &#x2013; seven. Revenues were roughly stable, despite an unfavorable dollar impact amounting to &#x20AC;1.1 billion and lower Defence revenues. Defence revenues would have grown but for a &#x20AC;935 million shortfall on the A400M program and a rough &#x20AC;400 million impact of MBDA's consolidation at 37.5 instead of 50%. 2006 MBDA figures have not been restated. Stripping out the dollar and impacts due to the change of consolidation scope, revenues were growing by about 3%. On a like-for-like comparison, all divisions are growing, except MTA.</p>
          <p>EBIT was pushed down to &#x20AC;52 million. It is burdened by the A400M loss-making contract provision. Power8 restructuring provision, A380 losses and A350 charges. After stripping out all one-timers underlying EBIT from recurring operations is improving. Order intake surged, lifted mostly by Airbus's order stream, and backlog increased by a sharp 29% to record levels, despite a &#x20AC;20 billion negative revaluation hit at the deteriorated year end dollar rate. Stripping out the impact of MBDA's consolidation, the Defence order book grew by 6.5% to &#x20AC;54.5 billion, driven by new contracts for the Eurofighter and NH90 programs.</p>
          <p>If we go to page eight, we look at the big movers that explain EBIT in 2007 against the 2006. Firstly, operating performance improved compared to last year. Increase of Airbus deliveries, the disposal of Sogerma's loss-making business and to a lesser extent, growth of commercial helicopters, Astrium and Defence &amp; Security contributed to the operating performance improvement of roughly &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>In the end, the impact from price deterioration was lower than $300 million. You can see R&amp;D increased slightly. The dollar impact is low and includes four factors:  deteriorating exchange rates, revaluation of certain liabilities at closing spot rates, the gain from maturing A380 hedges, and the revaluation of loss-making contract provisions at a lower year end dollar rate than they have been accrued at. This is obviously something which will accompany us, the dollar fluctuations, as we go into the next years as well and it makes the understanding of our results rather complex.</p>
          <p>The A400M provision weighed down EBIT by &#x20AC;1.4 billion, the Power8 restructuring provision by &#x20AC;624 million, and the 350 charges increased by &#x20AC;350 million, bringing the total of A350 charges incurred in 2007 to around &#x20AC;850 million, stripping out the dollar impact. This increase in the A350 comes from the inclusion of new contracts and, of course, at completion adjustment at year-end. The A380 loss in 2006 included provisions and especially settlement provisions. For 2007, A380 losses show an improvement of around &#x20AC;1.5 billion. This loss relates primarily to costs above the learning curve and to the continuing support of the fleet. One other positive one-time effect of roughly &#x20AC;240 million mainly reflect the absence of the Sogerma impairment and accruals. Other negative and positive one timers compensate each other.</p>
          <p>If we move on to slide nine. We can see that EBIT margin was 0.1% in 2007, while expense R&amp;D increased by 6.1%, because of the A350 and A330 freighter development ramp-up, R&amp;D capitalization decreased dramatically due to the finalization of A380 capitalization. Going forward, we still expect R&amp;D to grow and it might be in an order of magnitude around or close to 3 billion in 2008.</p>
          <p>The interest result echoes a lower average net cash balance through the year following the acquisition of the 20% Airbus stake, higher interest expenses for Paradigm and on refundable government advances. Meanwhile, other financial result declined by about &#x20AC;400 million. This is mainly due to the revaluation of dollar cash assets at the closing spot rate, and due to the unwinding of the discount on provisions whose present value grows as we move towards their consumption.</p>
          <p>The earnings deterioration leads to a tax income of &#x20AC;333 million, compared to &#x20AC;81 million last year. The impact of tax-free gains on such a low tax basis skews the calculation of the tax rate. For the future, we expected to be around 30%. This leads to a significant loss of minus &#x20AC;446 million for 2007, compared to a profit of &#x20AC;99 million last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 10, net cash in 2007 exceeds our expectations, it benefited from a robust &#x20AC;3.9 billion gross cash flow from operations, since the A400M, Power8 and A350 charges impact EBIT but not yet cash flow and the underlying performance of operations was good. The most exceptional contributor is, obviously, working capital. An important Paradigm milestone in December triggered the securitization of receivables, representing the secured future revenue stream with a positive and higher-than-expected cash flow impact of &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Roughly half of the remaining &#x20AC;3.6 billion growth of pre-delivery payments comes from Airbus. The inflow more than offset the &#x20AC;3 billion growth of inventories across all divisions, 50% of the growth was coming from Airbus. Investing activities consumed &#x20AC;1.55 billion of cash in fiscal year 2007, much less than expected. CapEx decreased significantly thanks to Power8, including tougher criteria for investments and postponements to 2008.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from customer financing contributed less than last year, but exposure stands at its lowest point since a long time, I think, since two decades. The line Others includes the proceeds from disposals of buildings and small entities.</p>
          <p>The initial contribution in Q4 2007 amounts to &#x20AC;500 million &#x2013; I'm talking about the pension fund we set up in 2007. So, we are gradually contributing cash to externalize our pension provision in a trust. 300 million out of the 500 came out of cash, while &#x20AC;200 million were contributed in securities. It is the first of many such intended contributions. Taking these components into account and the negative 250 million impact from the MBDA consolidation change within Others, the net cash position stands at a record &#x20AC;7 billion.</p>
          <p>While the dollar depreciated, we kept hedging. I'm now on page 11. While only $16.3 billion of hedges matured, $22.4 billion of new hedges were done in 2007 at a weighted average rate of $140 per euro. It is worth mentioning that even if the spot dollar deteriorated extensively, the interest spreads between the currencies mitigated the impact. We kept hedging heavily in 2008 at planned rates. The higher order inflow dilutes the hedged Airbus eligible exposure to around 55%. Nevertheless, even if we modify the pace of hedging activities, we make sure net exposure for the next two calendar years is nearly hedged.</p>
          <p>We are increasing the proportion of structured forward transaction relative to classical forward. Structured forwards provide full hedging while allowing for some dollar upside upon maturity. More options might be used in the future. The average rate of maturing hedges overall was around $1.16 per euro versus 1.12 in 2006. For Airbus, the corresponding numbers are 1.14 versus 1.10.</p>
          <p>Let's now review the division results in greater detail on page 13. In 2007, Airbus broke its previous orders and deliveries records. Fast growing airlines in the Asia-Pacific region and in the Middle East were the chief driver of new orders. Demand from low cost and legacy carriers modernizing of expanding their fleets in Europe and in the US remained strong.</p>
          <p>Airbus delivered 19 more aircraft than last year, of which one A380 and 21 were single-aisles, but 10 less long range and wide body. Airbus revenues were kept stable by lower revenues recognition on A400M and by the euro/dollar rate degradation. Year-over-year, EBIT decreased by around &#x20AC;300 million, dragged down by higher exceptional charges, as I have mentioned earlier. Nevertheless, it benefited from a good underlying performance. Operating leverage more than offset our $270 million deterioration of delivered aircraft prices.</p>
          <p>Compared to 2007, the dollar impact on EBIT was a negative &#x20AC;0.2 billion. The main ingredients were already described and will continue to create volatility in the future. Louis already mentioned the ebullient commercial activity of Airbus this year. Beyond the commercial momentum of A380 and A350 XWB, the A330-200 freighter was launched in January, totaling 66 firm orders in 2007, and the KC-45 wins confirms the huge attractiveness of this model.</p>
          <p>That win will modify our industrial footprint in the US and will hasten our natural hedging. Major industrial challenges were confronted and all models are ramping up successfully while the supply chain remains under considerable pressure.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to Military Transport Aircraft on page 14. For 2007, the division's revenues declined to 1.1 billion, largely due to the postponement of the A400M power-on milestone to 2008. 2007 EBIT is a loss of &#x20AC;155 million against a &#x20AC;75 million profit in '06, reflecting mainly an A400M margin adjustment of minus &#x20AC;92 million and a &#x20AC;62 million impairment of inventory.</p>
          <p>The new management conducted a significant clean-up. The order book remains substantial at close to &#x20AC;20 billion. Regarding the A400M program, you saw the assembled aircraft in Seville. We are talking to customizations and with progress happening weekly, we are still aiming for a first flight this summer. Also, this is not without risk.</p>
          <p>There is no way to describe our pride that the US Air Force shows the A330 MRTT based solution for its KC-45A acquisition of ultimately 179 aircraft to better serve their warfighters. Saudi Arabia and the UAE each also ordered A330 MRTTs, both contracts to be booked in 2008.</p>
          <p>The new refueling boom, which has a larger refueling envelope and better control than others, successfully performed its first in-flight contact with a fighter plane and fuel was passed. The first Australian Air Force tanker first flew in June. The AirTanker Consortium is raising roughly &#xA3;2 billion to build 14 A380 MRTTs for the UK's Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft program and to operate them for 27 years. The global financial crisis led to a redesign of the project's financing, but closing is expected imminently.</p>
          <p>In the medium weight turboprop range, defense forces from Poland to Colombia ordered a total of 11 C-295s. The Spanish Interior Ministry bought another two CN-235s to perform border patrol missions, and the US Coast Guard's Deepwater program ordered a further five CN-235s.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to Eurocopter on slide 15, where we can see that revenues were up 10%, driven by a steep ramp-up in growth in support and development. Out of 488 units delivered, 275 belonged to the light helicopter segment, 172 were medium helicopters, and 31 were heavy ones and 10 were Tigers. Eight heavy helicopters were NH90s, and they were delivered to Australia, Sweden, Germany and Italy. Services is going to be a growing revenue source in Eurocopter. EBIT fell to &#x20AC;211 million weighed down by the margin correction and provision on the NH90 program.</p>
          <p>However, we are seeing significant increased profitability, thanks to volume, cost reductions, better pricing and favorable mix. The order backlog exceeds &#x20AC;13 billion. Eurocopter captured more than 50% of the civil and parapublic market again. Its order intake increased by 35% in value, driven by the oil and gas and parapublic segments, and thanks to the NH90.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter continued to expand internationally. In Europe, the Spanish Albacete plant was opened and Eurocopter UK was founded following the full acquisition of McAlpine Helicopters. In Asia-Pacific, joint development of the medium weight EC175 started in China, prompting market interest at Heli-Expo last month. And on NH90, final assembly largely was &#x2013; assembly line was opened in Australia.</p>
          <p>In the US, the Columbus, Mississippi production line for the US Army's LUH program is progressing as planned. Eurocopter has now delivered 18 UH-72A Lakota helicopters to the US Army, in line or ahead of schedule with full operational capability, so it seems the Army is very pleased with that helicopter.</p>
          <p>Astrium's revenues, if we turn to page 16, were up by 10.5% to &#x20AC;3.6 billion. This increase is driven by the ramp-up of Paradigm services and Ariane 5 production and higher ballistic missile sales. The 33% EBIT step up to &#x20AC;174 million is driven by the rising contribution of services, in particular, Paradigm and by the volume increase and better process efficiency in Space Transportation. The satellite business still has some room for improvement.</p>
          <p>The full order book and rising EBIT crowned several years of innovation, reliability and efficiency improvement. Arianespace, of which Astrium Space Transportation owns 30.5%, won more than 50% of new accessible orders. It manufactured six Ariane 5 ECA launches during the year and signed a preliminary order with Arianespace to deliver 35 Ariane 5s from 2010 onwards.</p>
          <p>Additionally, France's new M51 ballistic missile had a successful second test flight. The satellite business unit won 8 commercial telecom satellites out of 21 awarded globally. This includes the award of the two Yahsat communication satellites with Thales Alenia Space for a total of $1.66 billion. This made Astrium the world leader for telecom satellites in 2007, and I think this is the first time we have &#x2013; we are in that position.</p>
          <p>The DS division, on page 17, also continues to deliver beyond its commitment. From 2007 onwards, we only consolidate 37.5% of MBDA. Like-for-like revenues remained stable at &#x20AC;5.5 billion, despite the dip in stand-off missiles and thanks to growth of Eurofighter and Security revenues. MBDA confirmed its position as a world-leading missile systems company with more than &#x20AC;3 billion of sales, obviously on 100% basis.</p>
          <p>EBIT improved at &#x20AC;340 million after adjustments for one-time effects. Mainly &#x20AC;121 million lower capital gains and &#x20AC;47 million lower restructuring expenses. Better business processes, stronger risk management and lower structural cost enhanced operational performance.</p>
          <p>The order book expanded to 17.5, or &#x20AC;17.9 billion actually, with contributions from Defence &amp; Security activities, including Eurofighter, EuroHawk, avionics, communication and global security. Progress was made in potential high growth areas such as lead systems integration and unmanned aerial vehicles, as Louie mentioned.</p>
          <p>The German Ministry of Defence awarded DS the research and technology program for the Agile UAV in network-centric environments. EADS was also tasked for risk reduction study of a modular reconnaissance and surveillance UAV by Germany, France and Spain.</p>
          <p>And finally, on restructuring, the new Elancourt site was opened in Paris, bringing together all eight previous French sites, or Defence sites, and DS is in the process of consolidating its Military Air Systems center in Munching, in Germany. It's north of Munich. MBDA also centralized activities in France and in Germany. So, we are on track with our restructuring.</p>
          <p>Finally, on page 18, a few words on the improvement of our other businesses. Revenues of other businesses were roughly stable due to the disposal of the maintenance business of Sogerma with an impact of minus &#x20AC;181 million revenues, which was compensated by organic growth of other businesses. EBIT is now positive for all businesses. The disposal of Sogerma loss-making maintenance business helped, as did the improved performance of the remaining Sogerma business.</p>
          <p>The turboprop market continues to thrive. ATR delivered 44 aircraft this year versus 22 in 2006. So, it doubled its output, and it is ramping up to around 64 aircraft in 2008. ATR received 123 orders representing 58% market share.</p>
          <p>Besides, service revenues rose by 36% in one year, reflecting a new focus of this growth segment. 195 aircraft are now in backlog. EADS EFW increased its deliveries of freighter conversions and aerostructure ship sets with good performance. And EADS Socata captured 71 new TBM 850 orders this year, a clear sign of success for its most modern turboprop aircraft and then &#x2013; at 46 TBM 850 were delivered over the last year.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a look at our short-term outlook on slide 20, and that's your turn, Louis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans Peter. The EADS guidance and outlook are based on an exchange rate of &#x20AC;1 for US$1.45. Based on continued economic growth and comforted by a solid order book, despite the volatility of markets, the Group believes in the continuation of a resilient commercial aircraft market, and Airbus deliveries peaking in 2011 and 2012.</p>
          <p>In 2008, EADS expects Airbus to capture about 7 aircraft orders in 2008 &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; EADS revenues are expected to exceed &#x20AC;40 billion in 2008, compared to 2007, with about 470 aircraft deliveries for the full year.</p>
          <p>EADS expects its 2008 EBIT at &#x20AC;1.8 billion, reflecting higher comfort in its improving ability to drive profitability, yet recognizing evolving economic and cost changes. This figure contains allowances for planning contingencies. However, it does not take into account the possible influence of short-term currency movements on revaluations of existing provisions, nor does it take into account an impact from the potential sale of industrial sites. While they are not without risk, EADS does not presently expect a further material deterioration of its critical development programs. Before the impact of customer financing, EADS presently expects 2008 free cash flow positive at 0.5 billion, keeping in mind it is a most volatile item to predict.</p>
          <p>So, longer term perspective. The long-term plan of EADS points towards the mid-single digit EBIT margin in 2011, although not in a straight line &#x2013; with a small dip in 2009. I do not accept this situation and neither does the Board. With the implementation of Power8 plus, between Power8 with additional measures impacting 2011 and 12, and other such levels of R&amp;D policy, I intend to set our sight to higher levels and drive faster improvements.</p>
          <p>In view of the cash performance of the Group and keeping with EADS' dividend policy, the Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, a dividend of $0.12 per share, at the same level as last year. The dividend will be paid out of the distributable reserves, despite the net loss registered in 2007. The amount of the dividend is limited, but it underlies the turbulent macroeconomic and capital market environment.</p>
          <p>But the Board of Directors wishes to recognize importance of shareholder loyalty to EADS and management wishes to express confidence in the company's short and medium term prospects. It expects the conditions for a more substantial dividend will be met for the full year 2008.</p>
          <p>What's strikes me when I look at 2007 is that we now have a business which is brisk and solid. If we look at the total portfolio, underlying EBIT and cash flow indicate that we are finally, shifting toward greater stability and predictability. And all the signs are that our strong sales momentum will lead to continued top line growth.</p>
          <p>Our confidence in continued top line momentum is matched by our determination to improve EBIT. We remain vigilant in our ability to deliver crucial programs. We must increase our efforts to offset a still unfavorable dollar environment.</p>
          <p>Our hedging policy and Power8 reductions only partially mitigate the impact of the weak dollar. Therefore, to enhance mid term profit performance, we must not only fulfill Power8, but also go beyond Power8 through continued efficiencies and internationalized production. To face the US dollar challenge, we have only two ways: cost saving on one side, and increased dollar content on the other side, in our product.</p>
          <p>As we must continue to adjust our business mix, fulfillment of the US Air Force tanker contract is a key step in this internalization as we expand our industrial presence in the US. Commercial aircraft services, as well as other lines of services revenue, will enable us to achieve higher margins and we continue to look for ways to augment organic growth with targeted M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I think you are finally seeing a reenergized EADS. Products such as the A380 and the A350 XWB and our keyhole in the KC-45 tanker program shows that we have leapt over our short term challenge and have stayed focused on our commitment to value generation. Tomorrow's EADS is taking shape today. I fully believe it merits your confidence.</p>
          <p>And Peter and I will now take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Can I ask two questions? Firstly, looking at the guidance and your comments about the planning contingencies, Hans Peter, are these contingencies, is it fair to say, in the order of hundreds of million of euros? Secondly, can you give us a bit of sense please about the R&amp;D you expect to be expensed at Airbus next year? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hans Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I take it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On contingencies, you should understand that remark is &#x2013; I would say encompassing a number which deals with normal fluctuations during a year. Clearly, as we and as Louis said, it does not reflect further, say, big deteriorations of one of our programs potentially, or potentially dollar fluctuations, which impact provisions obviously. So, it's more to deal with normal fluctuations in our different businesses, not only in Airbus. It's not targeted to offset big program charges, which we do not expect, as we said before.</p>
          <p>On the second one, with Airbus and with the R&amp;D, we are currently in a process, we should say, Louis, to look closely into that topic? This is something -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. To assess the situation -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A tasking we got from our Board. As of today, our plan reflects something like an R&amp;D level which is roughly 2.4, or probably a little bit more for Airbus, which would mean for the Group as a whole, as I mentioned before, something in an order of magnitude close or around 3 billion for EADS.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Ben Fidler from Deutsche Bank. Mr. Fidler, please go ahead with your question now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Couple of questions. Firstly, on the level of Power8 savings, I may have missed it, but I am &#x2013; if you can clarify what the savings were that Power8 actually generated during the year that contributed to the 2007 performance, and where you expect those savings to be in 2008?</p>
          <p>And the second question is just a further one on your guidance, which &#x2013; just strikes me is, it seems extremely conservative, implicitly, it's talking about an Airbus number, I presume, somewhere at or below of &#x20AC;1 billion of EBIT in 2008 when, if you add back the one-offs, it appears Airbus delivered clean EBIT in '07 of over &#x2013; around about 2.5 billion. Just wondering why you see such a deterioration in Airbus profitability in 2008 over '07? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the perhaps in the first point, we share the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer the first question and you answer the second one. On Power8 in 2008, we have reached all the targets and more than that, we have a fix on ROC -- reduction of overheads, we have reduced by the employment jobs by more than 3,100, compared to the 10,000 expected for 2010. On the cost savings, we have saved more than 500 against a target of 300. For 2008, the plan is EBIT below 1 billion, but to be very frank, I expect EBIT more than 1 billion. It means that we expect to keep some advance in 2008 on our program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just a follow-up on that one before maybe you answer the other one about the guidance, just to clarify, the 500 million of savings you talk about in '07, is that the year-end run rate, or is that the achieved and delivered savings during the fiscal period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Please, Hans Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, this is the year-end or the yearly run rate, you could say because part of this savings are obviously flowing through inventories. So not everything is turned into EBIT in the year 2007. And it's very difficult to exactly figure out, I would say, the impact in a precise way, but we would be, in terms of EBIT impact, we would be probably at around 300 in 2007. And we would expect at least more of that number in 2008. This is probably the Power8 question.</p>
          <p>Another thing I want to add on Power8 and we talked about this in Seville. You always have to be careful if you use the numbers, because the 2.1 billion are against an expected cost base. I think we made that clear in the workshops. So, there are some elements of inflation or escalation, we anticipate, mainly on the material cost side, so part of that is definitely also fighting against these elements. On the make part obviously, we expect through productivity increase that we probably have even, I would say, at least not &#x2013; I would say something, we have to compensate, but probably rather the opposite.</p>
          <p>The second part of your question, I think was related to the reconciliation of Airbus and your disappointment that it is not higher in 2008, is that right, Ben?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's just to try and understand what are the key drivers of what looks like quite a material deterioration in underlying performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. So, I mean, obviously, we are not giving all of the reconciliations division-by-division, but in total, or overall for EADS, there are a lot of positive impacts you would expect in 2008 if you strip out all the charges in 2007, and you have heard the numbers before. And they are at the slide.</p>
          <p>On the other side, there are also some negative impacts you have to keep in mind between '07 and '08. It is in respect of sales financing, it is in respect of some price deterioration and again, I think we discussed that in the Seville investor forum.</p>
          <p>We don't expect the same level of positive impact coming from hedging because we don't have A380 related hedging, and the revaluation of the liabilities obviously is something very difficult to predict. So, you would have significant negative impacts as well. And on top of that, there is obviously an impact coming from the R&amp;D line, which is by the way not only related to Airbus. Currently in the context of growing our Eurocopter business I would say rather significantly over the years, we decided on product development also in Eurocopter and one is the EC175, the co-development with the Chinese.</p>
          <p>So Eurocopter between 2007 and the next years will probably also increase by, say, around 100 million on the R&amp;D line to support future business. And finally, on, I would say, all the non-Airbus businesses, there are number of one-timers which more or less even out each other, so there should not be a big impact coming from that.</p>
          <p>So, if you take the charges we had in 2007 going forward, into 2008, you have obviously a huge positive impact. At the same time, we have the negative effect as I mentioned. And this explains a little bit our guidance for 2008, and obviously, what I forgot to mention is that there is a small contingency also included.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Am I slurring? I beg your pardon. Two things, one is that very large depreciation charge in the fourth quarter normal? It's hard to compare against last year because of the A380 charges and so on, but depreciation looked very high. And picking up on what you just said, could you please confirm that I heard correctly that Airbus was at $1.14 to the Euro in 2007? And that we are really only looking at a step up to 1.16 in 2008?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hedge rate. I will get you the average rate in a minute, Sandy. Just to come to your depreciation point, I mean, from the P&amp;L depreciation contribution if we come from net income in the cash flow statement is 1.8 billion, which is not so much different from last year. So, I don't know what &#x2013; to what you are referring to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as what I am trying to get at, Hans Peter, is that after nine months, the depreciation and amortization was 1.1 billion. For the full year, in the cash flow it's showing 1.7 and I appreciate it's not so different to 2006. But in 2006, we had so many exceptional charges that I felt depreciation was included in some of them. The fourth quarter depreciation number is high to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just struggling a bit because on the depreciation line, also in the fourth quarter, we are even so it refers then obviously to all the provisions we were taking in the fourth quarter this and last year. So, obviously last year in the fourth quarter, there was a huge contribution coming from the reset of the A380 program, and we had a change in current and non-current provisions of plus-1.7 billion last year in the last quarter, whereas this year, this is just a figure around 100 million. That explains probably your difference?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Yeah. It sounds like something we should pick up on later, I'm sorry.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And for the hedge rates you said 1.14 in 2007, which is correct versus 1.16 in 2008, right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good afternoon, Louis and Hans Peter. Two questions please. First of all, can you just tell us, your comment about a mid single-digit margin in 2011, what the assumptions are there on both the FX rate and the additional cost savings you plan to make, if any?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, can you give us some color on the air tanker in terms of your FX strategy on that? Is there any sort of cause you have with the DoD that they will compensate you for FX exposure, or are you just taking that same exposure as you would on commercial business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on the mid single-digit margin for 2011, it's with the US dollar at 1.45, and it's taking into account only Power8, and not additional measures. And it's for that, we are looking at additional measures, because they have refused this outlook. And they have asked with the Board &#x2013; supported by the Board at Airbus, these different divisions and especially Airbus to give us better figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I may add something to this it means specifically David, to correct what you said, that's not guidance it's in -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not for the guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's what DOP [sic &#x2013; DoD] says and the management is not happy with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And the Board is not happy.</p>
          <p>On air tanker strategy &#x2013; the main purpose is not to escape to the US dollar weakness, but it's very good collateral effect that we have now &#x2013; we are building in assembly line in the US. In the assembly line, you have between 8 and 10% of the added value of an airplane. It means that we are transferring 8 to 10% of the value from euro to US dollar. We will do that for the tanker. We will do that also for the cargo air plane -- the cargo A330.</p>
          <p>And you could have noticed that Tom &#x2013; Tom Enders has said that we could look at the use of this facility in a broader way. Air tanker &#x2013; the air tanker was more a strategic move. As you know, I think, that we have to balance &#x2013; rebalance the activity of the EADS Group. And we have to get access to the defence market of the United States, it's half of the world defence market.</p>
          <p>We can't be a big actor on the defence market, if we're not in the States. And it's clear that we need to balance Airbus commercial aircraft activity with defence activities, which are not cyclical or not in the same cycle as the commercial aircraft activity, and with the different economic conditions. For that, I think the air tanker deal is, for us, a strategic move. We are going to the States and we are increasing our defence activity, especially in Airbus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for that and it's a fabulous win. I still struggle to understand the FX situation. Is &#x2013; should we think of it as a &#x2013; for you as a commercial piece of business? I mean, what &#x2013; are you going to take the FX exposure, or is there any sort of compensation you've been able to negotiate with Northrop or DoD?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I give the floor to Hans Peter, but in any case, you &#x2013; it will be &#x2013; it will not be significant in volumes before 2011 and 12 --12 and 13 and we will see the volumes only after 2013. Hans Peter?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, we're not at this point able to talk about any, I would say, details on that contract because it's not a contract yet, it is just an award which is currently challenged. And it is certainly something which will have to be further discussed with the Air Force. But what we can say is that the green aircraft, so only the green aircraft is going to be treated like a commercial item.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, I have two questions actually. Just to  come back on the US set-up, how much of your commercial activity could you transfer from Europe to the US and what type of aircrafts could you build there -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are talking, Antoine, you are talking about production?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Production &#x2013; final assembly line, actually.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So concerning what type of aircraft, A330 and others?</p>
          <p>My second question is regarding actually your production for this year of Airbus aircraft 470. It looks a bit cautious starting from 453, knowing you have more &#x2013; 12 more A380 plus production ramp-up of narrow bodies? Could you explain a bit this figure of &#x2013; if you please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no &#x2013; first, Antoine, there is no transfer of activity in the final assembly line of Mobile because the two airplanes we will assemble in Mobile are not assembled in Toulouse for the time being. They are &#x2013; because they don't exist. It's the tanker first and it's the cargo airplane and -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no plan for others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will begin production in the final assembly line in Mobile, but it's not taking jobs in Toulouse for &#x2013; to be very frank. And the &#x2013; if we go further, we will see, but for the time being, we stick on that. We could elaborate about that, but for the time being, we are not on transferring, but we are beginning production for new product in the Mobile assembly line.</p>
          <p>On the number of airplanes we deliver, it's &#x2013; even to go from 453 to 470 or 70, a bit more. Some units, about 70, it's already a change, but it's consistent with the fact that we are increasing the projection of single-aisle. We will have around 380 single-aisle, 85 long-range, and 13 A380s, compared to 367 single-aisle last year, 79 long-range, and 1 A380.</p>
          <p>If you make the addition of 2008, it's 477, but from the beginning of the year, we are not able to know if it will be whether &#x2013; 477 or 475 or 470. We are seeing a bit more than 470.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the Mr. Colin Crook from UBS. Mr. Crook, please go ahead with your question now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. It's Colin Crook from UBS. Just a couple of questions. Can you just clarify exactly what incremental currency hit do you expect EADS to suffer in '08 relative to '07, including the impact from the over hedging on A380? The first question.</p>
          <p>The second question relates to Power8 plus. Can you give us some idea of the timing of when we should expect something to come out in terms of the further measures you're expecting to take, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the first one, FX impact, obviously, as I said, this is going to be a volatile figure for the time being. It should be something like minus 0.5 billion, so 500 million in the order of magnitude, Colin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question, on the additional measures to Power8, Airbus is working on them. I could say that first, they are screening all the costs to see if it's possible for 2011 and 12 to go further than Power8. They are looking at R&amp;D expenses to know how to manage that in the most efficient way and to be more focused on R&amp;D, or as focused as possible.</p>
          <p>And third, they are looking at increasing the dollar content of our product. It can't be done in one day because we have contract with suppliers. We have to protect the ramp-up of production, and we have to protect the quality. It means that we're extremely &#x2013; we have to be careful for the existing programs. For the legacy program, we have to be careful, but clearly for the new programs, it means that A350 and certainly, the new short range, we will have to be more aggressive on the dollar content.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you said in &#x2013; when we were in Seville, that you expected something by the end of March, in terms of announcement of further measures. Is that -?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not about announcement. We &#x2013; first, Airbus has to go before the Executive Committee of EADS, and after that, we will go to the Board of the EADS. And after that, we will come back to you. It means that it will be during spring.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two. Well, a series of minor ones, really. I just wanted to know what the actual A380 costs were in '07, because you said it was a 1.5 billion reduction. So, was it a 1 billion cost that you suffered in '07?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the &#x2013; into '08 and the guidance. Could you please give us some idea of what kind of continuing costs do you expect to suffer in the A380? And also, if there are any further A350 transition costs? And just as an adjunct to that, the Power8 restructuring costs, do you expect any more above the line in '08?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. Yes. Yes -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Was the last one restructuring costs for 2008, I think, was your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In Power8 restructuring, any further above line costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We provided for all the social measures in our 2007 accounts. What's -- our ongoing costs, we spend when we &#x2013; while we carry out the program is on design-to-cost measures. So, there are some efforts of our engineers, where we have to invest something, it's not a big number, let me say. So, in the context of the guidance, it's really small.</p>
          <p>On the continuing costs for A380 for 2008, I think we do not give any program profitability, so what we have said, Zafar, is that the program should be breakeven on the serial cost side, roughly 2010, 11. So, you should still expect that there is a loss in 2008 on the program, which is not insignificant. 350 transition costs, most of that &#x2013; or all of that actually should have been digested in 2007. Obviously, the provisions might move with the currency. So, there is some ups and downs, depending on where the dollar goes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I take all that into consideration, Hans Peter, and just pick up on Ben's question, the underlying number you reported in Airbus for '07 was close to 2.5 billion, if I strip out these things. And given what you've just said on these various costs, the indication is, on the guidance you've given, and if I just extrapolate the other business numbers, then you're suggesting Airbus isn't going to make much more than about 6, 700 million of EBIT. Surely you can't suffer price deterioration of close to 1.7, 1.8 billion?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, definitely not. But I'm not going to argue with you about the reconsolidation of Airbus, and certainly, when you do that, Zafar, don't forget the currency.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in 2007 we had a lot of positive contributions coming from A380 hedges, and from revaluation of liabilities, so that is a significant number you would have to deduct if you reconcile that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, there. First question is on loss-making contract provisions. I think I remember from Q3, this was an item which arose and we were told it would be quite difficult to forecast because it goes up and down with currency. And if the currency gets worse, there could be some more contracts which slip into loss making, and you have to make provision for them. If we're at 1.55, is this more that would then crop up if it stays at 1.55, that will crop up in 2008, and which are not included in the guidance already?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just the financial charges and based on what we know at the moment, what we can try to forecast for 2008 for the financial charges in the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, let me come to your first one. 1.55 and what is the potential impact of provisions? I mean, I'm not giving you any precise numbers here. But all what we can say is that it is significant movement, if the dollar moved to 1.55 and it's not included in our guidance as Louis has said before. So, it's in the three-digit million area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the other one, just a second. The financial result, I think was your question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I mean, what we have to keep in mind in the other financial result is obviously the unwinding of the discount on provisions, which was a number around or close to 200 million in 2007. So, it's also not insignificant.</p>
          <p>And then on the dollar cash assets, I mean, it depends where the dollar goes, obviously. And it can easily also be 100 million-plus or 100 million-minus. So, depending on that, I cannot give you a forecast.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Going back to your guidance for deliveries &#x2013; Airbus deliveries in '08. Again, looking at the 470 number, this is a long way from your 2010 goals for production. And what's constrained you in terms of increasing those delivery rates? Are there specific aspects of the supply chain that are particularly difficult there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, the main constraint for increasing the production is supply chains, is clear and when you know, that for the landing gear we have to order two years before the delivery of the part to Airbus, because it's a forging part, and it's a very difficult to increase the production of the forging part, you have a good example of constraint we have on the supply chain.</p>

It was a time when Boeing was recovering and in very aggressive way. And it was a fierce competition, I have to say that, fortunately, 2007 has shown that we were able recover on prices. It's &#x2013; and we have to continue that way. I think, we have to make our efforts to sustain our prices, especially with others -</p>

          <p>Yes. There is one major answer to that, which is consumption of provisions. So, we are going to consume, I would say, a significant part of the Power8 provisions, just as one example. And then obviously on the financial result, there is some negative impact and if the result remains positive as what we expect obviously, then obviously, there is potentially also some tax effect.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. Just two questions. First, if you look at your '08 guidance and your 2011 operating plan, it looks like the FX headwinds significantly higher then the incremental cost savings you're planning for. So, could you just talk about what you're seeing that gives you confidence that you will be able to get up to that profitability level.</p>
          <p>And then another minor question which really just &#x2013; could you give us an idea of the capital you intend to put into the facilities in Alabama for the tanker, as well as for the cargo aircraft. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the first &#x2013; the second question I could give you a very short answer. We are not giving any figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you could &#x2013; perhaps in the future we could be a bit more outspoken and specific but for the time being, we are not giving figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first point -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what makes us so confident that we increase; improve performance, Scott, that was your first question. I think, given the FX headwinds you have mentioned. I mean, indeed if we look from between 2007 and 2008, there is a significant impact if you compare the two years. What makes us confident is that obviously; Power8 is not only on track, we are at least last year slightly ahead.</p>
          <p>And what &#x2013; if we look into the future what is the most difficult year is 2009, where we have a significant deterioration on the hedge book side and probably, not yet the necessary level of impact coming from Power8, which will then only flow into the P&amp;L in 2010. But I mean, the key is obviously to deliver on Power8. And we are confident that we are able to do that, Louis.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow up on that. I mean, if we look at just the pure math of it, it looks like the Power8 would be an incremental savings of somewhere around 1.7 billion, your headwind is going to be closer to five, I imagine. So, what are the other factors that &#x2013; is it just volume, or is it just A380 losses going to profit? I mean, what are the things that are -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, of course, we are improving and growing our businesses and not only on the Airbus side. We are significantly growing in the Eurocopter business, in the Space and in the Defence business. And we are overproportionally growing the margins, that is &#x2013; our today's plan. And so far, you should see much improved performance coming from the non-Airbus businesses especially, but also the underlying business. If the cycle remains somewhat robust, is &#x2013; Airbus is stable.</p>

          <p>Good. Before we close, I'd like to finish on a personal note. This was my last conference call as Head of Investor Relations. I'm moving to a new position at EADS and Natalie Haas whom you know well will take over from me. You gave me six captivating years of good and bad times, and I will miss tremendously this great window into the world. Good luck to you. May your investments be rewarded.</p>
          <p>Good luck to my IR team, which I really love and admire and thank you to Hans Peter for his support in favor of clean and candid communication.</p>
          <p>For the coming hours and days, please e-mail your questions to your usual contact, copy me on your e-mails to Natalie, as she will be traveling for two straight weeks, if you want quick answers. Good day to all of you.</p>
