        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Matt Ginter, Head of Investor Relations for 3M.  I'd like to welcome all investors and analysts to our first quarter 2008 business review.  You will find this morning's presentation on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com.  These slides will remain on the site along with an audio replay of today's call for an extended period of time.</p>
          <p>Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements on slide 2. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results.  These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.</p>
          <p>I also wanted to mention that our Annual Investor Day meeting, which will be here in St. Paul, will take place on September 9.  Please hold the date and more details will follow.</p>
          <p>George Buckley, our CEO, and Pat Campbell, our CFO, will both make some formal comments today, and then we will get to your questions.  Today is a very busy day as many companies are reporting earnings and I know you're all very busy, so we'll do our best to keep the call to about one hour.  And you can help during the Q&amp;A by limiting yourself to one question and one follow-up.  We appreciate it.  This way all questions can be fully addressed.</p>
          <p>So, now go to slide 3, and I'll turn it over George.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Matt, and good morning everybody.  Today I'll give you my views on the quarter along with some comments on the rest of the year.  In an uncertain economic environment like the one that we're experiencing today, we are particularly blessed by the global presence and strong diverse portfolio that 3M has developed over the years.  The investment we've been making in new products, in acquisitions, and particularly in strengthening the core of 3M is paying off handsomely and it's these factors which have allowed us to do so well even as we deal with the weak US economy and face the challenges of our LCD-based Optical Films business.</p>
          <p>So first and right up front, I should like to affirm our 2008 goal of EPS growth of 10% or more.</p>
          <p>The quarter was a tale of four principal factors: first, excellent performance in four of our six reporting segments; second, slowing US growth as evidenced by slower performance in our Consumer &amp; Office business; third, superb international performance; and fourth, continued slowing of and margin compression in the Optical Films business.</p>
          <p>Overall, we had good results with sales up 9%, bolstered somewhat by foreign exchange and EPS up 8%.  And we maintained margins at or about 20% or better in all of our businesses even as we continue to invest in R&amp;D, additional sales presence, a more efficient supply chain, and in acquisitions.</p>
          <p>It will surprise nobody that we saw Consumer &amp; Office segment slow in the first quarter and it finally mirrored the experiences seen by US retailers and other suppliers into that market, though we've clearly been taking market share in many important product categories. As companies in the US cut back in banking, in airlines, in brokerages, and with the contraction in residential construction, people are naturally buying less of these types of products.  The US economy as we see it from our Consumer &amp; Office perspective continues to be slow in the end markets.</p>
          <p>Net sales in the Consumer &amp; Office business were up 2.6% while local currency sales were down 2.5%.  Margins held in at about 20% but we must expect that the Consumer &amp; Office market will continue to be weak in the second quarter, and likely it will persist throughout the balance of 2008.</p>
          <p>Performance was helped by continuing improvements internationally and I think that given the tough US market challenges that this was still a great performance by the Consumer &amp; Office team.  We may see some improvement as the current inventory corrections in the United States finish but we don't expect this to be transformational.</p>
          <p>Our Industrial &amp; Transportation business saw nothing less than stellar performance.  Sales were up 17% and profits were up about 15% with the margins coming in at 22.6%.  This great performance went right across the entire Industrial &amp; Transportation sector.  Like many other parts of our business, it has underscored the wisdom of our invest-in and extend the core strategy.  Along with international growth and our localization initiatives there, this focus on the core has been the primary reason we've been able to do so well in these tough market conditions. Pat will give you more details in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Health Care performance was also strong. Sales were up 12%. Operating income was up nearly 20%, and margins approached 30%.  New products continue to reinvigorate the product portfolio of Health Care. For example, we plan to release our Digital Dentistry System in higher volumes as the year progresses.  Health Care will continue to be one of those segments that receives targeted investments.</p>
          <p>In Safety, Security &amp; Protection services, the focus on the core business is also paying off there. For the quarter, we saw broad based growth in respiratory products, window films, corrosion protection, and Track and Trace solutions.  Sales were up over 13% in the first quarter and profits were up 12%.</p>
          <p>We've been building this business steadily over the past 2 or 3 years, and even with the contraction in industrial minerals business, and no X factors to drive sales, we've still done remarkably well.  The future looks very bright in the Safety and Security business and the acquisition of Aearo, which will significantly expand our occupational health and personal safety lines, received final European regulatory clearance and closed on April 1. Our support of security agencies around the world also gathers good strength.</p>
          <p>Our Electro &amp; Communications business continues to do well also. Sales were up more than 9% and profits were up over 13%.  Overall, E&amp;C showed great growth all around the world.  New products, both those developed in-house and acquisitions, are driving that growth.  We're seeing increasingly strong demand now for our ceramic core reinforced high voltage overhead wire product and it is swinging into profit now, albeit small for the time being.  We achieved this performance despite significant end of life contraction in flex circuits for inkjet printers.</p>
          <p>Display &amp; Graphics was clearly our biggest challenge in the first quarter. Sales fell by 6% and earnings fell by 37%, largely because of significant weaker dollar volume in the Optical Films business, which overshadowed solid performance by Commercial Graphics and Traffic Safety.  As we outlined for you in December last year, our mission in Optical Films is very straightforward.  First, we are establishing stronger working relationships with our customers, much as we did when we first built this business over a decade ago. By reconnecting with them, we will more clearly understand their needs as we provide them the solutions they need in a fast changing technologically driven marketplace.  Second, we are vigorously driving out costs and introducing new cost competitive films to deliver better value to our customers.  And third, we continue to strive towards a profitable and sustainable business in the market with explosive growth potential.</p>
          <p>To drive this mission, we've installed new leadership in the Optical Systems division.  The division is now managed by Jim Bauman, who formerly led the improved performance in our Automotive OEM business.  In addition, we have in place new technical and manufacturing leadership.  Importantly, we have moved the division headquarters to Asia to be closer to our customers and close to the rapid innovation and change that is taking place in the set and panel manufacturers in this incredibly fast-moving industry.</p>
          <p>Over the last year or two, we have talked a great deal about the rapid rate of change in this market.  The first quarter was no exception.  And if anything, it was surprising how quickly the market moved towards monetization in the quarter.  These challenges will likely extend throughout 2008 as the flat-panel TV market continues to transition to commodity products.  We enjoyed the growth in this business and now we are managing it as a transition to a business much more like the rest of 3M.</p>
          <p>But please keep in mind that this is still an enormous market with enormous potential to those that can get the cost and product structure right, just as we are doing.  We're in the field sampling many new lower cost products that should win new converts.  So despite being in transition, Optical Films remains a good business for 3M, a business with both good growth potential and operating margins comparable to those of the rest of the company.</p>
          <p>A piece of good news in this general Optical area is the strong interest we are getting for our new mini-projector with applications in many new areas.  Because of the rapid movement of these markets, in a break from tradition, it's our intention to license this technology openly, widely, and quickly.  It's in its very early days of this product, but we hope it will quickly become a fine contributor to 3M's overall product portfolio.</p>
          <p>So to keep this in proper perspective, we have very positive performance across our portfolio.  Four of our six businesses are achieving double digit profit growth and one is a little softer, as expected, a true testament to the power of 3M's diversity and its recent investments.  As I mentioned earlier, we're especially grateful for the 3M business model in times like these.</p>
          <p>Like all manufacturers, we are combating significant upward pressure on commodity prices, transportation charges, and energy costs.  This has put pressure on gross margins, which we are fighting hard to resist.  However, as you'll see from Pat's charts later, the reduction in gross margin this quarter is all attributable to Optical.  As you can well imagine, we are designing products that substitute lower cost alternatives, which takes time to do, and we are taking price increases wherever we can.  So continued operational excellence is vital in these environments, and our focus on Lean manufacturing, faster web speeds, better sourcing, and yield improvements are keys to success.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains very strong and we just posted our 50th consecutive annual dividend increase, and our pension plans remains well funded at around 100%.  This gives us enormous flexibility on where to deploy resources.  The supply chain initiatives continue at a steady pace with no hiccups in the transition.</p>
          <p>Just as our diverse portfolio contributed to our success this quarter, so too did our international strength.  In the first quarter, two-thirds of our sales were from international and grew by 13%. China, Russia, India, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe are all growing between 15 and 30% annually, and we are very encouraged by the acceleration of growth in Latin America over the past year.</p>
          <p>We see this Latin American region as a major opportunity for growth. It is politically and economically stable, friendly to the US, and right in our figurative backyard.  In 2007, sales were $1.7 billion, which is larger than China for now, and growing in the teens of percent with margins well over 20%.</p>
          <p>So absent the impact of declines in Optical, the businesses in all international markets remain surprisingly strong across the world.  We have an unequaled global team in the presence and they are hitting it on all cylinders.</p>
          <p>So in summary, challenges in Optical and in the United States will be offset by other areas which are performing even better than expected. We are staying on the course of growth, prudently investing in our core and near adjacencies and in acquisitions.  International will continue to be a positive factor overall for us. And as always should the need arise, we will cut our cloth according to the size required.</p>
          <p>So now I'll end where I began. Our geographic and market diversity enables us to reaffirm our 2008 EPS target of 10% or more despite the challenges we face.</p>
          <p>So now, I'll hand the call over to Pat for more first quarter detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, George, and good morning everyone.  Please turn to slide number 5. All information in today's presentation will exclude special items.  You'll recall that last year's first quarter earnings per share of $1.85 included net gains of 422 million or $0.57 per share from the sale of the company's branded pharmaceutical business in Europe net of various other special items. Excluding special items, in Q1 of 2007 earnings per share was $1.28.  There were no special items in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>As George pointed out, we continued our trend of quarterly records for sales, operating income, and earnings per share in the first quarter.  Sales were up 8.9% to $6.5 billion, led by Industrial &amp; Transportation, Safety, Security &amp; Protection Services, Health Care, and Electro &amp; Communications.  Local currency sales were up 3% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at the company geographically, internationally we drove broad based growth with double digit sales growth in Europe, Latin America, Canada, and Asia-Pacific excluding Optical.  Operating income was $1.5 billion, an increase of 3.6% over the same quarter last year, with four of the six business segments achieving double digit operating income increases.  Operating income margin was 23.2%, as all six businesses delivered 20% or so plus margins in the quarter.  First quarter earnings were $1.38 per share or an increase of 8%.</p>
          <p>Currency has gone in our favor for some time now and in the first quarter was no exception.  We benefit perhaps more than your typical multinational because of our significant international footprint.  Two-thirds of our first quarter sales occurred outside the US with an even larger percent of our profits.  Currency added about six points of sales growth in the quarter and an estimated $0.07 to earnings per share.  The earnings impact is indeed an estimate as it picks up the positive elements of the weak dollar, but it does not comprehend the higher commodity prices we are feeling related to dollar dominated commodities. So, the true net earnings impact would be muted somewhat.</p>
          <p>In addition, as we have previously explained, we proactively manage currency gains to the extent we can.  We have committed to deliver 10%-plus EPS growth in good and bad times.  And when currency is a tailwind, we work to invest the excess to ensure a predicable stream of future earnings, thus improving long-term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Overall, I'm pleased that we were able to deliver these results despite a very difficult US consumer, housing, and auto marketplace, the softening Optical business, and record level commodity prices.  As we pointed out to you previously, we expected Q1 to be our toughest comparison for the year due to our outstanding performance in last year's first quarter.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 6 for an in-depth review of the first quarter performance versus the same quarter last year.  All information on this slide excludes special items.  The story around the P&amp;L this quarter needs to be separated into two pieces, Optical and the rest of the company.  As you can see at the far right of the chart, excluding the impact of Optical, gross margins and operating income margins would have been better than last year, so our broad-based portfolio continues to perform as anticipated.  Sales would have been up 11% and operating income would have been up 12.2%.</p>
          <p>Optical, on the other hand, saw their operating income halved from last year with a sales reduction of 16%, which results in the decline of margins, but still well within our guided margin range for the year.  As I previously mentioned, we delivered all-time record sales, operating income, and earnings in the first quarter.  Now including Optical, first quarter sales increased 8.9%, boosted by currency translation effects, with operating income up 3.6% and earnings per share up nearly 8%.</p>
          <p>Net interest expense was 25 million, up 15 million year on year, primarily due to higher debt balances.</p>
          <p>And finally, the first quarter tax rate was 31.8%, a decline of 1.4 percentage points versus the same quarter last year.  This decline in tax rate is consistent with our goal of reducing our tax rate by 1% per year.</p>
          <p>The P&amp;L on a sequential basis is found on slide number 7 and reflects solid performance in several categories.  Sales were up 4.1% versus the fourth quarter.  We kept SG&amp;A relatively flat versus last quarter and SG&amp;A (sic) [R&amp;D and related] spending declined by 1.7%.  With four of our six businesses delivering positive sequential growth, we leveraged this into a 16.3% operating income improvement.</p>
          <p>Operating margins improved by 240 basis points sequentially, driven by a combination of strong sales in our emerging markets and developed international markets and outstanding operational discipline.  On a sequential basis, net income and earnings per share increased 14.5 and 16% respectively.</p>
          <p>Now, let's break down the components of sales growth for the quarter.  Please turn to slide number 8.  On a worldwide sales basis, we grew 8.9% in US dollar terms, with international up 13% and the US up 1.6%.  First quarter organic volumes were up 1.6%, while selling prices declined by 30 basis points and acquisitions added 1.7% of growth.  Selling prices were negatively impacted by 1.1% due to price reductions in our Optical Film business in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Globally, we are aggressively pursuing price increases where we can to help offset record level commodity price inflation.  Global revenue growth was boosted by foreign exchange to the tune of 6% in the quarter.  Internationally, local currency sales were up 3.4% versus the same quarter last year.  Organic volumes increased 3.9% as five of six business segments posted positive local currency growth.</p>
          <p>Selling prices declined 1.4%, driven by a 14% decline in Optical pricing.  Excluding the impact of Optical, international selling prices increased 30 basis points.  Acquisitions added an additional 90 basis points of growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Regionally, local currency growth was led by Latin America at 15%, followed by Canada at 7, and Europe at 3.  The Asia-Pacific region delivered 0.8% local currency growth in the first quarter, which was negatively impacted by an 18% decline in the Optical Film business.  Excluding Optical, local currency growth in Asia-Pacific was 8% versus last year.</p>
          <p>As many others have already reported, growth in the US was more difficult due to the slow economic conditions with local currency growth of 2%.  Organic volumes declined 2.8% while selling prices and acquisitions added 1.7 and 3.1% respectively.  First quarter business segment performance was a tale of two stories. On the positive side, we saw strong growth of 13% in our Industrial &amp; Transportation business, 7% growth in Electro &amp; Communications, and 3% growth in Health Care.  This growth was offset by sales declines of 9% in Consumer &amp; Office, 5% in Display &amp; Graphics, and 4% in Safety, Security &amp; Protection Services.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 9 for review of our Industrial &amp; Transportation business.  This is our largest segment, representing about a third of our sales. And in the last quarter, its revenues grew faster than any other business. It was truly a remarkable quarter for this team.  First quarter sales in the segment grew 17.1% to $2.1 billion. In local currency terms, sales increased 9.6%, including a 4 point boost from acquisitions.  Our efforts to reinvigorate 3M's core is paying off in spades here. In fact, all of our largest core industrial businesses, including abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket, and automotive OEM each drove double digit sales growth in the quarter, along with personal care products, aerospace, and our oil and gas market initiative.</p>
          <p>Throughout 2007, we stepped up our investment in this business to strengthen our already unrivaled portfolio of core technologies.  Through increased R&amp;D and a number of bolt-on and complementary acquisitions, we have begun to transform our tapes, abrasives, and adhesives businesses into a legitimate growth engine for the company.  And we are extending the core by expanding into fast growing adjacencies such as professional abrasive power tools and solar energy solutions.</p>
          <p>In our market leading Automotive Aftermarket division, which supplies technology based solutions to auto body shop repair around the world, growth was driven largely by abrasives, masking, and refinishing products.</p>
          <p>We also have effectively reinvented our Abrasives division in the past year, driven by special application products for dozens of industries including Marine, Aerospace, Wood and Metalworking, and Automotive OEMs.</p>
          <p>Geographically, we saw outstanding double digit growth in every region worldwide, including the United States, with growth led by Europe.  We are driving added market penetration in emerging markets as our Industrial business continues to make significant investments in China, India, Poland, and Brazil.</p>
          <p>First quarter operating income in Industrial &amp; Transportation was 472 million, up 15.2%, with operating margins of 22.6%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 10, where you will find the first quarter highlights for our Health Care business, which is a leading provider of medical, dental, and orthodontic products along with drug delivery and health information systems. Health Care extended its stellar 2007 performance into the first quarter of 2008.  Local currency growth including acquisitions was 5.9% in the quarter, virtually all organic.  Three of our Health Care divisions drove double digit sales growth, namely Medical, Dental, and Orthodontics, with Medical leading the way.  International sales growth was outstanding in Q1 as we drove double digit growth in all regions outside of the United States.</p>
          <p>Our Dental business was recently recognized as the most innovative company in the worldwide dental industry for the third consecutive year by the independent publication, 2007 Dental Industry review.  The award commended 3M's track record on innovation and is based on achievement in three categories: the number of new product clearances in the US market, the number of approved US patents, and the number of European and worldwide international patents.</p>
          <p>We also drove strong double digit sales and profit growth for the quarter in our Medical division, another of 3M's critical core businesses.  Recently we extended our core offering in this business by introducing a transparent antimicrobial dressing to cover and protect patient's catheter sites.  And of course, we are leveraging the 3M Tegaderm brand in order to highlight its value in the eyes of healthcare practitioners around the world.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in our core Health Care businesses while pursuing strategic synergistic acquisitions.  In fact, we have added more than 10 acquisitions in the past two years.  The team is working hard to bring new products and solutions that will enhance the patient experience and drive productivity for the healthcare professional.</p>
          <p>First quarter operating income in Health Care increased 19.6% to 321 million and margins at 29.8%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 11 for a recap of first quarter performance for the Display &amp; Graphics business.  Since George covered Optical Systems in a fair amount of detail, I will try to be brief here.  Sales for Display &amp; Graphics were down 5.9% in the first quarter and operating profits were down 37%.  Operating margins came in at 21.5%.  Positive sales growth in Traffic Safety Systems and Commercial Graphics were more than offset by lower than expected sales in Optical Systems.</p>
          <p>Display &amp; Graphics faced a traditional seasonal slowdown in our Traffic Safety Systems business as the highway construction season obviously slows during the first quarter during colder climates.  We also experienced some softness in the rebranding aspects of the Commercial Graphics business, which is not unusual to see when the economy slows.  We continue to see strong demand for our on-premise graphics services and fleet graphics in Commercial Graphics.</p>
          <p>In Projection Systems, we have introduced some unique super close projection products and are scaling up production of 3M's Mobile Projection Technology, an ultra-compact, LED-illuminated projection engine designed for personal electronic devices.  George mentioned this briefly in his comments.</p>
          <p>Traffic Safety and Commercial Graphics are highly stable, long-term winning businesses for 3M.  So, although slower growth in the first quarter, these will rebound and we have some exciting new technologies in microprojection as well.  We obviously have challenges in Optical in 2008, but rest assured we are addressing them aggressively and we feel very good about the D&amp;G business longer term.</p>
          <p>Safety, Security &amp; Protection Services also had an outstanding quarter as shown on slide 12.  Sales rose 13.4% to $859 million. Local currency sales growth was 6.4% with 1.9% from acquisitions.  We posted strong growth in three of our four businesses: respiratory protection, protective window films, and cleaning solutions for commercial buildings, and corrosion protection.</p>
          <p>As a leading manufacturer of occupational safety products, asset tracking solutions, security systems, and building safety solutions, we continue to see exceptional growth in both developed and emerging economies outside the US. International sales expanded at a double digit clip in the quarter with equally strong contributions from Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.</p>
          <p>On April 1, as George mentioned, we completed the acquisition of Aearo Technologies, a global leader in the personal protection industry.  Through significant acquisitions such as this, we have expanded our safety portfolio to offer customers a more complete personal protection solution and we continue to see strong demand in this area.  We also have seen continued growth in our corrosion protection and security businesses, which were both supplemented with strategic acquisitions, namely E Wood and Security Printing and Systems Limited.</p>
          <p>Based upon our advanced heat blocking technology, five 3M window films were selected to be part of an initiative to lower energy costs across the globe.</p>
          <p>The roofing granules business posted sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter. However, the business was still down slightly year on year.  Being that sales in this business are predominately US based, we continue to expect that sales will remain soft through the year due to the weak US housing market.</p>
          <p>Operating income was 204 million, up 12.4% versus last year's comparable quarter and margins were a solid 23.7%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number 13 for a recap of our Consumer &amp; Office business.  Year-on-year growth in this business was 2.6%, with sales in local currency down 2.5% for the quarter.  Consumer &amp; Office feels the pain of the US economic slowdown more quickly and directly than many of our other 3M businesses.  Recall we began feeling it in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2008, business conditions were even more challenging, driven by slower US same-store sales and further inventory draw-downs from our large US retail customers.  One bright spot in Consumer &amp; Office was our Homecare Products division, home to leading brands such as Scotch-Brite sponges and scrubbers, where sales increased over 10% in the quarter due in equal parts to volume and currency.</p>
          <p>In geographic terms, international sales were up almost 20%, following our focused investment strategy to grow this business.  We saw strong double digit growth in Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Latin America; while in the US where we derive over 50% of over revenues, sales declined year on year by 9%.  Going forward, we expect growth in the Consumer &amp; Office business to continue to be led by international operations as US growth will remain uncertain over the near term due to challenging economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Showing the strength of our relationships with key customers, we did earn some accolades from a couple of our largest customers.  Target recently awarded us the Partner of the Year award and Staples recognized us &#x2013; recognized our Post-it team as the Best Category Manager in the US, Canada, and Europe, the first time that a supplier has won the award in all three regions in the same year.  Internationally, our team in Brazil won the Vendor of the Year award from Sam's Club; and 3M Mexico won the Vendor of the Year from Wal-Mart.</p>
          <p>Operating income was 166 million, down 7% year on year, but profit margins remain in their 20% levels.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 14 for an overview of our first quarter performance in Electro &amp; Communications.  Our solutions in this business connect the world's power grid, enable global telecommunications, and help to connect scores of high tech electronic devices.  Electro &amp; Communications marked another solid performance with first quarter sales of 725 million, up 9.2%, and profits up 146 million or 13.6%.  Sales growth was led by our Electrical Markets division, another critical core 3M platform that serves the electrical utility, construction, and maintenance OEM markets, along with our Electronics Markets Materials business, where we provide adhesives, fluorochemicals, and abrasives to a number of industries, most notably semiconductor and electronic assembly. Electro &amp; Communications in total delivered 3.3% local currency growth in the quarter despite another tough sales quarter in our Flexible Connectors business, where a number of product solutions are going end of life.</p>
          <p>In geographic terms, we saw solid double digit growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America and single digit growth in the United States and Europe.</p>
          <p>We have invested in a number of customer technology centers and manufacturing facilities in key regions around the world to serve our customers in this business.  It is this kind of bench-to-bench intimacy that enables 3M to outgrow our competitors and become true partners with our customers.</p>
          <p>The first quarter balance sheet and cash flow metrics are found on slide number 15.  Free cash flow for the quarter was 699 million versus 670 million in last year's first quarter.  Income tax timing differences negatively impacted free cash flow in the first quarter versus last year to the tune of $200 million.  Traditionally, our free cash flow conversion in the first quarter is the lowest of each year due to historically strong sales in March and softer sales in December, which negatively impacts our working capital.</p>
          <p>Working capital turns were in line with the same quarter of last year and down 0.4 turn sequentially.  Foreign currency translation increased accounts receivable year on year by 289 million and sequentially by 150 million and inventories by 200 million versus last year and 82 million sequentially.  Capital expenditures were similar to last year's first quarter at 298 million, but down 93 million sequentially. Looking ahead for the entire year, we are now expecting capital expenditures to be in the range of 1.3 to 1.4 billion from our previous range of 1.4 to 1.5.</p>
          <p>Dividend payments for the quarter were 353 million and share repurchases were 510 million, both consistent with recent quarters.  Weighted average shares outstanding were 717.2, down 3% year on year and 1% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Our debt-to-cap ratio was 33% at the end of quarter.  Due to the closing of the Aearo acquisition on April 1, we did carry excess cash on our balance sheet at quarter end.</p>
          <p>Now let me cover our full year guidance, so please turn to slide 16.  As George mentioned, we continue to expect 10%-plus growth in earnings per share for 2008.  While some elements of our portfolio have gotten more challenging since our last earnings call, namely the US retail, housing, and automotive markets, along with Optical, others are performing as good or even better than expected.  And of course, the dollar has remained weak, which is helping our results as well.</p>
          <p>As previously expected, operating margins for the year should be in the 22.5 to 23.5% range and our tax rate in expected to be in the range of 31.5 to 32.5.  We expect capital expenditures as I previously mentioned to be in the 1.3 to 1.4 range.</p>
          <p>Let me take a quick moment to remind you of a couple of items that will impact our per share earnings in the second quarter.  As in past years, we will have higher sequential stock option expense in Q2 than we did in Q1 as we grant our options in the second quarter of each year and must recognize the expense on the date of the grant related to those employees that are retirement eligible.  Second quarter options expense will be $0.03 to $0.04 higher than in Q1.  Second, with the closing of Aearo on April 1, we estimate we will have $0.02 of acquisition related cost in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>That concludes our formal comments this morning. Now we will be happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question around organic growth, that US down 2.8%; George or Pat, what do you think that growth would have been if you folks had not been over the past few quarters putting in place your growth spending initiatives? I am just curious how much you think your initiatives have driven this number or is this still going to be something that's on the come in later '08 or in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, it's difficult to give you a precise answer to that question, but the new product vitality index that we measure is moving upwards about 2 points each year.  So I think it's fair to say that it would have been impacted. I don't know that I can give you number. Matt, do you have anything recorded there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's only an estimate, George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it has been positive, John, obviously but very difficult to give you a precise number. Can we make an estimate and get back to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for sure.  And then just as a follow-up, I know that at the December 12 meeting, we had thrown out a currency contribution for '08 of $0.05 to $0.15. And I think if I parse Pat's comments, the $0.07 times 4 is 28, but there are higher raw material costs and so forth. Maybe it's $0.25. I guess my question is that's 5% of the EPS contribution. It looks pretty good.  But how are we thinking about or how are you guys thinking currency potentially moving the other way? Between that and pension, are those headwinds something that we need to factor in here as you begin the look to '09, or for instance, do you feel like you have enough in the flex spending or other things to potentially offset was could invariably turn into some headwinds next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, Pat here. First of all, we never bank on either foreign exchange or pension returns from a long-term planning perspective. We view those as being a little more short-term in nature. So we plan the business more around a steady state operational basis. So what we try to do is when we have the benefits of foreign exchange and just to be clear with everybody, it is a difficult number to get your hands on.  I can give you a technical foreign exchange number, but I think you are all well aware there are other more macroeconomic impacts that affect business results, volume and so forth, that may be a little harder to come up with a good net number.</p>
          <p>We are definitely seeing on the commodity side some significant increases that we are trying to of course address through price increases and the like. What we are trying to do is while the currency is favorable for us is to continue to invest in our businesses so as currency does move, which eventually it will at some point in time, that what we've done is we've got a better growth base in the rest of our businesses so. That has been our strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I am here, Matt.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Matt. I wanted to clarify one thing. We live in this world of instant information so I've seen your initial report. For the benefit of everybody, we had a benefit in corporate miscellaneous versus the same quarter of last year and I want to make it clear what that is. This year, our pension expense is lower, as we've told you, to the tune of about $0.02 to $0.03 in the first quarter of this year. And what we did is that whole $0.02 to $0.03 essentially is affecting corporate miscellaneous. The amount of pension expense we're charging out to our businesses is essentially the same.  So that really accounts for the difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Matt, what should we model as then the corporate number for the rest of the year, do you think, for the other quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Lehman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Shannon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of the targets we didn't get updates on, the 5 to 8% organic growth for the year, are you still thinking that's achievable? And Display &amp; Graphics given the tougher first quarter here, there we were looking for mid-single digit organic and 24.5 to 25.5 on the margin. Do you have an updated view of those different targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shannon, I think in the current economic situation, getting to 5 to 8 is a nice aspiration, but probably unlikely. We're not throwing that away from where we want to be, but I just think it's probably unrealistic in today's economic world. And top of that with the situation that we are in with Optical, it just probably doesn't make that a realistic assessment.  So, you can be guaranteed that we're fighting for every piece of volume that we possibly can in today's economy.</p>
          <p>But importantly I guess, Shannon, I want to make sure that you don't connect &#x2013; we're saying we're going to give you 10% plus earnings growth. Don't tie that to necessarily 5 to 8% volume growth. We will get there without having the 5 to 8%. But that is clearly in our sights as what our objective is on more of a steady state economic environment world. If you get outside of the US, our international performance remains very, very, very strong. So that piece of the business ex-Optical for a second, I would say that we're still performing at the levels that are consistent with that 5 to 8% range. It's really the US impact and it's the Optical piece that is dragging us down at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another thing, Shannon, we talked about in the past &#x2013; this is George, is a multiple of IPI growth, and we seem to be well in the hunt for that. So we're not slowing faster than anybody else even with the kind of headwinds that we have talked about already this morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On IPI I've seen &#x2013; I don't know what the actual number will come in at I guess in the first quarter, but it's not going to be 0.5%.  Organic growth is like 1.3 with pricing a bit &#x2013; and the volume is a little different. But I mean you're not going to be at 2x IPI, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably 1.5, on that order.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the Display &amp; Graphics margin target, what's the updated view on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, Shannon, you have a very good question there. It's pretty hard to look at Q1 at being 21.5 and saying that our objective of 24.5 &#x2013; 25.5 is a realistic one. I think the best way to think about that business is to assume that Q1 will be probably indicative of where the year will run.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just then the last one is help me to put the no change to the annual guidance in terms of margin. Health Care looks like obviously it's coming in better. Where are the other big offsets given you've already got a decent drag from Display. Now it's going to look worse. Where are the offsets to keep the overall year flat to up 100 basis points on margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at it, where Industrial has gone, first of all let's go back to what our margin expectation is. Our margin expectation for the year is 22.5 to 23.5. We ran 23.2 here in the first quarter with Optical &#x2013; or D&amp;G really at 21.5. So I think they are very consistent that we can continue to perform at the company level where we say we are and then continue to bring D&amp;G down because it's somewhat like we ran here in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll leave at that. Thanks guys.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to approach the opposite of Shannon's questions and the outliers on the high side. I don't think it was a huge surprise at least for us that the rate of change in Display &amp; Graphics was negative, but I was certainly surprised that Health Care and Electro &amp; Communications came in as strong as they did. Are there any, and let's just address maybe one at a time, but it wasn't clear in the presentation if there are any kind of timing issues that may have &#x2013; mix or some timing issues that may have benefited margins in the quarter or if there is something that's purely volume driven and you are getting volume leverage maybe above and beyond what you have had historically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, there is nothing in either segment that is unusual that you should take away that there was an artificial impact on either one of those businesses. E&amp;C just continues to perform very, very well. They've got a few businesses that are absolutely doing gangbusters right now that are actually at higher margins than what their average is. So that continues to hold them up. And really Health Care across the board is just performing very well both geographically and across all business segments. So there is really nothing I would say that is unusual in either one of those that Q1 would be an outlier of what the future is going to look like for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, it's George here. We said very early in my tenure, what we're going to do is take the old traditional core of 3M and invest in it and make sure it remains strong. It became a base from which to build the rest of the growth platform. And what we've seen now, certainly what we're seeing at this moment in time and it has been progressively increasingly improving the past two years, we see &#x2013; Pat actually mentioned two of three of these in his presentation. We've seen wonderful performance, improved performance from Abrasives, from the Electrical Markets division which is in the E&amp;C segment that Pat just spoke about. We're seeing it in industrial tapes. We're seeing an improvement and resurgence in Medical and the automotive aftermarket. And one of the businesses that we were struggling with terribly, which was the Personal Care division which is the division that makes diaper tapes, is another business which is turning around.</p>
          <p>What I think is turning out to be true, Scott, is the wisdom of investing in those businesses and bulwarking those to make sure that we have a great platform to grow from. So, there is no reason at this moment in time for us to believe unless end market conditions worsen dramatically that we can't see continued either improvements or at least steady performance from those businesses. And it's so broad based and in such a lot of the big businesses and the big divisions of 3M, that's why you end up with even dealing with this Optical transition, why you end up with the good numbers that you do.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, and I want to go back and talk about Aearo a little bit. On the surface, the acquisition looked a little expensive to us. It's tough to tell. It's a bit of a unique asset, so it's hard to value from our perspective. But can you talk &#x2013; I know you have had a chance to close the deal and have a few weeks, and you've had a few months to do due diligence. Are there cost synergies, any other strategic benefits above and beyond what you talked about on the last conference call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll try to take it and see if George has anything to add to it, Scott. Based upon the feedback the business team has had with them, I think they feel even better about the business, the opportunities, the very solid organization they have at Aearo, the products they've got. The business has continued to perform actually even above our short-term expectations. So everything thus far has been very, very good. The integration planning has been just outstanding with them. So I can't say enough good about the relationship that we've had with the Aearo organization thus far.  And by all signals thus far, I would actually rate it probably a little bit better than we thought when we first looked at it.</p>
          <p>Scott, I think the other thing is just keep an eye on where others trade in that space. There has been another company sold in that space that we &#x2013; but just do your own assessment as to Aearo versus them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They weren't expensive enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually thought both acquisitions were expensive. We criticized the other company as well, so we are equal opportunity critics here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's good for you. One last point that I've got is that I've been traveling around internationally, Scott. We tend to when we do the modeling of these businesses, Pat and myself tend to be the very serious critics of synergies both in the cost area, but in particular in the sales area. Over many years of experience of these sorts of things, it is a place where companies seem to consistently make mistakes. What seems to be transpiring though here in Aearo, because they are relatively simpler products and they are so familiar and close to the OH and E&amp;S core that we've had for many, many years, is there is a very high level of comfort in being able to get out those Aearo products into the international markets and drive sales synergies. And of course, you can well imagine that Julie Bushman, who runs that business &#x2013; Pat and I have set Julie some pretty tough targets. And so I think that if this thing goes anywhere near as well as we expect, then we'll see better into the synergies. I'm not sure about better into the cost end yet &#x2013; in sales synergies, I meant.</p>

          <p>I've got it. It's 1.7% will be the organic in Europe for the quarter, which is somewhat of a slower growth rate for them versus last year's first quarter and from a trend standpoint. I didn't talk about Easter. It does affect them in more the Mediterranean part of Europe. So we do expect second quarter will be a little bit better. I didn't want to get into the excuse game.</p>
          <p>But I still feel very good about Europe. I think we have our eyes wide open in Europe to make sure that we don't see a slowing trend there. But I know that George has been there more recently than I have and we still feel very, very good about the programs that we have in Europe. Central East Europe, Africa, and Mideast continue to grow double digit rates. The story will be Western Europe over time. We did see a slowing but I used to tell you guys that any growth in Western Europe, I've always viewed as being a positive. And to some degree I still view that from a plan perspective and many of our countries have proven me wrong there and I'm glad they have. So I feel that we got a solid plan in place there. But we are watchful as to how the economic conditions are going to play out in the West.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, George, just a little further elaboration on your declaration if you will that Optical has gone commodity, was that a them versus us type comment or is that an all-in consumer preference comment?  Can you give us a little more color on attachment rates and what you are seeing with the mix and how the competition is shaking out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can do that, Jeff.  You'll recall it's a four segment business. It's LCD TVs, the handhelds, the notebooks, and monitors. And essentially, this particular story is really about LCD TVs. The handheld attachment rates, monitor and notebook monitors, while they jump around a little bit, have largely remained okay, at least I should say stable. There hasn't been the same intense pricing pressure in those markets simply because the value proposition of some of these high brightness films is very strong because they help battery life.</p>
          <p>So the whole game really is essentially down to the LCD TV market, Jeff. And you know the way that the bottom of that market has exploded and because the market in many respects is still trying to find bottom. It's trying to find out where is the smallest bill of material that it can get to with an acceptable performance for the &#x2013; from a set for a customer. And if other consumer electronics commoditizations give you a lead, what might happen is once the bottom is found at the lower end of the market, if you think about sort of good/better/best, once the bottom end of pricing at the lower end of the market, Jeff, has been found, the bottom end of pricing at the top end of the market will be found.</p>
          <p>And I think that there is likely going to be some recontenting. There are some positives in the energy area. For example, 3M's films can cut in a small television a third of the energy usage, in a bigger television more. But in the end, that may not be a place that will sell you more televisions but it might get customers to make choices left and right on a low energy versus a high energy set. So those things I think in the longer run help us. What we are also doing, Jeff, is putting something &#x2013; a lot of inexpensive but still relatively high performing diffuser films into the market so we can supply that bottom end of the market and get some more leverage there.</p>
          <p>So I think that still during 2008 in summary, Jeff, we are going to see more turbulence in that market as the set manufacturers in particular scramble for share and they prepare for digital switchover. I don't know if it's fully commoditized yet, Jeff. I suspect not, but I think this first bump hopefully will be the worst bump.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>George and Pat, good performance in Industrial, but no operating leverage; margins actually fell. Can you just comment or talk to that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave, we're glad you thought they did reasonably well. Based upon &#x2013; having a low 20s margin in a mainstream industrial business I think is a very good performance. Our objective in that business is not to grow margins as much as it is let's get the top line going. So if they can keep the top line growing in the way they have, keep margins where they are, I'd be perfectly happy with that model.</p>
          <p>Now, I think you've heard from H.C. Shin in the past that he has got a lot of focus on operational excellence to continue to drive productivity, get cost out, reinvest back into the businesses. One of the things that does hurt Industrial a little bit from a margin standpoint is we have made some acquisitions in that space that haven't been necessarily at the same margin level that some of our core businesses have, so it takes a while to build those profit rates up. But I'm not at all concerned with the level of margins within Industrial.</p>

          <p>By the way also, Dave, they are one of the units that suffers from commodity price increases more than anybody else. Consumer &amp; Office is also another. Everybody does, but if you wanted to pick on a couple that suffer it most, they are they.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood and thank you for that answer. One more thing, George, you mentioned about Optical Films still being a good growth business; you are referring to a new revised base, not from last year's base, correct?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I jokingly say sometimes, Dave, predictions are very difficult, especially when it might concern the future. The business is obviously shrinking, Dave. It's mainly shrinking due to two things, somewhat of attachment, primarily in TVs, and obviously price compression.  I think we're not fully through the transition yet, Dave, and if you let me make that observation I made about a good growth business in the future, let me make it from a new base that comes up in 2009.</p>

          <p>Yes, Deane.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Pat, I just want to go back to pension and FX for the quarter and make sure I have my math right. Pat, you said $0.07 from FX this quarter and that was $0.02 to $0.03 from pension?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Deane. But I do want to clarify it, if I could. FX, the way we calculate it is if you just literally take rate differences on both transactions and translation, and that's where you get the number. It does not pick up any of the other input related impacts of say a weaker dollar, on commodity prices and the like. So, it is probably an exaggerated example of what the real impact is on the bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how about your assumptions for the year?  When we look at that 10% plus, where would FX and pension combined represent of that 10%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean pension will be give or take $0.10. FX is probably in the 25 &#x2013; 30 range, but who knows, depending upon where rates end up. That's purely just taking quarter end rates and then assuming they stay that way for the rest of year, which I guess your crystal ball is probably as good as mine on that one.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think it was 1.58 a quarter end, so that's what we would have extrapolated in our last forecast.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just to recheck on Optical and I know we have beaten this one, but the assumption for the absolute EBIT decline for the year as of last quarter would be down 50 to 150 million and you were down 110 this quarter. Are you going to set a new range for that or George, I think you're saying, you really won't have a sense for this until 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Deane, I guess, let me try to get at your &#x2013; I think where you come from. December, we gave you a range for optical. I think that's where you are coming from. And in the quarter here, profits are going to halve in that business. So, we would expect that that trend from a year-over-year basis will probably continue to play out for the rest of the year here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The same trend from the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so you could expect similar downtrends second quarter year over year is what that means, Deane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I was able to draw it for you, Deane, is that business has been &#x2013; of course the profitability has been being reduced over time. So even during '07, if you look at Q1 to your Q4, it went down. So what we're saying is that what we're down here in the first quarter, that delta will probably carry through for most of the rest of the year. It could be that by the end of the year, it starts to tail off a little bit, but that's everybody's forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on the capacity expansion this year, just a quick update. There were 19 new plants. Where does that stand? And I see you are also cutting CapEx. Is that related at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not specifically, I view that $100 million reduction almost a little bit in the round. It does reflect the economic situation we are in and so forth because if your growth rates do slow a little because of economic conditions, there are some things that we possibly were looking at relative to capacity needs and so forth, I think we can just maybe push them off, push them off a little bit, so that's more tinkering at this point in time.</p>
          <p>But on the plants, if I recall the statistics right, Deane, out of the 19, we are scheduled to have about 13 of those up in running here by the end of the first quarter. The one that I think we have talked to you about in the past is Russia. Russia is the plant that we thought we would have up and running right now. We still are struggling a little bit getting final occupancy permit for that facility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just that environment, Deane</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's just the environment of Russia, so there is nothing that I would say from an operational execution standpoint that we are at all concerned on. Everything appears to be on track.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, what has actually been happening, Deane, is these plants have been coming in generally faster and generally at lower cost than we thought.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it will be fair to say that there are some discretionary decisions that customers make about when they have dental work done. And as people get more and more concerned about discretionary income, it could affect people's buying behavior. So I think it would be fair to say that there has been some feedback that maybe dentists have started to see some slowing in discretionary treatments and so forth. My counter a little bit is that it's hard to get into dentists at times as well, especially orthodontists. So that doesn't really impact you that much, but I think it would be fair to say that in a slowing economy, you will see some impact on discretionary dental care.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then just on the Optical side &#x2013; I hate to beat this one. I wish we could talk about something else, but it was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So do we.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was really bad in the quarter and when you think about &#x2013; you brought us out to the meeting in Minnesota and also in the New York, you walked through and I think made people feel comfortable that you had at least your hands around &#x2013; a fence around the situation to some degree. And you basically hit your decline target in the first quarter only a few months after you did that bottoms-up review. What's getting missed here? I know it's a totally dynamic market and it's in free fall. But what's getting missed here from the ground level up to the executive office, where you guys are just having such a hard time on visibility, totally acknowledging that this is a very unusual circumstance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's happening in the end markets, Steve, are the set managers &#x2013; I said this a little bit earlier, the set managers &#x2013; makers are scrambling for share. There is a reordering of the power base in the marketplace. The leverage has swung more to the set manufacturers than it was previously in the panel manufacturers or even the upstream manufacturers. Those dynamics are extraordinarily difficult to forecast accurately, Steve. They just are.</p>
          <p>All I will say to you, and I will pull you back to the other position, which is you have to look at 3M in its total context and 3M's total context. The core of 3M has done so very, very well, it was able to overcome and surpass the challenges in Optical roundly. So does that make us feel better about how to predict accurately what's going on in Optical? No, of course not, but what it does do is to make us feel a little bit happier about what we can predict in 3M in total.</p>
          <p>When things begin to fall in a marketplace, when we have these rapid changes, Steve, it's very difficult to know is the trajectory down 25% a year, down 50% a year, and the end game error can be significantly worse with one set of assumptions versus another. All you can do is go to your customers, try to get the lead information, try to bring products that they want to mitigate some of these changes, and bring value to the customer and &#x2013; I started also by saying this morning this is a business that we enjoy the upside and is now transitioning it appears to be a business very much more like the balance of 3M, and that's what we currently expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and then just lastly on the ForEx contribution, to get to your 10% growth, it was I guess $0.07 year over year. But doesn't the comp get a little bit tougher as you move in the half? So just taking the $0.07 and multiplying that by 4, I mean that wouldn't seem to be the right math on that. And I am just curious because this is a key aspect now of you guys getting to your annual target. Doesn't that EPS impact get a little bit lighter as we move through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, you are right. Exchange rates started to move more towards the back end of the year, so it's not as simple as just taking 7 times 4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is something else in the 25 to 30?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it also is &#x2013; we also have to look at where our hedging situation is. I remind you, Steve, that we hedge about half of our exposure, so you are on a year lag for about half of it. So on some of our hedges, when you look at the back half of the year on a year-over-year basis, we'll be probably better off on those than we were in '07. So that's what probably evens it out a little bit.</p>
