          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Carrie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Year End Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Briggs, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Briggs, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Mr. Sheldon G. Adelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Leven, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Rob Goldstein, Executive Vice President and President of the Venetian and Palazzo Las Vegas; and Ken Kay, our CFO; Steve Jacobs, CEO of Sands China Limited, and Tom Arasi, CEO of Marina Bay Sands.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. I would also like to caution you that the company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release under the caption forward-looking statements for a discussion of risks that may affect our results.</p>
          <p>In addition, we may discuss adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted property EBITDAR, which are non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Adelson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining us today. I will begin the call today by sharing a few general thoughts on the quarter. I'll then hand the call over to Mike and the team to provide some additional detail.</p>
          <p>In Macau, I am pleased to report that we generated more EBITDA from our three properties during the fourth quarter of 2009 than in any other quarter in the company's history. We continue to lead the Macau market in this most important measure of financial performance.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the often-quoted gross gaming market share figures, we firmly believe that EBITDAR is the appropriate measure of overall financial performance, and that growth in this metric, along with increasing returns on net invested capital, will translate directly into shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Total net revenue at our three properties did increase 25% compared to last year's fourth quarter, but most importantly, adjusted property EBITDAR increased a whopping 48% across our portfolio of properties in Macau.</p>
          <p>At the Venetian Macau, EBITDAR for the quarter was a record $175 million, an increase of over 55% compared to last year's fourth quarter. EBITDAR margin increased to 30.6%, another quarterly record.</p>
          <p>The Four Seasons Hotel Macau and Plaza Casino also had its best quarter yet. The strength of our business model in Macau is clearly on display in our quarterly results. Our focus on the highly profitable mass gaming hotel and retail businesses, together with our attention in cost structure and efficiency, has allowed us to grow our EBITDAR faster than others in the market that rely more heavily on lower margin segments for growth.</p>
          <p>A strong quarterly performance provides momentum as we resumed the construction process on our largest Cotai strip development to date, hotels five and six directly across the Cotai strip from the Venetian Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao. We'd like to call that development the game changer. Because we believe the addition of -- to the Cotai strip of a development of that scale at 13.3 million square feet, together with this resident cornucopia of world-class attractions and amenities will change the dynamic in Macau quite dramatically.</p>
          <p>The first phase of the development featuring 3,700 hotel rooms from the Shangri-La, Traders, and Sheraton brands will open in June 2011, around 16 months from today. The second phase of the development will open approximately six months thereafter, and will feature an additional 2,300 rooms from the Sheraton Towers brand, totaling 6,000 keys.</p>
          <p>We are confident that the addition of our latest integrated resort development will both enhance Macau's appeal as the tourism and nice destination and extend our position as the leading mass market operator in Macau.</p>
          <p>Also during the quarter, we completed the sale of a minority interest in our Macau operations, so the listing of Sands China Ltd. on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. SCL now trades in Hong Kong under listing code 1928, must have been a good year. We were pleased to both increase our cash reserves to just under five billion of unrestricted cash on our balance sheet, and to offer Asian and other investors the opportunity to participate in the future growth of Macau through Sands China Limited.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Marina Bay Sands development in Singapore, we are now entering the final stages of our pre-opening activities and expect to announce the specific April opening date next week.</p>
          <p>Genting Singapore opened last Sunday and early indications are that activity is brisk and robust. This contributes to our enthusiasm about the property's potential to generate both significant growth and strong returns. We look forward to introducing this iconic destination resort to the world in about 10 weeks and to formally celebrating its debut with the people of Singapore in a grand opening celebration in June.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me spend a moment on Las Vegas. The good news is that group business is returning. In fact, our group business is up 20% in the first 40 days of 2010 compared to last year. Forward bookings are also increasing for both 2010 and 2011. Excuse me. The Venetian and Palazzo were purposefully built to serve this customer segment, and with 2.25 million square feet of exhibition and meeting space, as well as 7,100 all-suite rooms and myriad dining and entertainment amenities, we believe we are extremely well positioned to benefit as the recovery in the group business sector continues.</p>
          <p>So overall, from my perspective, I'm extremely pleased with both our performance today and our positioning for the future. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sheldon. I'll add just a couple of big picture points, because I think the results pretty much speak for themselves, and we want to allow plenty of time for your questions.</p>
          <p>Our operating results clearly reflect our rightsizing of efficiency initiatives. We have eliminated over $500 million of costs from our expense base. We're working hard to make sure that a culture of efficiency and a focus on cost control will be among the most important pillars of our future success.</p>
          <p>Our strong results in Macau reflect both that focus on efficiency and a healthy gain in market. The Venetian Macau remains the clear market leader in mass play in Macau, delivering non-rolling drop of $905 million and a record slot handle of $659 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>We strongly believe that the development of critical mass on the Cotai Strip, including the City of Dreams as well as Galaxy's planned property at Cotai and our development parcels five and six, will not only expand the market, driving greater mass play, as well as greater hotel and retail revenues to our current and future properties, but also will contribute to the maturation process of the Cotai Strip and its evolution as Asia's premier business and leisure destination.</p>
          <p>Cash flow generation at the Venetian Macau continues to mirror our strategy. For every dollar of EBITDA generated at the property during the quarter approximately 49% was produced by less volatile, higher margin mass gaming and slot play.</p>
          <p>Approximately 26% was generated from non-gaming areas, including our hotel, convention, banquet and retail operations, and approximately 25% was contributed by the more variable lower margin VIP rolling play.</p>
          <p>We remain focused on developing and growing our premium direct business, which is the higher margin segment of VIP rolling play. The direct VIP play at the Venetian Macau grew to $1.7 billion, or approximately 17% of the more than $10 billion of rolling volume during the quarter.</p>
          <p>At the Four Seasons Hotel Macau and Plaza Casino, which is clearly benefiting from our 19 Paiza mansions, rolling volume grew impressively to $3.8 billion while direct VIP business accounted for 1.1 billion, or 29% of that amount.</p>
          <p>Let me spend a moment on the Sands Macau. The Sands Macau EBITDAR increased 8% to $56 million for the quarter reflecting healthy gaming volumes and the execution of the rightsizing and efficiency programs. Our flow through to EBITDAR was less pronounced at the Sands this quarter because of approximately 12 million of higher reserves for receivables, primarily relating to one longtime player.</p>
          <p>The Sands remains a market leader in mass play on the peninsula, delivering non-rolling drop of $579 million, and a record slot handle of over $352 million, an increase of nearly 40% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Rolling volume of $6.6 billion is the highest at the property since the third quarter of 2008. The operating momentum of our Macau properties continued in January of this year with strong year-over-year growth despite the fact that Chinese New Year fell in January last year.</p>
          <p>So that covers Macau. Let me spend a moment on Sands Bethlehem before Rob covers Las Vegas. Historically, it has taken about 17 months on average, for slot parlors in Pennsylvania to complete their initial ramp-up.</p>
          <p>Since we only opened the property in May of last year it clearly remains early days for the Sands Bethlehem. We continue to believe the property has great potential, particularly given the introduction of table games in the Pennsylvania market, which will occur later this year.</p>
          <p>With respect to our current performance we generated $6 million of EBITDAR for the quarter. We look to improve that performance in the near term through enhanced marketing programs. We're also dealing with our development strategy in light of the introduction of table games and are preparing to submit our application to install table games at Sands Bethlehem with the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. We expect to introduce approximately 80 tables to the property in the third quarter. The table games offering should enable us to serve a broader customer service segment, enhance our revenues and contribute to greater profitability of the property overall.</p>
          <p>With that let's go to Rob and Las Vegas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. The Las Vegas properties delivered EBITDAR of $57 million in the fourth quarter compared to $90 million in the fourth quarter of last year. In a nutshell, the game piece by business is holding up pretty well, in fact the volume levels today are trending above what they were 2008. The problem for us and for all of Las Vegas remains room rates; decreased hotel, food and beverage revenues, historically high margin segments of our Las Vegas business hurt our profitability in this quarter. In addition, low table hold also negatively impacted our results by about $20 million.</p>
          <p>Table game drop was $509 million during the fourth quarter, a modest increase from the fourth quarter 2008, while slot win was $51 for the quarter, about the same as 2008 fourth quarter. Our January performance in Las Vegas was quite healthy compared to last year principally due to revenue growth and continued impact of our right sizing initiatives. ADR for the month reflected a slight increase from last year. That's a particularly promising result given that last year's ADR in January includes some room blocks that were booked at the higher pricing levels that existed before the economic downturn. Looking ahead we will clearly realize more group rooms in 2010 than we realized in 2009.</p>
          <p>The pace of group bookings continues to improve and all signs indicate 2011 will be stronger than '10. In 2009 we realized approximately 470,000 group room nights, as of today we have more than that number on our books for 2010. In the month of January, we realized approximately 64,000 group rooms, up 17% from 55,000 group room nights in 2009.</p>
          <p>As Sheldon mentioned in his comments, we do expect that pricing will turn around as business expands and the economy eventually strengthens. Until then we will continue to focus on providing service to our business customers and work to ensure that our all-suite integrated resort offering remains the most attractive destination for business in the Las Vegas market.</p>
          <p>So in summary, our gaming business is relatively healthy with volumes trending above 2008 levels and our costs are down. Given that backdrop, we are confident that Las Vegas properties will exhibit significant operating leverage as price in the group business segment improves.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn it over to Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. As Sheldon mentioned earlier, during the quarter we completed the sale of a minority interest in our Macau operations. We also made marked progress on our de-leveraging strategy and mitigated the financial risk associated with covenant compliance on our credit facilities. We now have in excess of $5 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. That cash has significantly increased our financial flexibility and will enable us to execute additional components of our de-leveraging strategy in the future. Excluding our development financing of Singapore we've paid down or retired in excess of $1.1 billion of debt during the quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition to our cash balances at December 31, we have approximately $850 million of availability under our undrawn credit facilities at current exchange rates, principally through our Singapore credit facility. So together, we have approximately $5.85 billion of cash, cash equivalents and available sources of liquidity. The principal uses for that $5.85 billion include approximately $1.5 billion of capital expenditures pre-opening, FF&amp;E, and construction-period interest to spend on our Marina Bay Sands development in Singapore through the end of calendar 2010.</p>
          <p>An additional $400 million, principally retainage payments on the development, will be paid out of cash flow from the completed property in 2011. Further, approximately $400 million in additional equity contributions will be made toward the development of parcels 5 and 6 on the Cotai Strip in Macau. In addition, in March, we expect to close the previously announced $1.75 billion credit facility to fund construction of parcels 5 and 6 in Macau.</p>
          <p>The equity and project financing is sufficient to complete the first two phases of that development, which will feature over 6,000 hotel rooms and all the major cash flow generating components of the development. As of December 31, total debt was $11 billion while our cost of borrowing remains low. Our weighted average interest rate for the quarter was approximately 4%, compared to 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008. At our current levels of operating performance, our cash balances provide ample cushion for compliance <mark type="audio gap" /> U.S. restricted group covenant compliance purposes at December 31st, 2009.</p>
          <p>Our trailing twelve month EBITDA was $412 million. Our total gross domestic debt was $5.2 billion. Our cash balances within the U.S. restricted group were $3 billion. And our calculated net debt was $2.2 billion. Our leverage ratio was 5.3 times, compared to a maximum leverage covenant under our U.S. credit facility of 6.5 times. For the Venetian Macau restricted group, at December 31st, 2009 our trailing twelve month EBITDA, for compliance purposes was $940 million.</p>
          <p>Total gross debt at the Venetian Macau restricted group was $2.6 billion, and our leverage ratio was 2.81 times, compared to a maximum leverage ratio of 4.5 times. We remain focused on maximizing operating profitability to enable debt reduction. While our business will naturally generate a significant amount of free cash flow that will enable deleveraging in the future, we also expect to execute in due course the sale of non-core assets, which will enable significant debt repayments and enhanced return on investment.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call back over to Sheldon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ken. Before we go to Q&amp;A, let me make a couple of final points. We worked very aggressively over the last year to right-size our cost structure and to clean up our balance sheet. The results of those efforts are now clear. We just completed the most successful quarter in our history, generating record revenues and EBITDAR, and our balance sheet now has more than five billion of cash, providing significant financial flexibility, enabling us to continue our industry leading growth strategy.</p>
          <p>We stand today on the cusp of our next major phase of our growth. In about 10 weeks, Marina Bay Sands will open its doors to the public, introducing to the people of South Asia a convention-based, integrated resort destination that will be unique in the world. And less than 18 months from today, we will open additional integrated resort destinations on parcels 5 and 6 on Macau's Cotai Strip, including the Shangri-La, Trader's, Sheraton, and extend the Sheraton brands &#x2013; and extending our position in the world's largest gaming market on the doorstep of the world's fastest growing major economy.</p>
          <p>And while the Las Vegas market may not shine quite as brightly as our Asian properties, in the near term, our convention based business model remains compelling. And we remain confident that our group business strategy, together with our reduced cost base will enable us to perform well in Las Vegas in the years ahead, particularly in comparison with our competitors.</p>
          <p>With that, we'll move to your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you, Mike, for clarifying about the Sands Macau reserve being largely one longtime customer. Can you help us understand, and if you could do it by property, if you want to do it for Macau in the aggregate at the end of the fourth quarter, what sort of outstanding receivables you have out there, and what's reserved against that, and if you can talk about collections history in general. Obviously, we're all reading calls about China tightening, how concerned are you that you're adequately reserved?</p>
          <p>And then, the second Macau related question, if you can help us understand I guess what percentage of your VIP junket related business is on a revenue share basis, and then where are you on a percentage of revenues relative to what you think the market, or where the market is right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's about 10 questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple more, too, if I could ask.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me address the receivables.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, the memory is the first thing to go. I can't remember all those questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me address the receivables, and then Steve will take the rest of it. At the end of the year, you've got to breakdown the total receivables between casino, hotel and other. But I think what you're focusing is more on casino. We've got about, let's call it 440 million approximately of receivables. We have about a 22% reserve for doubtful accounts against that <mark type="audio gap" /> little bit higher than that in Vegas about 28%, but in Macau you've got to break it out between kind of the junkets and non junkets. If you back out the <mark type="inaudible" /> for which there is a fairly modest reserve against that, the reserve against the remaining receivable balance is about 32%. Which we think is adequate, and part of I think what went on during the course of 2009 was a little bit of catch-up with regard to some of the slower paying accounts and us approaching it more conservatively in that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, I think the second part of your question was what percent of the junkets have switched over to revenue share versus the volume base. We had 19 contracts that were up for renewal at the end of the year, and of those 19, 15, 16 of those actually chose the volume base. I'll tell you at that time end of our next quarter, what the actual share will be, because we've got, as you expect, month-to-month changes between the revenue base and the volume base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Okay. I was sitting, but now I'm standing. So what I was wondering is, at Macau part of the differential I think what was a for a lot of investors for debt expense, but it also fell short of expectations. I was wondering, other than holds is there anything that is not there that would be impacting margins?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There's a couple of things that are going on. One, we talked about the reserve that we took for a long time outstanding receivable. That was about $12 million. The second has to do with the incentive comp, which we booked fourth quarter, which is our bonus. Typically that is accrued quarter-to-quarter. As we came into the tail end of our fourth quarter we went ahead and we reserved all of our bonus for the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then just &#x2013; are you guys seeing at the Venetian Macao, City of Dreams has now started a new marketing program. Are you guys seeing any kind of impact from that at all, anything promotional coming from them?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We certainly see their volume picking up, which is very positive for Cotai Strip. That's their get lucky campaign -- you can't miss it, everywhere you go even on the do not disturb sign it has the get lucky which is quite clever and creative.

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Felicia, I'd just like to clarify what Steve said before about that write-off. That was not really a long-term write-off. The debt started about a year ago, and then long term write-off, in our terms, I mean write-off of a long-term debt would be somewhat in excess of a year.</p>
          <p>Payments are being made on this. Not as much as we would like. The man was a major, he wasn't a player. He was also a player, but he was also a junket rep. And the amount of money that was built up was not on the basis of him playing but was as a junket rep.</p>
          <p>So we cut our junket rep relationship with him. He does have other assets. He's been a customer of our company and certain executives in the company for over 20 years, and has always paid his debts.</p>
          <p>And we feel confident. Frankly, I had a sort of a warm discussion with our CFO about the necessity to take that. It was really heated, I was going to take my cane and beat him over the head. I was dissuaded from hitting him, only because he's about a foot taller than me.</p>
          <p>And so I objected to that write-off, but he claims that PW required us to write it off, PWC. In any event that was an extraordinary write-off. That's not a usual kind of write-off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Understood. Thank you. Rob, in Las Vegas, are you seeing any promotional activity in gaming and play at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the gaming side? There's increased pressure I think on the high end on some discounting and airfare but I don't think it's exceptional. The problem in Las Vegas remains room rates. I don't think the gaming issue is really a, for us it's not really an issue. It's more room rate, remains in all segments to add pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on that subject, obviously a competitor is trying to build market share in the convention business. I was wondering what you guys are doing to try to maintain your market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've actually &#x2013; I know that one of our competitors has been boasting about taking business from us. The bottom line is that we've done a calculation, and we've taken more business from them than they have from us. And we allowed them to take some business from us because in one case, there was a group of thousands of room nights that they gave an $80 less rate on the rooms than what we quoted and what we were willing to give. We gave up that group. Let it go to the Aria, or wherever they went for one year. The group has come back and signed us at the more realistic rates for the following three years. They talk about &#x2013; MGM talks about stealing business from us. We take more business from them than they do from us.</p>
          <p>And the fact of the matter is that they just don't have the experience from having been on the other side of the desk in dealing with conventions and they don't understand the service and the issues that have to be addressed. So we don't want to buy that business. We were complimented by a competitor with whom one of our colleagues had dinner last week, and that colleague, that competitor said that the industry recognized that we were the only one that was holding our rates up there, and everybody wishes they, too, could hold their rates up. But maybe we'll set a leadership role and perhaps they'll keep their rates up.</p>

          <p>Good Sheldon, just put a couple things in --</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I just got shot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things in the context, with regards to Macau, this isn't our numbers, these are Macau numbers. If you look at January '09 versus '08, up significantly. If you look at a press clipping that came out yesterday or the day before, for the expectation for Chinese New Year, exceptionally strong. We dominate the mass market. We always have. Nothing has changed. So as Sheldon said, we're quite pleased with where we sit today, vis-&#xE0;-vis our expectation for Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thanks. And some have been talking about a commission war erupting with SJM. Are you seeing any evidence of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>None to date, but I wouldn't necessarily carve out SJM. With the new restrictions on the junket commission caps, you have seen, over the last really five to six months, a fair amount of jockeying from all of the different concessionaires. The simple truth in Macau is you can buy business through commission, and you can move share a point, two points, three points through changing those commission rates. But it's not sustainable. You can't build a business on gimmicks or on incentives. It's got to be built on the fundamentals. So notwithstanding the fact that from time to time some of our competitors raised their commission rates, at the end of the day, it comes back to haunt them, and everything settles back down to a sustainable level.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Well, all of the forecasts for Bethlehem at the table games, which have been published by many of the analyst community, is just about where we're projecting the situation. We think that 80 tables appropriately run and trained can generate the numbers that have been published.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as -- that's good. As far as the VIP commission rate and in Singapore what are you guys seeing? I know Genting has talked about high numbers. What are you guys expecting the commission rate to be, in your opinion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's commission rate, and there's commission rate, Larry, as you probably recall, from your equity days. The commission rate for a junket rep in the field which I call a field sales person is capped at a few thousand dollars, but it's not the Macau style commission. So the second commission rate is the Macau style commission rate which -- for which the junket reps performed three functions.</p>
          <p>One, they find the customer two, they provide the credit. And three, they get the money into our venue, from where they come. Obviously, we can't have anything to do directly with that, and we're not going to, and to the best of our knowledge, they say -- Genting says that they intend to pay 1.5, but the Singapore government continues to maintain unequivocally, and when the Singapore government maintains something unequivocally, you can go to sleep on it. You can bank on it. They say there will be no junket reps of the Macau style. They don't want people to come in and earn 40, to 50% or more of the gross income and they to the best of our knowledge, they have received very, very few applications, probably only applications from somebody in the former category of junket reps, not the ones who provide the credit. So it's still a moving target.</p>
          <p>My personal take on this is that if there are junket reps they will be of the former type, and not because the government won't necessarily approve them, but because they're not going to apply. Everybody, every one of our companies' directors that has applied, including myself, say it's the most comprehensive, the most detailed application they've ever had to fill out in their lifetime. So I don't think, while I'm positive that the junket reps in Macau are not going to provide the information that Singapore Gaming Control authorities want.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So you still to have give the gamblers their kind of discount. So what do you guys think, like you're probably giving 0.7, to 0.9 to the gamblers or a combination thereof, versus the 1.25 you're giving in Singapore is that reasonable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I suspect, and all my estimates have been figured on about 0.7 to 0.75 or 0.8, direct to the players that want to get compensated and even out the, to neutralize the house advantage a little bit. We would rather &#x2013; we're going to give them the option of the Las Vegas way or the rolling chip way. So if somebody says, well I'm not &#x2013; I don't want to do it rolling chip, so I just want to know that if I lose, I want a discount of X%. And we'd much rather have it that way because on the roll, we to have pay win or lose. On the losses, we pay on that, and we're much better off that way, in my opinion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So this could actually mean maybe an extra, what, 15, 20 basis points of margin compared to Macau?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if we don't get I feel that we should be getting 30 to 40 percentage, 30 or 40 basis points, not basis points. 30 to 40% more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the taxes alone we'll pick up at least 24% and in our integrated resort model, if we make 28 or 30% and we add another 24%, never mind the savings on the junket reps we're at 54% of gross and if we pick up. Depends upon the ratio of high end versus mass but let's take a round number of 50/50 it's 44% we'd save at 1.25 and let's say we get half of that, so we would say save 0.22 on the total, and if we give half of that to the player, we would save about 11%, which could bring us to an extraordinary EBITDAR margin. I mean, it's so large, I don't even want to -- it sounds like blue sky, but I don't see any reason why it can't occur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, keep in mind that the rolling direct to the customer, also the big variable there is credit, right? It's not just about since there's no junket reps. It's a question of not what we pay or Genting pays, it's question of who wants to issue and collect the credit that will determine in part what the rolling number is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Larry, everybody listen I want to say that we experienced between a one to 2% default rate here in Las Vegas. I think my personal opinion is that if we're judicious in our granting of credit, which we're certainly known to make an effort to be, we will experience a very low single-digit credit default rate because the Asian people are far more pay sensitive if somebody tries to collect money particularly if you collect money from gambling, because of the stigma that it, that is present in their social circles and the last thing they want to do is let their government find out they're doing this. So I think that we'll have a much higher collection success rate than otherwise thought.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Not me. I don't know where that's coming from. Thank you. My question is about the rates at the Venetian and the Palazzo. We know that last year the Venetian was doing 163. The Palazzo was doing 179. And as Rob was talking about the rate pressure, I'm wondering what you'd expect for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any segment in particular Janet or just in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, across the board. I know you have your groups booked in largely for the year, or at least at the same level of last year. I'd be curious to know how those rates are trending, and then what the overall impact is on your RevPAR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're trending down, relative to 2009 rates, we're 211 for actual group segment for the year. We're down in the 180 range for 2010, high 170's, low 180's. And again the competitive pressure is pretty relentless. To be honest with you, it's not slowing down. In everyone's numbers in town you have to factor in the segment has grown tremendously and that is the, everybody in town is has not -- they're comping rooms off to slot and table players at a higher rate than ever. So when you factor that in, it's going to be a big driver of your ADR. Our ADR, you know, obviously there's rate pressure across the board in every segment; no one's immune to it.</p>
          <p>I'm hoping we can keep, maintain a better cash ADR than we'd hoped to in the past, but, look, the rate pressure will determine that and then market will determine that. Every day, you look at the emails, you look at the offers out there. There's pressure, whether it be the casino segment, the FIT, the wholesale, and you got to factor in these days the non-cash RevPAR segment which is driven by the growing use of comped rooms in every hotel in this town.</p>
          <p>So I'm not trying to elude you -- it changes every day. And we're trying to maintain rate, I think Sheldon and Mike both referenced. Our intention is to stay above the market somewhat but group rates are certainly down and that's a function of the marketplace and I don't see how that changes when the market starts trending upward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It varies. I want to address that. Excuse me, Rob. It varies from show to show and event to event. We have the largest convention facility in the world. We have 330 meeting rooms, including ballrooms, and we can hold somewhere in the 50,000 person category, simultaneously.</p>
          <p>Now, there's no need for 50,000 people to sit simultaneously, but we can have overlap of smaller groups. And so if we have a group that needs the facilities that only we could provide, and nobody else can provide, we maintain the leverage on the room rates.</p>
          <p>So far the room rates on the groups have been -- what we've had have been in the two's for the most part, and Rob is shaking his head. He's saying I'm right about that. They were trending up now.</p>
          <p>Rob said that they were trending down because of the competition but there's two packages of competition. The people that are small, and they don't need a lot of the breakout rooms, they can go somewhere else. And the larger groups that need our breakout rooms that nobody else can provide.</p>
          <p>So we maintain some leverage, and besides, there are, it's just they're coming out, it's like a Tsunami of groups that are signing up. I don't want to wish us anything, but we do have a government group coming in that &#x2013; we can't say the name of that, that's paying a pretty good rate. And listen, we've got to face it, Las Vegas is the best convention, the most cost effective, most efficient convention city in the world and we're the leader in the conventions in this market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The group segment obviously continues as the most desirable segment in the city in terms of both ADR and when they attend midweek. And I think we'll survive and prosper in that segment but it has been challenging. The more challenging segments, everybody, the FIT wholesale, and those segments, you can see those everyday on the internet and see who's done what, and it's challenging, by anyone's &#x2013; when you look at those things it's a very difficult FIT wholesale market.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>If you factor in all those segments, is it fair to assume that your RevPAR will be down in 2010 versus 2009?</p>

          <p>Janet it's Mike. I think it will be slightly down because there was a hangover in 2009 in the first four or five months of group business and other business that was booked in 2008. But I think the RevPAR &#x2013; I think there's been a lot of commentary by others about their RevPARs improving and going up, and I'm sure you've seen some of that. I think, honestly, we don't know what the summer is going to look like at this point, which is going to determine where that number really is going to end up where we don't have groups, don't have a lot of groups. Where we have groups, I think our RevPAR will hold, and where we don't have groups it may be very difficult in the summer to hold it.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're sort of in the early going, as we've said, in the early going, we seem to be holding up here. But I think that &#x2013; candidly I think if you're looking purely at RevPAR, which I personally think is a misleading number due to all the casino comps that go around the city, because people can use casino comps to buck -- to build up their RevPAR by putting a special rate on it. We don't do that, but others do.</p>
          <p>I think we'll probably be closer to losing a little RevPAR this year than last year. But I don't think it's going to affect our EBITDA in any way, actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it all depends on what happens for the last half of the year. If the &#x2013; if we continue to pick up good bookings between now and the end of the year, I think the ADR will increase if we maintain that level of bookings. So I'm on the optimistic side of comparison for last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. If could I ask one more question on the group side, but this time in Macau, now that you have extra hotel rooms on Cotai Strip with the Hyatt rooms from City of Dreams, and you've got 5 and 6 in the works, where's the tipping point where you become &#x2013; where Macau and the Cotai Strip becomes an important convention destination and you have a high utilization of your space there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When the Chinese and the Asian population shrink to a fraction of what they are today. I mean, its 1.3 billion people. There's 120 million in Japan. There's 44 million in Korea. There's 24 million in Taiwan. I don't understand how anybody could say, one of the analysts, I read the report last night said that it's very clear that the opening of Genting in Singapore made it abundantly clear that this truly is an industry that demand &#x2013; that supply creates the demand.</p>
          <p>Everybody who says, where's the tipping point, I can guarantee you this, there'll be no tipping point in my lifetime, and Janet, there'll be no tipping point in your lifetime, and I know you're a lot younger than I am. At least you look so. I'm sure you are.</p>
          <p>So there is no tipping point. How can you say there's a tipping point? We haven't had enough critical mass of hotel rooms to be able to bring on other conventions, and now we're starting to book more and more conventions in Macau. I met yesterday with a show producer here in the United States that has 45 shows, big ones that they want to start duplicating them over in Asia, and they're going to go and take a look at both Macau and Singapore, and I don't understand, you've got 1.3 billion people, and these populations are not shrinking, they're growing. So there is no such thing. It's supply creates demand. It's not demand creates supply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think just to add to that point, the point of inflexion, where we'll start hosting more meaningful and more frequent events, is actually when we get 5 and 6 open. The 1,400 rooms across the street at City of Dreams did not give us sufficient girth to be able to host the additional shows. But the opening of 5 and 6 with 6,000 rooms, personal opinion, then you're starting to talk about a meaningful capacity to book very large groups and take advantage of the infrastructure that's in there. That's why we call it the game changer. It's the game changer.</p>
          <p>So I think we are well within 16, 18 months to see a very profound change and interestingly you are starting to see it now. I don't know if you follow the local Hong Kong and Macau papers, but about three, four weeks ago on the inside front page of the Hong Kong paper, you saw that the Hong Kong air show now is going to alternate every other year between Hong Kong and Macau, and that's a very calculated event, which in connection with the airport authorities and the Macau government, we sat down last year and we said in keeping with the mandates to diversify the economy let's start attacking and identifying some of these larger trade shows that we can start to migrate into Macau that will have a profound impact so that when the extra rooms from Galaxy, City of Dreams and 5 and 6 come on board, we can actually start to use the infrastructure we've built to its best and highest use.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we need the critical mass of 5 and 6. It's not &#x2013; it's not a tipping point. The tipping point is that it allows us to reach the threshold of critical mass a lot faster. It will give us 10,000 rooms. The problem with City of Dreams is they're putting up four separate buildings, and they only hold 350 to 400 rooms each, and that's not sufficient capacity for each one of those brands to make an effort to send in a lot of business, because the properties are too small.</p>

          <p>The Hyatt, or what's this? Crown. We have 4,000 Sheraton rooms, 4000 plus another four or 500 St. Regis to be built in the third phase or maybe along with this phase. The issue is that with 4,000 rooms, Sheraton has to put a major full court press on filling up those rooms and we are going to be, along with Shangri-La and Traders. There's dozens of Shangri-La with a very good reputation. I've stayed at several of them myself. I think they are very good. And you can't, with 300 rooms at a Hard Rock Hotel, offer yourself as a convention property. You can't with one Hyatt at 350, the other Hyatt at 300, you can't do that. And I think that even though they resemble an integrated resort, they are not truly an integrated resort that can focus or that can specialize in a convention and trade show market</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. First I was hoping to clarify something that was said earlier. The whole benefit in Macau, was that a $50 million benefit to net revenue or EBITDAR? Haven't done the math yet, but it was mentioned earlier.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess the first question, I had a question on policy shifts with regard to the tightening of credit in China and its impact to your business in Macau. I didn't really hear the answer if there was one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that we gave one. I think it was one of the questions that were wrapped in with Joe's, so I apologize for that. Clearly, there is a lot of press, and a lot of discussion going on right now in terms of the liquidity and the excess thereof in the China marketplace and the impact of Macau when and if they start to really restrict the additional credit.</p>
          <p>That will have a far more pronounced impact on the VIP business, and I think on the junket business, than it will for ours, primarily because majority of our business is mass oriented. The other thing that I would throw out there for consideration is everyone assumes that there's a one to one relationship between the credit market and liquidity and the role of Macau. It would have to be profoundly different, in my opinion, for it to have a material near term impact, because the people that come, particularly on a frequent basis, aren't coming on credit. They're fairly liquid individuals themselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I mean, as that does sort of bleed in there over time, if it does, can you, just given your liquidity situation yourselves be a little bit flexible with your balance sheet and loan additionally to junkets with a track record to extend to their players?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If anything, we've gotten a bit more stringent over the last couple of quarters. We've put in some standards, and we don't tend to deviate from those standards. It works well for us and it works well for the junkets. I think we are on par with our competitors in terms of premium direct. So long answer to a short question, no we don't see us using our balance sheet to offset any liquidity issues from the mainland.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I know. I wanted to ask, I've been so busy putting the numbers in that I may have missed this comment on the call. Have you taken out a minority interest for SCL in the quarter, is there someplace where that is reflected in the income statement?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you look on the income statement, it's the line just below net loss, and it shows a net loss attributable to non-controlling interest of...</p>

          <p>Okay. Was there something in the third quarter also for that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not for SCL. That would have only been in the fourth quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What was it then in the third quarter, Ken?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it would have been mostly for Pennsylvania and then some other kind of joint venture arrangements we have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But the lion's share of that 6.6 was SCL related now?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, only the one month. And then when will SCL have to release their detailed results? Not that it can be any more detailed than you've already done, but I'm just wondering on the Hong Kong exchange what their requirements are for disclosure?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yeah most of my questions have been answered. Just wanted &#x2013; I wanted to clarify, you gave a dollar amount of receivables for the whole company and then you talked about reserve percentages by region. But I don't know if you specified, what is the dollar amount of receivables, just in Vegas versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The total amount of receivables in Vegas, including casino and hotel and other, or just the casino number?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just casino, I guess, versus the prior year in Vegas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't have the prior year on me, but the gross receivable casinos for Vegas was about -- a little bit short of 160 million.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. I was hoping maybe we could get a little color on your thoughts on potential development in south Florida, maybe some higher level things, what needs to happen before you move forward and just general thoughts on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's see an exclusivity for the entire United States, a nice condo sitting out in Bell Harbor. Besides that, and we don't have to wait in line at Rascal House, it's a deli. Seriously, I think that tax rate is priority one. If they maintain a very high tax rate, we won't be in. If they -- particularly on table games. If they allow too many para-mutual racinos and it would interrupt the way we think we'd like to go then that might be a deal breaker for us.</p>
          <p>I have expressed -- I've been to Florida personally several times. As you can see, I like it. And I think -- there are just too many places. We learned from the Sands, and we learned from what's they're talking about in Massachusetts and then other states like Ohio, like Kentucky, and Texas. They're talking about 12 tracks and 12 racinos in Texas. And they're talking about another 12 casinos. Point is that if we can't do our song and dance of an integrated resort, it becomes less and less attractive.</p>
          <p>We think that south Florida could, it attracts enormous number of people from Latin and South America, a number of high rollers, so if we can do an IR there, in spite of the fact that there are a lot of local casinos in the racino category, we might still be able to do it, but that then depends upon the tax rate.</p>
          <p>So that's where we are on south Florida, and the same in any other U.S. state. They're becoming more plentiful now, and so we'll have to decide whether or not we want to be in a $50 million a year casino business or we want to be in the 0.5 billion or $1 billion integrated resort business.</p>

          <p>I would like to ask everybody, anybody have a question or comment about Singapore? I guess not. Okay. Well, if that's it, do we have any other comment to make? Mike? Ken? Steve, Tom, nobody?</p>
          <p>All right. Thank you, everybody, for joining our call and having an interest in our company, and for those investors that are on the line, we want to thank you for your confidence in our company.
