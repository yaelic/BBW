        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Susanne. So starting on the agenda, given that we closed the Alcon transaction on April 8, we're going to spend some time talking about the integration and the financial implications. But before we do that, I want to comment on our performance in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So on slide four, we had a very strong start to the year with our sales up 14%. And this is despite the fact that we had over $1 billion of H1N1 in the year ago base. So we were able to increase our core operating income of our underlying business. And because there's a lot going on to strip out Alcon and H1N1, our core operating income grew 13% versus a year ago. We also made very significant progress on the pipeline this quarter, which we will talk about a little bit later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>So on slide five, you can see the summary of the financials. Jon is going to go through them in a little bit more detail. But slide six shows that all divisions grew nicely in the first quarter. Sandoz had really a great quarter with sales up 15%, but all of the divisions grew above market rates. And we &#x2013; we're continuing to focus on our three priorities of extending our lead in innovation, accelerating growth and driving productivity. And I want to just highlight some of these areas.</p>
          <p>Starting with innovation on slide number eight, we did have great progress. Gilenya was approved, as you know, in Europe and our launches are underway. David is going to talk a little bit about how the launch is going in the U.S. and also in Europe. But I think one our more overlooked pieces of news in the first quarter was the second positive Phase III for our JAK inhibitor, INC424. The data from both of these positive Phase III studies in myelofibrosis is going to enable us to file worldwide this year.</p>
          <p>Recently launched products, on slide number nine, accounted for now over a quarter of our total group sales, so $3.1 billion out of our $14 billion. And that was up about 45% versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, we saw a nice uptick on our emerging markets growth, particularly in the BRIC countries. So, Russia up 20%, India up 19%, China mid-teen growth. I think we're &#x2013; you're going to see this nicely throughout 2011.</p>
          <p>Sandoz saw an impressive growth in the first quarter despite a pretty significant decline in Germany. And this was driven by enoxaparin, which generated almost $250 million in sales. Also biosimilars were up nicely and emerging markets saw us &#x2013; double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Our Consumer Health business saw double-digit increases in growth, on slide number 12, with all three &#x2013; sorry, high single digit growth. Each of the three businesses contributed to that growth. OTC had a particularly good quarter. If you look at brands like Excedrin, up 19%, and Theraflu, which was driven by a strong cough and cold season in the U.S., up 50% versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, Vaccines, we closed the Tianyuan acquisition to form the joint venture with this vaccines manufacturer in China. This is going to provide a great platform for us to grow our vaccines business in China with really a two tiered pricing structure, one for innovative Novartis vaccines, and another for lower priced but very high quality local vaccines from Tianyuan. We also submitted, on April 13, the Menveo filing for U.S., for children between 2 and 24 months of age, and we're now waiting for FDA feedback.</p>
          <p>From a productivity standpoint, on slide 14, back in November, we announced our cross-divisional program that would optimize our manufacturing footprint. And since November, we've had a lot of activity. We sold two plants to third parties. That's in Morocco and one in France. We announced the exits or partial exits in four additional sites, Liverpool and Marburg, Germany, where we consolidated flu vaccine platforms, and Horsham, UK where we are exiting manufacturing completely, and in Mexico, also. So, the completion of these exits will occur over the next 24 months for the sites that I've talked about. And we'll give you updates every quarter as to further progress that we're making on the manufacturing footprint.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes talking about the progress that we've made on the Alcon integration planning and the financial implications. So, on slide 16, this eye care sector, I believe, is poised for continued growth over the next 10 years. Just look at the basic demographic trends with the aging population. This is going to be a growth engine for Novartis well into the future. We've already started the integration planning right after the Novartis and the Alcon Board signed the merger agreement.</p>
          <p>So, on slide 17 you can see the moving pieces where we integrate CIBA Vision and Pharma Ophtha, ex-Lucentis, into Alcon. And then we'll also move Alcon's generic business into Sandoz, given Sandoz' relationships with top generic customers around the world. So, Alcon in Novartis will create a $9 billion business, totally focused on eye care.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 shows that it will be the second biggest business in Novartis, after pharmaceuticals, at 16% and further improving the growth profile of the business. There's going to be three businesses in Alcon: Surgical, which is ophthalmic surgical products for cataract and refractive surgeries, Pharmaceuticals, focused solely on the eye, and then Vision Care, which includes contact lenses and lens care.</p>
          <p>Now, we see tremendous growth synergies here and have always said that this acquisition is more about growth than about cost. If you think about Novartis's research capability bolted onto Alcon, should result in an increase in breakthrough innovation in Pharmaceuticals for the eye. Also the Novartis market access capability, particularly outside the U.S., will bring new market access for Alcon's premium intraocular lenses. And the synergies also will go this way because Alcon's expertise in formulation is also something that we can leverage on the Novartis side. Our bottom-up cost synergy estimate now looks like it's more than we had previously talked about and should be nicely over $300 million. So we've organized clear accountability and tracking for the synergies in the new organization.</p>
          <p>Slide 21 shows the timetable. So the planning is nearly completed and now we will be moving into the execution phase. And we are targeting getting most of the integration activity completed within the next six months.</p>
          <p>So, now Kevin is going to give you an update on the performance of Alcon, and also where he sees the value creation opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Joe. Starting with slide 23, I'm pleased to say that in Q1 2011, we had a strong quarter with net sales rising 12% to U.S. $1.9 billion. This represents 10% constant currency growth. Alcon's double-digit sales growth was broad based with balanced contributions across all geographies and strong performance in our Pharmaceutical and Surgical franchises.</p>
          <p>Reported operating income rose 25% to U.S. $207 million. However, for a better picture of Alcon's performance, we've adjusted both Q1 2011 and 2010 for certain exceptional and other items to arrive at a pro forma core operating income for each period. The adjustments include U.S. $501 million of amortization of intangible assets related to the purchase price allocation as a consequence of Novartis obtaining majority ownership, and other items totaling U.S. $14 million. On this basis, core operating income increased by 11% to U.S. $722 million, or 37.4% of sales.</p>
          <p>Drilling deeper into the core operating income performance, the 11% growth reflects the achievement of operating leverage even while increasing our rate of spending in research and development and other growth activities. This performance is the result of the success of Alcon's business model to focus on the eye with a diversified portfolio of high margin products across the major eye care categories.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, free cash flow improved to U.S. $523 million in Q1 2011 versus U.S. $267 million in Q1 2010. Free cash flow increased in large part from the Q1, 2010 rights for DUREZOL, a higher level of accrued rebates and royalties, and reduced capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 24, the global sales of Pharmaceutical products increased 18%, or 16% on a constant currency basis, to U.S. $863 million. Sales of allergy products rose 31%, fueled by increased demand for Patanol and Pataday due to the early onset of the spring allergy season. Glaucoma product sales increased 15% on strong sales performance for glaucoma combinations, which actually increased 48%, and continued solid performance of TRAVATAN and TRAVATAN Z ophthalmic solutions.</p>
          <p>Global surgical sales were U.S. $845 million, which was an increase of 9%, or 7% on a constant currency basis. Fast growing emerging markets led to faster sales outside the U.S., while U.S. growth was negatively affected by Q1, by inclement weather across much of the country and the expiration of the new technology IOL reimbursement program. Advanced technology IOLs, including both ReSTOR and the Toric IOL brands, grew 15%. And sales of vitreoretinal products rose 23% to contribute to the surgical performance.</p>
          <p>Global sales of consumer eye care products rose 2%, or flat on a constant currency basis, to U.S. $223 million. Strong sales of the Systane family of artificial tears, which increased 27%, offset declines in contact lens care and other consumer products. The sales decline in contact lens disinfectants was the result of a continuing trend towards the use of hydrogen peroxide solutions and increased competitive activity in the multipurpose market.</p>
          <p>As slide 25 shows, our sales results were balanced across each of the geographic regions. In Q1, 41% of Alcon's sales were in the U.S., which showed sales growth of 8% over prior year. Outside of the U.S., 39% of our total sales are in mature, developed countries with demographic and healthcare delivery trends similar to the U.S. And these developed international markets showed 13% reported growth, or 9% in constant currency growth.</p>
          <p>Sales in emerging markets accounted for the remaining 20% of our total sales. We have been achieving especially fast growth in these markets as we penetrate the unmet clinical needs of these countries. Our Q1 sales in emerging markets rose 21%, or 19% on a constant currency basis. We are continuing to invest in market expansion activities in these markets, which represent a significant opportunity for eye care and our most attractive long-term geographic opportunity.</p>
          <p>Consistent with past practices, we will not be providing quarterly guidance, but for those of you who are not familiar with the Alcon business, there are a couple of comments I want to make about how our revenue expectation will unfold over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>In 2011, Alcon's annual revenue expectation is high single digit growth, based on the growth dynamics in the key ophthalmic categories, share expansion, planned product introductions and growth in emerging markets. It should be noted that the quarterly growth is not consistently applied to each quarter, especially in Q2, which is directly impacted by a number of factors. For example, Q2 2010 was a relatively strong quarter in the Pharmaceutical segment, related to the severe allergy season, and we will need more time to evaluate the severity of the season in 2011.</p>
          <p>It is reasonable to assume lower growth in the U.S. in Q2, considering the relative uncertainty around both the Xalatan patent expiration and the expiration of the new technology IOL reimbursement program. This reimbursement program is not applicable to sales outside of the U.S., and the growth rate in the second half of 2011 should compensate for this Q2 impact.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at slide 26 and turning to the integration with Novartis, we are building the Vision Care commercial capability with the strong CIBA Vision contact lens brands, as well as CIBA Vision's hydrogen peroxide solutions plus the leading Opti-Free product line. The new Alcon Eye Care division adds selected Novartis ophthalmic medications to the broad Alcon portfolio of eye care drugs. Along with the Surgical franchise, the new Alcon division has three solid product line growth engines.</p>
          <p>As we carry out the integration, we will capitalize on the best attributes of each company to make a business that is simply stronger, together. We will also move aggressively to optimize our commercial platforms across the three eye care categories. By doing this, we will deliver incremental and sustainable growth from the new Alcon while capturing operational efficiencies between Alcon and CIBA Vision. We will also be able to capture savings from the integration of certain functions into the Novartis management structure.</p>
          <p>As slide 27 shows, the division will operate with three dimensions: geography, franchise and function. By and large, global strategy for each product area will be developed and managed by the three franchises: Surgical, Pharmaceutical and Vision Care. Practical execution and customer support will be delivered through the regional structure, just as it is today in Alcon, though the regions will be defined slightly differently. Finally, we will have functional areas that support the franchises and the regions in manufacturing, research and development, quality assurance and finance.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 28, the new Alcon has many of the world's leading brands in eye care, holding the number one or two positions in most of the largest product categories. The Surgical division contains leading positions in intraocular lenses with the AcrySof platform, cataract equipment with the Infiniti Phaco Emulsification System and vitreoretinal equipment with the Constellation System.</p>
          <p>The Pharmaceutical division is rapidly growing and is number one in allergy with the Patanol family, number one in anti-infectives, led by Vigamox, and number two in glaucoma with the TRAVATAN, Azopt and combinations portfolio. Vision Care has strong positions in weekly, monthly and disposable contact lenses, including AirOptix and Dailies and is number one in multipurpose, as well as peroxide solutions with Opti-Free RepleniSH and Clear Care, respectively.</p>
          <p>Slide 29, shows our global share of voice is unrivaled in eye care. Our sales teams will bring the Alcon portfolio to our global audience of eye care practitioners across categories and customer channels. This enhances our ability to execute a comprehensive commercial strategy across all three areas of eye care to capitalize on all growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>The Surgical team of over 1,500 sales people work closely with the ophthalmic surgeons around the world to communicate the benefits of our total portfolio of cataract, vitreoretinal and refractive products. Over 2,000 pharmaceutical sales people are driving growth for Alcon's glaucoma, allergy, anti-infective and dry eye offerings to eye care professionals and other specialists that treat ocular conditions. Most of these sales people are directed to ophthalmologists, but in some countries such as the U.S., we also promote eye care drugs to optometrists for allergies, glaucoma, dry eye, and eye infections. Our Vision Care sales force of over 1,400 promotes our contact lens and lens care products to those eye care professionals who fit contact lenses and recommend solutions.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 30, we have already made a lot of progress since the announcement of the merger agreement. In the last 90 days, we have already established a new operating model for the Alcon division, announced the global leadership team and selected country management. We have also made significant headway on our functional integration and we have launched our value creation plan, which I will focus on in the next few slides. It is expected that the integration implementation phase will continue in 2011 and commercial execution to the customer channels will start in Q3.</p>
          <p>Slide 31 highlights that to maximize the value creation opportunity with this merger, we are focusing on three main areas. Number one, enhanced innovation to drive more growth from new products. Number two, synergistic cooperation to capitalize on incremental revenue growth from our existing products. And number three, increased productivity from our combined global infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll spend a few minutes in each of these areas of focus. On the next slide it notes, Alcon will leverage our expertise in ophthalmic research and development to expand potential targets from the libraries of compounds at Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research and we will work together for solutions to many areas of unmet need in eye care.</p>
          <p>Novartis's size and expertise in clinical development will provide multiple opportunities to leverage the synergies in the ophthalmic development activities. We have already identified opportunities for the integrated development of technology in the contact lens and solution arena, and we're exploring the collaboration of our intraocular lenses and contact lens research teams in order to share technologies.</p>
          <p>On the next slide and with our expanded portfolio, we will simply have more to offer the eye care professional and expect to have increased share of voice in the eye care market against these products. The Vision Care franchise can now bring two industry leading offerings, in the AirOptix contact lens and Opti-Free Multi-Purpose Solution, directly to the contact lens fitters globally in order to be a more complete partner.</p>
          <p>We will also be able to clearly position Clear Care and Opti-Free appropriately with each of the eye care professionals. Expanded market access will increase reimbursement for value-added products outside of the U.S. and accelerate penetration in emerging markets. As a practical example, Novartis's expertise in European market access may help us to obtain a similar reimbursement approach to advance technology IOLs to that we have received in the U.S. The Alcon generics business, named Falcon, can also greatly benefit from the size, product breadth and global reach that Sandoz offers.</p>
          <p>Now from a productivity perspective, on slide 34, Novartis has several areas for value creation with the integration of Alcon, such as in the areas of procurement and manufacturing functions. Procurement savings will affect areas ranging from IT to research lab supplies and help the new organization's profitability. We will gain efficiencies in lens care manufacturing and be in a position to optimize the manufacturing footprint.</p>
          <p>We are planning to capture significant cost savings for the new organization as we realize these efficiencies and opportunities, allowing us to reinvest in research and other growth initiatives while still providing sustainable P&amp;L performance. In summary, I am very excited about the growth and investor value that the new Alcon can bring to Novartis. I'll now turn the call over to Jon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kevin. I'll now look at the financial consequences of the financial &#x2013; of the Alcon merger before moving to the first quarter results. As you can see on slide 36, there are four components to the Alcon merger from a financial perspective. I won't repeat what Kevin has said about the growth opportunities, even though improving the top line growth is the single most important value driver to the whole deal.</p>
          <p>So taking cost synergies first, slide 37 gives you a summary of where we expect the synergies to come from, delivering the base line $300 million, which we hope to build on and exceed over time. There is a lot of granularity behind these numbers now. We've built a very detailed model that integrates costs line by line for all of the components of the new Alcon division, together with the related head count. Synergy targets have been allocated down to the country level, and as we appoint the new country teams, general managers have already been appointed and their management teams are in the process of being put together. This will give us the ability to develop full bottom-up synergy targets that have clear accountability and can be tracked on a monthly basis.</p>
          <p>This process has been only possible since December. And while it's now a very robust profile, as Kevin has already mentioned, there are opportunities that we can further assess in the supply chain and the commercial area. In many meetings over the last 18 months, we've been asked why the announced synergies on the Alcon acquisitions appear to be so low. The simple answer is that synergies come from the removal of overlaps, duplications and inefficiencies. The most attractive part of this whole transaction has been that these are relatively low. There are no surgical overlaps in CIBA Vision and there are no contact lens overlaps in Alcon. This is also why we have to focus on growth to drive longer-term improvements. This slide tries to put the cost base into perspective to make the point, and it's perhaps easiest to read it from the right.</p>
          <p>In aggregate, the announced synergies represent 5% of the total cost base. At the low end of what would normally be expected for the reasons I've just outlined, is a combination of the combined G&amp;A cost base, synergies amount to 25%. And of the combined cost base in the areas where we have most overlap, the reductions represents around 40% of combined costs. So, I think you can be satisfied that where we can, we're applying the necessary rigor while making sure that the business as a whole are giving the necessary priority to growth.</p>
          <p>Slide 39 shows the phasing of the cost savings. We expect around one third of the synergies to be achieved in the first 12 months. That's by the second quarter of 2012. Slide 40 sets out the one-time costs for delivery of the synergies. For the activities that we're confident about, the cost is around $270 million. The areas we're still working on is the integration of Alcon into our ERP systems. But now we have a provisional cost estimate of $350 million, which we'll be updating as our plans evolve.</p>
          <p>Slide 41 summarizes what you've already seen in the information provided with the <mark type="ph" /> EGM, (29:12) which takes a mitigation of dilution through three stages. Firstly, our expectations on 15th of December 2010, when we expected to issue 215 million shares. Secondly, the position achieved on closing on 8th of April, when we actually issued 165 million shares following the purchase of $2.6 billion of Alcon shares. And finally, the position which would be achieved were the share buyback to be increased to $5 billion.</p>
          <p>Given that the mitigation of the dilutive effect of the Alcon share issue was our major objective in reinitiating the share repurchase, it should be clear from this that we have already significantly reduced the amount of dilution arising from the issue of shares. And with a further $1.8 billion of share buyback to an aggregate of $5 billion, it will be neutral to core earnings per share and accretive when synergies are fully factored in.</p>
          <p>It's clear from slide 42, that our ambition for Alcon is to progressively improve its CFROI and to demonstrate the enormous value contribution we expect to gain from Alcon. This slide sets out how the three components of returning &#x2013; improving returns fit together.</p>
          <p>Finally on Alcon, constructing the new division is not a simple task. And this slide shows you all the moving pieces. Only the Vaccines and Diagnostic division is unaffected, although the impacts on Pharma and Sandoz are relatively small. So I think you're well prepared for quarter two when we publish our results on the new basis. We will, in effect, republish the entire Q1 press release on this new basis, including a restatement of the quarterly results for 2010. As this is a significant exercise, we'll be holding a teleconference on the 18th of May with Kevin, his CFO, Robert Karsunky and myself to answer questions.</p>
          <p>So, let me now turn to the first quarter results, and I'll cover three areas: operating performance and margins, cash flow, and net debt and capital structure following the Alcon merger. You will have already recognized that while the underlying results for the first quarter are excellent, being able to reach this conclusion requires a little unpicking.</p>
          <p>On the left hand side of the page, you see the reported results in constant currency. This already removes one layer of complexity in currency, which I'll return to in a moment. Structurally, however, the results reflect two things: the acquisition of Alcon and the loss of H1N1 revenues. There's no surprise in either of these events, but it takes care to work through the effect. The right hand column, therefore, gives you a much better indication as to how we see the underlying business performing when both of these factors have been excluded. 8% growth in sales, 16% growth in core earnings, representing excellent operating leverage, and a 30% growth in operating income boosted by a disposal of gains and a legal settlement in CIBA Vision.</p>
          <p>Slide 46 shows in its fullest extent all the moving pieces in the top line. There are three points I want to make off of this page. At the far right, volume growth continues to be robust at 10%, a product of good growth in Pharma of 9%, 25% in Sandoz and 9% in Consumer Health.</p>
          <p>The performance in Pharma excludes the dampening effects of both generic competition and product and divestments. The generic impact will increase as we go through the year. We expect Femara to face generic competition in the U.S. in quarter two. And Diovan is already facing generic competition in Spain and other markets will follow in quarter four. The second point is that price erosion is more or less as we expected, and so far we're not seeing anything major in the pipeline that will change this view. Price erosion in Sandoz was higher than we'd experienced in the past at 10%, predominately a function of the German tenders from last year working through the system. Finally, I'll note for now that currency had a positive 2% effect on the top line.</p>
          <p>At the heart of our business lies our commitment to innovation and the rejuvenation of our portfolio. Recently launched products generated $3.1 billion of sales in the quarter, representing 26% of the total. And that's up from 19% in the first quarter of 2010 for a 45% increase in dollar terms.</p>
          <p>Slide 48 &#x2013; and on this slide you can see the reconciliation of core operating income and reported operating income. And there are two points to note. Firstly, the FX impact on profits was a negative 2%, and the adjustment between reported and core income comprised various exceptional gains and restructuring costs, which are fully described in the press release, together with the PPA adjustments relating to Alcon that Kevin has talked about. As with sales, slide 49 shows the moving parts to exclude Alcon and H1N1, demonstrating the strong underlying core income growth of 16%.</p>
          <p>Slide 50 gives you the delivery &#x2013; the divisional summary performance, the last time you will see it on this basis, as from quarter two we'll implement the new divisional boundaries. Generally, it was a good performance from each division. The numbers from Consumer Health speak for themselves, driven by an excellent OTC performance. And the Pharma performance was also very good with good cost management delivering operating leverage.</p>
          <p>Sandoz had an excellent quarter, in fact setting new performance benchmarks. The top line grew by 15%, having absorbed 10 percentage points of price erosion and a decline in the German business of 27%. Although Sandoz' good &#x2013; cost management was very good overall, the level of price erosion dented gross margin. Productivity should, over the remainder of the year, recover some of this, although the performance for the balance of the year does depend somewhat on the exclusivity of enoxaparin.</p>
          <p>The only other point to note on this page is the impact on currency or margin. At the bottom of the shaded column, you can see that margin improvement in constant currency was an excellent 2 percentage points, but only 70 basis points was visible in reported terms. On the line above, you can see that the group reported margins were squeezed by a currency effect of around 110 basis points. This was mostly attributable to the fact that the Swiss franc strengthened proportionately more than the euro against the dollar. Pharma, with a high proportion of R&amp;D in Switzerland, and Consumer Health with its Swiss based manufacturing, were harder hit than Sandoz for example, which has a very small Swiss franc denominated cost base. This is a good point to look at currency more generally.</p>
          <p>Slide 51, shows the currency trends over the last few quarters with currency on &#x2013; currency impact on sales and core operating income. You can see that, for sales, how a steady weakening of the dollar since the middle of 2010 <mark type="ph" /> hasn't (37:32) produced an improving trend, which yields a positive 2% impact on the top line. If rates stay where they were for quarter one, for the remainder of the year, we expect around a 3% positive outcome for the year.</p>
          <p>For profit, the impact has remained stubbornly negative since the third quarter of 2010. This is essentially because the natural hedge between euro denominated profits and Swiss franc costs has broken down, as the Swiss franc has taken on a safe haven attribute in addition to its natural role as a trading currency. For the full year, Q1 rates would produce a similar negative effect on profits as we saw for the first quarter, at around 2%.</p>
          <p>So turning to margins on slide 52, you see that the movement in core margins. At the top and bottom of the reconciliation, you see the impact of H1N1 Alcon on currency. In the middle, you see the outcome of good management of the cost base and which produces the underlying margin improvement of 2 percentage points. Our target for the year is to aim to increase constant currency core margin. And by this measure, we're off to a good start, as the impact from H1N1 will reduce significantly in subsequent quarters. Remember, however, what I said at the beginning of the year that in order to simply deliver the same margin as last year, we had to increase our core margin by 70 basis points. 70 basis points for a business of this size is already a big achievement.</p>
          <p>Slide 53 gives you the core EPS reconciliation between 2010 and 2011. There is really nothing new to say here as it's largely related to Alcon, higher financing costs, the loss of associated company income and minorities offset by an improved tax rate.</p>
          <p>Turning now to free cash flow on slide 54. After H1N1 and Alcon, cash flow is down on the equivalent quarter of last year. This year we've paid almost $600 million out to provisions in Pharma and we've seen a &#x2013; the normal increase in working capital from the end of the year. Year-end working capital was slightly below normal. And as the first quarter tends to be higher, taken together it looks a bit more dramatic than it really is. There is no shift in our focus on cash flow and it will recover in the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Finally, on slide 55, you see the movements in net debt, from $14.9 billion at the end of 2010 to $22.3 billion at the end of the quarter. The first quarter is generally the toughest for the year on cash flow, particularly with the payments of the dividend and with the negative working capital trends. But in this quarter, you also see the effects of the share repurchases to reduce the Alcon dilution, which I've already spoken about.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll hand you over to David for the Pharma highlights.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thanks, Jon. Want to share with everyone a very good start to the year. Sales grew 5% in constant currency despite negative pricing of about 2%, the divestment of Enablex in the U.S. and generic impact on Lotrel high dose in the U.S., as well as first generics on Diovan in countries such as Spain. Core operating income grew well ahead of sales. We saw a nice increase in core operating income margin despite the negative FX effects.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to do now is just give you an update on four of our key franchises, starting on page 58 with Lucentis. You see that Lucentis grew 22% quarter over &#x2013; I'm sorry, quarter one 2011 over quarter one 2010. We have just started to launch Diabetic Macular Edema in Europe with a particular focus on Germany. And we received a positive CHMP opinion for Retinal Vein Occlusion earlier than expected, with that launch expected to commence during the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>On the very next page, we tried to put into perspective the CATT data. That's the head-to-head study of Avastin versus Lucentis that most expect will be available during the month of May. We continue to believe that this study is unlikely to share any new insights, as that trial is quite small in size. As you know, there have been retrospective analyses done on very large safety databases. In those large clinical trials, we do see what appears to be increasing rates of stroke and, worse, mortality on patients treated with Avastin.</p>
          <p>Turning now to page 60, I'm happy to see that Tasigna continues to grow strongly, out-stripping our expectations. We showed 100% sales growth during the quarter, reaching sales of $153 million, showing us this product is well on track to become a blockbuster. And the conversion of the CML market from Glivec to the better product, Tasigna, is continuing as expected.</p>
          <p>On page 61, I'm happy to share the latest data on Gilenya, our oral MS drug. As you know, we launched Gilenya in the U.S. late last year. We achieved, during the first quarter, $54 million in U.S. sales, as well an additional $5 million, for a total of $59 million in sales, outside the U.S. Currently, we've made good progress in converting patients who are on free drug to paying patients, with now approximately 80% of the 6,500 patients that are on drug actually paying for their medication. As you know, we received European Commission approval in March and we launched in Germany at the very end of the month.</p>
          <p>Now, this chart, which is the first time we show it, is a comparison adjusted for time, weeks after launch, of Gilenya versus two of the market leaders, Copaxone and Rebif. And as you can see, this launch is performing in line with the very best launches in the MS space.</p>
          <p>Turning now to page 62, just want to give you some additional insights into our evolving respiratory business. Our Onbrez Breezhaler launch for COPD continues to gain momentum. As you can see from the chart on the left hand side of the page, with each successive launch, our market share gains have been greater as we have gained experience in the respiratory market. Onbrez achieved sales of $20 million for the quarter, which is a very nice acceleration versus the $33 million that we had for the full year of 2010.</p>
          <p>We also announced that the U.S. FDA Advisory Committee recommended approval of the 75-microgram dose on March the 8th and we expect to see a final approval in the next couple of months. And we also expect a Japanese regulatory decision by mid-year, which will allow us to continue to build the Onbrez brand.</p>
          <p>We turn now to the next page, I want to remind that our respiratory strategy is not just focused on Onbrez, but rather a portfolio of products. The next launch to be NVA237, long-acting muscarinic agent, where during the quarter we saw the first positive Phase III results. That data will be released in a major medical meeting during the third quarter. We saw positive efficacy, as well as a very nice profile, in terms of dry mouth, which is one of the side effects of drugs in this class.</p>
          <p>The development program for QVA, which is the combination of Onbrez and NVA, is continuing as planned, with continuing to accrue patients outside the U.S., with a planned launch outside the U.S. in 2013. And we are in the progress of &#x2013; we're now in progress of getting ready to meet with the FDA to discuss how this program would need to be amended for a U.S. launch, given that the dose of Onbrez in the U.S. will be lower than it is in the rest of the world. Overall, we remain very bullish and positive about our respiratory portfolio. It will take time to evolve, but I believe this will become a major leg for our organization.</p>
          <p>If we turn to my final slide, which is page 64, I won't go through this in any detail. Suffice to say that our development organization is very busy with a lot of expected news flow during the second and third quarter. And our commercial organization continues to demonstrate that it is very capable of launching new products, and we're very excited about the products yet to come as we continue to rejuvenate our portfolio.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to hand it back to Joe to wrap up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. So we're off to a good start in the first quarter and our priorities for the rest of the year are clear. If you look at slide 67, we are reaffirming our outlook for 2011, sales growth around the double-digit mark. And we aim to improve our core operating income margin, which will more than compensate for the lack of H1N1 this year. So with that, I'd like to now open the call for questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question comes from Mrs. Alexandra Hauber, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have couple of questions. Firstly, firstly on the buyback program, I think you emphasized that the key strategy really is to mitigate the dilution, but today you're mentioning $5 billion versus, in December, you mentioned a range of $5 billion to $6 billion, if I recall correctly. So I'm wondering whether we really should focus on the $5 billion, given that it has turned out to be cheaper to buy back enough shares to mitigate the impact, to get it to zero. So whether the cheaper share price is the key reason why it's now $5 billion rather than $5 billion to $6 billion. Second question is on the integration costs that you've highlighted. Is there, can you roughly tell us what the cash component will be?</p>
          <p>And also on &#x2013; outside Alcon, on your ongoing restructuring of the manufacturing footprint, I do understand that you cannot announce today what you're going to do. But what sort of annual restructuring cash requirement should we put into our cash flow models? Then I have a question for Kevin, which is very uneducated because I still don't know Alcon as well enough as I should know. But once I saw your strong constant currency sales growth, which I understand is partly because of an early seasonal &#x2013; an early on &#x2013; an early onset of the allergy season, I was actually surprised that you didn't get more operating leverage out of the business.</p>
          <p>So, could you just &#x2013; and you briefly mentioned that you have the drive to accelerate R&amp;D spend. So, could you just briefly talk a little bit more about your growth initiatives, which are ongoing basically on a standalone business before we get all those revenue synergies coming on top? And then the fourth question is on &#x2013; is for David. We've seen on Friday the FDA announced the post-marketing commitments for the LABAs and the &#x2013; LABAs ICSs. Given that you &#x2013; for indacaterol, you're not going to go for asthma, do you &#x2013; are you confident that you can escape a similar post-marketing commitment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay let's start, maybe Jon, the first two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, coming back to the buyback, Alexandra, we have always put as the priority of the share repurchase program, the minimization or the elimination of the dilution from the shares that we issued with Alcon, which is why we felt that repurchasing Alcon shares during the quarter made more sense because it eliminated dilution at source. And therefore, not only reduced dilution, but also I think mitigated the amount of shares that would have come back in flow-back. When we talked about $5 billion to $6 billion in December, we talked about $6 billion of &#x2013; up to $6 billion of cash and we gave a scenario of a $5 billion share buyback.</p>
          <p>The $1 billion difference was the CVA, which at the time we announced it in December, had a value of &#x2013; cash value of about $1 billion or an anticipated cash value of around $1 billion and actually came out at about &#x2013; at a bit less than that.</p>
          <p>So as you saw from the slide I presented, we've actually dealt a lot already with dilution and we'll continue to buy back shares until we're satisfied that we've mitigated it. The Alcon integration costs are predominantly cash because there is a relatively limited asset overlap between the two. And then on the manufacturing footprint and the restructuring, I think we will &#x2013; in future we'll separate out what the cash costs and what the asset are on the write-downs. But in the initial phases of the restructuring, most of it relates to asset effects because these programs will stretch over a number of years, and the cash costs will come towards the later part of the program. But we'll separate out cash and non-cash in future quarters.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Kevin, the question of operating leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Alexandra, the &#x2013; as I mentioned in my comments, we were actually quite pleased with the operating leverage that we had on a core reported basis, which actually showed leverage at 11%, one point faster than what we achieved in terms of top line revenue on a constant currency basis, that at the same time that we increased research and development expenses by 11%. And this is something that we've been doing over the last couple of years as we reinvigorate our R&amp;D pipeline.</p>
          <p>Also our SG&amp;A expenses were slightly higher than what we would normally plan to run for the year. And part of that relates to timing. One of the major surgical events, the American Cataract and Refractive Surgery Meeting was in March this year, when in fact it was April last year. So, overall positive operating leverage on the Alcon business.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, David. So, Alexandra, on this post marketing requirement around the LABAs, we've been working with the FDA for some months on that now and it does impact our product, Foradil. It has not involved indacaterol and we think it's unlikely because we're applying for an indication in COPD, although it may well impact products, which are going for an asthma label in the U.S. in the future.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my call. On NVA237, could you just comment on how it broadly compares to what we've seen in the Phase II data in terms of the FEV1 benefits, and just comment on perhaps when we should see the Glow 2 data coming through? And then perhaps just talking about the relationships with the FDA and what we've seen recently with QAB149, Afinitor, perhaps a slight delay to Menveo and also LBH.</p>
          <p>What are you learning from how quickly you're trying to get products through to the FDA? Is it time to step back and do you need to sort of learn some lessons from this? And what do you think going forward in terms of your development plans?</p>
          <p>And then probably lastly on Lucentis, just on the CATT study obviously, we're getting the data very soon &#x2013; could you just comment on in terms of market shares that we see between Avastin and Lucentis in the key European markets? And then just maybe give us an idea of what we see in terms of sales split between Europe and rest of the world? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll pick up the NVA question. As we indicated earlier, we have the first of the Phase III studies, which we will be disclosing more information on at the ERS in the second half of this year. We did say that the study was clearly positive on its primary endpoint, which was the trough FEV1 at 24 hours. And the data looks quite similar to what we've seen in previous studies. As to the next Phase III study, that will come out in the second half of this year and that will emerge with the totality of the data as we file end of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of just general commentary, working with the FDA, I wouldn't say there is any significant change in direction or approach. We have seen over the last couple of years an increased emphasis on benefit risk overall for products with a particular focus on safety. I expect that will continue. And I think our strategy of increasingly identifying patient subsets who are likely to respond so we can submit drugs with higher benefit risk will differentiate our company and allow us to continue to get drugs approved. Regarding &#x2013; I guess your question is regarding the use of Avastin in Europe, the simplest way to describe it is it's highly variable. And it's not even a country-by-country answer. It's a region-by-region answer. There are some places where Avastin use is zero. And there are other places it's nearly 100%. So it has, however, in terms of Avastin encroachment in the business, that has actually stabilized. And I guess depending upon how people interpret these larger retrospective databases, where we see the increased safety risk with Avastin, that may ultimately have some impact on Avastin use going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just ask, do you expect to see Avastin &#x2013; I mean not Avastin, Lucentis growing over the next three years following the CATT study?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Lucentis will certainly grow. Lucentis will benefit from the DME indication, from the RVO indication and other development work we're doing. In addition, Kevin and I have been discussing a synergy between our businesses where he can help us perhaps penetrate certain customer segments where we haven't had the same depth of experience and reputation that Alcon has. So, I'm optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I also think if you just look at the number of patients outside the U.S. with DME, it's &#x2013; or treatable DME, it's as large as what AMD, at about 600,000 patients. So, I think we fully expect to drive Lucentis' growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just starting with enoxaparin annualizing nearly $1 billion in sales now, just wondering if there is any stocking or one-off impacts in the quarter or if that was a good run rate that we should think about in the absence of any further compensation from Teva. Second point &#x2013; question for Jon, just on your comment about mitigation of dilution through the share buyback, are you talking just here about EPS dilution or about shares dilution?</p>
          <p>You've included in your $5 billion, the $2.6 billion in Alcon purchases. And I was just wondering does that mean we shouldn't expect anymore than the further $1.8 billion share buyback this year or is it feasible that you could actually go over that level depending on opportunities to buy back stock?</p>
          <p>And then the final question just on Trevor's comment on LABA post marketing requirements, following up there. Just wondering if that would also apply to any generic Advair that you're developing in Sandoz. Or do you think you can use a pathway that would mitigate that? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with one. Graham, thanks for a question on the enox run rate. Look we had a strong performance in Q1 for our largest launch ever but having said that, it's important to keep in mind that we're still operating in a supply constrained environment. We've worked hard to get our supply and share up to between 45% and 50% and, yes, there is some normal stock-in built in around two new accounts that we picked up in Q1.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and on the, on mitigation of dilution, you're right that you should think of the $2.6 billion that we've already spent, or really the $3.2 billion because we did buy $600 million of Novartis shares back before we had to stop the program, as being part of the dilution program that we talked about in December. In December when we talked about a share buyback of $5 billion eliminating or mitigating dilution, we hadn't fully taken into account at that time the opportunity to continue buying Alcon shares. And as I said to the earlier question, that seemed to us to be the more efficient way in which to reduce dilution. We are thinking about dilution in terms of impact on P&amp;L and so the conclusion that you can draw is that we have not yet fully eliminated dilution and therefore, you can expect that there will be some further share repurchases.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Graham, in terms of whether Advair would be &#x2013; or generic Advair would be impacted by this ruling around the LABAs, so I think that if that were the case, that certainly would mean there would be no path to a generic product in this category in the U.S. that wouldn't be a generic path. And as we've said before, we believe that there is in fact such a path. So, you know I think that you can draw your conclusions from that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, three questions, please. First <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:01:25) previously indicated your expectations to be able to grow through the entry of Diovan generic. Would you like to reaffirm that commitment today?</p>
          <p>Second, you obviously have one of the highest R&amp;D spends within your Pharma business, particularly with regard to research and as your ongoing series of acquisitions and organic investments in the business. Perhaps you could say something about capital discipline and how you think about capital allocation to building out the research part of the R&amp;D Pharma business. And finally on the same theme, you recently amended your elinogrel program for a shorter and lower cost clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome.</p>
          <p>I note that you've started a program with Ilaris in cardiovascular disease, which at the moment is in a long-term trial which is probably going to have a similar cost to &#x2013; or maybe slightly lower, but still a substantial cost similar to the original elinogrel program. Is there any sense that that could be amended or there specific scientific rationale why you're doing a secondary prevention trial with Ilaris in the cardiovascular indication?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Andrew, this is Joe, starting with the first question around patent expiration. You know, we have had many years to plan for the Diovan patent expiration. We continue to stand by our previous comments about the fact that when you look at the diversified nature of our portfolio, you look at the growing markets, you look at the balance between reimbursed and non-reimbursed products, that we do in fact expect to grow through this period of Diovan patent expiration. If you just look at the first quarter, Diovan was down 5% globally. We lost Diovan in Spain, in Brazil and in Canada in the first quarter. And the organic growth of our business ex-Alcon, ex-H1N1 was 8% with that built in.</p>
          <p>So, I think that we're at the very beginning stages of losing Diovan, but we're going according to plan with the addition of Alcon and what that does, as the second largest business with a growth trajectory of high single-digits, that's going to further enable us to accomplish that. In terms of R&amp;D, we are one of the highest in the industry, but when you look at what we're getting for that, we believe that it's a good spend, obviously.</p>
          <p>If you just look at the previous data that we've shown around pre-clinical Phase I, Phase II, Phase III and the number of new compounds that it takes to get us from those stages to an approved new compound, it's significantly better than the rest of the industry. So as we look at the &#x2013; at capital allocation decisions, this is a good spend for Novartis. It's probably not a good spend for some companies, but at this point given the productivity that we're starting &#x2013; that we are seeing now, it is a good spend. And you're going to see us continue to spend research and development at around 20%, anywhere from 19% to 21% of the Pharmaceutical division. David, do you want to add anything to that or -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, so the other question was about elinogrel. As you saw, we have decided to focus the program on ACS acute indication. As you know, elinogrel is likely to be available in both an injectable and an oral form. And we felt that was the best place to start when you look at the overall risk of the program, which Andy, you've certainly pointed out to us in the past.</p>
          <p>The program for Ilaris is really different, as we've explained before. Patients that have had a myocardial infarction, a significant portion of them have a very high inflammatory burden and there seems to be the opportunity to significantly improve upon the use of statins in those patients. The program, of course, won't be cheap. On the other hand, we think the potential benefit to patients could be really quite large.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I've just three questions. Firstly, I understand that you have recruited the manager of AstraZeneca in China to your organization. I was wondering if you could give me some comments around how that may change your trajectory there?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Alcon, when the TRAVATAN patent expires in 2013, do you still expect to maintain a high single-digit growth trajectory? And lastly, a question for Jon, just generally when you've implemented procurement saving programs, approximately what proportion of procurement spend have you saved? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have &#x2013; this is Joe. We have recruited Xudong Yin to run our Chinese business. We do believe that his experience in China and in terms of being able to build sales force excellence, as well as build out a commercial operation in China is directly relevant to our business. We've also hired him because we believe that there is substantial opportunity for the other divisions to gain scale and to leverage the Pharma strength.</p>
          <p>So, many of our businesses, like over-the-counter drugs, the Sandoz generics business and animal health are not as big obviously as the Pharmaceutical business and with Dong's experience, he is able to ensure that we're making the right decisions around China. So we do expect to see accelerating growth in China. I was there with him reviewing the plans just a couple of weeks ago and they're very exciting. We're doing something very different in Novartis in China than we have done in the past, and so we're looking forward to seeing the results of that. Kevin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, thanks for the question. The TRAVATAN patent, I think, I have it listed as 14. I think you said 13, but you have to keep in mind that for the most part, we're talking about the U.S. market. Alcon obviously participates with our Pharmaceutical business on a global basis where the conversion on generics is not the same as in the U.S.</p>
          <p>I think you also have to understand that the fact that the market is moving from a single entity prostaglandin to a combination, and obviously that allows us to participate at a different level. And at the same time, part of our approach in terms of the glaucoma segment is looking at ways that we can continue to differentiate. So for example, we've been launching TRAVATAN without the benefit of a BAK preservative. We just got approval for DuoTrav, which is the combination prostaglandin with the same preservative difference.</p>
          <p>So we're going to continue to differentiate so that we have some difference that is clinically relevant. And then you also have to think about the three legs to the Alcon business because you were relating it back to our overall growth rate. And we've got three growth engines: Pharmaceutical, Surgical and then the enhanced Vision Care when we combine eventually contact lenses and solutions. So we feel very optimistic about our growth prospects going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on purchasing, Mark, I mean there has been a well established program here for some time and it covers about $17 billion of cost base spend. So that's pretty well everything, you know, excluding head count costs. It will be increased going forward with Alcon by about another $3 billion. So that's about $20 billion of cost that is coordinated through the global and divisional purchasing teams. If you go back to what we talked about in November, we felt that if we really pushed this we could be generating somewhere between 6% to 8% of annual savings, and it's an &#x2013; and it's a big and important part of our overall productivity program.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, thank you. A number of product specific questions, if I could, largely in Pharma. Firstly, with respect to Diovan in the U.S., can you just give us an update as to how formulary relationships are progressing, given the new formulary year and obviously multi-source Cozaar?</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you also give us an update on how government negotiations are progressing on price for Lucentis in DME and RVO? Basically what price assumption should we be using for 2011? And then just a couple of quick ones. Exjade looked particularly weak from a positive trend in recent years. Has something happened? Was that stocking related?</p>
          <p>And then just a follow-on on the FDA requirements with Foradil. I mean, quite frankly, is it worth it for a product of that size in terms of the very substantial investment for the clinical trial, which is needed? And then finally the $59 million for Gilenya in the quarter, was that all fundamental sales or is there also stocking and pipeline filling involved with that revenue number, too? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll try to hit each of them quickly. In the case of Diovan, actually, our formulary position improved slightly this year. It did require us to give slightly higher discounting, but overall it has allowed us, as you saw, to maintain a substantial portion of the volume.</p>
          <p>And you asked for an explanation why I believe that most managed care plans are looking at the switching cost and to switch from Diovan to Cozaar generic, and then potentially back to Diovan when Diovan goes off patent. It's just not a worthwhile financial equation for them. So as a result, they will keep most of their patients on Diovan until the Diovan patent expires.</p>
          <p>In terms of our ongoing discussions with some select governments on the Lucentis pricing in Europe, as you know when the company gets a new indication, some of those governments will at some point ask the company to come back to negotiate pricing. Those discussions are underway. As I've indicated before, I expect to see some pricing pressure for the brand, but overall it's probably somewhere in the single-digit range in terms of change in pricing. And we think that will easily be absorbed by the increases in volume that we will see.</p>
          <p>You're right about Exjade sales during the first quarter, in fact it's predominately focused on Exjade in the U.S. market because outside the U.S. the growth continues to be quite nice. What we found is that there was one particular specialty wholesaler that had de-stocked Exjade during the quarter. That represents probably about half of the missing sales. And the rest is some slowdown, particularly in the MDS indication. As you know, over time there have been &#x2013; required your doctor letters about MDS, which has had some softening impact on demand for the product. Regarding Foradil, we did about $72 million sales worldwide in Q1.</p>
          <p>So while it's certainly not one of our biggest products, it is a decent size product and obviously we would like to find the ways to do any kind of post commitment trials in a way that make economic sense. And <mark type="ph" /> Trevor (1:14:19) is charged with helping us figure out how to do that.</p>
          <p>And then your final question was about the $59 million in Gilenya sales during Q1, roughly $54 million of which was in the U.S. You want to know if there is any stocking in there and the answer is yes, of course, any time a new brand launches there is a stocking effect. That's in line with the growth of the product. And when a product outdoes expectations of the wholesaler, there's a bit of a catch-up period. And we did see some catch-up during the month of March. And I think I've covered all of them.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Florent Cespedes from Exane BNP Paribas. First a question for Andrin, could we have an update on the MenB program in the U.S., notably following their recent <mark type="ph" /> ATCA (1:15:15) meeting?</p>
          <p>Secondly, question for Jeff, could we have an update on the Copaxone situation in the U.S.? The trial will start in September. Do you have any news on potential clinical trials requirement? And, Jeff, also could we have a quick update on the German market environment?</p>
          <p>A quick question for David, could we have some color on the discussions you have with payers in Europe about the pricing of Gilenya? And the last one for Kevin, as we're not very familiar with your business, could we have some more color on how do you see the dynamic of the three divisions going forward, as you'll have to face some patent expiries, but also I guess you'll launch new product?

      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Florent, on MenB you've probably seen the recommendation of the advisory panel and from the FDA, who was positive on our approach on how we would show a surrogate and for efficacy in a Phase III program. This was particularly encouraging to us because this is exactly the approach we had used in our large Phase III programs that are the basis for our filing in Europe where we had filed Bexsero at the end of 2010, and subsequently we are now in the process of filing that product in other countries around the world.</p>
          <p>On top of that, in the U.S. we also had the end of Phase II meeting with the FDA where we had received additional feedback on the program. And we are currently digesting that feedback. It will take us a few months to evaluate all our options and then we will give an update on what is going to be our path forward in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little bit too early to give any timeframe now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would not want to speculate. I think it's a complex program. We had quite some feedback from the FDA that we're now digesting in detail. And I think then we will be in a better position to give guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, so Florent, on your question first on Germany, we estimate that the German generics market declined 23% in net terms as tenders now comprise over half the market, and in light of the AMNOG legislation, which limits substitution at the pharmacy level, unlike in Q1 of 2010 and most of last year. Sandoz as a group was hit a bit harder on a relative basis as we've had historically higher share of the statutory health insurance portfolio contracts with our Hexal brand, which have now converted to single molecule tenders.</p>
          <p>I think it's important to note that we continue to hold the number one position in the German generic market. And our market share in value terms per IMS is more than six points higher than that of Teva and Ratiopharm combined. As we announced at the end of 2010, we've restructured our business into three segments to simplify our go-to-market approach.</p>
          <p>First, the discount generic or tender segment, which is led by 1A Pharma, which has been growing double-digits for the last several years and is now the number three brand in the market. Secondly, our core generic business which is Hexal, which has detailing capabilities, and then third, our specialty segment, which is really where a lot of the growth is in biosimilars, oncology, injectables, hospital and other specialty.</p>
          <p>Before I go to Copaxone, as a final note, I think what's more significant about Q1 is that despite the performance in Germany &#x2013; offsetting the performance in Germany was really the excellent performance we had in Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe where we had 19% and 22% growth respectively, with over 40% growth in France, Russia and the UK and over 70% growth in Spain.</p>
          <p>Quickly on your Copaxone question, you're correct that the date for the full trial is now set for September 7th and we remain confident in our prospects in court. The FDA continues to actively review our application based on the accepted 505(j) pathway filing, and we believe we're first to file and look forward to bringing this essential medicine to patients once we're cleared in the future for marketing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, Jeff, any idea about the potential clinical trial requirements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't comment on our development strategy. I think that's probably best for me to not comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think the one price to point out in Europe for Gilenya now would be our German price where we are selling the product for &#x20AC;1,850 for a 28-day pack. The discussions with the other markets are ongoing. There will be additional announcements in the coming weeks and some obviously will take a few months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Kevin, the growth dynamics behind eye care obviously are linked to aging demographics and also when you look at the level of unmet medical need, in a lot of cases in the Pharmaceutical area, for example, in glaucoma where we're simply treating the symptom of elevated pressure. So, when you think about our business dynamics across these three businesses, we've really got to look at each one of them individually, starting with Surgical.</p>
          <p>Obviously as the population gets older, the opportunity for increased number of cataract procedures increases, but more importantly we've got the opportunity to add technology. And we're in a wonderful position with a multifocal IOL and a Toric IOL and we're just launching outside of the U.S., the combination of both of those technologies, that allows us to put a between 2 and 4x price on a monofocal IOL. So, obviously, as we continue to introduce technology, we're going to drive both procedures, as well as value growth.</p>
          <p>The Pharmaceutical segment is going to be based around the new products and driving out market share in glaucoma. And then when you think about the other side of the age spectrum, in contact lenses, we're in a much better position to address the under-indexed penetration of contact lenses, but at the same time to grow share across both lenses and solutions. So, we really do have different growth dynamics in all three of the businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we have time for two more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Next question from Tim Anderson, Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Back to the topic of R&amp;D spend. Just a simple question, which is whether your internal rate of return has been above your cost of capital over the last few years.</p>
          <p>Second question is on the tax treatment of Diovan. Often big brands are set up in favorable tax structures. And I'm wondering if losing patent protection in certain markets over the next year is going to put upward pressure on your tax rate. And then last question is on the margin structure of Sandoz over time, should we be expecting margins to go down before they go up between now and something like 2015 due to the need to invest in various things like biosimilars and clinical trials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the R&amp;D question when Jon got here he introduced us to cash flow return on investment metrics. I can tell you we've looked at our R&amp;D spend every such possible way and the return is much higher than any cost of capital that we use.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, he's right. On the tax treatment, I think without going into &#x2013; I obviously won't go into the specifics of the Diovan tax structure, but I think the fact that we're &#x2013; are and will experience Diovan patent expiries and are talking about a tax rate in the region of 15.5% to 16.5% sort of would indicate that we're not expecting to see any major impact on our tax rate as result of patent expiries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jeff, on margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you know on margin structure, Tim, we are investing heavily in biosimilars and respiratory. And as those products move to the clinic in Phase III and particularly on the back of this year and 2012 and beyond, that obviously has an impact on margins. Having said that, we're offsetting that through a lot of great productivity work that our teams are doing. So in Q1 this year alone we saved over $135 million of savings through productivity, through sourcing and procurement and over the last two years, in 2009 and 2010, the number is well over $850 million of productivity savings.</p>
          <p>So I think we're balancing the productivity, excuse me &#x2013; we're balancing the significant investments that we're making with productivity. We did get hit in Q1 on the gross margin side, as Jon mentioned, due to the declining German business. But there was also &#x2013; a good part of that was currency fluctuations, as well as lower sales to other divisions. So I'm &#x2013; continue to be optimistic that we can continue to show margin expansion over the course of the next couple of years.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking my questions. I wanted two brief questions. Firstly, on Germany and the Sandoz business, I just wondered if you could make any more comment on the pricing of the biosimilars in that marketplace. And secondly, Jon, I'm &#x2013; presumably now that the Alcon deal is complete with $4 billion of cash, which was on the Alcon balance sheet, is now wholly available for Novartis purposes, I just wondered how much of that money would need to be left for working capital purposes within Alcon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so first on Sandoz in Germany and biosimilars, it has been hit by some of the legislative changes in terms of the pricing environment. It's also a more competitive biosimilar market. I think it's notable if you look globally at our biosimilars business, we actually were growing north of 80% outside of Germany, but it was a tougher quarter for biosimilars in Germany. But as we continue to expand elsewhere, the relative share of Germany to not only the total biosimilars business, but more importantly to the total Sandoz business, continues to diminish in importance.</p>
