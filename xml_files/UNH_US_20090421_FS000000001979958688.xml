      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Our first quarter results reflected the steadily strengthened execution we committed to in the spring of 2008. There are three areas of performance we want to highlight for you.</p>
          <p>First, we continue to strengthen our discipline around product placement and pricing at the local market level. We are seeing benefits from a renewed focus on in-market relationships and local market insights and leadership, which are coming into better balance with our national capabilities and scale.</p>
          <p>Second, we continue to steadily advance a stronger culture of service and responsiveness throughout our businesses. This effort began roughly two years ago, and people are noticing the difference across the board, from brokers and consultants to customers and consumers and increasingly care providers. As we have built stronger local relationships and improved service, the positive aspects of our reputation for innovation are again being recognized. Our focus on fundamental execution in this area is driving results.</p>
          <p>And finally, even before the current economic crisis, we were reducing operating costs and working to more consistently and fundamentally to manage our medical costs. That work is continuing, and today we are clearly benefiting.</p>
          <p>Turning to our results, first quarter revenues of 22 billion increased 8% year-over-year. Revenues reflect strong growth in our Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, Part D Prescription Drug, and Medicare Supplement offerings, along with growth in sales of prescription drugs through our PBM. Enrollment and client retention in our commercial benefit businesses were modestly favorable to our expectations, offsetting higher than expected attrition driven by the economic downturn.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated first quarter operating margin of 7.6% absorbed 50 basis points of reduced investment income year-over-year. Positives included favorable developments in our estimates of last year's medical costs in our risk businesses and improved operating cost management. Overall, medical costs are performing consistent with our expectations. We continue to expect our 2009 commercial medical cost trends to be in a range of 8 percentage points, plus or minus 50 basis points, and we are pricing accordingly.</p>
          <p>We continued to effectively manage a conservative balance sheet with a strong liquidity position. At March 31, our investment portfolio had swung to a net unrealized capital gain of $54 million. Bringing these factors together, we earned $0.81 per share in the first quarter, compared with $0.78 per share one year ago despite absorbing a $0.06 per share reduction in net investment income. Our businesses generated cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion in the quarter, an exceptional performance for a first quarter when cash flows are not seasonally strong.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, our strong growth in public and senior benefit programs will likely drive full-year revenues past $86 billion, perhaps $1.5 billion or more above the upper end of our revenue outlook. However, it is premature to adjust our overall earnings outlook at this early stage of the year, and we continue to be appropriately circumspect about the economic environment and the impact it may have on our businesses.</p>
          <p>We are seeing pressures from increasing employment attrition at customers of UnitedHealthcare and OptumHealth and reduced sales activities at Ingenix, and these may largely offset the strength in our public and senior businesses. As such, we're maintaining our earnings outlook in the broad range of $2.90 to $3.15 per share.</p>
          <p>With the understanding that the broad range is appropriate and that we don't provide quarterly earnings guidance, we do have a view that second quarter earnings will be markedly lower than the first quarter, just as they were last year. That includes higher medical care ratios beginning in the second quarter driven by seasonally higher expenses under high-deductible plan designs at UnitedHealth Care. In the latter half of the year, this is expected to be partially offset by favorable seasonality in Part D earnings.</p>
          <p>Prescription Solutions also expects a sequential decline in second quarter earnings following the traditionally strong mail-order refill business in the first quarter. A year-over-year reduction in investment income represents further pressure for coming quarters, particularly the second quarter. We continue to expect a nominal level of second quarter cash flow, with roughly 4 billion of our targeted $5 billion or so in cash flows from operations to come in the second half of the year given the timing of income tax payments and variations in working capital balances.</p>
          <p>Before reviewing performance at the business group level, it makes sense to offer a broader context on where we are and our view of the market overall as we look over the balance of 2009 and towards 2010. Internally, we see substantive, positive momentum coursing through our enterprise, much stronger than last year or the year before. We see this in consistently stronger service and response levels, better market receptivity to and acceptance of our newer products and services, improved and more consistent pricing discipline, stronger customer retention levels, and growing broker and agent networks.</p>
          <p>In our services businesses, our consulting capabilities are expanding nicely. The government customer sector, where we were relatively weak two years ago, is now emerging as one of our strongest and fastest-growing sectors. Our selling skills, processes, and disciplines are advancing across the board. Our innovation and the attitude and energy of our people are sources of real strength.</p>
          <p>The obvious offset to this momentum is the exceptionally weak economy that is driving high levels of unemployment. It is also driving a pullback in those business sectors we provide with consulting and other information and knowledge-related services. We think that will begin to thaw in the second half of 2009 and into 2010, but it is impacting current sales and revenue pipelines. The healthcare stimulus package should be positive for Medicaid in the near term and for our healthcare IT services in the intermediate term.</p>
          <p>Through all of this, the measurable value we are bringing to the market in more consistent and concrete ways has never been higher. So as we discuss the business group performances with you, we will offer some specific examples to the value propositions we hope will play into a sustained movement to modernize the healthcare system in this nation.</p>
          <p>Let's begin with the business reviews with our benefit businesses, starting with UnitedHealthcare, where first quarter results were stronger than we had originally anticipated. We saw slightly better top-line performance from both fee-based and risk-based businesses driven by stronger-than-expected enrollment from fee-based clients and improved account retention on full risk business. These were partially offset by economy-related attrition that was higher than we had estimated.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we expect stronger customer retention to continue to help offset rising unemployment. If year-end average unemployment lands in the 10% range as compared to our previous upper-end outlook of 9%, we would still forecast our total decline in consumers served at about 1.5 million for the year. The slightly stronger first quarter start moves those incremental membership losses later into the year, so our total revenue outlook for UnitedHealthcare continues to be about $41 billion in revenue.</p>
          <p>Our UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio of 81.5% reflects slowly strengthening yields, as well as favorable development in our estimates of 2008 medical costs. We continue to estimate this ratio at 84% plus or minus 50 basis points in 2009, maintaining its seasonal increases towards a meaningfully higher fourth quarter level.</p>
          <p>All in, we're pleased with the steady progress UnitedHealthcare continues to make and the value it brings to health care. We align our benefits, our physician networks, our hospital contracts, and our support services along lines of clinical specializations. Our premium networks integrate evidence-based care management programs across more than 20 medical specialties and report on care quality and efficiency to the consumer. These networks now span more than 135 local markets reaching nearly 20 million of our members. Through our Premium Designation program, we can identify as many as 100,000 physicians who consistently produce superior overall clinical care outcome, and up to 20% lower cost levels overall through their adherence to evidence-based care and consistently excellent clinical practice processes.</p>
          <p>Today, well above 3 million people use some form of our modern consumer-focused benefit products, our fastest-growing products, particularly in this economy. These more modern product designs increasingly incent patients to pursue premium network care for better outcomes at lower costs.</p>
          <p>To this we're adding our Consumer Activation Index to systematically engage consumers in better care decision-making. Research suggests that 50% or more of the health care decisions people make are not optimal for them. We are incenting and supporting active patient engagement using this index and supporting better evidenced-based decision-making to the highly integrated, personalized, and multi-channel eSync platform developed by OptumHealth.</p>
          <p>Our programs offer potent results for customers. For example, our self-funded national account core client base has had an all-in compound annual health care cost trend at 5% over the last four years, with the last two years averaging 4% as these programs become more established. This is a dramatically differentiated cost performance trend from broad market trends evident in the market today, and it's a sustainable value.</p>
          <p>Moving to the first quarter of our public and senior benefit businesses. AmeriChoice had an excellent quarter with strong organic growth in premiums well matched to costs as expected. AmeriChoice revenues and growth remained strong, with full-year revenues expected to approach $8 billion. AmeriChoice's organic growth outlook for the risk-based business of 425,000 to 500,000 people this year is unchanged.</p>
          <p>We recently terminated an unprofitable fee-based Medicaid contract serving about 75,000 dual-eligibles in Texas, and we will lose that fee-based membership in the second quarter. AmeriChoice also converted about 100,000 fee-based members in Tennessee to risk-based status in the first quarter as we expected in our original outlook.</p>
          <p>AmeriChoice is a distinctive platform for driving value for the state Medicaid marketplace, where they routinely outperform fee-for-service Medicaid programs. AmeriChoice's middle Tennessee marketplace, which has taken over from a fee-for-service program, provide a recent example. Expectant mothers are having healthier babies and incurring lower costs, with a 13% decrease in neonatal intensive care days per thousand. Use of hospital emergency rooms decreased by 12% by moving care to effective primary care centers and reducing unnecessary visits.</p>
          <p>This is why states continue to look to private sector solutions and why AmeriChoice now serves 21 state governments and the District of Columbia. We bring more modern and integrated clinical programs, sophisticated technology, actionable information to improve program effectiveness, and ultimately better care and cost outcomes.</p>
          <p>AmeriChoice has abundant opportunities under health care reform, beginning with the reauthorization and expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program, where it is estimated that 3.3 million people are to be added to the base eligible population of 4.8 million. We anticipate that more people will ultimately be enrolled in Medicaid as a result of this expansion, and longer-term, AmeriChoice is exceptionally well positioned for national coverage efforts in 43 state-based programs.</p>
          <p>Ovations had a very strong start to the year with higher than projected growth across its offerings. In Medicare Advantage, our efforts to strengthen local market product positioning and distribution were more successful than expected. New sales are up year-over-year, as is customer retention. We grew across all channels and in all products except in Special Needs Plans, where we appropriately reduced prior-year benefit levels. Growth was driven by corporate-sponsored programs and retail sales and took place across all geographies.</p>
          <p>These results were achieved by stronger fundamental execution rather than any single tactic, and we believe these efforts have produced a well-balanced mix across our product. For the balance of this year, Ovations is clearly on course to grow all of its businesses except Special Needs Plans.</p>
          <p>The Medicare Advantage business will likely exceed 200,000 new seniors. That is roughly double the conservative end of our growth outlook from Investor Day. Our D growth is also above our estimate. This strength should lead to higher overall revenues for Ovations, likely approaching $32 billion, or midteens percentage revenue growth.</p>
          <p>UnitedHealth Group's value distinctions are among the most fundamental and basic for Medicare beneficiaries served by Ovations. Our Medicare Advantage managed care benefits are designed as modern, integrated offerings in contrast to the Medicare Part A and Part B indemnity benefits. Our benefits are richer, and consumer engagement is evident.</p>
          <p>The performance differences are evident as well. These privatized programs have taken one-quarter of the overall Medicare market, much of it in just the past few years. Our performance shows 25% lower readmission rates than unmanaged Medicare and in our local, best markets roughly one-third lower overall hospital inpatient bed dates.</p>
          <p>Our Medicare Advantage medical cost trends are better than unmanaged fee-for-service Medicare, even with richer benefit content. The 2010 Medicare cost trend estimate from CMS and its related rate adjustments were largely consistent with its February guidance. And we are preparing to file 2010 benefits using the rates CMS just provided and are prepared to adjust as CMS receives final guidance from Congress.</p>
          <p>Now we'll turn to our services businesses, for which we project combined revenues of approximately 21 billion this year, at the upper end of our prior outlook. We provide a broad and diverse set of capabilities and services across the total health care system through these businesses.</p>
          <p>Ingenix did a good job of withstanding economic pressures affecting its customers, particularly pharmaceutical companies and hospitals. Intensive operating cost management, as well as stronger sales performance in the payer and government market segments, largely offset the economic pressure on growth. And we remain focused on agile responses to changing market conditions.</p>
          <p>Ingenix is delivering consumer focus tools such as a matchmaking service for choosing a physician. And most recently, Quicken Health, developed in partnership with both Ingenix and Intuit. Quicken Health is being introduced into the marketplace and will be adopted by UnitedHealthcare to help consumers organize their health and health benefit information and manage their health care-related finances.</p>
          <p>Under that theme of using information to power the system, we expect Ingenix will see significant opportunities for growth through products and services already established and in the market in areas such as electronic medical records, comparative effectiveness research, health information exchanges and connectivity, information security, and physician performance and payment accuracy solutions.</p>
          <p>At OptumHealth, we are seeing high growth in the public sector and a solid external business pipeline, which are being offset by losses of higher-margin commercial business. The development of a strong and growing public sector business has helped to moderate earnings decreases from the UnitedHealthcare commercial market and position OptumHealth for a more diverse future.</p>
          <p>OptumHealth adds its own distinctive value to the system. Optum operates more than 1,000 Web portals on behalf of employers, helping put information at their employees' fingertips regardless of who their benefit carrier may be. OptumHealth maintains confidential personal health records on behalf of more than 20 million people, accessible through our membership cards or through direct Internet access.</p>
          <p>OptumHealth Financial Services used its payment system to electronically transmit more than $7 billion in claims payments and related payment information directly to physicians and other providers in the first quarter alone, a 29% year-over-year increase. This is an obviously faster and cheaper method of payment than the costly and inefficient paper check in the mail, which dominates the industry today. It is perhaps the simplest and most basic example of the extended modernization needed in health care. It also reduces costs and increases productivity for health care providers.</p>
          <p>Opportunities for OptumHealth include integrated disease management, behavioral and medical care programs, and expanded opportunities for wellness and prevention programs. OptumHealth was the developer of eSync platform, referenced earlier in today's discussion. And that platform enables us to drive personalized quality and affordability in the benefits businesses.</p>
          <p>And finally, Prescription Solutions had a very strong first quarter, with increases in revenues, total prescriptions filled and prescriptions filled through our mail facilities. Top-line growth was led by the increased Part D performance from Ovations and by strong mail-order sales. The operating margin of 4% was a record for this business, which is now on track for full-year earnings growth in excess of 30% on revenues approaching $14 billion.</p>
          <p>Prescription Solutions add value by helping people optimize their drug benefits. Their customers' use of generic medications exceeded the national average by 400 basis points in 2008. And we will exceed that in our managed Medicare business.</p>
          <p>Longer term, we expect a congressional focus on affordable drugs and ultimately an expansion of generics into the biologic area to create significant opportunities for this business. We see our country's focus on total cost and value only increasing the strategic importance of integrated pharmacy management in the future.</p>
          <p>Before closing, we'll touch on health care reform, or modernization, as we think of it broadly We support the true modernization of the entire health care system. We believe Americans want a system that is more accessible to all, more affordable, more effective and efficient, simpler, and more responsive. They don't want just more coverage. They want a better and more cost-sustainable modern system. This is what we have been working for, for more than 20 years, and I'll offer as an example to consider the programs a sophisticated customer like General Electric uses in its health benefit plan today. Our premium designation networks, wellness program, consumer activation, health coaching, applications of consumer technologies, and smart benefit design are all part of their approach, and it produces a distinctive quality of care and cost outcome for their employees year after year.</p>
          <p>Back in 1965, GE's program looked much like the indemnity or fee for service of today. But GE's progressive thinking and leadership, combined with private market innovation and entrepreneurship, have advanced its benefit offerings forward by multiple generations. That approach to innovation and modernization needs to be expanded across all markets from commercial, to Medicare, to Medicaid, and beyond.</p>
          <p>When we consider both reform and modernization, we see expanding market opportunity. Some of our businesses may need to adapt to different requirements, as they have done frequently in the past. As we have said before, this company was built on and for health care reform and modernization, and we expect that to continue.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we believe our first quarter performance shows we are expanding positive momentum in the businesses despite considerable pressures from the economic environment. We're seeing the positive results of fundamental execution, service, local focus, and practical innovations. This is in its early stages. We will steadily advance our performance quarter-by-quarter to better serve customers, consumers, and care providers. Modernization of health care, which we believe should go beyond the current expectations for government reform, plays to our strengths as a company and is key to our social mission.</p>
          <p>The truth is that change is inevitable. Some changes may require rapid adaptations, but leading companies take advantage of both change and challenging markets. There remains a huge opportunity to continue to advance our health care system to better serve people and create value for society through innovation, technology, and service. And that is what we intend to continue doing. As we continue executing on this agenda, our customers and stakeholders will benefit, and our shareholders will prosper.</p>
          <p>And at this time I'd like to open up for questions for our senior team. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. My first question on the 200 million in prior period reserve developments, which was comparable with last year, could you bifurcate commercial versus Medicare on that?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Charles, it's Mike. I don't want to get into exact numbers. What I can tell you is, we saw much greater development in mix in the commercial side versus last year, where we saw a greater mix in the government side. So year-over-year we're seeing a greater mix on commercial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And in terms of the uncertainty around health reform, which I think you addressed well, I'm just wondering how that's impacting your capital deployment decisions. And specifically do you think it's prudent to see how federal law may change before repurchasing your own stock or making further acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Charles, I think that as we've said through our prepared comments and as kind of we have behaved through our business, we think there is a significant need in the government marketplace and significant opportunity. We expect that there'll be changes over time, but the broad market demands of that whole sector are compelling and growing meaningfully. We have put capital there in the past. We would expect that we would continue to, and we will obviously be alert to the timing of what we might anticipate government action to be, but it really doesn't change. There is nothing here that has really changed our outlook on the business in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's just &#x2013; not to put words in your mouth &#x2013; would you say then &#x2013; should we infer from that that you believe valuations, including your own stock valuation, is reflecting something significantly worse than what we should expect the outcome of federal reform to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I may not comment on our own stock valuation. Do I believe that an enterprise that has the capacity that we have and the cash-generating capacities that we possess has a greater value potential? We clearly do. In terms of the government's role in its program and in the health care sector, I think largely as I've said before, we think that that will play out to be opportunistic, and we're approaching our business that way, and we're looking at our capital management in that fashion as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll of Stifel Nicolaus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. Just wanted to drill down a little more on your commentary about &#x2013; what does "markedly lower" mean for second quarter? And maybe in answering that, could you review for us the drivers of that again? And then secondly, if I look at first quarter to second quarter of last year, it showed about a sequential decline of about 14%. I guess applying that to this year would put you at about $0.70. I mean, is that in the ballpark? Am I thinking about that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll offer just a little bit of color on this, and then I might ask Mike Mikan to comment if we need a little bit more clarification. But we &#x2013; first of all, we moved to giving annual guidance. And we did that by intent. And we intended to broaden our guidance. And we will maintain that posture as well. I would say that as we look at consensus numbers, we might have a few observations.</p>
          <p>One, that the consensus is perhaps not fully considering the seasonal patterns of last year. So if you really look to last year's seasonal patterns, I think that offers some guidance. We would think those patterns would cause the second quarter to pull in a little slightly from where consensus is right now in response to higher medical costs in commercial benefits as deductibles wear off as well as Prescription Solutions seasonality.</p>
          <p>And I would also offer that maybe third and fourth quarters could be pulled in a bit more from where consensus is right now in consideration of progressively higher medical care utilization. But I think in total, if you really overlay the seasonal patterns of the prior year that will give you some sense of the quarter outlook. Would you offer anything to that, Mike?</p>
          <p>So as I would say, I would think from what's out in consensus now, a slight pull in from the second quarter and then perhaps just a bit more in the third and fourth, mostly in response to the pattern of the care utilization through the course of the year with our products.</p>

          <p>Yes, thank you. Could you elaborate &#x2013; on the press release you comment on higher medical care ratios for the public and senior markets business.

        <plist>
          <p>Matt, I think we talked about this at the investor conference, and we also discussed it at our fourth quarter call, that we were going to have a mix shift in 2009, a greater weight in the government business, as well as the fact that we did gain enrollment in group private fee-for-service business, which carries a higher loss ratio. In addition, we did make our benefits more competitive in the MA space. So all in all, we did expect a mix shift of additional volume in the government business, as well as higher care ratios in that business, which was driving our aggregate or consolidated medical care ratio up by, say &#x2013; call it 50 basis points or so year-over-year.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Matt, as we look at our business, we've got a deliberate strategy to match our revenue with our medical costs. And to date, those are progressing well. We've also had some favorability on our SG&amp;A side, where we've had a strong focus on taking advantage of our scale and size. So those operations are coming in as planned. And while we're seeing the outlook for the revenue side and yield to be slightly lower than we originally thought in the year, we're also seeing our medical expenses and our operating costs slightly down. So the matching of revenue and medical and operating costs are as planned.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A couple quick questions here. On Medicare Advantage, you saw a lot of growth here. And I think we've in the industry, although I missed a lot of it last year, but I think we've seen some disappointment. Can you give us some metrics that can help us understand what you look at in order to get a sense that Medicare Advantage won't be an unpleasant surprise later in the year? And then you said that you're going to look at Medicare guidance from Congress. Do you expect Congress to change the 4% reduction that CMS has announced? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You had two very different questions. Larry Renfro, do you want to take the first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think what's going on with the growth and how we're going to sustain it; we had a very good start to the year with our selling. I think one thing that we did really well was position, really, the product from a design standpoint. We also know our customer much better than we did a year ago. And I think at our distribution system, we were really adapting to the new guidelines with the suitability for our prospects, and all those things worked very well.</p>
          <p>As far as some of the experience for the rest of the year, maybe I'll just comment on one area, Christine. On the, what I'll call the Part D side, based on the claims that we have experienced so far in the first quarter, everything seems to be in line with our expectations. We're paying very close attention to utilization and unit cost trends. And again, they are in line with our expectations. The other factor would be the risk scores, and the risk scores are lining up with our assumptions and with our existing membership. So that kind of puts it all in perspective in terms of the growth side of the first quarter and the experience that we have today on claims, and where we expect to be for the rest of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I would. Christine, hi, Jack Larsen. The only thing I would add is that while we have looked at, as Larry said, the inbound HCC scores, and whatever medical claims information we have on some of those new members, we're going to watch those inbound as well as through the balance of the year and certainly have a much more refined point of view sometime in the second quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>I think that it's basically a situation &#x2013; if you really follow the patterns in the past, Christine, we'll file our benefits using the rate guidance that CMS provides. That is not a passive process. Once our benefits are filed, there is significant back and forth that occurs. And generally speaking, that resolves itself roughly around Labor Day. As it stands right now, we'll follow the guidance of CMS. And if the reduction in physician rates are overturned, we will expect that there will be revisions from CMS and accordingly, a response from us. That's a pattern that has been established in the past. And we'll continue to approach it that way. And we'll be very alert, and we are in regular contact with the administration with respect to that dynamic. We expect that to occur all through the summer.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. Two questions. The first one was on commercial risk business, particularly the high-deductible health plan products. Wondering if you noticed any change in utilization patterns in the first quarter? I know it's early. But with the deductibles resetting in the first quarter, if perhaps you noticed members putting off discretionary services or maybe utilizing more in-network doctors, generic drugs? Any changes, I guess, in the behavioral patterns of your membership that you could speak to?</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Gail Boudreaux. In terms of the high-deductible product from a utilization perspective, we've seen a fairly consistent utilization relative to the expectation we've had. As you know, we have over &#x2013; almost 3 million members in our high-deductible program. So we've got a fair amount of experience. And we have not seen anything outside of &#x2013; real changes in the behavioral patterns at this point. But again, as you said, it is still fairly early to make those kind of predictions for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then my second question was just actually, what was the free cash at the parent at the end of the quarter, and also the share count guidance? Has that changed for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Free cash at the end of the quarter was right around $700 million. And we're not changing the guidance &#x2013; we're sticking with the range in terms of share guidance for the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks, good morning. I just want to talk about medical cost trends. In the fourth quarter when you guys reported in January, it sounded like the medical cost trend had come in favorable to your previous expectations, below that 8%. And now we're seeing obviously stronger commercial earnings, favorable development, and it sounds more like a reiteration of that 8% trend. So, I guess technically that insinuates there's been some sort of acceleration in the first quarter here, and obviously it doesn't seem like it was flu. So I'm just curious what changed on the medical front, what's causing that slight upward pressure? And then &#x2013; I guess I have a follow-up then, afterwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, do you want to start it out and then maybe Dan can speak to the commercial business directly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Josh, I'm not going to change from what we said last quarter. We did see favorable development in the fourth quarter. We've continued to see some favorable development in the first quarter. That being said, we continue to see pressures on the unit cost side in the facility inpatient setting, and although we can acknowledge that there are areas where we're seeing moderating trends, there are also areas that continue to have significant amount of pressure. And remember, we have a very large national presence. So we're trying to give it to you in aggregate; the devil's in the details. But Dan Schumacher, the CFO of UnitedHealthcare, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure Mike. As I think about the cost trends in the commercial space, Josh, one thing that's important to remember, obviously in the first quarter we had favorable prior period development. That's not something we planned for nor expect forward. And then also something that may not be measuring into your calculus is as we add on more COBRA members as a result of the federal stimulus, we expect some additional medical costs as we pace through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you seeing that COBRA impact already, or is that just expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's expectation at this point. We've issued our letters to members &#x2013; to qualifying members &#x2013; last week, and so over the ensuing months we'll see the take-up rate and corresponding implications from a medical cost standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then just a quick follow-up. I know the question was asked, and I appreciate you're not giving quarterly guidance, but if you look at the previous 11 years before 2008, the history would tell you that the sequential change in earnings from 1Q to 2Q is actually up. Last year was obviously a lot different; there was a lot of recognition of higher costs or lower yields I guess in second quarter. So I'm just curious, what changed in the business? Revenues were only up mid- to high single digits last year, so what's really changed dramatically in the last two years to completely sort of change that seasonality of earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's interesting, Josh. In terms of 11 years, actually a lot has changed, and if you really think about it, the introduction of a different benefit design, the introduction of Part D across our business, the amount of just complete change in our mix &#x2013; business over that period of time, has produced different quarter-to-quarter patterns. Mike, you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would reiterate what Steve said; a lot has changed. It changed in the book of business; principally over time, it has changed the seasonal patterns of this business. But with second quarter, I think what Steve said &#x2013; you're going to see multiple things. One, we do have pressure on investment income, so you have to take that into consideration. And remember we do have a volume impact from UnitedHealthcare as well. So you need to look at that year-over-year, and we've been seeing that for the last couple years. So &#x2013; and Steve also mentioned Prescription Solutions' seasonality. We saw favorability in the first quarter. So when you take all that into consideration, I think directionally the market appears to be looking at it correctly. We think it should be adjusted slightly, but I think the market recognizes the seasonal nature of the business.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. You mentioned the slowly strengthening pricing yields. Could you talk about what you saw in the competitive landscape in the risk business on January 1 renewals? And then any indications you have as some of the July 1 or midyear rate filings come out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think Gail's the best for that. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Good morning. First of all, in terms of the competitive landscape, we really haven't seen the competitive landscape change fundamentally over the last several quarters. So from our perspective it remains competitive but rational. We have some pockets of firming, and I've talked about those over the last several quarters, in the Northeast and Southeast. As we look at our premium yields, as we talked about again, we're pricing our new business to match our forward view of 2009 medical costs, and again that is a projected trend of 8% plus or minus 50 basis points. When I think about our yields, again we believe that our actions have had an impact as we cycle through our policy renewal dates.</p>
          <p>You might recall we took a number of actions back in 2008, including giving less credit on <mark type="inaudible" /> and buy-downs on premium and reducing our new business discounting, as well as holding the line on case-level renewals. So at this point we believe that our yield and our trend expectations are aligned. As Dan mentioned a few moments ago, we talked a little bit about the medical costs. We do &#x2013; are looking at the impact of potentially COBRA. However, we do believe that our full-year medical cost ratio of 84% plus or minus 50 basis points accounts for that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I just want to follow up with a question on health reform. And just &#x2013; I know it's early here &#x2013; but get your sense on the potential of that. We move forward with a public plan option included, and maybe just talk to the likelihood that that would include either commercial versus Medicare rates. And then also with Lewin Report that recently came out, and talk to do you think that those assumptions they made around potential migrations over to the public plan would seem reasonable to you guys and how you would adapt to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Scott, I'll perhaps start out. And then Simon Stevens, who really is dedicated to this area for us and heads up &#x2013; we call it the Center for Health Care Reform and Modernization &#x2013; will comment as well.</p>
          <p>There's obviously going to be a great deal of talk around a number of concepts and so forth around public plans over the next few months. The whole political process is kind engineered to bring forth a whole spectrum of ideas, of which one genre of that will be public plans. While there's a lot of activity around them, they're highly conceptual at the moment. And it is really not possible to assess them, because really it's so limited in terms of their detail.</p>
          <p>There are instances of that where you could see that there would be opportunities to participate in some broader way. But for the most part, our view is that the employer-based system will remain intact and that while there may be some efforts to bring some changes to it, the employer-based system should prevail in that regard and that a real public plan would be quite challenging on many levels and particularly in the provider community, if in fact it is based on Medicare kind of rates.</p>
          <p>Want to take it from there, Simon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So just picking up Steve's last point &#x2013; this is Simon Stevens. I think if the public plan were designed off the back of Medicare rates, then there would be very significant opposition from doctors and hospitals, because as Lewin pointed out, that would mean a 19% pay cut to doctors and a 29% reimbursement cut for hospitals. We, however, doubt that simply slashing provider unit prices without taking any approach to volumes or appropriateness or quality is an effective way of sustaining or getting more value out of the health care dollars the nation's currently spending.</p>
          <p>Of course there are lots of other possible public plan designs that don't entail the use of gov price controls on providers. But in that case, it's not obvious what the point of having a public plan is, as there are other effective ways of achieving those same aims, as Steve said in his opening remarks. If the aim is to reduce cost growth, then we've already shown how we can help large employers bend the trend. And the question is how do we get these techniques deployed more widely in government-run health programs too? And in addition, of course, the industry has also proposed a comprehensive set of changes to the individual insurance market that achieve the same universal access that the public plan is supposed to do.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And if I could just ask a follow-up, just around the PBM and earnings up 43% there year-over-year. Can you talk about which customer segments really drove that growth? And then just more strategically, just in the context of the news out of WellPoint selling their PBM to Express -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Was just asking about the PBM and then just strategically, just in the context of WellPoint selling their PBM, your views at this point in terms of keeping that internally and driving growth as compared to potentially realizing value through a spin-off to the stand-alone PBMs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, in terms of our PBM performance, we're obviously pleased with the first quarter performance. But I think it is largely driven by a real seasonal influx in terms of prescription refills as the year renews itself in the first quarter. Bill, do you want to comment further on that? Or Jackie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jackie. Hi. Let me just comment a tad on the first quarter results. We believe that they reflect growth in external sales, additional Part D and MAPD membership, and the insourcing of our Unis and Medicaid business. We continue to benefit from drug procurement and network contrasting improvements that also provide our clients with a high quality, affordable drug benefit. We're on track with our phased insourcing of specialty pharmacy fulfillment and the AmeriChoice businesses. At the same time, we're very carefully managing our operating expenses. The high demand we saw in our mail service facilities in January and throughout the first quarter reflects Part D and MAPD seasonality as members return to mail service facility.</p>
          <p>However, at the same time, we continue to see, quarter after quarter and year after year growth in both mail penetration and generic utilization. Although Prescription Solutions expects to have a strong performance in the second quarter, as Steve mentioned earlier, we anticipate a slight margin erosion over the first quarter, as historically script utilization overall and mail utilization in particular tends to decline quarterly in the Medicare book of business as members move into the coverage gap.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd only add, I want to make sure it's clear that we are seeing volume increases as a result of the additional business that Jackie just mentioned, but from a utilization perspective, we are seeing that utilization on a per member per script basis or a day's supply basis flat to slight down, so within expectations of what we had going into the year. So it's really driven &#x2013; the increase is really driven from volume.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Scott, in terms of the second part of your question, I would say that our performance is bearing out that our &#x2013; kind of our PBM and drug benefit strategies are performing exceptionally well and kind of playing out as we'd hoped. Medco serves much of our commercial benefit business. We retain really comprehensive control through UnitedHealthcare, and Medco continues to perform well. At the same time, Rx Solutions gives us a more integrated internal capability. We are serving both commercial and the public sector through Rx Solutions. It's sourcing all our specialty pharma, its capacities are scaling and growing quite nicely, its systems have been updated and really are now state of the art in terms of the market. Its generic penetration mail service continues to grow, and it's becoming an increasingly more meaningful contributor to our overall performance.</p>
          <p>So as the Medco contract nears a point of reconsideration, I think we'll be in an ideal position to consider a spectrum of alternatives that can meet our business needs and drive long-term value for our customers and our businesses. And we don't really see a compelling reason to alter that approach at this point in time. We don't think we're anywhere near that full potential in terms of our performance in the business on either platform.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. In the commercial business &#x2013; well, in the risk business obviously &#x2013; one of the things that would concern me, and I don't know if it's too early to tell yet, is that you're retaining members with higher-than-expected attrition. That's one thing clearly that's going to have a negative impact on the rest of the year. But in retaining the members you have, and in the customers that you're attracting, is there any sense of whether the employees who are keeping the insurance and enrolling in these plans are adversely selecting, not necessarily just United, but to keep insurance? And to what extent might that be reflected in your actuarial models? And then I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think that's the case at all. Actually I think the retention dynamic in our small group business in C are actually quite positive in terms of that, and the attrition is really straight out in terms of where that is occurring, although it is hitting us harder in the small group space. But, Gail, do you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Sheryl.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sheryl, a couple of points around your question. First, as we look at our book of business through the first quarter in particular, the actual employer retention was favorable. And as you noted, the attrition in the small group, which was really more heavily impacted by the economy, is where we saw that. But again, looking at risk pool statistics, we have not observed any noticeable change in our risk pool, and we do look at that and track it fairly closely. We've commented a couple times, we're going to watch the impact at COBRA potentially.</p>
          <p>But we do track age and sex factors to give us a perspective into the relative health of our customer base and how that's trending. I think we've talked about that over the last several quarters, and that has stayed very stable.</p>
          <p>On a case level, at the employer level, we incorporate risk scores also into that selection process, and those scores take into consideration health status indicators. And to give you a little bit of an example, that's utilization data, pharmacy data, treatment, diagnosis, and ultimately the prognosis, and those are all part of our underwriting process. So when we talk about risk scores, that's really what we're looking at, and that's what's remained fairly stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful. And this is an only somewhat related question. One of the concerns that I've had is that &#x2013; you've addressed a number of things on the customer relationship side &#x2013; would be on the provider relationship side. And I understand you're making some changes in personnel and the like, but especially in the hospital sector, with the surveys that have been done, while you improved from last year, there's still some, shall we say, difficult relationships that you have within the hospitals. To what extent do you think you'll be able to make progress on that? To be able to go into 2010, 2011, where we might have some health care reform with some stronger provider relationships that can perhaps enhance your product offering relative to a public plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would like to jump into this one and then I will give it to Gail. I actually think, as you point out, Sheryl, we have made a conscious effort to really strengthen our performance and our relationship across the board. We probably had the most work to do in the care provider community. And we have made a number of changes there. And they are perhaps the most far-reaching. And they are starting to have a real impact. And I would say the level of disruption that has occurred within our &#x2013; particularly our hospital base &#x2013; has really been very, very modest over the last year and a half as we have expanded in terms of our hospital networks.</p>
          <p>That being said, there's probably more for us to do on the provider relationship side than in any other area. And I couldn't agree with you more that it will serve our business very well to strengthen those relationships. But I think Gail's got a lot more specifics in terms of what we have done and what we are contemplating with respect to provider response.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sheryl, we have a couple of things that I want to point out to you to build upon Steve's comments. The first is, we made a significant, I think, focus and investment around our provider advocate program, which is really putting customer advocates, provider advocates in the field. And we've been rolling that out throughout 2008 and into 2009. And we are starting to see the impact of that. And that's specifically on the physician relationship. On the hospital side, we have been investing in a Lean process using Six Sigma to help our hospitals specifically improve their accounts receivable balances as well as our interface and relationship with them. And I think that's starting to have really positive input.</p>
          <p>So as Steve said, as we saw in member and customer turnaround on service &#x2013; and I think we've done a great job there &#x2013; we're starting to see that on the provider side. But we would agree that there's a bit of a longer tail. And we're going to begin to see the uptick in 2009. But those investments in service have been happening through 2008 and are continuing in 2009.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sheryl, I'd add that, as Gail has said over time, it's going to take time to improve relationships, and we've been focused on it for several years. Some of the challenges that we've had, as you've probably recognized, is some of the acquisitions and integrations that we've had. And as we move to integrate platforms, consolidate reimbursement policies, standardize contracts &#x2013; which I'm happy to say we've made significant progress with &#x2013; we believe that in addition to the stuff that Gail just mentioned, that you're going to see an uptick in our relationships with hospitals. And we're seeing it internally. It may not be out there in the surveys just yet, but we do believe going forward you're going to see a markedly improved relationship between providers in general, both physicians and facilities, with United.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The provider survey results did get less bad than last year, but there's &#x2013; as you suggest &#x2013; there's an awful lot of work to do. It's cultural, it's reputational, it's the hard part to fix. You had to do that with customer service, and I imagine you'll be able to figure out what to do for the providers. It's just not wonderful at the moment. Is that fair?</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just thought I could &#x2013; want some more clarification, and I know that I come across being academic. One of the earlier questioners asked you about the stock price; you said you wouldn't comment on valuation. I'd like to think you've made 32 million comments in the first quarter. I assume we're not buying back stock for practice, that we're buying back stock because we think it's undervalued. No response necessary, but I just make that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lee, I did comment &#x2013; I said I wouldn't, but then I did because we do believe that there is a meaningfully higher potential value in our shares, given our potential and given our performance in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. If I could ask &#x2013; the $700 million number that was mentioned by Mike, what is the financial condition of the holding company? Was that the $700 million in the holding company that you're referring to? Just really two financial questions. What is the financial condition of the holding company? And assuming everything was the same the balance of this year &#x2013; your earnings guidance didn't change, your stock price didn't change &#x2013; how do you think you would deploy the 5 billion cash flow in '09 between debt reduction, stock repurchase, acquisitions I guess you can't foretell, but some sense generally of how you intend to use that 5 billion? So those two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The corporate &#x2013; as we sit here today, we have about $1 billion of corporate cash. That differs from what we had at the end of the quarter. It's slightly down from the previous time period when we reported fourth quarter earnings. That's as a result of the significant debt repayment that we made, Lee, as you know -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; or probably know, in the first quarter, $900 million. And then the first quarter, when you look at our dividends that we get from the regulated entities, the first quarter is the lowest quarter. It's about 15% of the dividends overall. So we expect to ramp up dividends through the remainder of the year in due course as we always do at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>With respect to operating cash flow and deployment, just in broad base numbers, we expected to reduce our debt. We gave a target of 33 to 36%. Saved roughly a billion dollars of debt repayment. We do have CapEx of roughly $800 million. And we do need to leave cash in our regulated entities as a result of the growth of payables. Since we started with favorable cash position of roughly $800 million at the beginning of the year, when you net it all out it leaves you with around $3 billion. And if everything plays out the way it trends today, we would expect to be repurchasing shares for the remainder of the year at or around that amount.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I just wanted to come back to Medicare business quickly. So as you think about your 2010, let's just assume the status quo here that we get roughly 5% reduction in premiums and assume if your cost trend in that business is running 3, 4%, so you've got a pretty wide gap to fill there. How should we think about this? Or how do you approach as you think about the trade-off between margin maintenance and member retention? And what can you do in terms of maintaining the current all-in value that Medicare Advantage Senior would see in the product? I would presume we need to think about 2010 and some meaningful reduction in your margin view for that business at least. Is that kind of the right way to be thinking about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will have Larry respond to this, but I would say that if that were to play out, there are a number of areas that we've obviously thought about government funding levels of these programs over the years. We have positioned ourselves in that marketplace to orient ourselves to the more high-value versions of these offerings in the marketplace. We've also oriented ourselves to markets that we think are more sustainable long-term. And we're driving a lot of change in our business. Probably more in that business than any others in terms of really looking at what our long-term cost structure has to be and how we approach that business so that we can basically outperform straight private fee-for-service across the board. And we are headed in that direction.</p>
          <p>We would see certainly some pressure. But we also have a lot of levers to pull with respect to how we approach benefits, markets, how we approach medical cost management, operating costs and the like. And Larry Renfro, who heads that business up, and Tom Paul, who is his Chief Operating Officer, maybe you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I start out, John? It's Larry Renfro. You know it's early right now, as we all know. And we're working our way through this. The one thing that's good as we prepare the June 1 bid is the fact that Ovations has been through changing rate environments before. Obviously we have also a great diversity of products. And a lot of the things that Steve just said, we believe we'll be well positioned for 2010. We really can't go into the strategy today. I think you know that from the competitive nature of our bid. But we are looking at all the business levers; we believe we have them identified. And over the next few weeks, as we get closer to the bid process, we think we'll have this worked out. So I'll turn it over to Tom &#x2013; Tommy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think I have anything to add other than, again, as Larry said, we are carefully looking at all the levers that we have from a resource perspective to bring to bear both within Ovations and across the UHG enterprise through continuing to focus on the operating expense, medical management trends, and the benefits and premium and geography levers that we have to look at in our 2010 bid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess just one point I was thinking about: You're in a position, at least from our vantage point, you look like you're maybe a little better margin position in MA than some of the competition. And so you potentially have the ability to look at this as kind of a more of a two-year deal. That is, let's say it sticks the way it is right now with it down 5, you get a lot of that back in 2011. And are you kind of willing to kind of use that advantage you have to kind of take a little bigger hit in margins as you go into the 2010, kind of knowing that some of this comes back in the 2011. And it's almost kind of an advantage you might have in the marketplace in terms of just member retention and having to do less with the benefit package than others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Without going into our strategy, I would say we always look at what we're doing over a multi-year process, but today is not the time to talk about our strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But John, your fundamental point that there is pressure in the marketplace is correct. And we have to respond to that pressure. But I might also suggest to stand back and take a breath, because the whole positioning of our business here is not just on a single program but on all that we bring to that marketplace. So there are supplemental opportunities; there'll be more experimentation in the marketplace. And to your point about pressure, there will probably be more change and more growth opportunities in that marketplace.</p>
          <p>So appropriate in terms of taking the perspective of how this will play out over a couple of years, and the positioning of our business so that we could engage in a multi-year strategy to really drive long-term market positioning and performance is exactly the right zone to be in. And our other products and our other positioning play into that quite nicely. And there may actually be more opportunity in the marketplace than others are focusing on right now.</p>
