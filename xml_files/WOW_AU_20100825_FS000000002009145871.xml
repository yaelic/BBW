      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us for the full year profit results announcement for Woolies Limited. I'm very happy to announce after a strong decade of double-digit growth, including that bumper year of 2009 where all the moons aligned. We've had a tremendous team effort by the entire Woolies team to deliver another double digit growth in net profit after tax at 10.1%.</p>
          <p>And I must pay tribute to each and everyone of the 190,000 members of the team because they really did push hard, particularly when the headwinds of inflation, or deflation rather, and the lack of stimulus, and all the other macro-economic factors that we talked ad nauseam about, really made the challenge of delivering profitable results a whole new ballgame for many, in fact including Woolworths, over the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>I think this result in what was a tale of two halves, where we had a reasonable first half and a very challenging second half, is a tribute to the business model that we have. To have a time in the second half where we continued in a area of low and, in fact, in many cases negative inflation, to add to that and add to the challenge of fractionalizing costs and fractionalizing variable costs; to continue to invest in price in our major businesses, in our supermarkets in Australia and New Zealand, in our BIG W business and in our now Dan Murphy business and also in our Dick Smith business; to deliver the result without, I may say, without asking vendors to fund it.</p>
          <p>So the real investment that we made, a significant investment in price to drive volume in what was going to be a difficult time was done out of the profit numbers that you see here today and not rung out of our trading partners.</p>
          <p>I think the other important part is of course that we continue to focus not just on price and the shopping experience, but the many other values from customers choosing Woolworths brands as their place of choice to do their shopping with the Everyday Rewards program, range changes in many of our brands that have been significant, the ramp up of our exclusive brands and the enhanced shopping experience through our multiple refurbishments that we kept pretty much unabated throughout what was a challenging time. It would have been very easy to just turn the tap off completely, but we were very careful to make sure that we didn't stop capital. It was not part of our growth story going forward.</p>
          <p>Today, Tom will take you through our announcement of a $700 million off-market buy-back on top of our on-market buy-back, which topped out at 325 million in the first half. So that means, in addition to dividends, we are delivering an extra $1 billion to shareholders for the last financial year.</p>
          <p>On top of that we still remain, even after that, with a very strong balance sheet, strong cash flow and our credit ratings of A3 and A-minus are very much intact. And that enabled us to continue going forward, investing in our existing businesses, continue to consider capital management and also to consider growth options as well.</p>
          <p>I think the most important point that I want to make here is, we take a very long term view about our investment and our businesses. We're not interested in quick-fixes or a quick-buck. We are interested in investing in growing our shareholder value over the longer term.</p>
          <p>And if there's a rule within Woolies, it's about making sure that we do what the customer wants us to do rather than what we want to do. Very easy to become self absorbed in business and to do things that turn you on as opposed to what you are hearing from your customers about what they want you to do as their chosen retailer.</p>
          <p>The numbers are there and both the dollars and the percentages are very strong, backing up on a very strong number for the previous year, EBIT for the first time over $3 billion and net profit after tax for the first time over $2 billion.</p>
          <p>Some highlights for the year. There's no doubt that we are of the strong believe that we are the Fresh Food People and everything that we do in every store and every day is about delivering that embodification of the Fresh Food People.</p>
          <p>And in particular Greg and the senior team right through to store managers, both their focus and in fact their incentive alignment is all about making sure that we convince more and more people that are in our stores already, to buy more and more of our fresh food and we're making some really great ground there.</p>
          <p>Certainly basket penetration and fresh improved over the last year and despite challenges of deflation in most of those categories we had very, very strong volume increases in our fresh food over the past year. But we're not just presuming that what we've got at the moment is what we need, so we're working very hard with our suppliers to make sure that we get the right product and the right quality delivered in the first place. And thereafter that, we're making sure that we work very hard on delivering the product to store through our supply chain at the right level. We're making sure through our systems that we have, that we have the right amount of product to suit the rate of sales at store level and hence reduce greatly the amount of shrinkage that we have.</p>
          <p>And then through our test labs, we've been working very hard, not only on our products but taking samples from all our competing major retailers in the fresh area, to test, blond test, the quality that we have versus the others. But more importantly then to go back after day one, day two, day three, day four, to see how the quality, our quality stacks up against others after four days at home in the fridge or in ambient temperatures, depending on the product.</p>
          <p>And overarching all of that, as part of our continuing focus on making sure that we keep our businesses fresh, you may recall probably 24 months ago that I said, that 2010 meant 2010, and some 18 months out, we would start work on preparing for the next evolution of our stores. And so, over the last 18 months or probably close to 24 months, across many stores, across the nation we've been doing individual elements, not all in one store, of the things that we one, heard from the customers they'd like to see a bit more &#x2013; also, we've had guys and girls traveling the length and breadth of the globe looking up what's winning around the world and seeing whether it actually was something that could come to Australia.</p>
          <p>And so, we brought all of those together in our first refurb at Caringbah, which is just south of the city for those that are not from New South Wales. And tomorrow we open our first new store which has actually moved on a little bit since Caringbah, at Charlestown in Newcastle. So either of those, if they're nearby, I anticipate that you'd get a lot out of visiting and if you'd like to have a visit with one of the Woolies executives, so that they can give you a better insight into what's happening, we're more than happy to give you that opportunity. So fresh remains a big part of what we're doing.</p>
          <p>We've continued to drive prices down and you can see the numbers there. And it's actually a very deliberate strategy. And as I said earlier, in all of our businesses this is a Woolworths funded strategy because we actually believe in doing it and delivering a profit at the same time. And more importantly, we're very proud to publish our most frequently purchased prices in our supermarkets on our website and we do get quite a bit of visitation, no doubt, a lot from some of our competitors from time to time, and individual prices for our 823 supermarkets at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Of course, on top of that we have continuing growth in our EDR program, both with understanding our customers in a richer way and making far more informed decisions. Our wonderful petrol offer in our supermarkets are $0.04 a litre, still remains a very strong driver of our business and of course targeted promotions. And we've now got &#x2013; we're closing in on 3 million people that are linked to the Qantas Frequent Flyer program.</p>
          <p>BIG W is all about brands that people know and love, quality brands at BIG W prices. So we have maintained both the quality and a price leadership on both the entry price items and also on the key image items against our direct competitors of about 10% across the basket, hasn't changed. But what we have, of course, is brands that people know and love. And there's a couple there, Bonds and Mambo, but of course, we've got Sony and Apple and Sanyo and a lot of others that we have within our business.</p>
          <p>Many people may not know that BIG W is actually the biggest retailer of iPods in the country. Also you see here with the shirts, this is our entry price level. It is the best quality T and also the best price in the market place and that will always continue to be the same.</p>
          <p>The volumes on all of our image items and entry price items, whilst the overall sales dollars are down, the volumes are up dramatically, but entry price Ts that were say $10 are around about $7 at the moment, so the Aussie dollar has obviously had quite an effect on the retail price.</p>
          <p>I think the other thing that I'm very happy about is the number of categories such as footwear, has had outstanding growth over the past 12 months, the online offer is off to a great start but a lot more work to be done.</p>
          <p>And more importantly, in terms of profit and sales over the last three years on an compound annual growth rate, we've really outperformed the market place and we've come over the last little while from third in revenue, now to be the number one both department and discount department store business.</p>
          <p>The formats continue and we've talked about 2015 marketplace or market store. We've got 50% of our stores in our 2010 and they continue to perform really well, 55% of the BIG Ws in the new format and around 42% of the consumer electronic stores in new format.</p>
          <p>In New Zealand, we now have approaching 70%, we're probably actually past 70% now, of the stores that are now in the new format and also rebounded as Countdown, they continue to have a tremendous effect there.</p>
          <p>Probably of interest to the assembled here, is in fact Quantum, which is an initiative that we launched in the second half and we'll ask Ramnik Narsey, who for many years ran the most successful, the most efficient, and the most profitable petrol retailing business, that's our business, to head up Quantum. I'm happy to welcome James into the seat and he's got big shoes to fill but I'm sure he's up to it. But we are going to be focusing on all parts of our business here. So this is very much akin to Project Refresh line and then Mercury. We are taking this to another level and we've already got several key initiatives that have commenced.</p>
          <p>And we believe that in &#x2013; well not only believe but we are targeting significant cost of doing business and cost of goods sold benefits over the next five years and each half we'll update the market on our achievements in that regard. But we're off to a great start, and I'm delighted with the way that the business has once again embraced change in a large way.</p>
          <p>In our financial services, amongst our innovative customer offerings, our Everyday Money credit card continues to grow each week in membership and now won five industry awards and got the top CANNEX rating. We launched the Everyday Money prepaid MasterCard in June and that's off to a great start and a little bit later, we're going to have the reloadable prepaid MasterCard to launch. And there'll be a few other products that will come in the next 12 months as well. So, we're heading in the right direction there.</p>
          <p>Our exclusive have been a major focus for us over the last number of years, particularly in the last 12 months, with the installation of our Century test lab. Over the year, the exclusive brands grew faster than branded products. Our largest brand, Home Brand is being repositioned, so we are focusing very much on making sure what's in the box or the can is equal to or better than any other offering in the marketplace. Then we're repositioning the brand through packaging and there's an element there with the cheese rings.</p>
          <p>Our initial results have been surprisingly good for us. So muesli bars, Greg, what was the uptake on that one, Home Brand muesli bars?</p>

          <p>There has been enormous uplift, Michael, so basically the product went from 10% share to 25% share.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Probably after Home Brand, the brand that I think has been the most successful in its uptake has been Macro Wholefood Markets. We've been astounded at the sales results of this product and we see wonderful opportunities in fresh and in ambient to expand this brand in as many categories that it's not already in. And it's just been a fantastic investment in buying that brand but more particularly reformulating a lot of the products and repackaging and they've had tremendous acceptance from customers.</p>
          <p>In Liquor, we continue to have great benefits from our exclusive brands and wine in particular has been double digit growth and won a number of medals in various wine shows nationally.</p>
          <p>Some commentary from time to time in reports that are put out by the industry suggests that the supply chain within Woolworths has rung out every last dollar. Last year, the guys did a fantastic job and improved again so all of our metrics in terms of cost per carton, delivery on time, delivery accuracy, safety, et cetera, et cetera, Geoff and the team did a sensational job and they're planning to do even better going forward, particularly as part of Quantum.</p>
          <p>We continue to reinvest, so in terms of infrastructure, you can see a photograph there of the new national distribution center that's being built, being extended and built and refurbished in Auckland. We successfully commissioned the Brisbane Liquor DC in the last quarter. We've invested in Sydney and Melbourne national distribution centers that were original DCs of ours, both about 20 years old. And we've put new technology in there and in the case of Melbourne for instance, we've lifted the capacity of that shed without extending it by some 40%. And we're seeing already tremendous benefits there.</p>
          <p>The third BIG W facility is actually started to be built in Hoxton Park, and we expect that to be completed in FY12. Our global sourcing numbers increased, direct sourcing that is, by 70% over the past year and we've also expanded that reach into countries that we hadn't been in before.</p>
          <p>I think the most important one of course is that first point which is what we term a New Generation Replenishment. So there's no doubt when we look at AutostockR and Stocksmart and our transport management system et cetera, et cetera, they have been amazingly successful, and put it at the forefront not only of the industry here but we know by our visitors that have come to have a look, we're at the forefront of the world.</p>
          <p>But thinking that's the end of the world and there's nothing more to do is the wrong strategy, so we've got a team that are actually working on the next iteration of this New Generation Replenishment, which we have a strong belief will continue to actually add further efficiency gains to our business going forward. So we're pretty excited about New Generation Replenishment.</p>
          <p>New Zealand supermarkets, we weathered quite a bit of criticism in the early years as we set out to change this business, and no doubt, we'll be wearing some criticism about consumer electronics during the questioning and answer period a little bit later. We're very much focused on making sure, if we think we've got the right plan and we've got the right outcome and in the long term we're right, we're prepared to take a hit which we did in New Zealand, because we strongly believe we're on the right track.</p>
          <p>We also believe we're on the right track in consumer electronics. Others may disagree but that's where we are and this is really a testament to two things. One, a belief in making sure you've got a strong long term plan and secondly, making sure you've got a great team to implement it. So the New Zealand team under Peter Smith have been fantastic. Open heart surgery, well they walked around, but we knew what we wanted to achieve, we've invested in price, the new formats are working really well.</p>
          <p>In a zero inflation or close to zero inflation they had tremendous volume gains last year, tremendous market share gains and whilst the market was actually negative, we had strong positive sales for the year and they're real sales. A big focus on fresh as in Australia and obviously the systems that we have, have greatly helped us reinvest in price particularly reducing our shrinkage and other costs within the business.</p>
          <p>Home improvement, once again this is now &#x2013; yesterday was the 12 months anniversary of our announcement and we're progressing actually ahead of where I thought we may be. So we said at the announcement, we wanted to have 150 sites by the end of five years. After 12 months and one day, we're at the half way mark and what I can say is those sites are really, really good sites. So I've visited many of them and I know many of them due to my experiences in other parts of the business, and they are really terrific sites.</p>
          <p>We completed the Danks integration, and Graeme here today &#x2013; and the integration is started and what we're seeing has been benefits that are starting to flow through not only to Danks but also to their customers, and they're certainly enjoying that.</p>
          <p>All the store design, the layouts et cetera, are all in place. So clearly having &#x2013; I think a lot of people think this is start up business and put risk attached to that. But this is actually no different to Costco coming to Australia or Aldi coming to Australia. We're picking up a tried and true successful format and we're bringing it along with its owner to this country.</p>
          <p>The benefit they've got, of course, is they've got a local strong partner. And there is no doubt we have got absolute confidence this is going to be a success and it's going to be a long term driver of value for our Company.</p>
          <p>The supply chain strategy is developed. We've secured the two national distribution centers that will service our business going forward over the next couple of years. The IT systems are pretty much underway leveraging the Lowe's and all of our negotiations with our vendors both domestic and international are progressing really, really well. And it's been of interest to see that a couple of Lowe's top vendors have actually made some investment in our country in buying some local businesses which we think should be to our advantage.</p>
          <p>Online shopping is certainly a way forward for us and we continue to invest in that. BIG W, we launched in May. A little bit later, we're going to migrate the Dick Smith offering onto the new platform that we've got BIG W on and then we've got Dick Smith hot on its heals. So Dick Smith hopefully in the next calendar year will be operating at full speed. The online sales obviously were very strong for the past year. I will say also in food, I think, that &#x2013; has it doubled or tripled? What's happened? Well over doubled, but the running rate right at the moment is significantly higher than we were a year ago and we're making money which is more important.</p>
          <p>Corporate responsibilities, so this is not all about profit. We've continued to invest in our place in the community and green stores, we've now got 51 of them and they're working particularly well. We've got a new technology tool that enables us to very closely monitor and measure and compare every one of our businesses, individual stores and DCs, et cetera, both our carbon and our waste load and that's certainly been a great tool for us.</p>
          <p>Ethical Sourcing Policy is being implemented. We've made strong community support in the four key areas and one that I really want to say that we've got fantastic community response from has been our Fresh Food Kids' Grant which is obviously an unconditional offer to support a healthy lifestyle for our kids. And whilst it may not be of interest to people here, we're very much focused on making sure we have a safer workplace and shopping environment for our customers. We've had tremendous improvement over the last four years. Last year, we had another 34% improvement. We're now actually at the same level as what we can identify as the best in the world. But our goal is to become the best in the world and we've challenged ourselves to actually have another significant reduction in the coming year.</p>
          <p>And of course, people are first, but in the longer term, it means our cost of that comes down dramatically as we move through. So it has a dual benefit. Of course, the human benefit is the one that we're really focusing on.</p>
          <p>The report card since 2002, given the challenges of the second half we've got to give ourselves a circle rather than a tick on the 4.8 for the low &#x2013; sorry, the upper single digits for sales. EBIT out performing sales growth, we give ourselves a tick. A lower double digit impact growth, we give ourselves a tick. And EPS, not quite a tick but clearly if we factor in the off market buy into that number it will probably change so that it may just get ahead, I think, depending on the price that we buy them at, of course.</p>
          <p>And CODB, once we take out hotels and petrol, we once again, had a 20 basis points plus reduction. EBIT was again strong and I just want to point out the wonderful continued performance of our supermarket group underpinning that. Profit after tax, as we mentioned earlier, another strong result. CODB, after we take out, was 21 basis points, as I mentioned before. And just doing a quick calculation on 2005 to 2010, if we hadn't have changed anything then we would have spent or lost about $400 million worth of EBIT as a result of not doing anything.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margin, and I think this is a fantastic result because we have literally invested hundreds of millions of dollars across all of our businesses in better prices and not asked our vendors to actually fund it. But we've delivered once again a better gross margin and clearly our work on shrinkage to our systems, our direct sourcing, our private label program, working on changing sales mixes, et cetera, have enabled us to do both. And I know that some cynics may think that perhaps it's the vendors that have been funding this. I can tell you and put my hand on my heart, that that's not the case. We've actually done it on our own.</p>
          <p>Dividends per share, as we saw on the earlier slide, the final dividend was $0.62. The dividend payout ratio which has been hovering around 70% was just a little bit higher at 70.4%.</p>
          <p>Now to the individual businesses, the supermarket I think was just a great result. Once again, I'll just mention to you with the CODB, that when you back petrol out of that, we actually had better than 20 basis points CODB reduction. The second half I thought was an outstanding result for Greg in costs. Considering the fact that we went from inflation to deflation basically at Christmas we had EBA increases and we had energy costs going up et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So the variable cost was going to be a challenge but the productivity gains that the guys got right across the business were just outstanding. You know, over the last three years $6.8 billion have gone into this business. And I think the important thing is the momentum continues so the market share growth where we grew at $1.7 billion, nearest to that was 1.2. We grew market share, we outgrew the market last year, month after month after month after month and it appears that we're heading in the same direction this year.</p>
          <p>When we look at the fresh we've made some gains from what was a very high level. What we have seen in some others is it actually got back what they lost in fresh to specialists. You can see the switch around happening there. We're seeing that in groceries that perhaps the German retailer has gained some, one of our retailers has actually given back some of that growth back to our major competitor.</p>
          <p>Petrol &#x2013; another outstanding result. $1.241 was the weighted average price for this year. $1.275 last year so all the challenges of fractionalizing et cetera, and the challenges of having around 50 million litres in the ground as prices go up and down you've got to revalue stock on hand and manage that. There's always a challenge. But our volumes increased comparably 0.7 in a falling market so we gained market share. Once again, I think we can now claim that we're not equal number one. I think we're actually number one in fuel now.</p>
          <p>And you can see the sales were down but clearly our volume comparably was up and obviously we added some new stores as well, during the year. Our EBIT margins in a really tough year to do it, increased to 1.8% and obviously our EBIT per litre was just slightly up at $0.021 a litre. So a great effort there.</p>
          <p>Liquor, once again we had sales for the year of 5.6 billion up 7.7% and we've grown market share again. So we've grown market share dollar wise faster than anybody else again because we're double the nearest competitor. And percentage wise, I think we just had our nose in front for the year. So dollar wise we're terrific.</p>
          <p>We actually had to take our foot off the pedal in the first quarter because as we opened the doors on 1 July suddenly our WET tax arrangements were changed so we had to put those in place and what I can say is despite that, liquor division delivered great sales on virtually deflation for most of the year, a very competitive marketplace but delivered their profit above their target of profit for the year.</p>
          <p>So there was a bit of a wobbly toss to us when our WET arrangements were taken away and we had to recover that pretty quickly and the guys did a fantastic job. There's no doubt that the investment in the DCs and the investment on taking a lot of stock of others into liquor has been fantastic. There's a great example there with Dan Murphy's. So we opened 18 Dan Murphy's last year. We used not one extra dollar of working capital on Dan Murphy's to open those. Not one extra dollar. It shows you the power of having the right replenishment capability.</p>
          <p>New Zealand, I won't go on about what's happening here but clearly it was just an outstanding result to be up 19% in NZ dollars for EBIT for the year. Peter and the team have just done a tremendous job there and that trend is continuing on into the early part of this financial year.</p>
          <p>BIG W once again, I think this was a terrific result in achieving basically the same profit on less sales in the previous year and it was done in a time where because of the Aussie dollar and our reflection of a higher Aussie dollar and lower prices on the shelf, our volumes in the past year in our key items that most of them are imported, were up dramatically.</p>
          <p>So that meant we had to work really, really hard on the efficiency of our business to make sure that we actually got the profit because there were no free kicks from even just keeping pace with price. We actually had to absorb all the cost increases with labor et cetera, through productivity and the guys have done a fantastic job in doing that.</p>
          <p>We had tremendous improvements in margin mix. So footwear for instance, as I mentioned earlier, has been a tremendous addition there and our soft goods have performed really well over the past year. The areas that have been a little challenging have been in fact elements of consumer electronics, particularly the gaming area where we sold literally tens of thousands gaming consoles the year before and it's somewhat subdued this year. But this business has set itself up for the future in a very strong way. The addition of brands like Morrissey and Mambo and others really have set us apart from our competitors.</p>
          <p>Consumer electronics, this was a tale of two halves. The first half you might recall we had a fantastic profit result. The world changed at Christmas and we had a decision to make and one was do we back off on our price strategy and that was not to take a backward step and make sure we got every sale. We decided not to back off.</p>
          <p>We also were getting great sales results and good EBIT results out of the stores that we refurbished and I think for the whole year including those that had cycled over a year, we had a 15% increase in sales for those stores that we'd reformatted. But also in addition they had a reasonable EBIT from them. But our existing stores that hadn't been reformatted really got hit because most of, a great deal of sales actually moved into big ticket items that were being obviously sold at very keen prices across the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So we had two decisions to make &#x2013; stay with it and recalibrate and continue on with our strategy or step back and let the sales slowdown and then finish the year with a whole heap of stock that really we would have to clear because it would be not fresh stock. So we finished the year with fresh stock which is great.</p>
          <p>We're not happy about the fact that we ended up with a slight loss for the half but I can tell you we're now trading profitably again within Dick Smith so we're comfortable and we're going to continue on with where we're going. Our online business at Dick Smith is going really well. Our in home service had great growth. I might point you to one number here where we've just added in something because we changed the accounting basis in Dick Smith for rebates, particularly advertising rebates. We had a bit of a typo so we have to write over it. You can see it up there, 24.13.</p>
          <p>So rebates used to go into costs of doing business up until last year as a contra. We've moved them as we have in other parts of the Woolworths business, into gross margin and obviously that has the effect year-on-year unless you do a comparison of lifting gross margin and lifting a CODB at the same time. So just to give you a true comparison we've restated the change. So the actual change in gross margin was a decrease of nine basis points year-on-year. Sorry, decrease of 149 was the restated one, rather than nine. So that really indicates where we've invested in price.</p>
          <p>The CODB notionally went up 153 basis points. It actually went up 13 basis points because of that number that we've moved from one to the other. So we've got work to do here but like New Zealand, what we're seeing in the stores that we've refurbished and reformatted gives us heart that we're on the right track. Now, we've actually changed the nature of this business tremendously.</p>
          <p>A couple of years back we sold virtually no TVs, a few CRTs and we sold no computers. Last year we sold close on &#x2013; almost 280,000 odd flat screen TVs in Dick Smith from basically a standard start at a couple of years, and we sold a quarter of a million computers. So we're managing that margin mix as we go forward but we're now establishing that volume, it gives us a great place to go back as we are renegotiating our cost price going forward on those big ticket items. Because clearly, others have had a bit of an advantage and used that in the last half to drive some pretty keen prices but we think that we've now got a good argument to ask for a better price. In India, great news. We continue to grow that business. We had a profit of $1.3 million against a loss of the previous year and we've now grown to 50 stores and things are working really well.</p>
          <p>The hotel industry had a tough time last year with changes in trading hours in Queensland and changes to some other metrics in Victoria and what we can say is that we're probably one of the few hotel groups that actually made money last year and we continue to make good money although not as good money as we made the previous years. But what we are now seeing is that as a number of them are starting to fall away and the banks are starting to put them on the market for sale, although there are not too many takers at the price they want at the moment, we're starting to see the well run pubs starting to pick up. So our gaming comps in particular in this early part of the year have returned to some positive territory which is fantastic.</p>
          <p>We're certainly looking forward to the 2012 changes in Victoria because that will have a beneficial and material effect on the profitability of our hotel chain going forward.</p>
          <p>I'll hand over to Tom now to take you through some of the other numbers. Thanks, Tom.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. I'll just go through some of the elements of the balance sheet and the cash flow. In relation to inventory, inventory was up about 4.4% and sales were up about 4.8, so we had reasonably strong inventory controls for the period, and I'll take you through that a bit more.</p>
          <p>In terms of working capital, we're about 2.3 billion negative. We were about 2.4 billion last year, so continued strong negative working capital. CapEx has really just increased, fixed assets and investments have really just increased because of CapEx spend, offset by depreciation. And our net repayable debt has actually increased 529 million, primarily through CapEx and the on-market buyback. So we've got to continue to have a nice strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In relation to cash flow, we've got some timing differences here which I've attempted to very clearly enunciate. The cash provided from operating activities was up 6% versus the EBITDA of 9.4. There were three items. There were some receivables that we didn't collect at year end which we've collected in July. There was some increase in prepaid occupancy in June. And in terms of tax paid, our installment rate this year was quite high and we expect a refund during the following year. So in essence we've just overpaid our tax for the year based on the way the tax office calculates its installment rates for us. In terms of CapEx, we spent $1.8 billion and in terms of cash flow as a percentage of profit, we're about 39% compared to 43 last year.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, really I just put this in for your information. It really shows the strength of our business over a five-year period where cash from operating activities is very close to our EBITDA growth. In terms of inventory, we're at 33 days, same as last year. As we mentioned before, inventory levels have been impacted by the level of imported inventory because we take ownership of that earlier compared to buying off a supplier here. Over the last couple years we've been increasing the stock in our liquor distribution centers, and that has also had an impact on the level of stocks we've had. So despite that we've held it at 33 days ,which is a good outcome.</p>
          <p>That graph there is on average inventory. If you look at spot inventory from one close to the other close, we're actually down 1.2 days excluding petrol.</p>
          <p>Shareholder payouts, 2002 to 2010, we returned about $8.2 billion in capital to our shareholders. I think it's interesting to note that between 2006 and 2010, we've doubled our profit to $2 billion. Our shareholder returns are up by 250%. If you just look at the relative numbers between 2006 and 2010, the 1.8 billion or 1.7 billion in 2010 doesn't include the $700 million off-market buyback that we're about to undertake. So 2010 is going to be a very good year for shareholders and the returns that they're going to get.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital management, most of you know how we manage our capital. We minimize our weighted average cost of capital. We retain flexibility for growth to invest in our businesses, to take advantage of opportunities as they arise, but we also do it to maintain our credit ratings. Within those constraints, we announced the $700 million off-market buyback, so that's going to be a $1 billion of capital return by buybacks in this year. We'll finance the off-market buyback by refinancing of long-term debt as part of our normal refinancing program. And the only maturity we have, as you know, is a $350 million medium-term note that's coming up and we will refinance that shortly.</p>
          <p>In terms of buyback features, there are two pages here in the pack but there's also a separate announcement that has gone out with a lot more detail, but a couple of the key pertinent points, $700 million, about 2.4% of Woolworths capital. The tender discount range is about 8 to 14%, and the capital component is $3.08.</p>
          <p>In terms of timetable, the mailing of the documents will happen on the 17th of September. The tender opens on the 20th and closes on the 8th and cash proceeds will be delivered on Monday, the 18th of October.</p>
          <p>In terms of returns on funds employed, we're about 31%, slightly down on last year. But given our continued investment in the business and the returns we achieved, that's a very good outcome. I think there are a couple of things in ROFE I'd just like to point out. In terms of supermarkets ROFE which is the core of our business, that has increased from about 64% to 77%. In 2006 it was 64%, so it's a nice, steady increase. The key with this measure as you understand, this is an accounting measure. It is not an economic measure, and we just need to keep that in mind. But over the last three years, funds employed in supermarkets have increased by 1.1 billion. That's the increment, and incremental EBIT has increased about 900 million.</p>
          <p>Over the last three years CapEx has increased $2.6 billion or invested $2.6 billion in the supermarkets business, and the incremental EBIT over CapEx is about 36%. So that supermarket &#x2013; that food and liquor business really knows how to generate returns from the investment that we've put into it. In terms of return on equity, 28.1% and that will get a kick along when we do our $700 million buyback.</p>
          <p>Thanks, Mike.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the next two pages are not unknown to most people in the room. I just wanted to reinforce a couple of things. The first one is in that first line. But we very much think about the longer term and sustainable results for our shareholders and for our customers. And our clearly stated long-term performance targets remain unchanged and likewise our clear capital management objectives are making sure that we had the right balance of security, of returning value to our shareholders and also having options for growth, both organically and then through acquisition, are very much part of our disciplined approach to managing all the elements of the balance sheet and those things that surround it.</p>
          <p>In terms of the key growth initiatives, the boxes remain the same. I'd add in the words that are continuing to reinvigorate our offer in that top range box. Part of that new price range merchandising quality of course is the formats in which they sit and we're doing that in a way that is a lot smarter, particularly through our enhanced customer engagement strategy, which sits in that box down in the middle left-hand side of the screen. Clearly all of the others are there and we're very much focused on building long-term sustainable business and shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Our outlook for the year is that we expect net profit after tax for the financial year to grow between plus 8 and plus 11% and the guidance is subject to the extent of the following consumer confidence levels, inflation, interest rates and the broader global economic conditions.</p>
          <p>So, with that, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to open the floor for questions to Tom, myself, or if need be we'll pass through to our senior executives as well.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Michael, Andrew McLennan from CBA Equities. Just on that caveat if you like for your guidance. Last time you spoke in front of us you mentioned that you were concerned about the economic outlook and weren't anticipating a turnaround until possibly the end of this calendar year. Have you changed that view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think when you look at the macroeconomic factors, there is no doubt both the direct stimulus payments and the indirect &#x2013; so we had the small business investment rebates. We had the various other consumer and educational investment along with the direct, we saw in all of our businesses very strong comp sales right through that first half, until about November when we hit the anniversary, which was December the 8 of the first big one.</p>
          <p>So I would suggest that we're gradually going to see over the next &#x2013; and through till the end of November an improvement. There's no tap to be turned on because we're still flowing over a lot of excess money. From December on, there'll be two things; we'll be in clear air in terms of additional money in households, but also we will have cycled across the switch from inflation, which was running at say four down to flat and negative, so those two will become like-for-like.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of inflation for July, take cigarettes out, food and groceries was pretty much flat again, just slightly negative. However, we're seeing our cost inflation was a little higher than that so we've actually held back on passing through a lot of cost increases. So in dairy products, we're seeing some cost increases. There's no doubt with the Russian announcement around wheat that wheat and other grains globally will go up and as will animal food. Sugar continues to have increases and of course there'll be the flow on effect of particularly utility costs, electricity in particular that will flow into the area.</p>
          <p>The unknown of course is what happens to the Aussie dollar so clearly if the Aussie dollar takes $0.10 the wrong way then you're going to see some pretty hefty inflation in general merchandise. So those are the unknowns.</p>
          <p>It was really, really tough when we hit those unchartered waters to try and ascertain what the effect on sales would be. It would be fair to say when we looked back on that last half and even as we're looking forward through to November, we greatly underestimated the effect of those various elements in our sales numbers the year before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of what we should anticipate within the food and liquor division over the next 12 months, we should be anticipating a similar year to what we've seen last year in terms of most of the growth coming out of gross margin as opposed to CODB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well actually, the CODB, you've just got to remember that it shows two basis points because it's actually got the petrol in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Take the petrol out and it actually came from both so we had a really good reduction in CODB. In the second half we had a fantastic reduction in CODB through some tremendous changes that Greg has put into the business and they will continue on. But in terms of sales, it will be a tale of two halves again, there's no doubt about that, for the whole industry. And the market data that I'm seeing suggests that July and the early part of August has really been just a continuation of what we saw in that fourth quarter for just about all the businesses that I can measure.</p>
          <p>The only one that &#x2013; the two in our business that are ticking up a bit, consumer electronics is off to a reasonably good start in this part of the year, a bit of a pay back to our pricing position so there's bright lights there. That's certainly helped us return to profitability. And the second one is New Zealand. It just continues to power on. Each week we deliver &#x2013; not quite each week &#x2013; but a new refurb and bang off they go.</p>
          <p>So those two businesses &#x2013; but the rest of us are pretty &#x2013; you think about what we saw in the fourth quarter. That's what we've seen in the early days. I would say it'll gradually come up to December the 8 and December the 8 we're in clear air again. But what's going to happen with inflation, the Aussie dollar, who knows? Shaun.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Shaun Cousins, JPMorgan. Just in terms of Quantum, if we think back Project Refresh saw your EBIT margins in &#x2013; across your Group but particularly Australian food and liquor expand materially. When you think about the benefit of Quantum, is that going to sustain EBIT margins that you've got across your businesses, particularly food and liquid which are quite high, or is this actually going to be a catalyst for further EBIT margin expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've said and it's on the page there that we anticipate both in cost of goods sold and cost of doing business that we will generate value and we'll share that as we see fit at the time between delivering greater value to our customers.</p>
          <p>So we'll continue as we see fit to deliver further price competitive pressure or we'll flow it through to the bottom-line, which is what we did quite frankly during Project Refresh and then Project Mercury after that and now we're into the Quantum initiative. And they are of &#x2013; they're similar ilk. But we're now perhaps really tackling the things that we thought that we might aspire to during Project Refresh but were to put to one side, but they are things of great value that we can see and touch and feel and we're going after them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to be clear, that means that we shouldn't anticipate that your food and liquor EBIT margins are tapped out and that they won't be able to expand further from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess we'll see as we &#x2013; the answer remains the same every time it did last half. We'll make the decision. If we think it's the right thing to do in the marketplace to invest in price at that particular time we will and we thought the last half it was really important that we did that. We established a lead against our competitor and we've maintained that lead in terms of the basket price. We're not going to let that go, I'll tell you that now, like in BIG W. There was a challenge there but we've maintained the gap of about 10% on the basket of all the image and important like-for-like lines against their major competitor.</p>
          <p>We're making a statement that we are the biggest and we're going to be the leader in a number of areas and we're not going to be &#x2013; have someone else lead us on price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Dick Smith, I mean that's a business that's had some troubles here. Do you still anticipate &#x2013; do you still think you can be the number one player there? Because if we think about the trading environment you had in the last six months, JB Hi-Fi were able to expand their margins, Dick Smith goes to loss making. Do you think you've actually got &#x2013; I guess the footprint, the people, the business there that's actually going to be a market leader as you aspired to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm very comfortable we've got the people. Time will tell when and if we get to number one. What I can say is that Woolworths is actually number one, because when &#x2013; we've got a significant business in BIG W. BIG W sold, I don't know, a couple hundred thousand, 180,000 flat screen TVs. It's the number one iPod seller in the country. Put those businesses together, we actually are the biggest consumer electronics business in the country by quite a margin.</p>
          <p>So we just need to focus on our strategy in Dick Smith and Debra understands exactly what we've got to deliver, but we're still seeing great customer response to the new formats. But I'd have to say that the thing that gives me most heart has been the response to our online business, which has been remarkably strong. I think five or 10 years from now when we look back, it'll be our online offer that I think will be the star attraction within the Dick Smith group, as we've seen with the Dixons and Currys group for instance in the UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Across the business, gross margin expansion was the same I think in most all of your businesses. How much of that is attributable to the overseas sourcing that you've been able to do and how far along are you on that I guess journey, but it's actually improved your offshore sourcing? Because ultimately could we see this being a continued driver of future gross margin expansion as you improve your sourcing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, look we had great growth last year, 70% increase in volumes of products that we used to source from agents and now we're going direct to the factory. As we've discussed before, we typically get a different product that's better spec. That doesn't mean that we're abandoning brands that customers really love, so there are &#x2013; like Bonds. We're sticking with Pacific Brands because it's a fantastic brand and does tremendous volumes within our business. I think we're probably number one with Pac Brands. But is there upside? Absolutely, absolutely. And the guys have been given &#x2013; I've asked them for some challenging targets to achieve in this coming year and they've all got plans in place to achieve that, so they did really well last year but we're upping the ante.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Philip Parker, Parker Asset Management. Just picking up on that last question, vis-&#xE0;-vis Dick Smith. How are you actually going to engage your staff to really start to promote that business to their customers in the way that that yellow and black label seemed to be doing it? Because that's a &#x2013; perceived or otherwise, it's a key differentiation between the two groups.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're investing a heck of a lot in selling techniques, so we've got training programs that are happening as we speak across the nation, particularly in positive selling techniques. So there's no doubt that most people like to go to Dick Smith to get &#x2013; find out which is the right product to buy. What we haven't been good at till recently has been &#x2013; and I'll get this ready for you to take today Sir &#x2013; it's that last sentence that we need to really work on. And the sales result in those new stores where we refurbish, we reformat and we do the retraining, we changed the incentive program, we start seeing a different outcome there, but we've got a way to go. We've only got 40% of the done list. We've still got the rump &#x2013; the largest rump of them to do. But all credit to those that do well. The guys at JB Hi-Fi are fantastic retailers. They do a great job and there's a lot to learn from them.</p>

          <p>I think I mentioned before. What we're seeing across our business is pretty much the continuation of what we saw in the last quarter except in New Zealand, where we've probably strengthened a bit and consumer electronics where we strengthened a little bit.</p>

          <p>Greg Dring from Macquarie, just two quick questions. Customer engagement, we always saw your commitment to that as being quite unique and differentiated in Australia. So <mark type="inaudible" /> has gone, the whole customer engagement thing seems to be sitting at the side. So my question to you is are you tendering for resources from Dunnhumby?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you bringing more people in? What are your expectations about what this capability's going to do for your business and how might we see that impact your earnings?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are about six streams &#x2013; actually there are six distinct streams of value that we've identified. There are only probably two that are public and one's the direct marketing and another one is obviously decision support, but we've identified another four or five from talking to other retailers around the world and we're working very hard on that.</p>
          <p>We've made appointments in that particular area. What we have done is split up some of the things that were under customer engagement, so financial services, as you're probably aware, has gone to Tom and to Dhun Karai. The online development has gone to Dan. And the insurance and what's the other one &#x2013; the telephone, telephony has gone through to Martin, who reports through to Tom. So no less focus whatsoever, it's just a little less obvious to everybody, but I can tell you that work has continued unabated.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't. We had the assistance and have the continued assistance of another group and we can call on them at any time. But I'd have to say we've also been very lucky to have some really great relationships with other retailers that have been very helpful as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So just a second one from me, you bought up maybe half a dozen of these Fresh and Easy stores in New Zealand. You're buying them in areas where you're coming up against the New World. That's obviously contributing to growth. I'm just wondering how big the opportunity is for that network expansion from that source?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's &#x2013; Murray, 25 or so is there Fresh and Easy's? Six yes and they were &#x2013; they'll actually be in this year rather than last year. So we were supplying them on a wholesale basis anyway. So in terms of the overall mix, it'll be the difference in the sales from what was one brand to the Countdown brand.</p>

          <p>Hi, Michael, Craig Woolford from Citigroup. Just touching on the question about gross margins and there are some sources of gross margin increase like overseas sourcing and a few other areas such as the direct store &#x2013; sorry, the move to distribution centers for liquor and also factory gate pricing seemed to be mentioned. Can you just talk about how far you've progressed on those two initiatives and whether we'll see further gross margin improvement going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, clearly in liquor with the established of the DCs, we've changed the route to market and we get both a cost of doing business that we have to carry, but we also get a gross margin tick up. There is still some significant categories that we're moving through, so of late, we've moved a lot of fresh chicken that used to go direct to store through our network, and there are a number of other major categories that over time we'll move in. Sorry, what was the second one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The factory gate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The factory gate, I think in the supermarkets, Geoff, we're about 50% of volume now is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a touch less than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a touch less than 50% of all volume that goes into our DCs are on our fleet, so there's still upside. I think the best in the world are around about 70%, so it's not 100%, but we certainly believe that it can be more. And of course we've extended our primary freight &#x2013; and Ian can probably expand upon it if you need to. So we're doing a lot of the &#x2013; we do our own shipping now for instance. Not that we own ships, but we actually manage all of the shipping around the world. Through Kuehne + Nagel we do all of our consolidation. And we're just extending that notion of primary freight, and also we're doing some co-freight. So we've got some vendors that are joining in on our freight rates to bring product in.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a significant element of it, absolutely. Clearly, when we started off with Project Refresh, we had the optimum of doing everything once in one place where it made sense. We never quite got there, so one element of doing that is in fact that. So a good example would be we had across all of our businesses 25, I think, Ramnik, 25, how many call...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>32 &#x2013; they found a few more call centers. We know that we can do with a lot less. We can make sure we standardize the customer experience both internal, external, both our retail customers and our supply customers by doing it a lot more effectively in far fewer locations on a standardized technology et cetera, et cetera. So the experience can be a lot better, the efficiency can be a lot better, and we're pretty much on the way to implementing that at the moment; so that's a small example of what we're trying to tackle.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just lastly, the hotels' EBIT margin in the second half was about 12% compared with the PCP of about 18%. Given what has happened in the gaming industry, is this new run rate because of the changes in gaming revenue and the impact on some of the limits?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think we're going to see a return to the running rate in gaming over the next 12 months, but the big tick of course is the 12 months after that where it will change. There will be a bit of a game changer in Victoria, which is obviously a large part of that group. Ross, do you have any further comments to that?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin Yule from Morgan Stanley. Not to be too critical, but I guess this is the first year in a while where you've grown funds employed faster than EBIT. I think most of the other years that this business has done that, it has been as a result of acquisitions and this is largely an organic year. So am I missing anything? The real ramp up in expenditure on hardware is still to happen, so how do you justify or how do you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has not actually been hardware. What's happened and I think we talked about this last time, the development industry, both in the large shopping centers but more importantly where most of our business was done with the small or medium sized developers who did our supermarkets and our Dan Murphy's and all that stuff, basically can't get financed and are still struggling to get financed now, even with almost 80% equity. They just cannot borrow, so we've actually stepped in and done the vast majority of our developments ourselves. In time, we will &#x2013; in fact we've already started selling those down again. So we knew that we would ramp up that. It's probably going to peak in the next year or so.</p>
          <p>We're starting to see Westfields and others starting to come back in again, but if we didn't do that we'd have no BIG Ws going forward, we'd have probably about a quarter of the supermarkets going forward. So the last thing we wanted to do was to say it's all too hard. So Ralph and the property team ramped up dramatically on our development starts, so we now do &#x2013; the vast majority of developments are done in-house. They'll obviously come on balance sheet, but we will be selling them when we believe the yield on those properties is appropriate. So it's a timing thing that we knew was going to happen, but it was a balance between keeping that down and really just giving away future growth opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing, Martin, is we continue to invest in hotels, Dick Smith and in BIG W, so we didn't turn off the investment in those two businesses or those three businesses. Therefore, you mathematically or automatically get some dilution in there. But the return on funds employed &#x2013; I was trying to make the point before, but probably didn't make it very well, was that it's hung in there despite those three businesses having either a lower earnings or a normal increase in earnings because of the factors that we've described. I'd imagine it would just go back to normal. If we have a normal year next year it'll go back to normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So if we take a business like BIG W with the ROFE halved in the year, are you saying that the &#x2013; I understand the funds employed argument, but is there a direct short-term impact on the EBIT? Is that the sort of &#x2013; is there...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The EBIT figure was 200 million for both years and we continued to invest in the CapEx, so that benefit will just come through in future years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin, in normal years we do five or six, some years seven or eight BIG Ws. All of them in the past pretty much were done by third parties. Nearly all of them as I &#x2013; am I right &#x2013; all of them now are being done by Fabcot, which is our own company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in the short term it changes that number, but going forward we're not natural holders of those assets for long term. When the yield's right, they'll be back on the market and they'll become a leasehold for us.</p>

          <p>How are you?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very well, thanks. Just a first question, just in terms of gross margins in the food and liquor business, you talked a bit about how private label is a big driver of that. What's your feel in terms of what your major competitor is doing out there at the moment, cutting their private label prices 20, 25, 30% and how that's going to impact profitability going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't got a problem with that because our prices are already being down there, so we're not having to do that to respond to them. We've set our private label prices basically at Aldi, so we've negated that. And what we've been doing is also bringing down branded product price. So what about &#x2013; it isn't really important that we &#x2013; we have our game plan, our strategy. We're not going to dance to anybody else's tune. We know exactly what we need to do and we're heading down that track.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's not going to be any need to repeat those below?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's not going to be any need to repeat your private label another level below, things like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think there is some way to go on some products to get down to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just in terms of the 2015 market concept, just what the strategy varies around the rollout, whether it's just going to be majority on new stores or versus actually pushing us into the refurbs now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will just replace &#x2013; there will be a period of time where we have an overlap of ones that are already in the pipeline, both a couple of new stores, I'd imagine, Greg, and also some refurbs that'll be still done in the 2010. But the 2015 marketplace by the end of the year, all new stores and all refurbishments will be in that new format. It's an evolutionary thing, so it's not radical change as we've been talking about over the last four of these events.</p>
          <p>Come 2010, we would be ready to have the next evolution on. The guys have been working on it for now near on two years. So the first one has gone down, but we will do probably about four or five until we fine-tune it and then we'll settle on that. But thereafter that, we'll continue to do it, so it's really important for instance on the CapEx side that this one not only delivers a better mousetrap, but it's a cheaper mousetrap in terms of capital cost, and that's what we've been able to achieve. So getting that return is a combination of how much you put in CapEx and what EBIT return you get on it, so we're making sure that we manage both ends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're expecting to see better returns out of those versus the 2010s?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe that we'll actually get a great EBIT return but we do know that like for like it's going to be cheaper for us to put it on the ground. Not that it looks cheaper to the customer, it actually probably looks more expensive but it actually is cheaper; so we've done a lot of work in terms of design. Not just of the product, but the design so it's really efficient to transport around the world because most of it's manufactured elsewhere. But also by buying direct rather than buying through someone else, we've significantly reengineered the cost of the product, the landed cost of the product.</p>

          <p>Hi, Michael, Paul van Meurs from Deutsche Bank, just a couple of ones from me. Just firstly maybe one for time on operating leases. Obviously the momentum, the accounting standard seems to be gaining some momentum. I saw you made some comments in the press. Is anyone going to be surprised when those have to come onto balance sheet within a year or two's time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. There will be a lot of noise about it over the next 18 months. The accounting standard setters want to capitalize leases onto the balance sheet of people that lease. It has no impact &#x2013; it's an accounting adjustment. It has no impact on the balance sheet from a debt raising perspective because the rating agencies already look at the commitments. Those commitments are already fully disclosed in our accounts, so it really is a desire by the accounting standard setters to put leases on the balance sheet. We can all rest easy that the photocopiers I've got in the office are going to be on the balance sheet and we'll be accounting for them correctly. It will be a great accounting standard.</p>
          <p>The profits will be distorted. We don't really know how yet because what they're going to do is take the rent and break it down into depreciation and interest. I don't quite know how they're going to do that. So you'll have a bit more accounting jiggery-pokery going through that particular item in the P&amp;L, but we will do our normal thing and try and explain that as clearly as we can. I don't think it's going to have any significant impact but we're going to get it I think.</p>

          <p>And then just finally on Thomas Dux, it was obviously &#x2013; it didn't get too much prominence in the release. Can you just comment on how that's going?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>This is a great initiative that has got two benefits. What we're seeing generally is this wonderful consumer trend towards what's good for me and new and unusual. And the stores are getting unbelievably high loyalty metrics, so people that shop there are extremely loyal to them and they go back. They recognize they're paying a bit more for stuff.</p>
          <p>But I think more importantly what we're seeing has been the real success stories in terms &#x2013; particularly in terms of product and a few other things that are Thomas Dux that quickly made their way across to the bigger brother in the supermarkets. And we derived a great deal of value and I guess macro is a great example of that, but there are many other things that you might actually see quite frankly in the 2015 that actually came from things that have worked really for us in Thomas Dux. And we're starting to see they're working really well for us in the 2015 market store as well. Yes?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Michael, David Cooke from Nomura, two questions if I may. Firstly, can you give us an indication as to what happened with selling and marketing? Has that stayed relatively flat year on year, particularly for selling and marketing associated with the supermarkets? And therefore did you get a benefit from the lower TVC and advertising rates, which pushed up the level of advertising, and would you look to keep that advertising constant into FY '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; Greg, you might try this one. Just grab a microphone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is we did see TV rates go down in FY '10 and we bought a little bit more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But not a great deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But not a great deal more, so we did benefit in this instance. The customers benefited because they saw our ads more often.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But certainly in terms of share of voice, there were others out there that spent some enormous amounts on TARP [Target Audience Rating Points] rates. The law of diminishing returns is something that we understand pretty well in advertising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mean you're going to keep your TARP rates the same into FY '11 and therefore potentially an increase in advertising spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the TARP rates will vary depending on what we believe we need to do to either stimulate or otherwise customer traffic because that's what it's about, getting people through your door.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you able to give us a bit more color please on the gross margin expansion that you've got in food and liquor, maybe proportionate between fresh versus private label versus Aussie dollar benefit either direct or indirect, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All of the above, but we're certainly not going to break them up for you. What I will say is that shrinkage was a tremendous contributor in both fresh and in long life. But all of those were &#x2013; along with global sourcing and some margin exchanges all contributed. But if you had to single one out, I guess shrinkage was probably the thing that really did well last year. The guys and girls have really focused on that. We're now into a couple of years of AutostockR in the fresh areas and we're getting far cleverer at doing that and that's certainly made a big difference.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, just a question on the hotels business. The second half result was a bit softer and as you mentioned that was mainly caused by the softer GP from the gaming result. But I noticed the cost base has gone up as well, and I think you pointed to one amount as a result of an accounting change. But it seems as though the cost base has gone up by another $30 million while sales have been softer. Can you just explain what the driver of that increase has been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's in hotels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In hotels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Clearly the change in mix, so what did work really well for us last year was our restaurants and of course they're pretty labor intensive. So we had a mix change where the share of revenue from gaming across to things like the bistros, et cetera, changed and of course gaming needs very few people. Bistros need cooks and waiters and cleaners and a whole host of other things. So really it was a factor of two things. One was the mix change and certainly in terms of the percentage of course not being able to fractionalize fixed costs. But in terms of the overall it really was around those elements that I talked about. It just cost a little bit more to run pubs when you've got the mix round the wrong way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it makes sense; just one other question &#x2013; oh sorry two more. Firstly, on &#x2013; I noticed the EPS has grown below NPAT for FY '10. Meanwhile you've had the buyback in place. Obviously there have been some shared issues &#x2013; shares issued with the DRP and the executive share options. If we look forward to FY '11, can we expect the buyback to be accretive once forecasting the DRP and executive share options?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let the most famous mathematician in the world, Tom Pockett, answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, I'll let you do the calculations on where it's EPS accretive because it will depend on what your assumption is for FY '11 earnings. But our plan on buybacks is always it will be EPS accretive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just taking a point in time, I think in the paper we've said it represents about 2.4% of script out there at the moment, but it does obviously get affected by positive additions through options and DRP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just one last question. I think it was on page 51 of the release. You've put in some CapEx forecasts there. So it looks as though underlying CapEx for FY '11 will be going up. Can you just run through the main reasons for that? Is that all hardware?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>No, the 1.4 billion is &#x2013; primarily there has a bit of a kick in refurbishments, which relates to some hotels and refurbishment activity in New Zealand. In terms of the supply chain and the data centers, we're actually building a new data center; so we're fitting that out just to handle our increased capacity over time. We're always fitting out the BIG W DC, the Tasmanian DC, and quite possibly the electronics DC over the next 12 months, so that's included in that. So they're mainly operational type expenses.</p>
          <p>The home improvement one, we've actually put a different line in there to show you what the CapEx is for home improvement. But the key is I haven't given you the property development CapEx for home improvement, and I'll do that in the next six months after we've spent it.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Phil Kimber from Goldman Sachs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Phil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, Michael, a question on BIG W. You mention AutostockR has gone into that business. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing but then maybe relate that back to the inventory that's gone up, I think six days inventory increase, which is by my rough guess, about 50 million in increase in inventory for BIG W.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Look, what we're seeing quite frankly is on a day-to-day basis we've actually reduced our inventory, so going out into the back rooms, it is a marked difference to what we saw 12 months ago. We've just finally put the final stores in at the last little while of the financial year. However, the big tick was that we brought forward a couple of our major promotions, so the toy sale for instance, we brought the stock in earlier. So there was a big chunk of product that was in our books a little bit earlier than it was the year before. Now Julie, have you got any other color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In relation to AutostockR, we've actually seen days stock come down since that went in. It finished at Easter on that merchandise, which is on that system, which is between 30 to 40% of the volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing was last year with the stimulus, we had a significant sell-through rate in our winter stock, so looking at the comparison we were actually quite low last year and that has been another factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Julie just made an important point. Unlike supermarkets, which is mainly all pulled stock, in discount department stores, there's a mixture of pull and push, so a big element of course is the seasonal and big promotions, where you commit a year ahead to the product, and of course it gets allocated to the store. So it's not something that gets continually replenished day after day after day. But what we are doing is working on &#x2013; particularly with new generation replenishment as it applies to BIG W, is to work how we can get that percentage much higher and take categories of products that aren't suitable for AutostockR onto a replenishment program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but with the weaker sort of sales in the fourth quarter there's no issue of sort of stock issue for winter stock this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Winter has been a little bit slower. You might recall last year everyone sold out and had to bring their summer on a lot earlier because people had a bundle of money last year that they just came in and they just grabbed three t-shirts and five pairs of slacks. That's not happening this year. So, if I go back two years, then we're very comfortable that we're in the right space in terms of winter, but if we go back to last year, it was one year out of the blue. We actually had to go and buy extra stuff to put on the racks and then bring the summer in as quickly as we could because we'd sold all the winter. Obviously, we've returned to normal trading patterns this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a question on quantum; can you give any sense of the magnitude in the past Project Refresh and Project Mercury, stepped it up in terms of the EBIT impact that they brought? Is this program another level above those two in magnitude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've said is it's similar. We haven't said it's above, below; we've just said it's similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and one more last one. I think it was in the official release, Tom was breaking out the cash flow and there was something on timing of rebates, and I think it was $40 million odd rebates a year gone through the P&amp;L but you haven't collected yet? That was quite a bit different to the prior year. Could you maybe talk about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, many a time those rebates were collected in July and we just hadn't received them in June. So if you just look through the movements in the balance sheet, you'll see the receivables have picked up a bit as a result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just going to say, just so that you're comfortable with that, our rebates work on an automatic deduct so when we pay for the stock we automatically deduct the rebates. So when we have got a change in timing of our accounts to be settled with our vendors, our rebates are on that same date. So as that changes, the rebate timing changes at the same time because they're the one transaction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">

          <p>The next question comes from David Errington from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mike. Hi, Tom. The question that I'm a bit concerned a bit, I suppose, is that you said, Mike, at the front of your presentation that you weren't going for the quick buck. But I'm a bit concerned that this result your actions aren't necessarily consistent with that, because when you look at the Australian food and liquor business, your comp sales growth in the second half was 1.7%, yet you increased your EBIT to sales margin by 72 basis points in the second half in the midst of a revitalising competitor or competitors.</p>
          <p>And when you look at BIG W, the gross margin on the second half increased by 400 basis points despite sales being down 700 basis points, again in the face of very difficult competitive situation and a revitalising competitor. I am worried that the actions that you're &#x2013; driving the Company is toward driving short-term profitability because at the start of your year, you would have been, in your guidance you would never have been thinking that consumer electronics would have been in losses in the second half. You would never have thought that hotels would have dropped like they did and probably, given your comments on stimulus that you underestimated how much benefit you got, there's no way known you would have thought BIG W would have gone backwards or stayed flat.</p>
          <p>I'm worried that you've pulled the margin lever to get this result and that ultimately that's undermining your strength in your business that's letting your competitor gain traction against you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that's obviously your opinion and we are describing what we actually went through and the decisions that we made in each of the businesses through the year, and I'm very comfortable we made the right decision in each of the periods that we did. We decided to invest in price at various times, which we did. We invested in price, substantially BIG W; we invested in price in Supermarkets; we invested in price in Dick Smith; and we invested in price in Dan Murphy.</p>
          <p>What I would say is that I think it's a wrong conclusion to say that another's growth has been at our expense, because clearly when you look at the numbers and the market share numbers, the growth that someone else has got has been at others' expense and not necessarily us, because in food we actually outgrew them in market share growth. In liquor, we outgrew them in market share growth.</p>
          <p>So I understand where your logic and comments come from, but it's not one that I subscribe to and I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If we look at the fourth quarter, Mike, I know that your metric was that you want to be growing faster than your competitor, et cetera. The only reason that you're growing market share faster is because you're investing more money. If you look at the sales per square meter, my calculations in fourth quarter your sales per square meter actually went down for Australian Supermarkets and when you're saying that you're dropping price or you're pulling price for BIG W and for food and liquor, it doesn't seem to be gaining traction because your sales are just slowing to a trickle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's less so gone to a trickle is our volume, which is the reflection of our investment in price because our volumes actually were very strong and all the market data that I look at, doesn't matter whether it's liquor or whether it's food, we actually outgrew in percentage terms market share growth. In fresh, we maintained and grew our share. What I saw with others what they actually got back was their loss of fresh to specialists that were very obvious in the previous years. So once again, it's not at our expense. The numbers are really clear, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm concerned that with the 1.7% comp that was in the second half, and you're basically saying that that's sustained and BIG W again like I still can't quite understand how the gross margin could go up 400 basis points in the second half when your sales dropped about 7%. I still don't quite understand how that works when you're saying you're pushing the price lever on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's the mathematics that you actually earn a lot more than 400 basis points and you're able to put some of those back in. And also you earn in CODB improvements, both of those go back into a different price position in the marketplace, it's no different than what we've done every year for a long, long time.</p>

          <p>We'll continue to register that each time we come in and talk in six-month time, David, and 12 months times and 18 months time, and 24 months time. We have always said that we're going to generate, as we've been able to do for a decade now, improvements in cost of doing business, improvement in cost of goods sold and we will determine at the appropriate time how much the customer gets and how much the shareholder gets, and we'll continue to do that.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I move onto the cash flow, when I look at your cash flow statement from operations it was 2.76 billion, CapEx was 1.8. So your free cash flow is 9.40. You did purchase some businesses for 200 and your dividends paid was 1.16. So when you look at your free cash, it's significantly below what your dividend payment is and yet you're doing an off-market buyback. I can't quite fully understand why you'd want to be doing an off-market buyback when your operating cash flow at the moment after your CapEx is not enough to support your dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, capital management and managing our balance sheet to maintaining our credit ratings is what we do. The fact that in one year the cash generated from the business doesn't cover the dividends, the key issue is do we have capacity in our balance sheet to do capital management, pay dividends, invest in our business and buy growth opportunities? And the answer is absolutely. So I think you've got quite a narrow view of capital management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the final question I've got is you mentioned Mike that Consumer Electronics you basically are confident in the strategy that you're adopting much along the lines that you're confident in the turnaround in New Zealand that I would have thought it's a little early to be popping Champagne corks in New Zealand given that you generated 232 million of EBIT from capital employed of nearly 3 billion, that's about a 7.5% return on funds employed, so you still &#x2013; and you're about five or six years in on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just &#x2013; you might recall we've had this conversation several times, David. You're only looking at one part of the return. We got a significant return through that transaction directly attributable to that transaction in our Australian Supermarkets by renegotiating our business terms with our major trading partners and they're still in place. It's still generating additional income.</p>
          <p>We got 20 stores and a number of development sites as a result of that. We continue to get benefit from those. We also got a taxation advantage through having a business in New Zealand. When you put all those together, actually we get a far better return than the one that you've calculated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the numbers that Tom said that he said that with the CapEx you got a 36% uplift on the Australian EBIT in the last three years. If you pull that out, the underlying business is growing at about 5.5, 6% and with inflation at 3.5, 4%. And then if you throw in all the benefits that you have supposed to have got from New Zealand, the underlying Australian business without that CapEx and without New Zealand is probably pretty flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we come visit you, you put the calculation in front of us and we'll indicate where you may have miscalculated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your statement about popping Champagne corks, David, that's your statement, Michael was really clear in his comment that we have a long way to go. We have got good competitors, so that's not a correct statement of our view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Rob Blythe from Macquarie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, guys. How are you? Another question on Dick Smith, as you roll out the new format across the network over the next two years, it's also going to have a negative impact on your gross margin at the mix, so what are you expecting in terms of cost of doing business to negate this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, there are a number of things. As the new stores come out, we get a bit of sales numbers so that it helps us fractionalize fixed cost, but we worked very hard on reducing fixed cost on the last 12 months. We just completed rolling the New Zealand office into the Australian office.</p>
          <p>We have recalibrated our supply chain costs in both businesses and we have the opportunity now, now that we've established better volumes to go back and re-negotiate our cost of goods sold. So they will be both elements that will improve our return in those businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you also mentioned that Consumer Electronics is doing well in July and August. Can you comment on maybe what products or categories is driving the growth over that, time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It continues to be the products that have been the backbone. So TVs, but iPads certainly has been a tremendous sales success. But also we're seeing a bit of rejuvenation in photography. So cameras and also in-car navigation's having a bit of a second life. But the area that really has been fantastic growth has been phones, particularly smartphones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We need to call a halt here now because I think we've got some TV cameras that have been waiting patiently for us. So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your time today. And we appreciate your interest in our company. Thank you.</p>
