          <p>Good morning. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome, and thank you for joining the UniCredit Group First Quarter 2010 Results Conference Call. As a remainder, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alessandro Profumo, CEO of UniCredit Group. Please go ahead, Mr. Profumo.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Many thanks. Good morning to everybody, and many thanks for being connected to us for the presentation of the first quarter results. Shall we move immediately to the presentation? So, we can go directly to page four of the slides, which is the executive summary. So as you can see, we posted a net profit of 120 million in the first quarter, which is an increase on the previous year of 16.5% and 40% on the previous quarter. As well, the operating profit is improving both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, 10.9% quarter-on-quarter and 6.9% on the year. The revenues are up, again both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, with resilient quarter-on-quarter trend on both net interest but even more on commission and positive contribution from trading income.</p>
          <p>The cost/income ratio this reduced at 57%, 2% less than the previous score and also 1.3% down on the previous year. We continue to be focused on structural efficiency. The full-time equivalent down by 2,683 in the quarter, which is quite a significant number. And as we said during the third and the fourth quarter presentation, when we started to see an improvement in terms of the asset quality we are seeing a decrease on loan provision, which are down 13.4% quarter-on-quarter with 127 bps of quarter &#x2013; cost of risk, which is still high, but you will see with a growth improvement on the previous year. The deterioration of asset quality going down, so we are seeing that the gross impaired loans are going up by 4.3% quarter-on-quarter and gross NPL 4.2%.</p>
          <p>So, we are seeing a small growth on the total asset 2.2% quarter-on-quarter, the funded assets 1.6%, but you will see the number later on &#x2013; the loan stabilizing, we have slightly higher deposits and the lower net interbank. The Core Tier 1 is stable at 8.45, reflecting risk weighted assets back to a moderate growth, mainly due to Forex and dividend accrual.</p>
          <p>Moving to page five, you cans see the key numbers which have been already described. So, I'd like to move, I think is better, to the page six where we continue to show the main operating trends in the first quarter. The stable sources of revenues, clearly the trading income are more volatile, are quite stable. I think that this number is very, very important because we're 259% on total assets in terms of sum of net interest plus net commission, slightly higher than &#x20AC;6 billion. So, it's a very well stabilized number.</p>
          <p>The operating expenses are slightly going up. There is an influence of the Forex effect, which if we would take out the Forex effect would be lower the growth of expenses, but there is a sharp focus on that. The net write-down from loans, as we have seen, are going down to 1.8 billion, 066 basis point on the total assets. So, it is also <mark type="inaudible" /> showing a positive trend.</p>
          <p>Moving to page seven, here we have detail. As you can see, the first quarter, you remember when I presented the fourth quarter results we said that in the fourth quarter there was in one-off in the range of 100 million, so &#x2013; and this is exactly the difference we are seeing despite of the fact that the first quarter, two days less than the fourth quarter. Just to give you a number, two days less is equivalent to &#x20AC;57 million. So, it's quite an important number. But there is detail in the following page.</p>
          <p>The net commissions are up quite significantly year-on-year, 17.5%. As you know, there is seasonality in the first quarter in terms of commission. So, I think that this is a very good number. The trading income have been good in the first quarter. Clearly, the first quarter has been good for almost all the market players. But if we consider that this is a number completely based on customer driven activities, we are quite satisfied with the trends of our franchise.</p>
          <p>Moving to the detail of net interest; finally the Euribor has stabilized and this space is going slightly up. Clearly, there has been quite a significant decrease on the previous year. The three months of Euribor are down on average by 135 bps, year-on-year is a very significant number for us. But again, it is important for us to see that we've stabilized the number quarter-on-quarter. There are no one-offs in the first quarter and as I said, there are the two days less. The three months Euribor is &#x2013; today it's the same level of the average of the quarter of slightly higher, 1 bps higher. So, it is important to say that we've been stabilized on that. We continue to have a significant positive sensitivity due to higher rates. You will see at the bottom of the page, 480 million of positive impact in the case, parallel shift of the curve by 100 bps.</p>
          <p>Moving to the commission, we had a positive trend both on the commission from investments which is &#x2013; as well as on other net commission. This is very important, the other net commission, because apparently it is stable quarter-on-quarter. In reality, the payment side of this has been reduced because in the first quarter we received an annual payment on the payment services. So in reality, we have quite a positive trend as well in this area. So, this is I think, and I repeat what I said before, a very important element because clearly with the low interest rate environment, net interest margin will stabilize, but will not go up. We have to be very open on that. So, the commission side is an incredibly important element for our future.</p>
          <p>Moving to cost, page 10, you see that we had a small growth in &#x2013; on the cost side, 2% quarter-on-quarter, 1.5% year-on-year. If we should &#x2013; the staff expenses are up by 2%, but if we wouldn't consider the Forex element and variable items, in reality we should be down by 0.3%. So, we continue to be very focused on the cost side. Is the same for the other expenses, without the 44 million &#x2013; without the Forex effect and 44 million of expense recoveries that we had in the fourth quarter on the workout activity, we should be down by 1.9%. So, the focus continues to be very strong. Here we have a walk that do explain this elements, so you can see &#x2013; page 11, you can see what is &#x2013; has been the walk from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of this year. Variable staff expenses, clearly we are accruing the budget for variable expenses, and at the last quarter usually there are the recoveries if we &#x2013; making more precise numbers, we know that we will pay a portion of that. So, this is usually how we work.</p>
          <p>Page 12, also this is an important page we continue to work on efficiency to further streamlining Western Europe, 1,353 colleagues less in the retail area, so is the delivery of the people related to the merger we have done in Italy. We continue to reduce the weight of the service center, corporate center and GBS, and we have a small further efficiency in Central Eastern Europe. Clearly, the cost control continues to be one of our key items and I think also in this area. We are doing what we are expected to do, at least internally.</p>
          <p>Page 13 is another important page, cost of risk. You see that we had the peak in terms of cost of risk in the second quarter of '09. Then we started with an improving trend. So today, we are at 1.8 billion in terms of total write-down on loans in the first quarter. When we do see the cost of risk, we are seeing a clear improvement in CIB and in Central Eastern Europe. Retail, this &#x2013; the first quarter number is slightly misleading because in the first quarter we had a positive element, not repeatable. The running cost of risk in the last year for retail has been slightly higher than 100 bps. So, this is a comparable number. We think that the first quarter do &#x2013; will represent a peak during 2010. So, this is something very specific.</p>
          <p>Clearly, in Central Eastern Europe we're seeing different trends in the different countries. We have a positive element in Turkey. You remember that in Turkey last quarter there has been a significant higher-ing of the coverage ratio. We have seen some higher cost of risk in Russia, Czech Republic and Croatia. But overall, we are quite satisfied with the trend in Central Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Looking to the following page, page 14, you see that the pace of deterioration is slowing down quite significantly. We had an increase of 4.3% in terms of total gross impaired loans, and also the other gross impaired loans I think the last quarter went up by 20%, in this quarter are growing only -- "only" by 4.5%. So clearly, the entrance flow of deteriorated loans is going down, and this for us is an important element. Also, if you consider this element with the following page, page 15, where you do see that the coverage ratio is going up in all the different categories. So this is also very important. We continue to keep also a significant amount of generic reserve with &#x20AC;3.1 billion.</p>
          <p>You remember that we have seen this slide page 16 also in the previous quarters. This is an important element because mainly the blue line is important, clearly also the other one, but the blue line is a sort of lead indicator for the future cost of risk because it is the addition to impaired loans in terms of bps. We had the peak also here in the second quarter with 98 bps. Then we started to go down to the 42. So, this is very important for us because we believe that that the future cost of risk.</p>
          <p>Page 17, also is important, so &#x2013; the so-called non-operating items. We had 156 million of provision for risks and charges, 6 million of restructuring cost. We've already seen the net write-downs. Then we have a small amount &#x2013; a small positive amount of net income from investments, which offset the loss we had in the disposal of Generali. So, is &#x2013; the 72 million of loss we had on the disposal of Generali has been offset by other gains. So, the net is a positive impact.</p>
          <p>Taxes, the tax rate, 38.6%, is slightly higher than the run rate, but as I said &#x2013; it's slightly higher than the run rate. Clearly, in the first quarter we had some small exceptional item, then we have minorities price which is allocation and we go down to 520 million of net profit we'd already seen before.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet, page 18; the total assets are back to a moderate growth. The hedging instruments went also slightly high up due to market volatility. What is in our opinion very important is the stability of tangible equity, which is slightly going up &#x20AC;2.03 per share in the first quarter. So, we are back to pre-capital increase level. The leverage ratio is still going down. We are at 21.6. We were pro forma 22.1 at the year-end. We &#x2013; this is very good number, also foresee eventual changes in the regulation related to Basel III. We are in a very, very strong position.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet, the customer loan are stable. We are starting to see some pickup in Central Eastern Europe plus mortgages in Italy, which is also important because today we have a positive contribution from the mortgage business. Again, customer deposits are slightly growing. Securities issued of slightly going down. Then the interbank net is slightly lower than what we had at the year-end as the trading assets are growing a little bit as well as the trading liabilities. So, the balance sheet is fully repositioned for a normal post-crisis environment.</p>
          <p>Then if we move to page 20, we have &#x2013; which is the last page of the presentation, we have the capital position. The Core Tier I is at 8.45. The total &#x2013; sorry, the Tier 1 ratio is at 9.40. We had an almost stable Core Tier I, minus 2 bps, on the previous quarter, mainly due to the positive contribution from earnings offset by the dividend accrual and the higher risk weighted assets. The risk weighted assets are back to a moderate growth, partially driven by Forex effect clearly in Central Eastern Europe. The devaluation of the euro vis-&#xE0;-vis the Central Eastern European currencies is bringing this effect.</p>
          <p>I went through &#x2013; over the presentation. Now clearly, I'm more than happy to answer to all your question. Just for you to know, I am here with the deputies, Roberto Nicastro; Sergio Ermotti; Paolo Fiorentino' Federico Ghizzoni who cover Central Eastern Europe; Marina Natale, CFO; Karl Guha, the CRO. So, we have all the competencies in order to answer to all your questions. Thanks.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, this is the Chorus Call conference operator. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from Ms. Annamaria Benassi of Banca Leonardo. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I have just few questions. One regards to the costs &#x2013; the staff costs because we're seeing even excluding the Forex impact, and as you said the accrual of the bond fees. The costs were just going down 0.3% Q-on-Q, which is strange because we see that 2.7,000 people more or less had left the group just in the quarter and then you have the accrual of the previous exceeds. Can you please elaborate what you expect for staff cost because I would have expected maybe a lower number on that?</p>
          <p>The second question regards the costs of risk, particularly in Italy retail division, because the retail division is against the stream of an improvements, and I see 118 bps annualized for the division and Italy particularly, 148 bps. Can you explain where this jump is coming from, if I see rarely in the divisional database you publish? And what is your view there, because on the other side you say you see stabilization in Italy in general? So is more on the corporate and not in the retail. Finally, we see on &#x2013; I see on Reuters that HVB is confirming to have made a binding offer for the German business &#x2013; the German branches of SEB. Can you please update on that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting from the staff cost, the &#x2013; 2,683 people went out, clearly on average are less during the quarter. So &#x2013; and the positive impact of the cost reduction is partially offset by the Forex effect more or less by one half. Then the salary sheet &#x2013; salary drifts, due to the national contracts and because this is also driving the &#x2013; this element, usually at the beginning of the year, you have one step up in this perspective and then there are the variable payments.</p>
          <p>So overall, the cost &#x2013; the staff cost should stabilize. You have to consider that the salary drift is on average close to 4% due to the national contracts which are signed for other banks. So more or less, this is what you have to consider as a cost to growth, not related to specific elements of any bank, but due to the cost to growth &#x2013; again for us this 4% is also related to the fact that in Central Eastern Europe the cost to growth is higher than Western Europe. In Western Europe, at least in Italy it is likely lower. The national contract in Germany is pretty close to that and then there is Central Eastern Europe. So, if you have a cost &#x2013; a staff reduction of 4%, you can assume that the cost base should remain more or less the same. But the 4%, it means 8% beginning of the year and end of the year if the exit are linear during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Consider that there were more than 8000 people leading to...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, which is more or less 5% of the total employees. That is slightly more in Central Eastern Europe, then we have the variable payments. So &#x2013; and since we are slightly down, if you take out the Forex effect is exactly what was forecasted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then SEB, I think that there is nothing new from what you already know, and now I leave the floor to Roberto Nicastro in order to talk of cost of risk in retail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. What we have been seeing and then on page 25 you can have a little bit more detail by country, has been, let's say, non-ordinary volatility in the cost of risk between Q4 2009 and Q1 2010. The reality, we've seen that Q4 has been below with quarter in terms of cost of risk of the entire year. And as Alessandro pointed out, we expect that Q1 of 2010 should &#x2013; exactly to be the highest in the year.</p>
          <p>What we have are two elements, on one side the Q3 &#x2013; sorry, the Q4 data was positively impacted by some one-off items. As far as the Q1 is concerned, our, let's say, forecast of seeing this quarter relatively here stems from the fact that most of the number really comes from the internal migration of already classified files from <mark type="inaudible" />. In reality, the net new inflows to <mark type="inaudible" /> and to the internal watch is under control, is clearly declining over the past, and in all areas what we are seeing is a stabilization towards the lower level of the overall risk areas. Just to give you a couple of numbers, in this moment the PD of the small business portfolio for instance is now at 4.4% versus peak of 4.8% during 2009 or when we look after the mortgage market here for instance, the total watch now including internal watch is now going down by close to 20% compared to the peak we experienced during 2008. So, the overall classification is on a reduction stabilization ground. This makes us quite more comfortable in forecasting now better quarters moving forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Ms. Francesca Tondi of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As you would expect, I also have still a few questions on provisions. I mean following actually the comment you just made on retail asset quality, so what you're signaling is that if deterioration of categories from watch list into the Italian Sofferenza. But my understanding is that, you already provisioned watch list according to the probability of transferring to Sofferenza and the coverage there. So your 30% of average coverage already takes into account of the 60% transfer statistical into Sofferenza and the coverage required there, so it should not have required a significant top-up of provisions or is the underlying trend different to what you're expecting?</p>
          <p>Also, you mentioned this positive one-off in Q4. Can you actually explain what they were? And what do you see as a trend, do you see the business to peak and then provisions go down from here or will it take a while to go down? Can you give us a bit of an indication of guidance there? I also wanted you to comment on provision in some of the countries in Central Europe. In Turkey it's actually down significantly. I think if I'm not mistaken, there's even a write-back. Can you actually talk us about what is the situation there? Romania is still growing up a little bit. Can you explain? And I see Kazakhstan coming down. Is this the new level whilst Ukraine is still remaining at a quite high level of provisioning? Can you please comment on these countries and the trends that you see there, please?</p>
          <p>One last question on volume growth; I know you've given a little indication of some areas of growth. Can you be more specific in where the loans is actually going up and where they're actually going down so that at least we have a breakdown on why the loans are flat quarter-on-quarter at group level? Thank you very much. I hope it's clear. I was not too fast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, it's clear. Roberto will start talking again of retail. Then Federico Ghizzoni will answer on Central Eastern Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Grazi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me give some additional remarks and which I think also Karl Guha, our CRO, will add something. Well, first of all, what we are aiming is that clearly a migration from the Incagli class to the Sofferenza class of certain volumes clearly. On the Sofferenza, we have a clearly higher coverage ratio so that in fact is generating the increase in the cost of risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But my understanding is that the Incagli coverage is already taking into account of the migration of &#x2013; statistical migration to Sofferenza and the coverage required should not have made a huge difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, currently, for instance in retail, we have an average coverage ratio and for instance the example of Italy of 31.4%. On the Sofferenza the coverage ratio is 59.1. Clearly, once you migrate the class from one to the other you have to add the data, so that clearly requires the impact in cost of risk.</p>
          <p>On the one-off item, maybe Karl will want to make a comment, I'll just finish really talking directionally in saying that overall what we have seen is a more stabilized &#x2013; clearly more stabilized level in as small businesses, in mortgages is more stabilized, but at an improved level in terms of new flows. New flows are still in line with the last quarters in the consumer loan part. Generally speaking, really everything points toward an improvement in the cost of risk and as a risk the only, let's say, risk one has to keep in mind could be unemployment. Should we see a big surge on unemployment in the second half of 2010, that would generate, say, a risk to our projection, but not we think that we expect an improvement in the next quarter's retail cost of risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think that actually this should be the peak and gradually...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's our current expectation, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, Federico, since the growth rate on the loan side is in Central Eastern Europe, as I said before, for the time being because we're seeing a stability in Western Europe, but the mortgage business in Italy, Federico will talk about the cost of risk and the countries where we are seeing some picking up in terms of loan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So coming to the request about cost of risk, the overall expectation for 2010 is clearly for a decrease versus the peak of 2009. Specifically and touching now the countries you ask about, so Turkey the decrease is mainly due to the following factors. First of all, as Alessandro said, we had a very high increase in term of coverage in the last quarter '09 and the first quarter we have an improving definitely of the quality of the portfolio with an increase &#x2013; a significant increase of write-backs versus previous quarters, so is an effective improvement of the trend and we are expecting good trend also for the next quarters.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, for the first quarter it's an exception, but any case we see in the qualitative portfolio constant improving &#x2013; or we are expecting an improvement versus the previous quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Then Romania; Romania we are expecting 2010 substantially in line with the first quarter, maybe some improvement in the second half. Romania to be watched, particularly on the corporate side, whether we will go for sure &#x2013; we need for sure some restructuring on some customers. Anyway, stable, let's say, versus &#x2013; stable looking forward versus this quarter. Ukraine as well, we are expecting to stay around this level. Also for Ukraine, the good news anyway thanks to the political stability reached recently and the good performance of variable, we see less pressure on the FX lending. So we may expect some slight improvement. We have also some positioning corporate and restructuring and we expected it will be finalize after the first half of this year. Kazakhstan is the most unstable. So, I'm not expecting significant improvements this year versus the trend of this quarter.</p>
          <p>Talking about loans, in general terms, demand is still quite low, especially on the retail side with some exception. One is definitely Turkey, for example, in March the increased retail and corporate has been higher than what was our expectation as a average in the budget. So in terms of volumes, it's promising even though there is a certain pressure in terms of margins. Other countries that shows some recovery are Poland, Russia and I would say, Czech Republic. So, it's still a mix picture that we have. But overall, in the key countries, particularly again Turkey, Poland and Russia, we see some slight recovery, especially on the corporate side, that is promising for the first &#x2013; for the following quarters.</p>

          <p>It's going down mainly CIB with some exposure, as you can imagine, in CIB. There is quite a relation to the AVA of the value added of the different customers. And then securities redemption because you have to remember that we have a piece of the portfolio which is in non-receivable, but as well we still have a portion of the portfolio. We do have a negative AVA on which we are working. So &#x2013; and the contribution in terms &#x2013; today on the loan side we have a growth in terms of net interest margin contribution despite of the stability because we are continuously working on the existing portfolio in terms of improvement of the profitability of the single customers.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Couple of quick questions. You've provided the tangible equity at the end of the quarter. Now, it feels like a lot has happened over the last few weeks. Could you give us maybe a little bit of flavor as to how that has moved? And particularly, could you expand a bit on also the Italian bonds that you have in your trading available-for-sale portfolio, and also obviously you us the exposure to Portugal, Greece, Ireland, which is very helpful. If you could also give us a bit more data maybe on the duration of the bonds that you keep generally in your ASSN trading portfolios. And the only other question would be also if you could disclose how much dividend you have accrued in the quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Forex effect on the tangible equity &#x2013; I am so sorry, the IFS effect on tangible equity, we continuously monitor that clearly there has been some growth in this period of time, but we provide the number we'd at the end of the quarter that &#x2013; because unless is &#x2013; there is a volatility which is not certain &#x2013; not meaning in our opinion as we had also to know quite clearly two things. The first one is the fact that there are a significant number of countries where this prudential filter is not there. So this is first important element. As we know France, U.K. and other countries don't have that. And on the other side it is important to say the fact that our core Tier 1 ratio is at 8.45 at the end of first quarter, in a very comfortable situation. We can give you a sort of index sensitivity, 13 bps all delta on the CBS Italy, means more or less 1 bp of difference in terms of the available for service safe reserve impact on our Core Tier 1, so it's not quite relevant.</p>
          <p>Moving to exposure to peaks in terms of sovereign, give you the exact number, on Greece we have 993 million at the end of March, on Spain 555, on Ireland 56, on Portugal 32 million. The duration of the portfolio, on Greece we have 35% of the portfolio, which will expire in the next two years and more or less 50% in the next four years. So in the &#x2013; within four years. In Spain 23% in the next two years and two-third of the total between five and seven years. Ireland, Portugal are not meaningful as I said before. 85% of the portfolio is in the banking book more or less because &#x2013; is and &#x2013; was and is a portfolio that we use &#x2013; we've always used as potential collateral with DCP. As we know, we have more than 100 billion of collateral. So as you can see, this amount is not meaningful. Clearly, 100 billion considering also loan in our core securitization and so on and so forth are not all sovereign. The dividend we are accruing today, the same dividend paid last year. So, on an annual base the $0.03, then at the year-end the Board considering the results and the capital base will define the dividend policy. So, we have decided to accrue exactly the same amounts we've accrued last year. In Poland, we consider payout ratio of 30%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, hello. Good morning. You've disclosed your sovereign debt to the peripheral European countries, as only 1.6 billion...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry to interrupt you. You have to speak louder and closer to the microphone unless &#x2013; we don't hear anything.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, can you hear me now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, perfect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that. Okay. So you disclosed your exposure to sovereign debt in the peripheral European countries, but I think you've excluded this, I couldn't see there a figure, so actually could you disclose that? And my second question is, your trading profits were obviously quite strong. Could you give us some color on the extent of seasonality there and then what your trading profits should be more like on a quarter-to-quarter basis for the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, Pioneer, you've now decided to sale this, which you've indicated was the core asset in the past. And why did you decide to do this? I mean by your own words, your capital situation is strong and in general the whole policy of turning assets in the positive courses doesn't seem in keeping with company, which where the solvency is considered adequate and where your funding issues of course are so not a concern, of course given your very strong customer deposit base. Could you give us some color on your strategy there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. First of all, many thanks for the question because I think it's pretty proper to address very well the Pioneer opportunity, but starting from your first question on sovereign exposure to Italy, we have 31.5 billion of sovereign exposure of Italian bonds and 46% would expire within one year. So I think it's quite important. Clearly, we are a bank based in Italy and Germany and Austria mainly. So, the bulk of our portfolio is in these countries.</p>
          <p>I will leave at the end the answer on trading income to which will answer Sergio Ermotti, but talking of Pioneer, first of all, we have decided to discuss of the strategic option for Pioneer exactly now when there are not at all any issue on the capital base. So, we've showed today there are no doubts on the fact that we are discussing of the topics, for any other reason than the one of the strategy in the business because, first things, asset management after the crisis, as service for our customers is and will be even more important. This is a key element and this is also visible today in terms of trend of what we provided service to our customers. In the first quarter, we had 3 billion of net inflows because again it is quite and important service.</p>
          <p>Second things, we can like or not, but with &#x20AC;185 billion under management we are the 53rd company worldwide, there is 17 in Europe and we don't think that we are big enough in order to maximize the value of the company on one side and to maximize the quality of the service to our customers in terms of performance of the fund on the other side, in the sense that you are in the business, so you know better than me what this means in order to be the most attractive employer, what is need in order to add also a portfolio of products that non-necessarily you can have when you are a captive player in terms of completeness of the range of products balanced vis-&#xE0;-vis the cost and as I mentioned, of the single plans and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>We have the new CEO in Pioneer, and together we have decided to open the analysis in a formal way on strategic steps on Pioneer with all the, how should I say, serenity of working with a timeframe that will allow us to choose the best option, again for our customers and in terms of value for us. We are completely open to any options in the sense that for us there are two drivers. The first one is to be sure that the new company will be &#x2013; the new company &#x2013; shall we make an example? We will contribute Pioneer to somebody. We have to be sure that the new company will be the best in class in terms of the way the funds will be managed; and secondly, we have to be sure that the value for us, which means for you, is maximized.</p>
          <p>These are the two drivers. We're sure that is the right timing in order to start this analysis, because again in the future we think that this business will be in the end of &#x2013; or quite strong boutique and we are not or a large player that are capable to attract the best talents. We're in the middle and we think that this is exactly the right timing in order to start and also the right subjective situation because again, we're not in any pressure in terms of capital and so we're all the time and the capability of analyzing the best options.</p>
          <p>Now, I leave the floor to Sergio in order to talk of trading profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, trading condition in the first quarter was already quite challenging. You remember, we had a very good January environment. February was very tough in terms of both opportunities and client activity. March was again very good. So in terms of sustainability, looking also how the first quarter started, clearly one cannot talk about prediction. It's extremely volatile. April for sure was not &#x2013; was more to &#x2013; compared to February than the rest of the quarter average. Therefore, making forecast on this quarter and for the rest of the year remains a very challenging task.</p>
          <p>For sure, we expect client activity to be reduced, risk aversion and cautiousness is stepping in. I think that the for sure there are opportunities in terms of carry trade activities for which we have been reducing and we are taking a very conservative stance. And the other element of trading condition positioning is not an element that we are pursuing very aggressively. Therefore, clearly, I would say that with this risk appetite in the industry and volatile, overall I do expect trading condition to be quite challenging in the next quarters.</p>

          <p>Good morning. I have just one question, on the typical seasonality of loan loss provisions, given that the first quarter, shall we assume a typical seasonality to a higher level in the second quarter or is a rule that that's not applied to UniCredit or it's impossible to say? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>I think that trend of 2009 is really showing that for us there is no seasonality in the sense that we provide when is necessary if for seasonality you think you consider that, so it's related to the quarter or year-end results. So we are seeing an underlying improvement as is clearly visible from the chart page &#x2013; sorry, I'll go back, page 16, which I think is very important.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just two questions. Sorry to make another question again on the Italian retail provision. Just a clarification, if you can. It will be possible to know if the &#x20AC;420 million reported in Q1, how much refer to the small business other than retail? Second, a clarification on capital, when I look at the Tier 1 it seems to me that compared with the previous quarter pro forma Tier 1 capital is down &#x20AC;200 million. I understand that there are around 150, 200 million due to the accrual of the dividend, but then I don't get where the &#x2013; why Tier 1 is not top of the net income you reported in Q1. And last question, on Pioneer, I am not sure you can or you're willing to comment on this, but &#x2013; and you say that there is no rush for a deal. But do you have in mind sort of timeline or can you tell or give us a sense how advanced are &#x2013; is the analysis of this option or potential discussion with partners? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so your question, if I listened correctly, was, what is the weight of small business cost of risk within the first quarter loan loss provision. The number is in the range of &#x20AC;190 million, 190, so what &#x2013; out of a total retail of 422; one, it is the small business data. I can take advantage on this basis also to answer a question that was made before about the one-off volatility, let's say, of the provision in Q4 that was made at the beginning, to say that this one-off item was coming from a time value effect of 95 million in Q4 that was driven by the significant drop in interest rate. Drop in interest rate have impacted time value of &#x2013; to &#x2013; for a total of 95 million in the Q4 of 2009. That explains the lower number of Q4 2009 compared to the recent average.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking of capital, clearly there are many different elements, so it's slightly more complex with only accrued results less dividend, because really there is the evolution of risk weighted assets. There is as well the eventual gap of expected loss versus provision and on top of that for Tier 1 there is a buyback we did and then we have done &#x2013; also there has been after the quarter and within the quarter there has been a new issuance. So is...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there are many different guidance, we cannot consider that. On Pioneer, I lost you a little bit because you were talking of &#x2013; sorry, timetable because I understood at that moment I was asking myself about &#x2013; so, in terms of timetable, we &#x2013; today we have given a mandate to an investment bank &#x2013; the timetable is when there will be the best deal in terms of quality of the performance and value for us. So, there are no already than &#x2013; sorry, going back to the investment bank, as usual also CIB is involved, but CIB is involved in all our bills. So is &#x2013; but &#x2013; so &#x2013; and the timetable will be the time in relation to the opportunities. And this is &#x2013; as I said, we're not in a rush, we are not in a hurry. What is important is to do the best deal.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Anke from Execution. I just had a very few follow-up questions. Just on loan loss charges firstly, is it fair to summarize your comments in saying that the loan loss charges are likely to be the unrealized &#x2013; if we unrealized our first quarter, which would be 7.2 billion from your current point of view? And then I was just wondering, in terms of your provisioning policy, on a quarterly level is it largely a function of what you're actually seeing or is it to some extent especially in the first quarter results of your budgeting?</p>
          <p>Then just a tiny question in retail, it's early I was quite surprised about your deposit trend. I was just wondering what caused the decline, if there is anything that's just a one-off? And then just lastly, and I think with the question on the Pioneer, just that the number is right, is it &#x2013; should I compare basically any potential proceeds compared to the goodwill you have of 1.7 billion in the asset management division at a book value of investment of 1.8 billion? Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>1.7 times 4 would be a triumph of hope over experience, so I would not do that. I think the point that was made by Alessandro earlier and also Roberto is the following that, what we do see across the board is a slowdown in the deterioration of the portfolio. So within the performing portfolio, in terms of the negative migration, in terms of ratings, that is definitely slowing down, in some cases plateauing out. So what that essentially means is that we will still have lag effect for some while to go. The specific comment that Roberto made refers to the retail division, in particular the retail in Italy. So I would not jump to conclusions in terms of 1.7 times 4, nor will I conclude that it's going to pick up and get worse. I think these things looking out on that is not very prudent, so I think we will &#x2013; that would tend to amount to sort of giving your forecast, and definitely that is not the conclusion that you should walk away with.</p>

          <p>Yes, what you have been seeing has been a bit of a mix effect. In reality, we're seeing a positive trend inside deposits. They &#x2013; those ones that show the &#x2013; let's say, say a main banking trend relationship of our customers in line with the policy, we are proceeding of strengthening the quality of relationship. Where we have decreased the deposits has been in the repos where we took the decision not to be too aggressive for interest margin consideration. So, we are not offering very aggressive rates on deposits. So, on the most price sensitive part of the customer base we have been losing some assets, but it has been a completely deliberate decision.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Couple of questions also, if I may. First of all, again on Pioneer, I fully understand the rationale it makes complete sense, but the timing looks very difficult, if not terrible, if I may say so. If you look round Europe, you have a lot of banks trying to sell asset management or insurance, as he's trying to do so, Intesa has been trying for months to do so with failure and sometime they've tried to sell the asset management operation in the U.K. We might see other banks also trying to sell insurance or asset management operations. So it clearly, clearly a buyer's market and &#x2013; although you say you are going to &#x2013; or you would like to...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry if I interrupt you, but on the base of your reasoning which is perfect, there is an incredible mistake because you are talking of sales, not &#x2013; but we're not selling &#x2013; sorry, we're not selling &#x2013; if &#x2013; shall we assume that we will contribute Pioneer to another asset manager, is not the disposal and &#x2013; sorry, we are combining different entities, creating something stronger. And in three, four, five year's time, we will have not only the value what we have but also the values of the synergies. So, if you consider disposal, you are right. If you are talking of really finding a strategic new positioning of Pioneer, you are wrong. Sorry...</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's move on. The other question, interest rates and margins, you have quantified the potential impact of a parallel shift in the curve at around 400 and something million euros, which is around 3% of the group net interest income. I mean considering what is going on in Greece, in Europe, considering that problem that we have in Europe I think is less &#x2013; and less likely that we're going to see any movement in rates in the short-term and even if we do so, it is going to be quite a small one. So &#x2013; I mean, this impact of a 100 bps parallel shift is clearly marginal for your P&amp;L already -- I mean not important at all for your P&amp;L. What are you &#x2013; I mean, what is plan b in terms of trying to get some better revenue momentum, because I don't think it's going to come from rates in the next one or probably two years? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay. Marina Natale, our CFO, will answer to this question. Quite clearly, the margins on retail will remain incredibly under pressure. This is clear to all of us. But Marina will answer more in detail on what we can do in order to enhance the net interest margin.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's &#x2013; today it's a bit difficult and too early to draw conclusion as the investor behavior and pricing relationship, we need to find new levels. So, it's fair to say that as a preliminary trend we expect to have an impact on senior &#x2013; a highest form of volatility on senior, but &#x2013; and lower on the main sources of our funding, which are covered bonds and natural bonds. Before &#x2013; say, we don't see the current environment producing significant impact on the &#x2013; our NII in the next few months, but again as pointed out at the beginning, I think that we should wait a bit more in order to understand how the market will develop.</p>
          <p>In term of &#x2013; there is no plan B, so to answer to &#x2013; straight to your question, there is no clear plan B unless to have a strong focus on commission cost and all the other P&amp;L lines in order to support and to fund the lack of margin resulting from the commercial business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. May I ask one last question, related to Mediterranean exposure, you give us recently your exposure on sovereign bonds for all the relevant countries, but I would tend to think that the really relevant exposure is coming on the corporate lending side and probably on the interbank side. I mean you have an important lending interbank position. Could you give us &#x2013; I mean obviously we don't need to go to all the countries. I would say the most relevant are Greece because of the difficult situation and probably, Spain because of the size. Could you give us some indication of what's your exposure to both Greece and Spain in terms of corporate lending and interbank lending? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as I know, there are no information market-wise on such an element. And also, when we consider country exposure of customers, in reality we think it's not the meaningful because we have subsidiaries of core market players. I will give you an example, INL is an important customer in Italy, should been in Spain as well within data. So, it's not something that we do see in this perspective and we are not worried on what is our exposure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just a couple of questions left. First, the head count in the corporate center in Germany; I know you usually don't give figures for the corporate center broken down by country, but I was estimating about 7,000 STs and I was wondering if that is correct and if perhaps there is a potential to recover some profitability there?</p>
          <p>Secondly, UniCredit seem to have maintained a strict matching of assets and liabilities maturities, not having engaged in large character aids like many European peers. And also you are disclosing today a modest exposure to European countries with large deficits. Still I was wondering what you expect the impact from the last few weeks of market volatility to be in terms of GDP growth, in terms of interest rate outlook, and what could the consequences for banks' strategies? I know some comment have already been made, but I was wondering &#x2013; hoping to have some more color. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I confirm that we don't give the breakdown of staff &#x2013; of corporate center per country, also because what we consider corporate center is slightly different in one country or another. I will give you an example. In Germany, all the CRO function are considered as corporate center, also if they are in the network, while in Italy the CRO function while in the network are in the network. So the number are not precise in any cases, that 7,000 number you have in mind is completely wrong. But having said so, we are continuously going down in Germany as well &#x2013; quarter-on-quarter the reduction in the corporate center in Germany has been higher than 6%. So we are going down, but again it's mainly in this CRO function, which is on the ground, so is something partially misleading. In order to be sure that we are keeping under control all these things, we are not seeing corporate center versus network, but for instance we are working on CRO functions, CFO function, HR function, so as the competence plans are managed in a centralized way in terms of total cost of the function. So, it's not relevant if the people are in the corporate center or internet or &#x2013; what is relevant is that the operative cost of each of the function is under control and is probably managed just for you to be sure that we're overseeing this number in the proper way. This is also one of the reasons why we've a competence line that are solid line across all the geographies. So when we are &#x2013; I'm talking with the Head of any competence line, I'm talking with the Head of the competence lines across the group, not only Western Europe but as well in Central Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Impact on clearly &#x2013; of this new market situation in terms of strategy; first of all, we don't know how we will come out &#x2013; sorry, how the governments in Europe will come out from the actual situation, if they will come out with structural changes and fundamental changes that for sure it will mean a significant cap of budget expenditure and low interest rates, relatively lower cost of risk, so &#x2013; and potentially lower growth or if we'll come out with a monetary solution which means some inflation just to be clear and some that &#x2013; it will mean a different structure of the interest rates curve, maybe slightly higher cost &#x2013; or higher cost of risk and "less" &#x2013; lower short-term rates. So, these are something that is still unclear. In any case, what is clear to all of us is that the cost management remain a key element because clearly it's important. There will be a competition on the deposits. Economy of scale will remain fundamental. So, in relative terms we assume that we have an advantage. And also, it will be very important to have access to the market. Said in other words, we think that the large players do have some advantage vis-&#xE0;-vis the smaller player. Again in relative terms, seeing an environment that is not easy. We are completely aware of that.</p>
          <p>We think that the strategy we have on one side and &#x2013; which are clearly visible from the number. On one side, to reinforce the unity of the way we manage corporate investment banking, because the capability of cross-handling on our customers, to give an example, debt equity &#x2013; debt capital market services will be key or to work on the rate services for our customers. So I think that this is a key element and the potentiality we have also in Central Europe are quite strong.</p>
          <p>On the other side, on the family in the SME side, the investments we done in order to move transaction to &#x2013; out from the desk and to reinforce dramatically the interaction with customer via other channels, which is something that we are doing pretty well as well in Central Eastern Europe and the fact that we have the capability of picking up the best practice we have, for instance, for mobile banking in Croatia and moving elsewhere is something quite important. So, we think that all these elements, again in relative terms, will make the different &#x2013; the difference in an environment that is for sure very tough.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just one small question on the risk weighted asset or total asset growth. From the press release, it appears that the bulk of the growth did come from the securities and the interbank, whereby as you said customer loans were stable. So the question is, can we expect the something similar over the next quarters, driven by the fact that there is no loan demand, as you said, and therefore you did invest liquidity in the securities and interbank or this was justificated by strategic, pragmatic reasons that you could change over the next few quarters? And this relates also to my previous colleague questions that says that, Core Tier 1 did not increases, also because you pointed out by FX and the other factors. Can we expect that going forward there will be some increased in Core Tier 1, either because of less risk weighted asset growth or because of leverage shuffle of some of the elements that kept core capital growth in this quarter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, the loan demand is quite weak. So in &#x2013; to be very direct, the budget was for a growth in the loan portfolio, so it's really a matter of demand, not a matter of <mark type="inaudible" />. As we always said, we are selective in the sense that we don't want to lend money in order to destroy value. So &#x2013; and in this perspective, the discipline is quite strong, but the evolution we have seen in the first quarter is not a specific choice. So, it is really related to the demand as Federico was saying before. We are seeing some demand in Central Eastern Europe, mainly to &#x2013; the most active market is Turkey clearly, but we are seeing also something that's &#x2013; as well elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Western Europe, there is a growth in the mortgage &#x2013; retail mortgage. In Germany, in reality there is just moderate action, but when we enter in a breakdown we're seeing that we are going up on medium size companies and we are going down on the securities, which are in loan and receivables. On one side, we have repayments plus some large corporate. So in reality, in Germany, on the key customer base, so-called Mittelstand, we are growing a little bit in the future. So, the signals are pretty mixed. When we do see the PMI index, we are seeing something positive. So we're seeing some customer with good portfolio of orders. So, it is really difficult to foresee what we let and, say, feeling I have, but again it is a feeling more based on Amdocs talking with a customer or with some industrial association, is that the real economy is slightly better than what we're seeing from the finance point of view. But &#x2013; so it's too early to say if this will consolidate or not. Clearly, what we're seeing &#x2013; for instance, what we're seeing, this we can in terms of financial markets turmoil that can affect the confidence of the customers. So it is important.</p>
          <p>One signal that we do have which is in &#x2013; if you go to page 41 of the presentation when we are talking of global transaction banking, we have seen a good flow of foreign guarantees, which potentially &#x2013; the bullet on the right side of this page, which potentially is another indicator of improving business environment again. There are &#x2013; the orders must be confirmed, but today this is a good signal. So, again it's very difficult to foresee the future if we will have &#x2013; some "positive surprise" will come from the real economy. This is important &#x2013; an important element.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning to everyone. Just have a couple of follow.-up I would be very quick. The firs is on the CIB division, actually I see your net fees are picking up quarter-on-quarter and this might be because you are starting to cross-sell products as Mr. Ermotti mentioned some weeks ago in a presentation, but I see already net interest income down because of the, let's say, decrease of the <mark type="inaudible" />. I was just wondering, I think that this is a work in progress. How long it's going to be &#x2013; how long it's going to last and maybe we are going to see pressure for the next quarters again on the NII?</p>
          <p>On the loan loss provision, I see a reduction in basis points. I was wondering where it's coming from, maybe you can give us more color about the SMEs especially in Italy? Then I have a question on the provision. I was wondering whether you can break down the provisioning, gross provision and the write-back for the quarter? And last question is on cost, because we see costs starting to grow, again this is because of the salary inflation you mentioned before. I was wondering whether you can give us an update on the restructuring plan in the retail division in Italy, of course the timing and maybe also the magnitude of the cost savings? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sergio will start with CIB commission.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, on NII clearly when you look at the drop quarter-on-quarter, you have to assume that around 50 million, half of this is due to trading related items and a good 30% is due to basically the fact that we have had expiration on maturities of securities that we were in loan and receivables. So, the pull-to-par effect, which is accounted on the NII is not there any longer as we deleverage the balance sheet. The delta is basically due to lower margin on deposits and some more miscellaneous. The interesting point about NII going to your sustainability shows that basically the reduced loans' volumes are offset by re-pricing. So, in terms of your question on sustainability of the NII, in that respect those are the element driving going forward. The usual volatility we have in trading related interest may be there also in the future.</p>
          <p>So in respect of commission, of course this is something that we have been looking at. I think this is an overall trend in the industry. I think the large majority is coming from new transaction, particularly in project finance and leverage finance. Transaction is very small due to plain vanilla, so it is very much structured financing and the other element which accounts for 25%of this delta is coming from transactions banking as mentioned before by Mr. Profumo. So overall, I guess this is what concerns CIB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Then talking of gross write-down and write-backs, so we have a reduction in terms of write-downs in the first quarter and we have a pickup in terms of write-backs. So we have positive signals on both and this comes to the net number you have seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you quantify that? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have never provided these details, sorry, because unless we enter in &#x2013; on those quarter-on-quarter, not necessarily are meaningful, but I think what is important is the overall trend of cost of risk which is going down.</p>
          <p>Talking of restructuring plan in Italy, as we always said, the One for C project is focused on improving the service quality to our customers, and this is relevant. The streamlining of the operation is something which is already going up &#x2013; going ahead as you've seen also from the number of the first quarter, 1,300 people less in the retail network, and this process will continue, is mainly related to the fact that we're moving transaction from the front desk to other channels. So, this is a very, very important element. The &#x2013; clearly, the cost reduction we can, but we will start to see effects from next year because, as you know, the merger would be effective at the beginning of November this year.</p>
          <p>Then there was a question on SMEs Italy to which Roberto Nicastro will answer.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the reduction in basis point on the cost of risk that we expect definitely we'll see a reduction year-on-year. In this moment, it's a bit difficult to forecast the magnitude of the actual total reduction, but definitely 2009 has been seen as a peak and so next 12 months we will see a decline.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. All my questions have been answered, just one final if I may, and that's on revenues. My understanding is that revenues are not going to pick up in Italy and that's because loans growth is close to zero. I am just wondering if you can give us any guidance on what the revenue trend might be in C and Poland. In that division we've seen it decrease in the cost of risk, but we're still seeing flat revenues. What do you expect from the coming quarters? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said on the previous question, one of the major problems we're seeing this moment is lack of demand overall in term of loans, even though in some countries it seems after February that some pickups is ongoing. Expectation are for first half, so second quarter substantially in line with first quarter, so slight growth with improvement in the second half driven mostly by countries like Turkey, like Poland, Russia and Czech Republic plus some minor countries like Serbia, driven mostly by corporate side, later in this year by retail. Also in Poland, it was same trend, the first couple of months relatively quite and the better March. So the expectation is for improvement during the year, especially in the second half, in term of revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a follow-up question; given the lack of growth in Italy and the potential for growth in Italy, are you as a group prepared to reallocate capital out of Italy into C and to what extend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said when we presented the year-end results, we are in the process of redefining our long-term view of the group. So, the answer to your question for the first half is, yes. So, we will reallocate capital from Italy to Central Eastern Europe. The second part of the question in which amount, we will answer in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll add just a point about revenues. If you look, net interest income anyway are growing. So, where we are suffering versus previous quarters in &#x2013; is on the trading side where we have a very conservative approach. But again, volumes are not going to match, so we're constantly reprising the book. So, we keep a descent trend in term of net interest income that hopefully will improve in second half of the year.</p>

          <p>Good morning; two brief questions. The first one is on tax rate which came up at the high end the first quarter and you said it is a bit higher than the run rate we should expect for the whole year. I will ask if you can comment a bit on what kind of run rate you will expect for the full year? Second question is a follow-up on interest rates. How is that that is becoming clear to the market where the rebound is down, the monitory policy of the &#x2013; is not going to change within the short &#x2013; the next future. I am wondering if you can still share what you said in the last conference call that at least the anomaly, the gap existing in terms of your Euribor against the official rats is going to be absorbed in the foreseeable future or based on recent events such a gap is going to last longer than previously expected? Thank you.</p>

          <p>On tax rate, we recorded in the first quarter a tax rate of 38.6% and one of the two main drivers of this level has been the taxation in Italy because, let's say, maybe we ought to look at the other side of the coin, the level of profitability, which due to the low margin, is weak in Italy and as a result we have a heavy burden resulting from Europe and <mark type="inaudible" />. So, the tax rate going forward &#x2013; if you look at the one we recorded in the first quarter last year, it was not far away, so the level is close to 38% and we recorded an exceptional level in the fourth quarter due to several exceptional items.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you like to say that the overall tax picture is not relatively changed, it's broadly with a different mix in terms of new distribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hopefully, it should go down, but until the level of profitability related to the commercial activity will be weak in Italy we will have a significant burden resulting from &#x2013; in this area. So, it will &#x2013; we will have might be a different mix and should be slightly lower, but we cannot &#x2013; you cannot look at the level that you've seen in the fourth quarter as a reference point. So, it should be closer to the one we had in the first quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On interest rates, I think that with the actual scenario clearly, the guest will last for a longer period of time. This is quite clear. How long is not easy, but while at the beginning of the year we were seeing at the year-end an Euribor above the official rates, today we're seeing an Euribor below the official rate at the year-end. We can &#x2013; seeing that also in the first half of next year will remain as such really, hopefully not, but today it's better to be conservative.</p>

          <p>Hi, just one question on net interest income since nobody has asked. I will ask you again if you can give us some color on what your hedging policies are, and in particular if we can use the current level of net interest income for Q1 as the level for the year, assuming no growth in assets and no changes in rates, given that probably there is not going to be any? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Marina Natale will answer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So as in the last quarter, we are not disclosing the full set of number and the other point, your relation to the hedging policy, we have to stress the point that there is a huge expectation about the component of hedging policy on our NII, in reality, let's say, it's more lumpy. You should look at &#x2013; if we look at our portfolio &#x2013; replicating portfolio, it represent a small portion of our total assets, say, 4% and it represents a small portion of our total site saving deposits, so 18%. So if you keep in mind these two figures, you will realize that the contribution of replicating portfolio cannot be material on our NII, which will remain stable over, -- and not materially affected by the developments of the rates and the replicating portfolio developments.</p>

          <p>Hi, my question is a follow-up on a previous question. You gave the exposure that you have to Italian government bonds, 30 million now is &#x2013; it shouldn't be a source of concern because if I look at the bond market, basically prices are back at to the level that there is in March. So, there shouldn't be any issue for you from that. It would be interesting whether to complete this with your exposure to German government bonds as well as Austrian government bonds because in this case it's actually if the bond prices are an indication of what we're going to see, you should probably have some realized capital gains. So, if you can provide us also the amount for Germany, Austria and possibly also France government bonds. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, sorry. We will not provide all these details because we think that we will have to enter &#x2013; then you will ask how much fixed rate, how much variable rate, then how much &#x2013; so &#x2013; and in reality I think it's not proper to go in all these details. Again, we are by far the most transparent one in terms of information, but we have learnt that to enter in too many details at the end is misleading.</p>
