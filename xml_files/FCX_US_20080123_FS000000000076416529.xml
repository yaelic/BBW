          <p>Thank you, and good morning everyone and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Our earnings announcement was released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release is available on our website at fcx.com.</p>
          <p>Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and we've several slides as usual to supplement our comments this morning. We will be referring to the slides during the call and they are accessible using the webcast link on our fcx.com website homepage. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has also been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the call will be available by accessing the webcast link on our Internet homepage later today.</p>
          <p>Before we begin today's comments, I'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements. I'd like to refer all participants to the cautionary language included in our press release and slide presentation and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.</p>
          <p>Also on the call today are Jim Bob Moffett, Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Office; Tim Snider, Chief Operating Officer. We also have several members of our Senior Operations team with us today, who Richard will introduce in his comments. And it's our &#x2013; all of our great pleasure to be here today to talk about our spectacular year that we had in 2007 and to our outlook. I will start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will discuss our operations and outlook. We will then open the call for questions.</p>
          <p>Today, FCX reported fourth quarter 2000 (sic) [2007] income from continuing operations applicable to common stock of 423 million, $1.07 per share compared with 426 million, $1.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2006. For the year ended December 31st, 2007, we reported income from continuing operations applicable to common stock of 2.7 billion, $7.41 per share compared with 1.4 billion or $6.63 per share for 2006. Our 2007 financial and operating results include the wholly owned subsidiary, Phelps Dodge's results following our acquisition on March 19, 2007.</p>
          <p>Net income in the fourth quarter from continuing operations included net charges totaling $0.29 per share, 120 million which included 143 million or $0.35 per share for the effect of purchase accounting and a gain of 23 million or $0.06 per share to mark-to-market the copper price protection program. These contracts were financially settled in January 2008 for approximately 600 million, which concluded this program. Our fourth quarter results also included a reduction to revenues of 281 million; this was 137 million to net income, or $0.33 per share for prior-period adjustments to concentrate sales.</p>
          <p>Our sales during the quarter from our mines totaled 878 million pounds of copper, 161,000 ounces of gold, and 19 million pounds of molybdenum. We exceeded our previous estimates of 875 million pounds of copper, 100,000 ounces of gold, and 18 million pounds of molybdenum.</p>
          <p>Pro forma sales for 2007 included &#x2013; including the pre-acquisition sales from Phelps Dodge totaled 3.9 billion pounds of copper, 2.3 million ounces of gold, and 59 million pounds of molybdenum. Our realized &#x2013; recorded realized prices for copper before hedge adjustments averaged $3.12 per pound in the fourth quarter that was 4% higher that the year-ago quarter. Our recorded realizations were less than the market average price of $3.28, because they were heavily weighted to forward copper prices of $3.02 per pound at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our operating cash flows during the fourth quarter totaled 1.3 billion and over $6.2 billion for the full year. Capital expenditures during the quarter were just over 600 million and $1.8 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>In October, we completed the sale of our international wire and cable business, Phelps Dodge International Corporation, for 735 million. PDIC's operating results are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income and our assets and PDIC's assets and liabilities have been reported as held for sale in FCX's balance sheet.</p>
          <p>We fully repaid the remaining 1.55 billion in term debt at the end of 2007, bringing our total debt repayment since the March 2007 acquisition to over $10 billion. At year-end, our total debt approximated 7.2 billion and consolidated cash was 1.6 billion, compared with total debt of 8.7 billion and cash of 2.4 billion at September 30 of 2007. We've also included in our press release our preliminary estimate of consolidated reserves &#x2013; recoverable reserves of copper totaled 93.2 billion pounds, gold was 41 million ounces and molybdenum was 2 billion pounds at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to Richard who will be reviewing our operations and outlook and will be referring to the materials included on our &#x2013; on our website.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I want to really focus our call today on our outlook and comment on our fourth quarter results, but I think it's &#x2013; it is certainly worth noting just what a great year it was for FCX during 2007. We transformed the company from a company that had a single great asset in the Grasberg mine in Indonesia to now, the leading publicly owned copper producer in the world and we are very pleased about where the company is situated, about the longer-term markets that we are involved in, and about our growth prospects.</p>
          <p>We've made great progress during the year in successfully integrating Phelps Dodge and FCX into a single company where now, we have a single operating team, a single financial administrative team and that process has gone very well indeed.</p>
          <p>I have here with me today Tim Snider who has served as our President and Chief Operating Officer during 2007. Tim has had a very long and successful career in this industry and with Phelps Dodge, and has been key in helping us successfully integrate the companies. He is retiring April 1st and will &#x2013; but will continue to work with us on a consulting basis and we value his participation.</p>
          <p>We will have a senior management group now and the operating group who will serve the chief operating functions. Red Conger is here today who will be leading our &#x2013; who is leading now our operations in North and South America; John Marsden heads Freeport-McMoRan Mining Company, which deals with technology and exploration and construction and support functions for all of our businesses globally; Dave Thornton heads our Climax Molybdenum business, with excitement in that business including the restart of our Climax mine; and Mark Johnson is here, who is our Chief Operating Officer in Indonesia and has had a long career with Freeport. We have one other executive, Phil Brumit, who we've recently hired, had a long career with Newmont running their &#x2013; at one point in his career running their Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia who is now located in the Democratic Republic of Congo and leading our Tenke Fungurume Group. But that will be our operating management going forward.</p>
          <p>A couple of other broad comments. Kathleen mentioned the progress that we made in reducing our debt and repaying this $10 billion of term debt in roughly nine months from the completion of the transaction is a major step for us. When this time last year, we were targeting doing that within a three or four-year period, now we have that behind us and that allows us to be very aggressive now as we approach our business going forward. We are in an industry of where it's very difficult for companies to meet production goals and to add new production.</p>
          <p>We have a company where our production is growing &#x2013; it grew this year &#x2013; and I will be talking about the growth that we have in front of us from projects that we've already identified and we have a great set of properties and resources that we are now analyzing and considering how to develop those to add production beyond our current plans. We are generating substantial cash as our financial statements show. Our Directors increased our common dividend by 40% during the fourth quarter of '07. We now have an authorized 20 million share open market repurchase program for our common shares and particularly beginning in the second half of 2008, we are going to be generating excess cash flows.</p>
          <p>Slide four, you can see a series of charts that just illustrate the change in our business. Revenues grew from under $6 billion to roughly $17 billion in '07, net income from $1.4 billion, roughly doubled. Our cash flow went from less than $2 billion to over $6 billion as cash flow from operations after taxes and interest and the enterprise value from year-end 2006 to 2007 grew by four times. So, our company is a changed company, a strong company financially and one with good opportunities.</p>
          <p>Page five shows the nature of our business now where previously Freeport was a copper and gold company; we still have the largest gold mine in the world, but on a percentage basis, it represents roughly 10% of our pro forma revenues. Molybdenum which is a very &#x2013; which we are the leading producer in the world, we have great assets, great growth opportunities, is a positive contributor to our business. 78% of our revenues come from copper, two-thirds of that come from copper concentrate and one-third from SX/EW operations which Phelps Dodge over the years has been a technological leader in developing that process which allows us to profitably mine lower-grade deposits.</p>
          <p>A lot of our growth in the future is going to be sulfide ore bodies. We are the leaders in the development of technology for processing those ores and that's going to be a key to us as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Page five has the operating data comparing '07 with pro forma, that's combining Phelps Dodge and FCX for the fourth quarter of '06. As we had indicated, our volumes were lower in the fourth quarter than they have been or that they will be on average going forward. And all you have to do is go down to that chart at the bottom right side of page six and see the significant drop in volumes from Grasberg during the fourth quarter. We had over 400 million pounds of copper in the fourth quarter of '06, 183 this year over 500,000 ounces and 124,000 ounces more than projected. But that simply reflects the sequencing timing issues and for those of you who have followed Grasberg over the years, you understand this that at certain times, we have to mine the upper reaches of the mine in order to get to the very high grades at the center of the mine and that's what affected our volumes for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We actually, on a consolidated basis, met our projected targets for volumes during the fourth quarter and we consider the fourth quarter operationally to have been a very strong quarter. You can see that our volumes are roughly split between North America, South America and Indonesia, reflecting our operations and that we had good performance out of our Molybdenum business during the year.</p>
          <p>Our earnings came in this year for the fourth quarter below analyst consensus and there was one reason for that and that has to do with the fact that two-thirds of our copper sales are sold under industry standard contracts which provide that shipments are priced provisionally at the time they are shipped and ultimately settled over a one-to-three-month period following shipment. What this means for us is that about half of our sales in any quarter are going to be priced at the price at the end of the quarter and not at the average price during the quarter. The actual cash that we will realize will be roughly over time at the average price but for accounting purposes, at the end of the quarter, we accrue sales and for half of those sales, it comes in at the price at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter '07 was a quarter in which the spot price of copper began the quarter at 3.70 and ended the quarter at 3.01. That meant during the fourth quarter, there was the downward adjustments for the accrued sales we had during the end of the quarter and half of our sales were recorded at $3, roughly a pound which was less than the average pounds for the quarter.</p>
          <p>We have the details for that here but here we had a quarter in which we met our production guidance, our costs were in line with expectations, and the financial results simply reflect the pricing in the marketplace. Prices have now &#x2013; have risen during January and as those provisionally-priced contracts are settled, they will have the benefit of the prices whenever they settle. And during the first half of January, they were higher than they were at the end of December. So I just wanted to make that point for that.</p>
          <p>On page eight, we again show our annual sales, you can see how the sales are divided between our North American mines, South American mines, Grasberg and our annual unit cost. Unit costs reflect volumes and because of the lower volumes in Grasberg this year, its costs reflect that. Throughout the industry, everyone has been infected by input cost and we are as well, diesel cost, coal cost, labor cost, all reflected in this number. For the year, our consolidated net cash cost, net of by-product credits, the gold and molybdenum credits, were $0.75 a pound which is certainly an attractive cost number for an industry where the average selling price was well over $3 a pound.</p>
          <p>Our reserves are presented on page nine. This year, we have priced reserves using a copper price of $1.20; last year, Phelps Dodge used $1.05 and Grasberg used $1. In addition to the increase in prices, the reserve calculations, which are an economic determination as well as a physical determination, reflect the higher cost of input. So there is higher commodity prices, higher input cost. As a result of our drilling activity and price changes, our reserves of copper were essentially the same at the end of the year as at the beginning of year, additions and revisions essentially offset production, 90% of production at least. Molybdenum reserves were slightly higher and gold reserves went from 42.5 to 41 million ounces.</p>
          <p>Interesting at the bottom to see what our reserves were doing over longer periods of time, and you can see the company has done a great job &#x2013; or the companies have done a great job in maintaining the reserve position. Our reserves are split between North America, South America and Indonesia as indicated on the chart on the right side of the page.</p>
          <p>Markets &#x2013; there is lots of questions about markets today because of the turmoil in the financial industry and what impact that might be having on the overall U.S. economy. With our business today, we are continuing to see tightness in the copper marketplace. The U.S., beginning at the end of 2006, saw the impacts on copper consumption or the slowdown in the residential marketplace, and the slowdown in the U.S. automobile industry. Today, the copper demand in the U.S. from non-residential construction and other uses continues to be relatively strong. It will certainly be affected about the course of the &#x2013; questions there.</p>
          <p>Globally, China continues to lead in the world's copper demand and growth was extraordinary during the years in China. Global inventories remained very low, a bit lower today than they were a year ago, and the copper price is stronger today than it was a year ago, and so we are approaching the world with a very positive long-term view about our commodities. We believe that we can focus on developing supplies, maintaining production in all of our existing mines and be in a position to benefit from these positive markets for our shareholders as we go forward.</p>
          <p>For 2000 &#x2013; turning to page 11, for 2008, we are looking to produce 4.3 billion pounds of copper, 1.3 million ounces of gold and 75 million pounds of molybdenum. Using $3 copper, $800 gold and $30 spot price for molybdenum, that would indicate operating cash flows for our business of $5 billion.</p>
          <p>Our cash flows for 2008, operating cash flows will be affected by significant working capital uses during the first half of the year. We have paid the final payment on the historical Phelps Dodge copper price protection program and we had to write a check for $600 million in January, that's reflected in this number. There's also significant cash taxes that were paid. So we will &#x2013; by the second half of the year, we will be generating very substantial cash flows; three-quarters of our cash flows will come in, in the second of the year on this model basis. We have capital expenditures which reflect all of our expansion projects that I will be talking about estimated at $2.4 billion for 2008.</p>
          <p>The debt reduction is illustrated on page 12. At the time of the acquisition, we had $17.6 billion of debt, $10 billion of term loans, $6 billion of senior notes as well as the remainder being existing debt that came over from the companies. We have now paid off $10 billion of that and really have remaining only the $6 billion of notes and other long-term debt for the company. We are at the capital structure that we were targeting when we did the transaction. Now our cash flows are going to be focused on investment activities and to the extent that we have excess cash flows, we will be in a position of following our historical practice returning those to shareholders.</p>
          <p>We are really excited about our development opportunities for this company. On page 13, we began a discussion of those, the Safford Mine in Safford, Arizona, first new mine developed in the United States in many years, so 12 years of Phelps Dodge work to get the rights to develop this mine. Construction is complete in all material respects; we started up the processing facility in the fourth quarter producing copper in December. This project is designed capacity of 240 million pounds a year and it's a very efficient operation and will be a good contributor to our company.</p>
          <p>We are starting a historical mine in a historical mining district with the Miami Mine. We expect to produce 100 million pounds of copper a year about 2010. This operation will facilitate the ongoing reclamation activities that we've had in this area from historical operations as well as contributing cash to our company from the investment that we are doing.</p>
          <p>At Morenci, the flagship mine of the U.S. copper business for 100 years, we have restarted an historical mill, added a new processing facility using new technology developed by Phelps Dodge to reach concentrate from this mill facility. The mill has a designed capacity of 54,000 tons per day and we are approaching that. We continue to ramp up the Leach Plant. This project will add 115 million pounds of copper annually and help our cost profile there and give us great experience to then use as we go forward with other expansion opportunities.</p>
          <p>I mentioned when I introduced Dave Thornton that they restarted the Climax Molybdenum Mine, this is again a historical mine which has been one of the great mines in the history of the U.S. mining industry, hasn't operated in a number of years. After completing a feasibility study, we are now embarking on a restart of this operation. It's not developing a brand-new mine but we've been processing the water that's coming out of the historical mining facility. $500 million project, it's an open pit operation with very attractive cash cost for a commodity which is currently selling for over $30 a pound with cash cost of $3.50 a pound.</p>
          <p>The initial project is designed with the new mill that we are constructing to produce 30 million pounds of Molybdenum a year. The resource is there to double that and we are going to be monitoring the marketplace and reaching decisions on further expansions of that operations as we go forward, but this is the largest highest-grade undeveloped moly resource in the world and it is going to be a great asset to go along with our Henderson Mine and our by-product moly production to allow us to continue to be the leader in that marketplace.</p>
          <p>The Cerro Verde Mine in Peru, $900 million project completed just over a year ago. Second half of the year, it was operating at capacity, tripled its production level to over 400 million pounds a year. It has a moly component that we will be bringing to the marketplace during 2008, continuing to do exploration drilling there and looking for further opportunities to expand this great ore body.</p>
          <p>In Chile, the El Abra Mine which has been a very positive producer from the oxide ore body that's there has a significant sulfide ore body that we are now looking to develop which would extend the line life significantly. We are working with the government on the environmental impact of this project; again, it's not a new mine but an alteration and expansion of an existing mine that will be &#x2013; that we will look forward and moving forward with with our partner Codelco with that mine.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, we are continuing with our work underground. Today, the DOZ Mine which is the current producing underground mine, we've now been block-caving underground at Grasberg &#x2013; in the Grasberg area for 20 years now very successfully. The DOZ Mine went from 25,000 tons a day to 35,000 tons a day nameplate, completed a 50,000 ton expansion mid last year, actually operated that over nameplate at 59,000 tons per day in the fourth quarter, hit 80,000 tons per day on at least one day and now we are going to be looking to expand it to 80,000 tons per day on a consistent basis. That makes this a very, very large block-cave mine by any standards around the globe. Great indicator of the future of the Grasberg district when the Grasberg &#x2013; following the depletion of the Grasberg pit in roughly 2015.</p>
          <p>To be prepared to deal with the transition underground, we've been developing this common infrastructure project which is getting very near completion to drive a new added at 400 meters below our existing added to get to the underground reserves below the Grasberg and we will be beginning development activities for the Grasberg Block Cave in the first half of '08. We are also developing a smaller stoping mine at Big Gossan which will be in production about 2010. At the same time, we are enhancing our mill using high-pressure grinding roll facilities to &#x2013; with our older mill line to improve this productivity and taking further steps to improve this mill facility which is the industry's largest mill facility globally.</p>
          <p>Then we &#x2013; on the other side of the world, in the middle of Africa, we are really excited about what we have to work with, with the Tenke Fungurume concession in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This is a very large concession, 600 square miles. It's a project that where we are continuing to do exploration, drilling and analysis of the ore body which has very high grades of copper and gold on near surface and while we are engaged in an initial project which is a good project, $900 million project, we are targeting bringing it online initially during 2009 to produce 250 million pounds of copper and 18 million pounds of cobalt annually.</p>
          <p>The real focus here is where we go beyond this initial project, how aggressively can we define the ore body, develop the logistic systems, put the resources in, work with the government on all the issues that involve doing business where we are physically located but this is an ore body that has a chance of joining the Grasberg as one of the world's great ore bodies and that's what we are committed to pursuing and doing so aggressively. I mentioned we've hired a new President in Phil Brumit. We've also brought &#x2013; bringing over a number of people who are experienced in the expansion that we did at the Grasberg during the 1990s. We are going to leverage off that experience on how to deal with the community issues, the employee issues, as well as the production and logistic issues of developing this great ore body and it's something that we are tremendously excited about.</p>
          <p>Immediately after we completed the merger, we began an ore body-by-ore body review of each of the producing and historical ore bodies in the Phelps Dodge portfolio of assets, and we are continuing with that project. We are looking to first, see what kind of information we have to understand the geology of these ore bodies, and in a number of cases, we are significantly expanding our core drilling to understand those ore bodies and what further expansion opportunities may be available to us, what kind of additions to reserves can we do, how can we then translate reserves into cash flow producing assets? Today, we are announcing a first step in that process.</p>
          <p>We are looking at incremental expansions beyond those previously announced at Morenci, Sierrita, Bagdad, and Cerro Verde. These are relatively small projects, but in total, they will involve capital of $400 million, incremental annual metals that will &#x2013; when they reach full operations of over 200 million pounds of copper and 7 million pounds of moly, very attractive rates of returns on these projects. So we are going &#x2013; we are already &#x2013; these are approved by our Board. We are spending money on them, we're moving forward with these projects, and then at the same time, John and his team working with our operating groups are now looking to see what potential larger-scale expansion projects might be available to us, as we look at all the issues that go into expansions, the economics, the geology, the technology, the land rights and water uses, all of those types of issues we'll collect there.</p>
          <p>Page 19 illustrates what opportunities we might have available. I mentioned earlier, we have over 90 billion pounds of recoverable copper reserves at $1.20. We will be reporting in our 10-K a resource at $1.50 of mineralized material that has contained copper of 100 billion pounds, and that's what gives us these opportunities to look for further expansions of our reserves and our production facilities.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to explore through substantially increasing our exploration budget. This year, we've spent just under $120 million, and next year, we plan to spend $175 million. This is principally drilling activity in North America. We are going to be focusing on Morenci as well as the Lone Star deposit which is a very large indicated ore body adjacent to the Safford Mine, which we are doing drilling on now. In South America, it's Cerro Verde and other places. In Africa, the Tenke Fungurume, we have a greenfield project nearby in a prospect we are calling Kisanfu and then continuing our exploration in Indonesia, in areas adjacent to and at depth of the Grasberg and then outside of the Grasberg's producing areas.</p>
          <p>Exploration really is what ultimately distinguishes a natural resource company. It's what built our company and it's what we are going to use to build our company going forward in the future. Tenke Fungurume is a tremendous exploration prospect. We've identified a project. We are looking for further projects to go forward there as I mentioned. In Indonesia, we have the rights to over 2 million acres that lie outside of Block A of the PT-FI COW, where the Grasberg is located. Grasberg is the only mine on the Western half of Papua. Same geological features that created the Grasberg were at play throughout the mountains that go through there and we are continuing to explore there. We also have other greenfield projects around the world that we are looking at.</p>
          <p>Page 22 just gives some details of the diamond drilling we are doing with ten drill rigs at Tenke Fungurume, where we are going to be very aggressive in pursuing this and understanding what the geology gives us and what the projects would be going forward.</p>
          <p>Page 23 is a chart I think that's indicative of what we are about as a company and why we wanted to combine these companies and go forward. We are looking at increasing copper production from 2006, 3.6 billion pro forma, 3.9 last year, 4.3, 4.5, 4.8, that's not something you see typically in this industry. These are projects that are approved and we are spending capital on, and beyond that, we are looking for other ways to expand longer term to enhance our operations.</p>
          <p>Looking forward into 2008 itself, I mentioned how our volumes will be back-end loaded this year. You can see that on page 24, where we will have a first quarter from a volume standpoint that will be very similar, very similar to the fourth quarter of '07, then increasing in the second quarter with really strong operations in the fourth quarter &#x2013; third and fourth quarters. Fourth quarter should see us at over 1.2 billion pounds of copper, 600,000 ounces of gold, and this will be similar to what we were during the first half of 2007 with the Grasberg's operations.</p>
          <p>Page 25 shows the vision of our volumes by region. It also shows our net unit cost. Unit costs again reflect obviously the lower volumes that we have &#x2013; we have had for copper and the increase in the unit cost inputs as we go forward. It also shows the by-product credits from molybdenum and gold. Unit costs on this basis are projected to be at $0.96 a pound.</p>
          <p>From a cash flow standpoint, we continue to have the opportunity to generate very strong amounts of cash flow. Page 26 shows that at $3 copper, as we go forward, the annual average operating cash flows for 2008-2009 would be $6 billion. You can see the variations with different prices and on the following page, we have, for your use, the sensitivity to commodity prices or changes in those units, and you can see we are very highly leveraged to copper.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures, as I mentioned for 2008, on slide 28, are projected at $2.4 billion and as we then begin completing our projects, our current budgets provide for significant reductions in 2009-2010 in capital expenditures. Now what we hope is that we can find new projects, new opportunities to spend capital on profitably as we go forward and that's what we are working &#x2013; working to do.</p>
          <p>Page 29 then comes back to just how strong our cash flows are. If we look at our cash flows, that would be operating cash flows reduced by our known capital expenditures, and look at the cash required for our annual dividend now, $1.75 a share in our preferred dividends, you can see at $3 copper, we will be generating excess cash flows on an annual basis of in excess of $2 billion a year and that is really a significant amount of excess cash.</p>
          <p>Financial policy has been clear-cut and one that we are maintaining. We are going to have a strong financial position. We believe &#x2013; we are optimistic about our markets going forward. A year ago, if you had said that copper was over $3 a pound now it would have been something we would have been very happy about and yet, we are at $3 a pound and still worldwide inventories are low. The outlook for the metal long-term is very positive, considering the dynamics of how copper is used around the world and in particularly, the challenges the industry is having in producing copper.</p>
          <p>So, we are optimistic about future copper markets, and strong markets would allow us to have ample cash to invest in new projects, to continue to look for opportunities on an economic basis to reduce debt. We really don't have maturities to deal with and then to provide cash for our shareholders. And we are committed to our longstanding tradition of maximizing value for shareholders. I mentioned the increase in the dividend, the share purchase program and we will be reviewing market conditions, the performance of our company, and the cash availability on how to execute this finance policy as we go forward.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to open the line for questions and we look forward to responding to your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from the line of John Hill of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead sir, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks and good morning everyone, and thanks for a detailed presentation as always. Since it's I guess Tim's last go around on an earnings call and we will certainly miss him and his steady-handed detailer with the operations, can we talk a little bit about an aggressive approach to projects in the Southwest U.S., Sierrita, Bagdad, Miami? You had a conservative approach to reserves at $1.20. Can we &#x2013; there are some sensitivities in the slides. Can we talk about how new or old these expansion projects are and then, what the sources of sensitivity in reserves are and where we should look for the biggest upside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see. The approach that we've taken, John, and thank you for your comments, is I think illustrated by the fact that we have begun this project of reviewing opportunities and we are taking it in steps. We are looking at undertaking the projects that I mentioned, which will first of all be good rates of return projects in and of themselves for the capital that we are committing and they would be good projects at much lower copper prices than we have today. But at the same time, they are also setting us up to be in a position to more aggressively pursue the bigger projects that are available to us, and a number of these projects are sensitive to prices. If you just see that and the resource number that we gave to you, and as we go forward, we are going to be seeing how we can approach it based on the market conditions as they progress. Based on the progress we make with these initial steps, we're looking at technology to see how that can help us achieve this, the work that we have done with the high-pressure grinding rolls is a big forward step in energy efficiency for milling operations. The work that we are doing with the concentrate leach has potential application to a number of these projects.</p>
          <p>We continue to do work with process technology and with mine technology to be more efficient, all of which in addition to positive prices allows us to go forward with it. The great thing is, we have the resources that are available to us. It's not a question of having to go out and do exploration. And while we do have issues related to some land rights issues and water issues and permitting issues, those issue aren't nearly as challenging as they are, when you are starting up a brand-new mine in a new area of operations. So, we believe this is a great opportunity for us to take steps towards getting higher volumes and then be in a position to move on larger projects. And we will be reporting on our analysis to you on an ongoing basis every quarter. You will understand exactly where we stand with these &#x2013; with this process.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, it's a great answer. And then just on that subject, on Climax, anything new in terms of the approval process and how confident are we, that we can adhere to the time table that's been laid out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, hang on one second, I think Jim Bob had an addition to your earlier question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I just wanted to &#x2013; it's Jim Bob Moffett, I just want to add to Richard's comment and emphasize what he said about the fact that this is not like exploration because in the case of all the ore bodies that we've discussed, we've got our drill holes as defined mineralized material. What we are doing with our program, 75% of our exploration budget is actually on exploitation. There is a sheath of ore underneath all of proven ore that just needs more density of core drilling in order to be able to quantify it for proved reserves.</p>
          <p>So, packing on would be a word I would use to the existing ore bodies is much different than exploration, but if you look at our monthly report on core ore analyst analysis when we've an assay, you thank you &#x2013; these are all exploration, and you're getting intercepts anywhere from 0.5% to 1% copper and the stuff we are doing in Africa, the core holes that have been analyzed average 3 to 5% copper and 0.5% to 2% cobalt. So, we have &#x2013; in our efforts here, we have the opportunity to be drilling exploration-type intercepts on exploitation wells, which will bode great in the future for the things you were talking about and Richard referred to where we said, we have got opportunities to expand our resources without having to go out and find new ore bodies.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. Climax is important to us. One of the great things about Climax is just the incredibly positive reception that the restart of that mine has received in the local community and by the State of Colorado, which is unusual obviously for natural resource companies today. But this is an area that was &#x2013; had a tradition of mining and really needed the economic velocity that the new mine is going to provide. But Dave, why don't you just make a comment on permitting process?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur of UBS. Please go ahead sir, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just first wanted to talk about a couple of things. First of all, on cost, I noticed year-over-year, you've got your TC/RCs down from $0.21 to $0.15 and I see just press have been commenting that you've just settled a lot of terms. I assume that 21 to 15 reflects all those new terms that you have just negotiated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's correct. In today's world, there is a tremendous shortage &#x2013; a tremendous shortage of concentrate for the world's smelters and so the smelter rates which once, just two years ago were receiving very high returns because of the structure of the contracts with price participation provisions are now being renegotiated with an absence of price participation and rates that are approaching historical low levels. Again, that's just a reflection of the tightness of the availability of copper concentrates coming out of mines. But yes, it does reflect that in those numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, can I assume most of it's in contract &#x2013; Grasberg contract, the Candelaria's contract and everything is pretty well contracted, so that's pretty hard number right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a number that &#x2013; yes, that reflects that considering our current state. You know that certain of our mines including Grasberg have some long-term concentrate contracts and have some minimum rates and about 30% of Grasberg's production goes into the smelter at Gresik, which under its original financing has a minimum rate which is averaged into those numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And I was going to ask you about that. Doesn't that eventually pay out, would have earned the capital return, I don't when that occurs or is that --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It had a time limit where that expires in '08. So we will be dealing with that as we go forward with our partners there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. And the second question is just on site costs at Grasberg, I mean they have trended up an awful lot over the year, from $1.14 in the second quarter, $1.66 in the fourth quarter and I realize volumes have gone down from 334 million pounds to 183. So there is a big volume effect, but could you just maybe just elaborate if there is an other extraordinary, other than oil, the regular stuff that's causing costs there to go up dramatically or is it just all volume and natural input cost increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just that. I mean, Brian, the volumes obviously, if you have X divided by Y and Y is half. I mean the volumes are going to go up just by arithmetic.  But also the Grasberg over the years is now a mature mine. It's a kilometer deep, it's 2.5, 3 kilometers across. So hauls are longer, that means you burn more fuel. You have more &#x2013; in those conditions particularly, with the weather and altitude, maintenance costs on trucks are high. We work every day to try to be efficient and reduce costs. But there are just over time some natural elements going through and then <mark type="inaudible" /> the market for that. That's what it is, steel cost or steel balls in the mills or what they are. So it's nothing unusual there other than the volume factors and the general factors that affect input cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Two other just real quick easy questions; just following up your slide on page 28 which gives your capital expenditures, I mean I assume obviously Climax and Tenke and I assume the new expansions in the U.S. Southwest are all in there. But I just wanted &#x2013; and Miami is in there. Is there El Abra in those numbers yet? Have you effectively decided to do the sulfide and is that in those capital programs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's in there. I mean we are still working on the environmental impact statement and so forth. But that project is one we have a lot of confidence in and those numbers are in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my final one, just to be very clear that I heard you correctly, when you talk about your operating cash flow this year of 5 billion which was after cash taxes and everything else; did I &#x2013; and I also hear you say that after the 0.5 billion or the 600 million that you paid out on the old Phelps Dodge puts, so it includes that one-time payment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It includes that &#x2013; it's 600 million this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was 800 million in the first quarter before the merger, in the first quarter of '07 and in January, we paid the final installment. There are no more derivative contracts for our mining operations whatsoever. And that 600 million is there and that's the difference between the 500 million &#x2013; the 5 billion and $6 billion of annual cash flows, we have been talking about $6 billion at $3 copper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Great, thank you very much, Richard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Victor Flores of HSBC. Please go ahead sir, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Good morning. I have a couple of questions, the first one is fairly simple. Could you update us on what the status is of some of the discussions that were being held in the Democratic Republic of Congo with respect to licenses; and have they said anything to you, because that whole thing went sort of quiet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has gone quiet and we have not heard official word from the government about that process. We have a lot of confidence about our contract, about the equity of that contract from the perspective of the government and our shareholders. I can tell you that the government is actively encouraging us to go forward with our projects and to go forward faster and bigger, because the country is in dire need of employment and economic activity and taxes and royalties. So we are hearing nothing, but encouragement from the government about going forward with our project. We have not had official word on the status of the contract review, but we believe our contract is a fair one for all parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So no news is good news?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously the best news would be to get official word on it and indications are at some point, we will. But it is not, I guess, Victor, the good news of it is, we are not slowing down anything. We are spending money, we are putting resources, we are in construction. We want to get this thing on stream and we are not delaying any exploration work or further evaluation work. We want to see how quickly we can go to the Phase II project, Phase III project, and Phase IV project. So, that's &#x2013; we are not slowing down at all because of this government review process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. A follow-up question actually has to do with the production profile and Brian just asked you about what &#x2013; which of these new projects are included in the capital profile and my question goes to the production profile; of some of these things that you've mentioned, which are the incremental production expansions at Morenci, Sierrita, Bagdad, and Cerro Verde, are those included in that production profile that you put through 2010, and is Tenke included in that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to your question is, yes. Obviously, it's a ramp up. We are actually going to be able to get volumes out of Morenci relatively quickly, but it will be about 2010, 2011 when we get to the full production, which actually ultimately gets over 300 million pounds a year. The average was 200, but that's what we are working towards getting that and we have some volumes for Tenke and beginning in 2009 but at a full rate in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and then just is the El Abra sulfide included in any of those figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is, but it's a longer-term project. It really &#x2013; we still have oxide ore that will be the source of volumes through this timeframe. What the sulfide project does is give us the extension of that life for ten years beyond, when we otherwise would have had been depleted. So it does not add near-term volumes, but it adds significant reserve volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thank you very much, Richard.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations on stepping up from 26 to 55 rigs operating near existing mines. Could you give us a review of &#x2013; in '07, how those rigs were allocated by location and in '08, what the allocation would be? It's very exciting to hear that you are adding 29 rigs near the mines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, that's the &#x2013; I could talk about it in broad terms. In broad terms, as we did this and as Jim Bob talked about, we began initially looking at what was available to us potentially from the existing mines.  And so, we have &#x2013; and also, we are now &#x2013; as you can appreciate, we are a larger company than either Phelps Dodge or Freeport was previously. So, in that context, in terms of looking at particularly greenfield projects, but also in terms of looking at certain brownfield projects, the projects have to be of a larger size to be impacting.</p>
          <p>So, we have allocated rigs away from smaller projects, particularly away from smaller greenfield projects, to areas that we believe have the most potential of having significant additions to reserves. And what that's led us to doing is really putting more resources at Morenci, more resources at Lone Star in the Safford area, at Cerro Verde where we've had a very significant drilling program and a real excitement about drilling there and then we are going to go all out with resources in terms of looking at Tenke Fungurume, and there is no limit to &#x2013; there is no budget limitations for us on exploration. It's a question of how do you effectively deploy resources and process the information. We are going after it as aggressively as we can go after it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Rich, is it fair to say that the emphasis is at the four locations you are saying rather than Candelaria or El Abra or Sierrita or Bagdad or Chino/Cobre?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are still drilling at Candelaria. Basically, the resource for our project has been defined at El Abra, still some work going on there. We are certainly looking at Sierrita and doing active drilling in that area and then drilling to a lower extent in some of smaller mines to see what we have there. So we have a broad-scale program, but I was just talking about the strategic emphasis is going to be in those areas where we have the opportunity of having larger-scale projects.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did. I think I did say that we are not going to have any limitations on what we are doing at Grasberg. I mean we are drilling there, we are back out in outside Block A this year and the fact that we've put more rigs in Africa doesn't have any impact on what we are doing in Grasberg. I mean we are looking at &#x2013; we are going after it just the same way we were or would have done, had we not done a merger.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line Lawrence Jahn of Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead sir, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wanted to touch on the revenue adjustments. I guess starting with Indonesia, if you go to Exhibit XVIII on a per pound of copper basis, there is essentially a loss of $0.35. I just want to confirm that those are the revenue adjustments related to the difference between provisional pricing and final pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct. That's the fact that &#x2013; and there is accepted accounting standards of how you deal with this. The SEC has been involved in directing how this was done. So, that means that going in &#x2013; at the end of the third quarter, we used forward market copper prices to price the open pounds in Indonesia. Those pounds basically priced during the fourth quarter and because the price went from 3.70 to $3 at lower prices, then you had that downward adjustment. In the third quarter and earlier quarters, the price goes up, you get the upward adjustments. That's what that is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in theory &#x2013; I know you are positive on the outlook, but in theory, if copper pricing continues to decline below the $3 level, you'll kind of have a double whammy hit of 50% of your sales at spot and then the other 50% there would be another revenue adjustment downward. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in theory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's spot. When you look at the overall numbers and the difference between the consensus analyst expectation and where we are, it's the fact that half the production during the quarter gets priced at the quarter-end price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry for using the term spot, that was incorrect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, yeah, it's either a double whammy or a double goodie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The price goes up or the price goes down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's just an accounting convention. The actual cash that we realize from these contracts is spread over the periods. It's a delay from shipment by the one-to-three month open quotational period and that can either work to be to our benefit in a rising price environment or it would be lower if the prices drop in relation to the date of shipment. But just &#x2013; this is just an accounting convention and you've accurately described how it works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to be clear, in South America, you had a similar what I would say hit of $0.40 per pound of copper. But in North America, I really didn't see &#x2013; I only saw $0.07 per pound hit. Can you --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the reason for that is in North America, we essentially produced copper cathodes through SX/EW operations. It's a bulk of our business and so you don't have &#x2013; and then, we convert that cathode into rod and we provide just under half of the copper rod to the United States market. So you don't have the concentrate open pounds situation. Those are sold at prevailing prices at the time they are shipped to customers. And in South America, we produce both copper cathode at El Abra and then, we produce concentrates at Candelaria. We also produce concentrates at Cerro Verde and they have the impact that's like we do in Grasberg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That goes with my point about why I said about half of our copper is priced that way, because of the mix of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, that's great. I appreciate the clarification. And then lastly, as we think about free cash flow in the first half of the year, and specifically in the first quarter, I just want to confirm that the $600 million settlement of the copper hedging will essentially be a reduction of payables and will be picked up in working capital, so the hit &#x2013; the cash impact will be hit in working capital. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's already happened.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just have a quick question to clarify the CapEx spending in '08. I know that you guys have given some good detail about how much you will spend on each of your expansion projects, but is there any way you could clarify what the largest expenditures for projects will be in '08? In other words, which of the expansion projects will be represented, I guess by most of that 2.4 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me see here. The biggest chunk is going to be at Tenke Fungurume, which will be roughly $500 million; the Climax restart, which is roughly half of that; and the underground mine development at Grasberg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then it seems from &#x2013; I think even consensus estimates and certainly the way we run our numbers that you guys have more than sufficient cash flow to finance CapEx, and I was just wondering if you would think about drawing down on any bank lines to fund it. It doesn't seem necessary but would you have another reason to keep more cash on hand rather than using cash from operations for CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We have no need to keep cash in the business and we are going to use all of our available cash. We still, because of the timing of cash flows, expect that we will have some draws under our credit facility during the first half of the year and those would be fully repaid in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's just because of the $600 million payment and then uses of working capital for other reasons too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is three factors; one is our volumes are split, one-quarter in the first half and three-quarters in the second half. So, you've got lower volumes in the first half. The second reason is the $600 million payment and the third reason is other working capital uses. Principally, we made so much money last year that we were writing governments around the world, big cash checks for taxes and those were being paid in the first half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's not too bad a reason to have to have to use your cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not complaining.  We are &#x2013; in all of this turmoil that's going around the world as we look at our business, as we talk to our customers, as we look at just thinking back about where we were a year ago and what risk we might be facing, we don't see the world quite as badly as a lot of people &#x2013; as kind of maybe the general consensus view is right now. We understand the risk, but we are just real happy about where our company is financially and operationally and from a growth standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I just have one last quick question. Could you update us on the labor situation in Latin America? I know that there are some new issues with sub-contract workers down there, not particularly with your mines but some core decisions that could maybe change your labor costs there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, right. Well, we do have labor contracts for our workers that are coming up for review this next year &#x2013; in the next year. We have less significant use of contractors in our operations than some of the other miners there and over time, we have had a policy of increasing the work done by our employees and decreasing contractors, and we are continuing to do that. That is a factor for the industry there, but from our standpoint, we have good relationships with our workforce and our contractors, and we feel good about being able to respond to the changing conditions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy of Jefferies &amp; Company. Please go ahead. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but in terms of the stock repurchasing, that looks like it's about 1.5 billion. Is that at all price sensitive in terms of sort of when you wander into the market? And do you plan on doing all of that during early 2008, all of 2008, can you give some sense of timing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me summarize that. We have historically executed our cash purchases of shares in the marketplace, as we generate cash and in response to market conditions. From the conversation that I have just had about the cash flow generation of our business, we are not going to be generating excess cash during the first half of the year, but we will be generating it during the second half of the year and we are going to look at conditions. We never &#x2013; we never wanted to be more specific than that in terms of how we execute this program, because it is a situation that's driven by the marketplace and our cash evaluations. So all I will say is that's the facts relating to our cash generation and we have this authorized and we will be talking with our Board and making decisions about how to execute it over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. All right. And then, in terms of &#x2013; you've mentioned that this is kind of your target level of debt until sort of the nature of the company changes. Have you talked to the rating agencies about that and have they had any thoughts about whether or not to kind of move you up a notch at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have ongoing discussions with the rating agencies and we will continue to meet with them and talk about our plans and update them on our progress. We now have a positive outlook from both agencies. We are one notch below investment grade for our corporate rating. We have very strong credit statistics for a high-yield issuer. The rating agencies are obviously where they are right now in terms of the overall financial markets and all I can tell you is, as we have, we will continue to work with them to get what we believe will be an appropriate rating for our company. We don't have need to go into the marketplace for new capital right now. We are generating excess cash, we are paying down debt and in fact, while we are at an attractive debt level, if we have opportunities that are economically positive for our company, we could well use some cash to take advantage of those. So we have a lot of flexibility of what we will do financially. We are not depending on rating agencies. We are going to work hard to get the right agency rating for what we consider the right ratings for our company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that leads to the very last question which is, do you have any long-term ambitions of being investment grade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've always been able to operate effectively and as a non-investment grade issuer, we were able to do this transaction and finance it efficiently. So in terms of saying that it is an overriding goal, we won't say that. Our principal goal is going to be building value for our shareholders. We believe that our company should qualify as an investment-grade rating credit and we are going to continue to manage them on the basis that we've laid out here today and work with the agencies to see if we can get the right rating. But we are focused on having what we and our Board consider to be a strong balance sheet and in providing good returns for our shareholders.</p>

          <p>Good morning. You've got a series of footnotes on page IV, including C which talks about a 125 million of purchases accounting costs added depreciation, but there is also one D that talks about 96 million of additional costs. Can I assume that those will go away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's the historical cost of G&amp;A associated with the PD activity, the Phelps Dodge activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But the 96 million seems like it was almost a one-timer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not a one-timer. That's just the ongoing G&amp;A associated with the Phelps Dodge part of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we can continue to see the G&amp;A as high as it was in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there were some &#x2013; I wouldn't look at the fourth quarter alone, because there was &#x2013; Chuck, this was a complicated year related to a number of factors. You pointed out to purchase accounting issue and under days accounting rules, that's a tremendously complex undertaking. The accounting standards, and particularly the way the SEC interprets them requires you to do all of these detailed valuation analyses and that comes in. Then this year was also a year in which we were taking steps to integrate our business and that meant integrating compensation plans and employee benefit plans. We had a number of people in the &#x2013; particularly in the finance and administrative area of Phelps Dodge that left and they had pre-established severance plans. So there were some unusual costs flowing through this year and I wouldn't look at any particular quarter, but look at the cost over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the purpose of the footnote was really to point out, when we're comparing the fourth quarter 2007 with the fourth quarter 2006, the fourth quarter 2006 was historical Freeport and didn't include the Phelps Dodge operations. So, it was just helpful to understand those changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what kind of a tax rate can we look forward to for ongoing quarters? Because you also pointed out the &#x2013; that one reversal that affected the tax rate in the fourth quarter and also affected the minority interest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. The two things &#x2013; yes, I guess to talk about on these calls are, one, the provisional pricing and two, the tax rates. The tax rate, Chuck, is going to be driven by the proportion of total income that PT-FI contributes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a much higher tax rate in Indonesia than we do in South America or Central America. And so, if PT-FI is contributing a significant amount of the income, then the overall average tax rate will be higher. In quarters where PT-FI is contributing relatively lower income as it was during the fourth quarter, our tax rate is going to go down. The tax that we pay on our income in these countries is essentially fixed. I mean it doesn't change; it's just how the mix comes about between those tax rates and so as we look forward in 2008, I will tell you and we will put this in our 10-K so all the world is aware of it, we are currently looking at the kinds of commodity prices that we had at roughly an annual rate of 34%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, that will vary quarter-by-quarter because in the early part of the year, PT-FI will be down, be higher later on.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Nice job. Just two questions, one on the supply side in the industry wide, do you see that supply is going to be tight from the industry for copper production in 2008 going to 2009 also or you think that supply might increase probably given what the conditions of the economies are?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Let's see. I missed the first part of your question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From the supply point of side, do you think that there might be some industry wide problems that may continue in 2008 that were in 2007 like mines disruptions or labor disruptions that may cause supply to dwindle and supply may remain very tight in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're talking about global &#x2013; industry wide conditions.</p>

          <p>Well, since the recovery from the last U.S. recession during the early 2000s, global &#x2013; I guess the global recessions and since China became such dominant factor, the industry's productive capacity has been stretched and that means, because prices rose, we and all the other copper producers are trying to produce as much copper as we possibly can. Prior to that time, an estimated 5% of the industry's capacity, including some of Phelps Dodge's operations, were curtailed. But with high prices, you can rest assured that everybody is going to be out there trying to produce everything they can produce. And in that environment, when you have ageing mines and &#x2013; all the major mines around the world today are ageing. The pits are getting deeper, as I mentioned with our Grasberg pit, it results in geotechnical issues and you can see that in a number of mines around the world. All the operating systems are stretched; workers around the world are looking for greater participation. So there has been a recurring series of strikes and unrest with contractors and other issues. All these factors mean that if there is a supply side response, it's evitable, that's going to be negative for supplies. And the conditions we have today in the industry are no different than they have been in recent years, and the likelihood is, we don't know where it is or where it will occur, but there will be mines that are currently producing in 2007 that won't produce what they expect to do in 2008, and I don't think there is nothing around the world today to change that, there's no slack in the system.</p>

          <p>You mentioned during the comment in the presentation that the demand for copper in the U.S. is relatively good. I guess what my...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me clear that, I said the market is tight, the demand in the U.S. has been affected for copper by the weak residential housing market, that was evident in the last half of 2006 has continued in 2007. Our fourth quarter in the U.S. in 2006 was weak and our fourth quarter in 2007 was about the same as it was in 2006, but &#x2013; and then also in the U.S., the automobile industry is weak and yet globally, the automobile industry is strong. In the U.S., there &#x2013; and this is almost totally a U.S. issue, but plastics are taking market share away from copper in plumbing applications. But, having said that, the U.S. non-residential market has been relatively strong and while overall demand is down, and the U.S. is a much less significant part of the world's copper used today than historically, roughly 12% and the weakness in the U.S. has been offset by strength in the global economies. It would likely take from a demand standpoint a global recession to have a major impact on copper demand. It's not going to occur as a result of supply side factors. The supply side situation, in terms of current production levels and new projects coming on stream, continues to be very supportive of the copper price.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just from China's perspective, have you seen any kind of change in China's patterns &#x2013; buying patterns given what the turmoils in the financial markets are or in the economies are? Have you seen any kind of change from China or they still continue to --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We saw a heavy indication of change in China during 2006 when the copper price reached $4 a pound in May and there was an absence of Chinese buying in the last half of 2006. A year ago, the copper price was below $2.50 and that primarily reflected Chinese buying patterns. Chinese came back into the marketplace strong in 2007 and so yes, I mean at any point in time, copper price is going to be influenced by buying patterns, by investors sentiment, by funds flow, and all those things and all that will happen around us and it will affect our price and the way the market views us. From our standpoint, we look on a longer-term basis and look at just how difficult it is to produce copper and find new projects, and that's why we are very encouraged about where we are. Longer term, the world is going to need copper as the undeveloped places in the world, including China and India and other places develop, they'll need copper. The world is going to be increasingly focused on energy conservation and how to use less energy for economic and environmental reasons. In every application that &#x2013; where that comes into place requires more copper and for a number of factors, we are just really encouraged although we've never tried to predict and have no confidence in our ability to predict what's going to happen next week, next months, in the short term in the marketplace but we are running our business with a very positive longer-term view of our marketplace and that's why we are working today.</p>
