          <p>Good morning.  My name is Regina and I will be your conference facilitator today.  At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2009 Earnings Teleconference.  Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Ann Marie Petach and General Counsel, Robert P. Connolly. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>Thank you.  Mr. Connolly, you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone.  Before Larry and Ann Marie make their remarks, I want to point out that during the course of this conference call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements.  We call to your attention the fact that BlackRock's actual results may differ from these statements.  As you know, BlackRock has filed with the SEC reports, which list some of the factors, which may cause our results to differ materially from these statements.  Finally, BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Ann Marie, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.  I will be discussing primarily as-adjusted results.  As you've seen, first quarter net income was 110 million, or $0.81 per share, including a $1.47 per share of operating earnings, $0.73 per share of non-operating losses, and $0.07 positive associated with favorable resolution of a tax matter.  Excluding the resolution, the tax rate was 35%.</p>
          <p>I thought it would be beneficial to begin by reflecting on the dramatic changes in external environment over the past year.  The Dow was down 38% from March of 2008 to March of 2009.  Mining and energy were off between 35 and 55% and sterling weakened 29% relative to the dollar.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter the Dow was off 13%, U.S. public real estate debt was off 20% and commercial real estate was off 15% and that's before considering the effects of leverage.  Equity markets hit a trough in mid March.  Since March 9, the Dow is up about 20%.  BlackRock's results reflected strong and diversified business model, cost disciplines and business reengineering, as well as the market driven pressures on the business.</p>
          <p>As a result, we have maintained strong operating margins.  The as-adjusted margin of 37.3%, compared to a full year 2008 margin of 38.7%.  The comp to revenue ratio of 34.2% compared to a full year 2008 ratio of 35.2%.  Even with strong margins, a robust business model and many new opportunities, the market environment has put pressure on AUMs, revenues and balance sheet investments.</p>
          <p>Revenues declined due to market effects on base fees.  In the face of the 13% decline in equity markets, first quarter revenues were 987 million, down 7% compared to the fourth quarter.  Base fees represented 70% of the revenue decline.  Compared to the first quarter of 2008, revenue was down 313 million, or 24%. That's more than explained by a 29% decline in base fees, primarily on equity and balanced products.  This is in the context of the 38% equity market decline.</p>
          <p>BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues remain strong, and have more than doubled compared to the first quarter of 2008.  BRS continues to have a robust pipeline of financial market advisory and risk reporting opportunity.  As adjusted operating income of 307 million was down 64 million, or 17%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and down 106 million, or 26%, compared to the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Compensation costs are being driven by two key factors.  Incentive compensation is being driven by the alignment of employees' compensation's corporate results. Base compensation is being driven by reengineering and cost management initiatives, including the 9% personnel reduction in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>There was a 22 million restructing charge in the first quarter, reflecting primarily an incremental personnel reduction facilitated by reengineering of the business.  The benefits of this action will be seen beginning in the second quarter.  Excluding hedge deferred comp changes, total compensation expense was up 25 million, or 2% from the fourth quarter. This is more than explained by low fourth quarter 2008 incentive comp.</p>
          <p>Base comp was down 12% compared to the fourth quarter.  Compensation expense was down 118 million, or 25%, compared to the first quarter of 2008. That includes a 30% decline in incentive comp and an 18% decrease in base comp.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expense is being driven by strong cost disciplines, particularly in marketing and promotions including G&amp;A and professional services.  G&amp;A expense was down 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, excluding a favorable 29 million balance sheet related foreign exchange re-measurement in the fourth quarter of 2008, and excluding 2 million of 2009 fund launch costs.  G&amp;A expense was down 61 million, or 29%, compared to the first quarter of 2008 with marketing and promotions down over 50%.</p>
          <p>As we've discussed before, BlackRock utilizes it's balance sheet to co-invest capital along side our clients and to seed new products. Most of these investments are long-term.  Despite the long-term holding period, the vast majority of these investments are mark-to-market through the income statement, not through equity.  Our valuation and accounting methods have been consistent and have not changed as the result of the new FASB accounting clarification.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet value of the assets is not necessarily indicative of the long-term economic value of the investment.  As an example, one investment will generate 2009 cash flows of over 10 million, while the book value of the investment is 2 million.  As we know, the first quarter was negative across many markets, including the dramatic negative movements in the commercial real estate market.  BlackRock's portfolio and clients were affected by these market movements.</p>
          <p>As-adjusted non-operating losses totaled 153 million in the first quarter.  Real estate related losses represented 93 million, or about two-thirds of the portfolio mark.  An additional 53 million of losses related primarily to private equity, distressed credit and hedge funds in fund-of-fund.  Net interest expense of 7 million also is included in non-operating results.  Our balance sheet exposure has been reduced greatly. The total value of the investment portfolio now stands at about 750 million, or less than 700 million including investments which represent hedges.  At these levels and given the present mix of the portfolio, I feel a lot more comfortable with the balance sheet associated risk.</p>
          <p>With respect to the mix of the portfolio, throughout 2008 assets have been invested 15 to 25% in each of the following five categories: private equity, distressed credit, hedge funds and fund-of-funds, real estate and other, which is generally more liquid assets.  Including the most recent market movements and net redemptions, real estate now represents less than 10% of the portfolio, private equity represents more than a quarter of the portfolio, and each of the remaining three investment categories continue to represent 15 to 25% of the portfolio.  We remain committed to co-investing with our clients, which facilitates us being a full platform provider.</p>
          <p>In closing, while we continue to reengineer the business we are also investing in the business.  Through the mid March equity trough, we have a large cumulative negative market behind us.  Over time as markets stabilize and begin to improve, our clients, our AUM, our revenue and our balance sheet will benefit.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ann Marie.  Good morning, everyone.  Let me try to give a perspective of the environment that we were facing in the first quarter and let me later on in my presentation give a perspective of where I think our environment is going in terms of how we are positioned at BlackRock.  I think it's fair to say that the, during the fourth quarter, clients globally from retail to institutional, from our insurance company clients to our pension fund clients, to our corporate clients, they were pretty shocked at the dramatic decline in their asset valuations.  More importantly, they were shocked at the absence in many cases of risk management and three, I think the greatest surprise to so many clients was the absence of liquidity within their portfolios.</p>
          <p>As a result of this market setback and their extreme &#x2013; and extreme uncertainties surrounding the market declines and their shock, our clients were frozen at the beginning of the quarter.  Clients needed to reassess their assumptions on risk, reassess their assumptions on liquidity and then they needed to start looking forward in terms of how best to allocate their assets.</p>
          <p>In many cases, their assets had deterioration and yet their liabilities did not change that much and, as a result, there needed to be a full reassessment of their portfolios, and this is where I believe the BlackRock model really came in very strongly.  The BlackRock came more tirelessly working along side our clients and helping our clients: A, to calm down; B, to give them a platform in which they could think holistically about their overall portfolio, and in cases where there was extreme uncertainty, recommend to our clients some things that may or may not have been &#x2013; may or may have been poor &#x2013; a bad result for BlackRock.  In some cases recommending or working with clients to go into index as they try to reassess some of their risk.  And I believe we are in a better position with almost all our clients in terms of our positioning with our clients, in terms of helping them reassess where they are in terms of their assets and their outlook as to how best to manage their assets.</p>
          <p>As the market began to stabilize in the second week of March, and as our clients began to understand what they needed to do going forward, we saw very quickly strong interest from our clients in terms of assets selections and more importantly in terms of RFPs.  Our pipeline reflects that. I'll go into that a little later and the amount of RFPs we are seeing now suggests that clients are now looking prospectively on how best to position themselves.  This is a far &#x2013; a big difference from what we saw at the beginning of the quarter, in terms of the outlook of our clients and where they want to take their portfolios.</p>
          <p>So let me now review our quarter and talk about the positives and negatives, and then let me talk about some of the opportunities for us. As our report suggests, we had assets about $1.283 trillion.  We are very pleased to announce it's only down 2%, a very strong showing, despite the severity of the markets, and I'm not talking about the severities of markets, just equities, but as Ann Marie suggested, severities of some of the credit markets and, more importantly, the severity that hit a lot of the alternative markets, which hurt NAVs, hurt our balance sheet and obviously hurt some of our clients balance sheets, as suggested.  Also importantly, if you go back and look at our position from a year ago, our assets are only down 6%.  Once again in our mind, really proving to ourselves and, hopefully to all of you, that our business model is unique and we are picking up more of our clients wallets in terms of new business.</p>
          <p>Importantly in our first quarter, despite all of this turmoil, we did see net flows.  Net flows was $5.6 billion, which is very low our historical rates; however, our long-dated flows were up $21.3 billion.  And I do believe this is because of our business model.  We have five different businesses, very different than most firms.  Obviously, we do have our equity business. We have our fiduciary outsourcing business. We have our fixed income platform. We have our alternative platform. We have our cash management platform and we have BlackRock Solutions, so that's really six.</p>
          <p>The fiduciary outsourcing, it really rotates around all of these different products.  But we've had a unique position to talk to our clients because of our risk management platform, which we are working with clients and, in many cases our success in the first quarter, and we believe our continuing success in 2009, is very directly related to having this risk orientation platform in giving advice to our clients.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline, as a suggestion that our clients are finally moving, is $34.4 billion, which we're pleased to note, $27.4 billion is long-dated, of which $17 billion is fixed income, $11 billion is equity, and we have outflows that we already know in our alternative space of $1.5 billion. Once again, a reflection that clients, because their extreme issues surrounding the liquidity in their portfolios, clients are still wishing to reduce their alternatives and this may persist throughout the year.  We don't have a strong view on which way it's going, but the trends in the alternative space is still more negative than what we see in the traditional spaces of equities, and fixed income, and in risk management and in our Solutions space.</p>
          <p>Let me specifically talk about fixed income, which I am very pleased to report that we had very improved performance, top quartile in almost all our businesses within our fixed income platform.  Also importantly, we announced to our clients last week the addition of 25 &#x2013; 26 professionals, including Rick Rieder, with our R3 inclusion of our platform.  We are very excited in building out the expertise of our credit platform, and now with the addition of the R3 professionals from credit and distress, we believe we are going to be very well positioned to take advantage of distressed credits globally of opportunistic investing in credit globally.</p>
          <p>And I believe this is a great investment that BlackRock has made, that we repeatedly make, even in this hostile markets, where in some parts of our business we are reengineering, as Ann Marie talked about, we are still investing in the future.  A good example of that investment in the future was a year and half, two years ago when we brought in a team to be additional to our European equity team and now a year and half, two years later, we have now grown by $1 billion in our European equity platform already.</p>
          <p>And this is the type of investing we're doing that we believe will position ourselves quite well in the future.  So having Rick Rieder and her (sic) [his] team with our present credit team is going to be a huge additive opportunity for us in working along side with our clients.  And it really is a, our clients who we discussed this with last week, were extremely pleased and believe this is another statement of positive towards BlackRock, in terms of that we are investing in an opportunistic way to take advantage of future opportunities that the markets can allow us to have.  And we've been telling clients worldwide that we believe the stress in credit will be the big opportunities.</p>
          <p>And we believe until you see credit opportunities or credit markets improve dramatically, we're not going to see a very large rally in equities.  We need the credit markets to vastly improve before we see equities improving, and we are making an investment now to prove our point that we believe these credit opportunities are going to be large, and we're going to be very opportunistic in seizing that.  So, we also did a lot of reengineering our fixed income platform over the last six to eight months and I think we are starting to see the real returns and the real process of these in terms of the returns and our performance.</p>
          <p>In cash management, it was clearly a mixed quarter for us.  Average assets for the quarter were up 4%; however, spot assets were down 16 billion. A good part of that was out flows at the end of the month.  But there are &#x2013; there were two very large facts that really directed our business.  One, we saw large outflows in our government funds. I think this is industry-wide. The government funds are trading at 10 to 30 basis points, depending on where the market is, but the returns are just so low that investors are now looking for other things, and clearly this is what the federal reserve's trying to do.</p>
          <p>They're looking for clients now to start taking money out of cash and start putting into other items.  And so I believe that trend will persist. Clients are going to start moving some money outside of cash. This is what we are recommending, and we are beginning to see that.</p>
          <p>The other trend that is, I believe, more specific to BlackRock, less to the industry, we positioned our portfolios very conservatively in our cash management in the first quarter.  We took a very hostile review of all credits.  We had a conservative postioning, and our returns were one or two basis points lower than a lot of other competitors during this quarter, because we were looking out for all our clients. We thought it would be imprudent to take more credit risk during the quarter.  And so we were positioned more conservatively than our clients, than our competitors, excuse me.</p>
          <p>We believe that was the right thing for our clients and we did lose some fast money.  Some of the money we lost was from very large hedge funds that had money with us and they just moved to a higher yield provider.  And so this is how almost the entire out flows at the end of the quarter happened, because of the government funds and our positioning in credit and cash management.</p>
          <p>In our alternative space, it really went from bad to worse in, for the fourth quarter, which was bad and worse than the first quarter. Ann Marie talked about the real estate market.  The real estate market, as you know, we are a big participant in it. We are a long-term believer in real estate as an asset allocation, but it's seeing some very hostile wind. It impacted our balance sheet. It impacted our clients.  Our high water in terms of managing real estate on behalf of our clients, and this is multi-family and commercial, it was over $30 billion and it's now down about $21 billion.  And at the end of the fourth quarter, it was around $26 billion and now it's down to $21 billion.  So this is a good indication of NAV decline, as Ann Marie discussed, the NAV decline and outflows from clients.</p>
          <p>So this is not a BlackRock-specific problem. This is an industry issue, and we are working with our clients on it.  Many clients are starting to look at now real estate as real estate's starting to fall.  I don't think we're going to see any positive momentum, though, until probably the latter part of this year, or early 2010.</p>
          <p>In our fund-to-funds area, many clients are reassessing fund-to-funds, obviously the end of the fourth quarter was the Madoff blow-up; a lot of feeder funds that were involved in it.  I think, as I said at the end of our fourth quarter in our earnings announcement, we are not involved in anything like that. We don't have any frauds within our fund-to-funds platform. The clients worldwide are reassessing fund-to-funds.  I believe we're going to be a net beneficiary.  I believe clients are looking to go to fund-to-funds with large scale platforms. So I believe systematically, we will be a net winner in this. It's all a relative gain, but in the course of the next few quarters, we could still see some outflows in this product area; however, I believe we are &#x2013; to our surprise we are seeing less outflows in this business than we originally have budgeted when we went into the beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>I can't say enough about BlackRock Solutions and our team.  They work endlessly, tirelessly, weekends, days. If there's 30 hour days &#x2013; 30 hour days, they'd be working 32 hour days.  The business is as robust as we've ever seen it.  The pipeline opportunities are robust as we've ever seen it.  Clients worldwide are looking for assistance. They're looking for spot evaluations many times, but they're also looking for a systematic review of their whole process in terms of risks, and then many clients are looking to take on the BlackRock Aladdin platform as a risk management platform.</p>
          <p>In addition, we created last year our Advisory platform to take advantage of the opportunities with some of our institutions.  I would like to just also say we are the only investment firm that has a separation between our asset management platform and our advisory and risk management platform.  This is what differentiates us more than any other firm. We created this fiduciary separation in 1994, and we built upon that to create two separate platforms so we can make sure that there is a difference between the asset management platform and the pure advice driven platform that we give to our clients.</p>
          <p>We now have $9 trillion of assets that we work on behalf of clients, but $7 billion that we have, where we analyze risk for our clients and about $2 billion in terms of &#x2013; 2 trillion, I'm getting the words wrong. I knew the "b" was wrong, $2 trillion of assets that we're advising with clients.  So it's robust. It's growing and, more importantly, having all of these assets on our platform gives us a unique ability to work in a very short timeframe to help our clients analyze their risk, another strong reason why we have been hired repeatedly worldwide.</p>
          <p>On that note &#x2013; on that worldwide note, we see huge opportunities outside the United States for our BlackRock Solutions platform.  We have added a team in London. We continue to hire to build out the resources of this platform.  And I'm pleased to say that we have now $169 billion of assets that we're managing in our advice business.  Separate from our asset management business, but it is no different in terms of the asset management process.</p>
          <p>We, as Ann Marie suggested, our revenues were up considerably. In the first quarter we had revenues of $140 million in the first quarter with our Solutions space, compared to $60 million in the first quarter in '08.  And, as I've said, we have a very strong pipeline of new assignments working with our clients.</p>
          <p>In this financial turmoil with so many institutions having extreme difficulties, and as some institutions brands have been so marred because of the problems associated with their financial condition, BlackRock's branding has grown precipitously, globally.  Our opportunities worldwide, institutionally in retail is growing large &#x2013; in a large scale, a good example of our retail powers overseas.  In the first quarter in the Luxembourg mutual fund platform, which is the cross-border platforms that people have their mutual fund platforms, we represented 23% of the Luxembourg mutual fund platform net retail sales, 23%.</p>
          <p>In the U.K. we had 9.5% market share of net sales in the U.K., and it is powered by obviously our success in our portfolio management teams. It's powered by our &#x2013; by the success of our performance, but more just as importantly it's powered by the growing brand of our platform, and I believe this is going to have continued momentum.  In addition, we are making very large headways to continue to build out our third-party branding initiatives in the United States.</p>
          <p>We continue to build our effort in third-party marketing in the United States with our retail platform, and we are very, very encouraged with the most recent growth in our relationship with Bank of America, BOA platform.  We see some very large opportunities in that and we -- in a very short period of time, we've enjoyed a very strong working relationship with our new partners at Bank of America and a very strong continued relationship with our partners at Merrill Lynch.</p>
          <p>Let me just personally talk about the balance sheet losses, obviously, extreme disappointment, frustration.  I did not anticipate the severe decline in some of the alternative spaces where we invested side-by-side with our investors.  As Ann Marie suggested, we did not take any accounting changes.  We took a very harsh review of our assets.  As Ann Marie suggested, one assets we &#x2013; a pool of assets we marked down to $2 million, and we're making $10 million a year in earnings as a base.  And so that's an example of the extreme marks we've taken, but we have followed the proper procedures in terms of just marking to market.</p>
          <p>We did not change our marks.  We did not change our behavior as in terms of how we account.  And we want to make sure that we are differentiating ourselves versus so many other institutions, who've announced earnings earlier, who did make some accounting adjustments to better their balance sheet and their earnings.</p>
          <p>As Ann Marie said, we believe the majority of losses within that portfolio are behind us.  I should say we do have a large fund-to-funds platform in private equity.  We did take some very harsh marks in that, but I don't want to antici -- if we continue to get further erosion from the third-party fund-to-fund private equity providers, we will take those hits.  But we took much greater extreme hits already than what was given to us by our managers, because we believe the managers have a three to six-month lag in terms how they report their performance and we just used what we expected from them by looking at public markets.</p>
          <p>And in terms of our investments in some of the real estate areas with our real estate funds, there is still some at-risk portfolios, but very, very, very modest.  And so I just wanted to be very clear on that and I'm sure if there's questions later on, Ann Marie could talk about them or we could do that later on, on a one-on-one.</p>
          <p>Let me talk about our industry and our business model very quickly, then we could open it up questions.  I believe the asset management business is experiencing probably the worse headwinds that they've ever experienced in our &#x2013; in modern times, I guess, in the last 25 years.  This is going to make and this is going to change dramatically the industry.  The industry had enjoyed some very modest to very strong tailwinds with rising equities, and now with the collapse of the equity market, the collapse of some of the credit markets and alternative markets, there is nowhere to hide.</p>
          <p>In addition, we believe our industry is going to be more regulated.  We actually welcome that.  We believe in Secretary Geithner's plan there is going to be more scrutiny with all investors. This is going to be added costs.  We believe we are beneficiary of that, because we believe firms that are subscale are going to be harmed by obviously the headwinds of the marketplace, the added cost of regulation, and then the third point is, unquestionably every investor is going to be audited for their risk management.  Whether it's just a one-on-one audit by a client, or a more overhauling audit, I believe risk management and the tools around risk management are going to be very important.</p>
          <p>Way too many firms talk about risk management and have very little in terms of capabilities, and this is one area once again where we shine and where we are very well positioned.  So we believe the industry is going to continue to have headwinds.  We believe it's going to change the landscape.  And we believe our business model of having this well-rounded platform, that it is global, that is retail and institutional, equities and fixed income and alternatives, and our BlackRock risk management Solutions platform is going to continue to differentiate us and allow us to continue to do well.</p>
          <p>I believe this atmosphere with these headwinds are going to force huge amount of consolidation in our business and, indeed, our strategy team is overwhelmed with the amount of institutions that are approaching us in terms of opportunities and in terms of acquisitions for BlackRock or some form of mergers.  And we believe we are going to have a unique ability to look at many institutions and determine whether any of them will fit.  I am not here to suggest we're going to do anything, and I don't want to make any suggestion that we will, but I will make a claim that we are looking at many institutions at this moment.  We have great opportunities to do an acquisition and we will do what is right for the long-term of our platform, what is right for our clients and what is right for our employees.</p>
          <p>One last thing that I'd like to put a little editorial that I think is very important.  The markets are very fragile and government is playing a more and more important role in terms of the overall direction of the marketplace.  It is very important as we navigate through these markets and as government's involvement becomes more pronounced, we need to make sure that in all cases &#x2013; in all the change that government looks at in terms of re-regulation, in terms of the restructuring the banking system, in terms of restructuring our markets, we need to make sure that we preserve our global capital markets and we need to make sure that we preserve our position in the global capital markets.</p>
          <p>There is a great need in the future with our deficits in our country to be more dependent than ever before on the global capital markets.  As our government and as society believes that leverage should be reduced, and the levels of acceptable leverage with financial institutions are going to be more manageable, and when we resolve our recession and start moving towards a more positive economic environment to finance our economic growth with these more manageable leverage ratios, it is going to be a requirement for us to finance our future.</p>
          <p>We are going to need a stronger, a more robust capital markets.  These moneys will come from foreigners, global institutions, and so we need to make sure that as we expand our markets that we have a market that can flow freely, a market that is &#x2013; that we are an example of fiduciary responsibility, but importantly that we are mindful that we are more dependent than ever before on the global capital markets.</p>
          <p>I believe because the markets are going to be more global, this is another reason why BlackRock is well positioned.  We are going to be in need of working with clients worldwide.  We are going to be working with more clients in looking at dollar dominated assets.  I think clients are going to be looking at not only dollar denominated assets, but much more in terms of local assets and we have to be there for those clients, too.  So, importantly, we preserve our capital markets.  We enrich our capital markets.  And if we do that we will, as a nation, as a financial center, be stronger than ever, and I think BlackRock will be a large participant in that global expansion.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to thank everybody. I spoke way too much today, much more than I intended to, and I'm looking at the clock. Why don't we open it up for questions?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>membership that's out there. You've been sort of quoted in a couple of...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the PPIP, yeah, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right...sources.  Just sort of wondering, a major bank has opted not to participate in that given, I guess, further political risk concerns. How confident are you that you wouldn't have any kind of sort of conflict with the government if you got involved?  And secondarily, I was sort of wondering if you could talk a little about how you see the economics of that opportunity playing out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me start out first and foremost, BlackRock has not been selected. They have not selected the managers at the moment.  And so, hopefully, we are one of the selected managers. So let me start off with that.  We have filed our fee, I guess it's due later this week, I think, so they delayed it by a few weeks, so it may be this week when it's due.  So I think, I'm not sure what bank you we were talking about, Bill, but I think the PPIP is going to be a huge opportunity.  It's going to be a huge opportunity for investors, for mutual fund investors, for foreign investors, for pension plans to participate in this plan.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the PPIP is only a good investment if you believe the Federal Reserve, the Treasury's actions will slow down and moderate the decline in housing prices in America.  I would argue, if you don't believe the government will be successful in moderating the decline in housing price in America, then we have a real bad recession that's only going to get worse.  So I believe the key to our economy, the key to our financial markets is going to be the stability in housing in America.</p>
          <p>I think the PPIP is only one step in the assistance of that.  We believe the Federal Reserve's actions by, with low interest rates with a huge amount of refinancing, with the TALF and all the other Federal Reserve plans and with the Treasury plans, we believe the government will be successful in beginning to moderate the declines in housing prices in America.  We're starting to see that in California with prices down about 40%. You're seeing many houses are successfully auctioned for the first time.  Now that's a one month view.  It's not a trend and we need to see that if it's persisting over the course of the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>If you believe, if you believe that housing prices are going to finally moderate and stabilize, there is a big opportunity for investors to make 20+% returns with the leverage that the government has offered to provide.  And so I've just come back from Asia.  We are working alongside with a retail platform here in the States with our pension plans and institutional clients here in the States and we're seeing some very large interest from investors.</p>
          <p>The big question that still remains, who will be the sellers of this, I believe there is going to be more selling into this plan than the market expects.  I believe banks are going to be in need of reducing &#x2013; in reducing some of their stressed assets.  I was very impressed.  I know the marketplace didn't like it, but I was very impressed with the earnings momentum of B of A yesterday with $19 billion of earnings pre-tax, pre-provision.  I think the marketplace was surprised with the largeness of their provision, but the reality is, as those provisions are being created by these banks, and I'm not suggesting B of A's going to do anything on it because I wouldn't know, but banks have the ability to sell now.</p>
          <p>And I believe the banks that do sell into the TARP and tell their investors they are reducing their risk.  They already have the provisions.  I believe that's a positive for the individual bank.  I believe this is what's going to be encouraged by our regulators in terms of what to do in the banks.  So I actually think there is going to be more supply of &#x2013; in the downsizing of these balance sheets and I certainly believe that there is going to be enough demand from investors.  I don't see why this is a conflict, Bill.  So I need to ask the question, what do you mean? Why would we be precluded from a potential conflict?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I just know one of the banks, I don't want to get into names, suggested that they were still concerned about some of the political risk of investing side-by-side with the government?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe strongly that as long as we are investing side-by-side with the government, I think I have no &#x2013; I don't want to say no political risk, that's being na&#xEF;ve.  I think we have little political risk.  And I believe it's important, though, that we have a &#x2013; that we could show our government, our taxpayers, that this is good for the economy, that it's offered to mutual &#x2013; to individual investors, it's offered to pension plans.  So the school teachers and firemen, whoever participates in the pension plans, can participate.  So and importantly, I think it's important that foreigners have the ability to participate.  They're the largest buyers of our treasury debt at low interest rates.  So I believe this is good.  And in all my conversations with anyone who will listen to me in Washington, and sometimes there's no one, but sometimes, there's a few. I believe there is an agreement on the opportunities for investors and that this is a positive, not a negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Understood.  Just in terms of the economics of these things, when you mentioned these are typical retail institutional type fee structure, could you participate...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't think &#x2013; we haven't finalized this. First of all; A, we have not been selected. I need to reiterate that; and B, I believe, as a statement to everyone, our fees are going to be systematically lower than they would be otherwise.  I think to make this happen, we're going to be looking for everyone to take a lower fee schedule in these type of platforms in terms of, if we had a retail fund lower, commissions lower, everything.  I think this is beholden at everyone to try to make this work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then a quick question for Ann Marie, if I might. You mentioned the reengineering.  So, I was wondering if you could quantify the benefit into the second quarter, and then I apologize for not obtaining this part of question.  But could you reconcile the share count difference between your P&amp;L upfront and then toward the back of some of the supplemental tables, the 131 million versus the 135 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we can spend some more time on it. I'll start with the last, the share count, but when we get in the back really what we're doing now with the new proxy is bifurcating shares into two classes of shares and likewise bifurcating the income.  And the way you do measure shares is a little different than it was a year ago, really with this more represents flat shares, but if you want to spend more time on that we can.</p>
          <p>As far as the reduction, what I can't give you is exactly but what you saw was really &#x2013; I think you can sort of estimate. We had a 35 million charge in the fourth quarter. We've got a 22 million charge now.  So you can sort of see what kind of dimension that represents as the reduction of the workforce, and then I guess would point out that we've seen a little more than that decline really in the first quarter, because we also really disposed of the metric, as well as have some favorable foreign exchange with respect to costs, that's growing. So hopefully that helps get you there. We can spend more time off line as well.</p>

          <p>Hey, Roger.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning.  So I just wanted to come back a little bit on the government program.  So Larry as you look at maybe the initial uptake on the TALF being as light as it's been as a precursor to PPIP getting rolled out, I mean are you concerned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm really not. Look at it, it's going to require an enormous effort, and I don't want to dismiss selling big blocks of loans and securities in an auction process from the Treasury is going required a huge structure, a huge process working with Treasury and the FDIC on this.  So it's going to require a big effort. I'm not trying to suggest that I'm not mindful of that and I think the Treasury is pretty mindful of what the huge responsibilities are in terms of making this happen.</p>
          <p>All I can say, Roger, we are seeing very large interest from investors.  And I may be mistaken, but I think you're going to see some very large sellers into this if they can. I think it's going be encouraged by our regulators. I think if you link this to the stress testing of banks, whatever that may turn out to be, I mean there's, institutions are going to either have to raise equity or reduce some balance sheet risk and I think this is going be a good mechanism to do that, and so this is why I remain to be optimistic.</p>
          <p>And I just think it's going take time. I am very constructive on the TALF. It just takes time and it takes the process to be built. You can't, these are very large monstrous programs that require a lot of structure and a lot of it &#x2013; a lot of detail and I think it would be incorrect of the marketplace to assume magically, the government could do what, you know large scale asset purchases, large scale restructurings, working along side with the public in a very short order, I mean I just think these are giant efforts that's going to require a great deal of a business structure build out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you confident that the government is going to lay off the various restrictions that could be imposed? I mean, the Washington Post is running an article this morning saying the Treasury Department lawyers are basically saying that they're going to have to put executive comp restrictions on the PPIP, which is makes that dead on arrival I assume?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that would. I don't know what they mean by that. If they mean it's the sellers, it may do it, I don't know. I think I read it doesn't impact the investment amount because we're just the agents of the investments.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's all going to be linked to, I don't know what I think, I mean I read that, too. If that was a serious view when I read that too, it's going to &#x2013; I could be incorrect then it doesn't &#x2013; it's not going to, it's going to fail.  The CEOs and the management team should be encouraged.</p>

          <p>To take the appropriate steps to de-risk.  And either &#x2013; and reducing systemic risk through equity rates, conversion of preferred to common which is another form of equity rates, and/or de-risking by downsizing assets.  And I think this platform can do that. We should, hopefully Washington doesn't discourage sellers to do that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay and just one more around this, I mean as you look at the opportunity, you said there's a lot of interest here. Can you size what you think you can raise? I mean there's been some reports about sort of five to $7 billion in toxic funds you're looking to raise.  I don't know if that's sort of tied to this and do you think it's multiple funds, some of which have incentive B structures, some of which don't, some of which are more <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think, you know we haven't thought about it.  As I said, it was Bill, we haven't worked this out with Treasury.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we haven't been selected, but I do believe, once again, I think we're going to have to do this &#x2013; we're going to &#x2013; our fee structure is going to be much smaller, much lower on this than other products.  I think we have to do that.  I think it is &#x2013; that's a very important statement to our government, to our tax payers, that if we're going to be a participant in this we have to do this,  I would say with lower market rate, lower than market rates and it should be done across retail platform and our institutional platform domestically and globally.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.  Just a couple of quick ones on the company.  Solutions, revenues came in up sequentially.  I guess that was a little countered in some of the body language that come out of comments and conferences, etcetera, earlier in the quarter.  I mean is this due to late quarter strength and new business wins or there are there sort of one time setup fees in there or I mean the run rate just seems higher than where we would have thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think some of them are one time setup fees, so I would probably sight that.  I don't know what body language was. Was it my body language or someone else's?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought the revenues were going to be down sequentially, but maybe I misread.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We probably thought that, that's true because we were &#x2013; we had such a good fourth quarter.  We won &#x2013; going into, we just saw more activity, Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And lastly just on &#x2013; just on bond outflows in the quarter, not including the advisory. I understand the whole sort of rebalancing issue, that makes sense.  If you look at sort of industry volumes, bond, funds and inflows for the quarter, I'm just curious is that, like what's different about sort of your business? Is it because it's more institutionally oriented?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, most certainly, we're more institutionally oriented. We actually had strong inflows in our retail platform in our bonds...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually thought, we, if I've got to cite &#x2013; and I think I have done this in many quarterly calls, if I've got to cite one extreme disappointment, and where I criticize myself is that we did not aggressively build our bond retail platform fast enough.  And it shows, and we got, and so flows in the industry were strong and we didn't participate as a percentage of our overall business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions.  First, Larry, I'd maybe like to review I mean I guess about a month ago, the ICI came out with its recommendations for the money fund business in terms of down the road and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things that strikes me, it seems like infact -- in a way you're going to further commoditize the business even more because it will be more difficult to differentiate yourself based on your credit and other capabilities?  I mean, what's your view on that, and how do you think you kind of benefit from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not, personally, I don't know exactly what the outcome of the ICI proposal is.  I mean, I don't know with total granularity.  What I do believe is, and what I said in the past is, I do believe there is going to be a need for capital to be held back in our money market fund business.  Right now, the industry is very dependent on having the government guarantee at four basis points on our money market funds, as a back stop.  I think that cannot &#x2013; as a money market industry we should not think this is going to last forever.</p>
          <p>And we need self regulate and self build up our own capital.  I would argue, though, if we are going to have to impose a capital charge to our own platform, it's going to raise the cost of money market &#x2013; money market business.  And I believe not only it may commoditize it, but it will also makes it a much more of a scale business and the smaller parties are going to have to be weeded out because it's just, between the risk of taking all the liability on yourself, but more importantly building up that capital base, it just reduces your overall profitability in that business.</p>
          <p>And we have been very much willing to expect a -- some form of capital charge to build up the resources to withstand any credit losses on behalf of our clients.  And so, I look at it as, in some form of a commoditization, as you suggested. I would also argue, though, it would make it even more of a scaled business and they're going to be fewer players.  Even in a commoditization business then, you're going to be differentiated by your full client service, and if you have an overall client relationship you &#x2013; it may be a commodity business that you're going to be a net winner in that.  And so, I believe we're extremely well positioned in the future money market business.</p>

          <p>And, okay.  And maybe a question on the M&amp;A environment. You talked about it at some length and obviously looking at a lot of things, I mean given the breadth of your platform, your ability to, as demonstrated with R3 to find teams of people and lift them out.  When you look at potential acquisitions, I mean are you really more focused on &#x2013; are there many &#x2013; are there that many kind of large enough niche businesses that you see or are you thinking that, gee this is an opportunity to use our integration skills and buy something on the cheap and really just consolidate a lot of assets or is it maybe both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say: A, we have, because our brand name is growing we have some real opportunities if we found the right opportunity in the retail business globally, be it domestically or outside the United States, to build our platform in mutual funds.  And so we would be very interested in that space to build more scale.  And it would allow us to build even a more robust retail business.</p>
          <p>I just believe we have a real opportunity with our brand in a growing brand to further build that.  And this is one area where I think in terms of retail business, if we had more scale we could provide even a more robust business to our global clients in that area.  That's one of the big areas that we're looking at right now and where we've had some reviews.  But we're also looking at some just like in the R3 list out.  There are other businesses, where we could add &#x2013; we can do some incremental small mergers to really fill out some of our other institutional spaces.  And so there are a few things we're looking at that could be very additive in a product or a business and then we could look at some of these overall large opportunities in terms of the mutual funds space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And maybe one last question on Solutions. I mean, clearly that business has had explosive growth and pretty robust pipelines. Is it at all possible to get some type of relative breakdown of &#x2013; if we look at the revenue there, kind of size what's coming from the one-time kind of advisory mandates, versus say that ongoing Aladdin business and, I'm just trying to think of how the dynamics of that...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe you could talk to Ann Marie on the side, and she could give you a little more granularity there.  I'm not sure how we break it out, so that's why I don't want to discuss it here.  I would say, though, one should look at the advisory business as a long based business, too -- these are long-term advisory solution based businesses.  So it's not a &#x2013; it's not like a quick fix, it could be multi years.  And so you should look at it that way. Aladdin could be more than multi years and so -- but the advisory business is very, very sticky business.  But we do have a lot of one-times where we're asked to just come in, evaluate risk and thank you very much.  And so we probably could give you some of that, too.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody.  Larry, just &#x2013; following up on M&amp;A, just I wanted your thoughts &#x2013; how has you view really shifted here in the last year and are you looking specifically at banks and insurance companies that are distressed that have asset management operations?  And then, I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the biggest change if you -- I am confident if you go back to the transcripts a year ago, I spoke about M&amp;A opportunities to expand our platform globally, more than I spoke about domestic opportunities.  I would say today the opportunities are just as great domestically as they are globally, because I do believe in the retail space we have great opportunities with our brand growth that we could add more &#x2013; a more robust platform.</p>
          <p>So I'm looking at &#x2013; we're looking at probably platforms that are &#x2013; that have a retail orientation to it just as much as a global institutional orientation, and so that's probably the changes of philosophy.  We want to take advantage of the growing brand in the retail space.  Our brand is growing dramatically in the institutional space worldwide, and so on the institutional side we're looking to grow maybe in a region specifically, and/or in a product specifically, but on a more grand scale would be more on the mutual fund side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just on retail distribution.  Maybe you could specifically talk to investments you've made in your wholesaling force. How many do you have now?  How has that grown year-over-year, and what number do you want to get that to, to build out that platform?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are adding wholesalers in the third-party distribution side and are -- I don't have the number in front of me as to the amount of wholesalers, but I believe it's close to 100, I'm looking at, it's more than that.  So you know what, we could get back to you with that actual number, but we have a very large scale of external wholesalers and internal wholesalers and that has grown in the last year.</p>
          <p>In Europe, it's a very different concept than having "wholesalers".  Throughout the Luxembourg and U.K. markets, our contacts are with gatekeepers with all the local distributors.  And so, it's not a wholesaling, it is almost like an institutional type of arrangement going, working with the gatekeepers at the various distribution platforms, country by country in some cases, or region by region in other cases, trying to offer more products through their systems.  And it's &#x2013; as I said it's more of an institutional touch.  And so, we have these two platforms, the U.S. one and the non-U.S. platforms. We call them both retail, but the execution is very different.</p>

          <p>I guess, okay.  I'm getting tired of talking, but otherwise I'm good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll try to keep it short here.  One question I would hit on was the fee waiver risk for money market funds.  And I know your business is heavily weighted to the institutional front, but maybe you could discuss the risks on the institutional side and maybe for some of your peers in the retail side, for fee waivers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The biggest area where we had fee waivers was from the government side, the government funds, and this is where we saw the outflows and that is the biggest risk where we have continued issues and just because of the low interest rates flows in that area.  On the non-government 287 funds, where you have &#x2013; now you have the government insurance backing you.  We haven't &#x2013; because we're not that, as big a retailer, we're not making fee waivers in those businesses yet. I'm looking and my staff's telling me that's correct.  So, I'm correct in saying that.</p>
          <p>Obviously, if we continue to see very low interest rates, and as rates go down and investor's appetites begin to be a little more upbeat, we're going to see outflows in everything, whether we have fee waivers or non-fee waivers.  This is what the Federal Reserve wants people to do.  That's why they have low interest rates.  They want investors, when they feel comfortable, to aggressively get out of the liquidity funds into more risk-based assets.  And ultimately, that's going to happen and that's going to work out, and our challenge is in making sure that in some of that transfer out of money market funds that we get some of the slice when they go with the long dated assets.</p>
          <p>This is why I believe the money market platforms that are only &#x2013; that are singular and they have greater risk, because we will see, whether it's in six weeks or two years, some large scale out flows out of money market funds into longer dated assets as clients begin to feel more comfortable about the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, that was helpful.  And then, just a little deeper on the M&amp;A comment.  You really compared outside the U.S. to inside the U.S. How do you look at emerging markets, because I believe and I could be wrong here, BlackRock is a little more underweight some emerging market economies and some of your big U.S. peers.  I don't know if you saw, but UBS just freed up Hexcel down in South America.  And so you have some opportunities in those regions to maybe build up and then you also in the U.S. have some bigger opportunities like Columbia, possibly free, getting freed up.  So, I'm just wondering how you kind of compare the two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we took note about the UBS sale of Hexcel. It's a great institution. It's a great country.  We have no presence in Brazil, so it is an obvious that's something we would.  And I think I mentioned this maybe a year ago, we would be very interested in doing something in South America and specifically Brazil.  We have had no conversations with any institution in Brazil, so I don't want to even suggest and have anyone talk about that, but there's a great example of the &#x2013; of the dismantling of either wealth management or asset management platforms from banks.</p>
          <p>And I think you're going to continue to see that.  I'm not going to talk specifically about any institution, whether it's Columbia or anything else, on this call, but I think Columbia is a great institution. It has a very good presence.  And we are &#x2013; we respect them as a competitor.  But as I said earlier, we are mindful that we need to grow our retail platform in the United States and if we have opportunity to grow here and continue to grow as you suggested in emerging markets where we are indeed weaker.  We have a growing platform I should mention, though, in India. We are very happy with our partnership in India and we believer we're going to have some real growth in our India joint venture.  And so there are areas in the emerging world where we have a presence and a presence that is growing.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful.  And then just on the TTIP just to beat that dead horse a little more.  You mentioned that there is definitely foreign investor appetite to participate in the program.  Can you give a little bit of color around that in terms of whether or not foreign investors are viewing what's happening in U.S. with a little bit of a discerning eye, given some of the &#x2013; some of what they've seen out of Washington?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think everybody is worried about the role of Washington, but I mean in my conversation with our foreign investors everyone asked that question, do you think it'll be good if we invest, do you think will government aggregate contracts?  And I answer &#x2013; my answer is I think investors worldwide will be encouraged, especially investors who've been big supporters of our credit or our bond mark of our treasury market, that's my view.  I have not &#x2013; I'm not espousing any official view, but that's my view.</p>
          <p>And two, I believe government understands that contract is a contract and obviously before we put any investors, provided we are selected, any investors in these platforms, we're going to have we will &#x2013; we will have confidence in the roll of government, in terms of these investments.  So it is my belief that government is &#x2013; will encourage all form of investors to be a part of it.  I think they would &#x2013; they are thrilled about having retail investors and pension plans.</p>
          <p>And so I'm not &#x2013; I think it's a good diversified investment profile of &#x2013; an investor profile would be good.  But we have to make sure, as everyone has suggested, can should we be mindful or careful of the government.  And I have concluded, albeit it's sometimes it's stressful, sometimes it's annoying, but I think government will do the right thing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then just getting back to the unfreezing of the institutional investors.  Can you comment a little bit on where you're seeing investors beginning to re-risk and sort of some color I guess around the RFP activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think one of the &#x2013; our three acquisitions we're seeing huge interest in credit.  We're seeing huge interest in some of our equity strategies. We had $1 billion in growth in our natural resources this year already.  We're seeing growth in our European equity platform and so specialized products, so investors are looking to take on more risk. One of the areas where we're seeing huge interest from investors, I should also say, are TIPS.</p>
          <p>Investors worldwide are a little more frightened of &#x2013; are a little more frightened of future inflation and so we see systematically clients worldwide are asking more questions about investing in global TIPS.  And so we are &#x2013; it really depends on the nature of the client.  Some clients who did not have extreme illiquidity because of over commitment in alternatives and private equity are looking to be much more opportunistic.  Clients that are overly committed in the alternatives that have more illiquidity are looking to be &#x2013; and there are more challenges as a result of it.  They're looking for more liquid types of investment, so there's no one rhyme or reason. It really is dependent on the circumstance of the investor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just to get a little more granular for insurance oriented clients or insurance companies. I mean, we're hearing a lot about a movement towards passive from active, given some of the underlying basis risk in their portfolios.  Are you seeing that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the general account, none.  Where you're seeing, we &#x2013; and that's where we had it.  One of our big outflows in fixed income was an insurance, an insurance account in the annuity side.  This is where you're seeing going from active to passive.  So in annuities, that's correct.  So for client accounts we are seeing that and I think that's a good point, and that's where we actually saw the outflows in fixed income out of active into passive in the annuity business.  But in the general account we're not seeing any of that.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Larry, as you mentioned, fixed income mutual funds account for quite a small portion of your entire business.  Could you just give us some color on the initiatives you guys are pursuing to get larger on this side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we made a whole restructuring where -- our mutual fund fixed income team under Curtis Arledge.  Curtis is running the platform now and we are aggressively now interacting with our distributing partners.  We've had in some of our mutual fund platforms, we've really reached out.  We've had some good successes in our intermediate fund, our Ginnie Mae fund and our TIPS fund.  So, we've seen some real opportunities there and we're rebuilding what I would call our core fund &#x2013; our core &#x2013; core plus fund is actually doing quite well this year, too.</p>
          <p>So we have been woefully inadequate in our fixed income mutual fund business.  And as I suggested earlier, it was a mistake and mid last year we made some big changes in our organization with Curtis and we are seeing some real positive momentum finally, and I would blame myself on that for not really identifying that as a real opportunity two years ago.  And we're paying for it today, but we're slowly getting back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, as we've seen, fixed income flows on the retail side have been very strong.  Do you see this as sustainable or do you think the retail investors are going to move back into equity products one day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would think good part of that will migrate back into equities.  We saw that in Europe, actually Europe if you &#x2013; Europeans flowed huge outflows in fixed income in Europe.  And we were not large and think coming to Europe. This is why we have such a great market share in Europe.  So it's not just because we were great in branding is, we were so weak in mutual fund, fixed income sales in Europe and that was the biggest growth area for the last two years in Europe.  And that's where firms are seeing huge outflows in Europe, as interest rates shot down there and we are a beneficiary by having a much larger equity roll out in Europe.  And so that's the reasons why we've had such success, relative to our peers in Europe and the U.K.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one final follow-up question.  On the institutional side in fixed income could you provide any color in terms of which products you are seeing outflows from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the biggest one &#x2013; the biggest &#x2013; well, there was a $3 billion of rebalancing.  So that is a &#x2013; that's generally with pension plans as they systematically rebalance and so it could have been any &#x2013; it could have been a core equity, a core fixed income strategy, or it could have been any other type of strategy.  Generally, it is &#x2013; it's more of the core multi-product strategies that they go out of, but I don't have it with any granularity, but I assume most of its there into more of the &#x2013; into other strategies.  And I said earlier, the other big outflow was a, was more of a core plus strategy in annuities and the client, throughout its whole business, went from active strategies to passives.</p>

          <p>Thank you, everyone.  I'm &#x2013; we're going to call it a day and Ann Marie and/or I will be free for calls if anyone needs to get further enlightenment.  Once again, thank you very much and let's hope the trends in the equity markets continue.  So we could continue this positive momentum.  Thank you, again.  Bye, bye.</p>
