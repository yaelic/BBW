          <p>Well, good morning everyone. If I could get everyone to grab a seat, now that would be great, we want to get underway. We are a couple of minutes behind schedule, but looking pretty good. Hi, everyone. If I could just ask everyone, before we get -- we kick off our live broadcast, I would like them to just turn your mobile phones off and blackberries, please that disrupts our web cast etcetera, it'd be very helpful. But after the <mark type="inaudible" /> I just want to get everyone sitting down.  OK, your mike.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our results briefing this morning those of you here in person and of course those of you connecting in via the web also are very, very welcome. I know we're the last of the banks to the reporting at this time, so we certainly appreciate that you had a very busy period over the last few weeks and personally as I know you would fully understand it's been very busy period for me.</p>
          <p>When I think about the last nine months -- as my first nine months as the CEO of Westpac, in a quite remarkable diversity of challenges and opportunities that we've had come our way over this period, quite a lot more I might add than I would have expected when I was appointed in August last year. In fact in lots of ways it feels like the world has moved and changed quite significantly over that period. But I really am very pleased to be here today, and to talk to our 2008 full year results. It is a robust performance delivered in very challenging times.</p>
          <p>So let me start with just a comment on the three key messages that we have for today. And the first of those key messages is the one I've just made, and that is this is a robust result delivered in challenging times. From my part of view, it's a direct consequence of coming into the crisis from a position of strength, having a deeply skilled and experienced team, and during the course of the year, of heightening our focus on risk management.</p>
          <p>I think the second key message is that we've been able to develop and get on with implementing a clear strategic agenda, and that's absolutely because we came into this crisis cycle in good shape and that we've remained in good shape during that period. And this strategic agenda has involved the organic development of our franchise, as well as taking opportunities that have emerged in the marketplace most particularly, you think about our RAMS acquisition, which was effected in the beginning of January this year and then of course the proposed merger with St.George Bank, which is now hopefully not far from completion.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, the third key messages that all the way through this year, we worked really hard to support our customers, to build deeper relationships with our customers, and to anticipate their needs. This is absolutely central to our strategy and we believe we're well placed to further the support in alignment into the 2009 year and we fully expect the 2009 year will be a difficult year for customers, as the effects of the financial crisis flow into the real economy.</p>
          <p>This audience will be very familiar with the market changes that have occurred and are still occurring.  What started as a dislocation in markets some 15 months ago evolved into a broader and very severe financial crisis, which is now having a significant impact on global economic activity. And I think we are in for a difficult two years ahead. What I'd like to comment on is how the Westpac team has responded. If you think back to September in last year, the Westpac team recognized that the emerging liquidity in funding issues could be a lot deeper and a lot more protracted than others who were investing at the time. And the team acted on this, even at that time, it seemed that the pricing was more expensive than others thought.</p>
          <p>Earlier this calendar year, under Phil Coffey's leadership and you may recall I mentioned this at the half year briefing in May, we established a multidisciplinary executive committee to meet at least weekly, in order to proactively assess, monitor and anticipate all elements and flow and implications of the financial markets' crisis. And amongst other things, this resulted in extensive industry reviews, for example in property, in infrastructure, in insurance, and in securities lending and then resulted in the team acting on those reviews and they can show that we positioned ourselves as strongly as we could. An example of an active review that was undertaken was the review of our margin lending business, which occurred relatively early on in the year, when we found that we had some large single name exposures and some concentrations that we wanted to in fact manage. And so with our customers on that in order to reduce their debt positions, in order to reduce LVRs, to put them in a better shape and of course get our own portfolio into better shape.</p>
          <p>What has been particularly pleasing for me to see has been the dynamic and proactive approach that the group have actually taken towards this and the high degree of coordination and collaboration across the group. This team has met whenever necessary. In fact there've been a few weeks, where we've met sort of three or four times a week, not just the weekly meeting. And there's been no level or sense of hierarchy or bureaucratic approach at all, it's been a completely one team approach.</p>
          <p>So turning to the financial scoreboard. And as you glance down the metrics, this results almost looks like normal results or a 'business as usual' result, but one delivered in extraordinary times. A 6% uplift in cash earnings is pleasing in a year where most global banks have experienced write-downs and negative growth. And we are particularly pleased with the revenue performance. A 10% uplift, which together with our effective management of expenses and particularly so -- particularly effective management of expenses in the second half has resulted in a full-year positive jaws of 3%.</p>
          <p>Impairment charges have clearly picked up, 31 basis points as you see here, but not unexpected in the current environment. Our cash earnings per share is up 5%, a little lower than the cash earnings growth. But that's given the increase in capital over the year. ROE comes in at 22.3%, which is a strong performance, and productivity has also improved with our cost to income ratio now sub 44%. I think in this year, the benefits of having a diverse portfolio are clear. And let me just get through a comment or two on each one of our major business units. Australian consumer business had a slow start to the year, was heavily impacted by the higher funding costs. But in the second half momentum was restored and cash earnings growth was 7%, which boosted the full-year performance to 9%.</p>
          <p>Our small and medium business operations have also continued to perform well, delivering an 11% uplift in earnings over the year. And we continue to see good growth in this business, particularly in our traditionally strong pre-June 30 flows. However in the second half, business customers began to feel the effects of the deteriorating environment, and this has been reflected in a pickup in impairment charges particularly in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The Institutional Bank has done a great job in navigating the volatile conditions with a performance that stands out against its peers. While cash earnings were lower over the year, revenues were solid; core earnings were up a strong 18%, which is a very pleasing performance. As you know, earnings were impacted by a few stressed exposures, particularly in the first half of the year, and I think these have been well managed.</p>
          <p>If you look at BT, it's clearly been impacted by the weakness in global asset markets, although the business has still managed to grow share, particularly in rep and in Corporate Super. And I think the team has responded quickly to the changed environment. And you can see this in the expense line. It's been flat expenses in the second half. For the longer run, this is a really important business for Westpac. The business has remarkable strength and we think it is well placed for the longer run.</p>
          <p>The New Zealand business has also delivered a good result in what's been an even more difficult economic environment. But for us, for Westpac, this is a turnaround story. While there has been substantial lift in impairment charges, again, most particularly in the fourth quarter, revenue was up 10%, expenses were up only 2%, margins were just one basis point lower for the year and cash earnings increased to 6%. So a good performance relative to our peers there.</p>
          <p>And I think if you look at the column on the right-hand side of this chart, which looks at the second half over the first half, particularly pleasing thing is to see the stronger momentum delivered in the Institutional Bank and in BT, which were the two businesses most impacted this year by the market dislocation.</p>
          <p>But in addition to delivering a robust financial performance, I think Westpac has also delivered a strong strategic performance. And as I indicated earlier, I think it's a fact that Westpac was well placed coming into this crisis and that we avoided major problems. That has allowed us to focus on the development of our strategic agenda, and I'll say more about this when I return for the concluding section of the presentation.</p>
          <p>But I think what we're really conscious of as a team is that it's in times like these, it's in times that are difficult or challenging, it's then that quality shows through, and it's then that differentiation for the future can be established. That was clearly the case in the 1990s, and we think it's again now the case.</p>
          <p>This year, risk management has been a key theme for financial service companies around the world, and we have a good story to tell, particularly relative to other banks locally and globally. I've already spoken to the proactive approach that we've taken to position ourselves strongly in this area. So the only further comment that I'd like to make is about culture and about the people at Westpac.</p>
          <p>From my experience here, this is a company where risk management is deeply valued, and it's deeply embedded. It's a company that has people at every level who are skilled and experienced, and people have been through the cycles. I think it's not an accident that the fact that Westpac went through those very difficult days in the late 1980s, early 1990s, actually stands us in good state now, because many of those people are still with us, and the lessons and insights from that period actually have remained with us today. And what I found is that we have transparency facing the truth as it is, understanding systemic risk, probing, taking accountability, and not personalizing, are traits that I've seen first-hand and clearly are attributes that are part of the Westpac culture.</p>
          <p>Capital management is also particularly important right now, and I think an important feature of our performance this year has been our strong capital position. Our Tier 1 of the 7.8%, which is conservatively positioned relative to our target range of 6.75 to 7.75, so it's just at the top-end or a little above our target range. This Tier 1 of 7.8 is equivalent to 10.1% Tier 1 level under the FSA methodologies. And as you note, I've seen, we're fully underwriting our DRP, which is to give us some additional strengths and some additional flexibility, particularly in the light of the proposed St.George merger.</p>
          <p>Our dividend is a good story, as this slide shows. We've been able to increase the dividend by 8%, and maintain the strong and steady trajectory that we produced over a number of years. So before I hand over to Phil to take us through some of the detail, let me just briefly reflect on some highlights and lowlights from my perspective, and I'll call out three areas of concern or lowlight and then a few areas of highlight.</p>
          <p>Starting with the lowlights, firstly, our area of concern was with regard to technology. Our delivery platforms and associated processes are not all that they need to be, and they have let us down from time to time. And so it's clear to us that they need work to enhance reliability and to equip us to support our customers in the way that we'd like. We certainly identified this issue, we're strengthening the team, and I believe that we have it in hand. So that would be the first issue.</p>
          <p>The second is that our equities division has had a challenging year, and it's been disappointing, I know, for the team concerned. It's been a combination of one large impairment provision and indeed some poor operational elements and some poor operational management. There's no question, we didn't manage the market volatility in this business as effectively as we managed in our other market businesses. And again, this is a situation that we have in hand.</p>
          <p>The third area I'd call you to is our deposit performance. You may remember at the first half, I indicated that it wasn't what it needed to be, and that we'd be putting some focus on it. And I have said, for the first nine months, it has been disappointing. We were slow to respond to the new environment, and we were slow to develop an integrated strategy, and indeed to up the focus in an effective way.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to say, we've had a much better last quarter results, some of which is probably as a result of the environment overall, but a much better last quarter result. So if you look at the full-year, 50% of our full-year increase came in the first three quarters, and 50% came in the last quarter. And not surprisingly, that momentum has continued into October.</p>
          <p>On highlights, the things I'm most pleased about, well obviously starting with the first one that we've effectively managed and navigated our way through one of the toughest environments that we've had to face over the last 15 years, with the 6% increase in cash earnings, strong capital position and strong level of provision coverage. So I think that's a real achievement.</p>
          <p>The second is the much stronger team approach. I have referenced that briefly already with regard to the multi-disciplinary team that Phil Coffey has been sharing, specifically to deal with our response to this environment. But I have seen it in many other areas as well. Our business is coordinating and cooperating much more strongly together, clearly our BT business working very closely with our Consumer Financial Services division.</p>
          <p>Likewise, our Institutional Bank working very closely with our Business Financial Services division providing additional products and services in support to our business customers in those businesses. And then of course all other work to do the merger; from the due diligence, all the way through to the integration planning work that we're doing right now has evidenced very significant collaboration, cooperation and effective teamwork across the group. So, a real highlight for me.</p>
          <p>The third highlight is that we have a new strategy in place. It's a strategy that's clear, it's a strategy that's actionable, it's a strategy that's underway, and it's very much a strategy focused on the customer.</p>
          <p>The fourth is that employee engagement is up. And that's pretty important in these difficult times. We completed our most recent employee survey a few months ago in middle of the year, and had a record response rates of well into the 90% response rates and the highest engagement scores we've had to date. But the most pleasing element of the responses was the response from our staff indicating that they are up for change. They are excited about the changed agenda. They are embracing this changed agenda, very much identifying with the focus on customer, and I think it's so important to actually have the people lined up behind the strategy, if we're going to be successful.</p>
          <p>And the last point talking about customers is that I'm really delighted to say that we have consistently supported our customers over this whole year. We've been opened for business over this whole year and notwithstanding the difficulties of the funding arena. And I think we've been very thoughtful in the way in which we've handled the interest rate movements. We've been active in assisting our customers, who may be having difficulties, we launched Westpac Assist, which has been a very important component of our overall positioning. And we sought to build trust with our customers over this entire period. So with that maybe I'll pause and stop and hand over to Phil, who I know will take us through some of the financial details.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gail, and good morning everyone. Today, I'd like to briefly review our 2008 financial performance, highlighting those areas and components of our earnings that I think are worth bringing to your attention. I will then spend some time on focus areas for us, especially credit risk and funding and capital management, areas where we think further discussion may be of use. And lastly, I will give some comments on factors that are likely to impact our 2009 performance.</p>
          <p>When we updated the market in August, we indicated we are on track to deliver cash earnings growth of 6 to 8%. And at that time, we expected to be more towards the middle of that range. Since that date, however, we've been dealing with a rapid deterioration in global markets. And this has obviously impacted our results, especially in the revaluations of securities in our prudential liquidity portfolio, and in our debt capital markets. These are areas where we mark-to-market all our holdings. We also uncovered a deterioration in one of our corporate exposures in early October, and we've topped up that provision by an additional $36 million. In each of those circumstances, I'm pleased we've dealt with the impact in '08 as it clears the deck and improves our '09 position.</p>
          <p>And so it's in that context I'm pleased to report cash earnings growth increased 6.2%, fueled on the foundation of strong revenue growth of 10%. Our expenses rose 7%, reflecting continued investment in the front line, although as we foreshadowed in May, we also slowed expense growth in the second half. Our impairment charge was significantly higher and I'll spend more time on that later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>We had little impact on earnings from tax issues. Our reported impact growth was much higher at 12%, as the net impact of one-offs, speced out, was an after-tax benefit of $54 million. A real feature of the result was the strong second half. Revenue was again the driver with growth over the half at 5%. All business divisions delivered a positive revenue performance, supported by strong customer growth on the balance sheet with lending and consumer and business, up 6 and 10% respectively, while customer deposits increased 9% in the half.</p>
          <p>Expense growth slowed as we took a harder look at our support costs, and we sought to ensure cost better effected revenue performance. So the combination of our revenue and expense growth saw our core earnings or the pre-provision and tax performance, up 7% in the half. We provide a bit more for some tax issues and had our impairment charge and so after-tax cash earnings increased 3%.</p>
          <p>In looking at the composition of our revenue growth, it's our net interest income that's the standout. A combination of both very strong growth in average assets, and effective management of margins. Non-interest income growth was slower with banking fees up 6%, and we saw a reduction in income from our wealth businesses. Transaction fees were also lower and there is a clear market trend towards accounts with lower fees.</p>
          <p>Looking at our margins and it was a tale of two halves but overall an encouraging outcome. In the first half, we reported margins down nine basis points, mainly a result of two factors. Firstly, the increase in our cost of funds which was only progressively passed through to our customers and which narrowed asset spreads, especially for our mortgage products.</p>
          <p>And secondly, from the impact of holding significantly more liquid assets; and you can see that here in the chart with a seven basis point decline from Treasury. However, in the second half margins improved. We didn't have the drag from liquid holdings, we saw the benefits of repricing both for risk and for a high funding cost, and we saw a large contribution from WIB.</p>
          <p>The contribution from WIB reflects three elements.  It does reflect the repricing of the book, but it's also due to the mixed effect of growing WIB assets more slowly in the half and it's from recording more markets income as interest income. If you look at it over the full year, and you take out the Treasury and the compositional changes, then you can see our underlying margins declined by only four basis points. Outside of the impact on funding, extreme global market conditions impacted our results in two main ways. The first was the impact of high volatility, and the second from weaker investment markets. Firstly, in managing market risk from both customer transactions and from our balance sheet we did well. Combined revenue increased 22%, with strong performance in foreign exchange and debt markets and Treasury. And in FX and debt capital markets, our customer volumes grew significantly, and what we saw was that higher market volatility is a great opportunity to deliver extra value to customers.</p>
          <p>One soft spot was equity risk management, as Gail has mentioned and managing risk in our equities books was particularly difficult, not only given the market moves we have experienced, but particularly the steep falls from one day to the next.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I'd note that as Phil Chronican explained in August, the impact of higher market volatility will increase our value at risk, or our VaR measures. And that continued throughout the second half. And this is particularly noticed in our Treasury, where we had little change in the underlying structured positions, but a large pickup in our measured VaR.</p>
          <p>The second area of impact from global markets is in our wealth business. After many years of very strong growth, we saw both our revenue and our earnings in BT decline in 2008. Lower investment market values reduced our FUM and our FUA, and this reduced earnings by around $55 million. We also saw reduced returns on our invested capital. And these lower returns alone reduced cash earnings by $38 million. So the total cash earnings impact of markets on BT was a negative $93 million. The underlying business, however, continued to perform well. Fewer margins increased by five basis points, our BTIM Managers had good relative investment performance and attracted institutional mandates, and our administration platform continues to be a market leader, grabbing 24% of all new business. So we will continue to invest in this business. However we have needed to cut our cost for lower activity, and so we reduced the run rate on expenses in the second half and we have positioned ourselves for a more sustainable revenue and expense balance for 2009 and 2010.</p>
          <p>Expense growth of 7% reflects our ongoing investment in front-line services. We added people and branches and business banking centers throughout the year. And we also invested in projects such as replacing our global foreign exchange system, improving online security for customers, and adding life insurance products to our rep platform.</p>
          <p>The RAMS business also added $36 million of expenses since it was acquired in early January. As I mentioned expense growth slowed in the second-half as we reduced head count mostly in our support areas. And we provided for that through our restructuring charge. There was little benefit however from the restructuring charge in the '08 result, as initiatives were skewed to the later months of the year.</p>
          <p>Equity credit quality is one of the hot topics of this reporting season, so I'd like to provide a bit more detail on that book, and how that is reflected in our provisions. And the next two slides give additional detail on our credit portfolios. The first slide shows the growth in impaired assets through the year. And you can see we had quite a pickup in the first half, but this was mostly due to a small number of large exposures in WIM and mostly due to the initial impacts of the global markets crisis.</p>
          <p>In the second half, the growth in impaired assets actually slowed, but more importantly, the composition changed, and the impact of the more broad-based weakening in economic conditions in Australia or in New Zealand flowed through our books. Now, total impaired assets to gross loans has now picked up 37 basis points, although this still looks pretty good in an industry context. The clear message here though is that the first half was one related to financial crisis, and the second half to an economic downturn.</p>
          <p>This next slide provides more detail of the other components of our stressed exposures outside of the directly impaired. And this is important detail because while impaired assets are clearly important, analysis of what we determined as Watchlist and substandard provides a more comprehensive disclosure of our book quality, and more completely these categories are also large contributors to our collective provision.</p>
          <p>I'd like to highlight two elements. The first is that we have reported quite a pickup in our Watchlist and substandard assets, but this is broad-based across divisions, segments and industries. Our level of stress in property, for example, was in line with most other industries, although this included faster growth in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>Secondly and importantly, most of this increase is in our early Watchlist category. And it follows our disciplines of being a very thorough organization in reviewing our credit portfolios and taking a conservative stance on our internal credit ratings, which include a very realistic assessment of conditions.</p>
          <p>So the key element to note with regard to that is at this stage of the cycle, you should expect us to be very vigilant in reviewing our credit portfolio.  We'd rather know early about our problems, because that enhances our opportunities for being proactive in dealing with them. I should also mention that our delinquency data is not indicating problems in our consumer portfolios, either mortgages or personal, although it does reflect the more difficult conditions in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>When we look at how that credit picture flowed through the profit and loss. You can see individually assessed provisions, net off write backs, increased by $290 million over the year, and collectively assess provisions increased by around 160 million. Write-offs grew by 76 million during the year and they slowed in the second half. Our collective provision included a top up of 76 million to our economic overlay and that overlay is specifically for additional risk to financial institutions that flowed from these extreme global developments. And that brings the total provision for that risk to $104 million, and our total economic overlay to $251 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at our total impairment charge to average loans for 2008, you can see it now totals 31 basis points, and if we used the older counting measures that would be equivalent to 36 basis points. So, we are now a little higher than the levels that we saw in the 2001 and 2002 slowdown. The increases in our charges have also increased our provision coverage. Now there are lots of measures that you could use to define that. The three that we focus on, and they reflect both the aggregate cover and cover relative to risk, our total provisions to gross loans, total provisions to risk-weighted assets and collective provisions to credit risk-weighted assets. And you can see on this slide that they've all showed good increases over 2008, and absolute healthy coverage levels.</p>
          <p>Another key area of focus for us was in funding and liquidity management. It's been a particularly busy year for Treasury, and we've raised nearly $40 billion in term markets, and for an average duration, not much shorter than the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Given the ongoing volatility and uncertainty that we saw in global capital markets, I think that performance speaks loudly to the strength and diversity of our funding franchise. Part of this new funding supported a further addition to our liquidity position, which averaged $35 billion through the year. Changes in the Central Bank rules around eligible assets through repo funding has now meant that liquidity holdings have increased to around $57 billion.</p>
          <p>The last point around funding that I wish to make was the growth in our customer deposits. Here if you back out the issuance of wholesale certificates to deposit, you get what we would call customer deposits, and those deposits increased by $17 billion in 2008, with much of that growth in the second half, as Gail has mentioned. In fact, over the last three months our customer deposits matched our loan growth.</p>
          <p>Looking at the environment for funding in 2009, we're likely to see somewhat slower growth in loans, and no extra requirement for additional liquid assets. We also have the benefit of the measures that are being put in place by the government to backstop global funding, and we are achieving better results in our deposit growth. So, that combination of factors, together with our existing liquidity balances, gives me great confidence around our future funding plans.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital. In the first product, the highlight is the setting of our target capital ranges and the Basel II. We've needed to consider regulatory minimums, feedback from our investors, and rating agencies, and our own risk modeling of the portfolio of activities that we operate today -- that is, banking and wealth businesses in Australia and New Zealand. So when all of that was considered in establishing the appropriate targets and ranges for capital for Westpac, which our Tier 1 ratio of 6.75 to 7.75% and TCI range of 9.75 to 10.75%. These ranges are the likely capital backing that we will operate with in normal business circumstances. We would expect to operate towards the upper end of those ranges, and from time to time above them in highly uncertain environments, like the one we are currently experiencing.</p>
          <p>Our ratios at the end of September were strong. They stood at 7.78% for Tier 1, and 10.84% for TCR. And those strong ratios were achieved after accommodating the impact of strong growth in Israel assets up 16%, and the introduction of new measures for Treasury risk management and interest rate risk in the banking book, which together deducted 24 basis points from our capital measures.</p>
          <p>As Gail mentioned, we've chosen to fully underwrite our DRP for the 2008 final dividend, and this will by itself add a further 51 basis points to our Tier 1 ratio. And this additional capital provides us with extra flexibility in dealing with the proposed merger. And in particular flexibility around the redemption of the St.George Bank hybrids. It will of course also facilitate customer growth, and of course, is an additional buffer against extreme surprises.</p>
          <p>I talked in August around the &#x2013; the procyclicality of capital ratios under Basel II, and I wanted to elaborate further on the size of that impact for us that we incurred over 2008. The table on this chart shows that our credit risk weighted assets have increased over the year, in part because of volume growth on loans, and in part because of changes in credit risk quality, and over this year, in part because of shifts between categories for some business facilities.</p>
          <p>If we focus purely on the impact of changes in credit quality, which I think is really what the focus is around procyclicality, you can see that the deterioration over 2008 had a negative 16 basis points impact on our Tier 1 ratio. And that compares with the estimate that I shared in August for what the 2001 slowdown would do to our portfolio today, which was a decline of 25 to 30 basis points.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to 2009, I'm mindful of just how much unpredictable change has occurred in the last 12 months, and so forecasting performance is a hazardous exercise. So let me call out some areas where we at least have some insight. Customers are deleveraging, and that's what you would expect with the slowing economic activity, and we see that with system credit growth slowing, and we can see that in our forward lending pipelines. But we are also improving our market share for lending, and we are doing better on deposits.</p>
          <p>We're also aiming to manage our margin compression toward the lower end of historical experience, leveraging some of the successful strategies that we executed in the second half of '08. We kicked off our restructuring program in the later part of 2008 to manage our underlying expense growth lower. And we will see the dividends of that in 2009. But we're also going to continue to invest in the front-line, and we will also need to offset some one-off costs in 2009 from our defined benefit plan, from expensing BTIM share-based payments, and the full period impact of RAMS. And those one-offs will probably add another 1 to 2% of expense growth.</p>
          <p>We expect our impairment charges to rise as the economy softens. But we've looked to be as prepared as we can for this, both in terms of our provisioning coverage, and in the shape of our credit portfolios.</p>
          <p>The last major impact for us next year, will of course be the proposed St.George merger, and we keenly await their shareholder vote on November 13, with integration plans that are well in place and well underway, and we will share more detail with you with regard to the merger impacts in a presentation in December.</p>
          <p>So, let me quickly sum up. 2008 was an amazing year of change, and challenge, and stress, and opportunity. And through that we have delivered solid earnings growth on the back of strong revenue. Our second half performance was particularly encouraging. We have a franchise in good shape, with improving market share in key segments, and we are managing our underlying expense rate lower, consistent with a tougher operating environment.</p>
          <p>Our impairment charge has grown as credit issues have arisen, and as we have taken a very realistic assessment of future trends. Within that context, we maintained a very strong capital position, and we have plans in place to maintain that.</p>
          <p>Thanks, and let me hand back to Gail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Phil. What I'll do in this section is provide a brief update on our strategic agenda and also add some words to those of Phil's with regard to the outlook. You may recall at our first half yearly results and again at the operational update on the 8th of August, I outlined our key strategic priorities. And at the core of the agenda is driving a significantly stronger customer culture, really putting customers at the center. And supporting this agenda, we called our specific priorities, those of strengthening our distribution, transforming our operations to improve service delivery, enhancing our technology both from a reliability and a capability point of view and driving a one-team approach. And we're also now well progressed with a proposed transformational merger with St.George.</p>
          <p>This slide and the next provide more detail on progress being made on the strategic priorities. Our new organizational model, which we announced in July and implemented more or less right away, has brought a high degree of focus on these key areas. Peter Hanlon has a number of initiatives underway in his division, the retail and business banking division, around improving the service proposition to key segments, improving our contact center delivery, and rounding out an enhanced local market model, with clear lines of authority. I think Peter is achieving particular success in restoring the balance back to the front-line. He is in the process of appointing 55 new regional General Managers and really complimenting that with a much stronger role and position for the Branch Managers, and we're calling those Branch Managers, actually Bank Managers.</p>
          <p>There a number of other things that Peter has been doing, as part of that revising, reviewing, the way we handle recruitment, putting a lot more local delegated authority into that model, the way we handle induction, the way we handle training, so new score cards that are being rolled out and it's of course de-layering is part of this model too. We are reducing management layers from CEO to our front-line customer-facing staff, from what I believe a 12, it sounds like an awful number of layers, but from what was 12 to now down to seven.</p>
          <p>With regard to our Product and Operations division, Peter Clare is up and running with his process redesign work and he has got a number of quick wins under the belt, some of which go towards improving our decisioning speed, and some which go towards -- just straightforward improving the operational capability that we have and simplifying processes, making it easier for our customers to do business with us. A couple of examples: One would be personal loan decisioning for shoppers, for Saturday shoppers, so that we can do that on that day instantly, and another is some instant decisioning online in key areas, such as approvals for our broker channel.</p>
          <p>But Peter is of course also actively ensuring that his division is ready for once the merger is effective. As his business unit will arguably be one of those that's most impacted with the operational teams coming together and the product management teams coming together. And so he'll have opportunities for cost synergies and for improved service delivery on his agenda.</p>
          <p>With regard to the technology, Bob McKinnon is being with us for two and a half months now, and we've benefited immediately from the dedicated focus that we've placed on technology and from Bob's experience in this area. He's building his bench strengths and he is underway with determining our IT strategy, the longer run architecture that we need to support that strategy, and the roadmap to get us there. And I think it would be fair to say that the merger with St.George will certainly provide Bob with both challenges and opportunities and he is certainly sitting about thinking this through in a very methodical and pragmatic way.</p>
          <p>An underpinning priority for me, and one in which we have made considerable progress and I've touched that already is in the area of one team. The new operating model that we have absolutely depends on collaboration, and there is certainly evidence of it across the group. You may recall, in our August update I have spoke to some of the results that we're having out of our Super for Life product. So, let me just briefly talk to that again. If you may recall, we launched at this time last year, and there was lots of discussion about whether or not it was appropriate or not for branches to actually sell the product, and very little progress was made in that space. And at April this time this year, probably about 30 Super for Life product sales were occurring per week through the branch network.</p>
          <p>We now have consistently and have had consistently for the past three months, about 2,500 sales of Super for Life product per week through the branch network. And I have told that every single one of our front facing customer serving staff has actually made a sale. And I suppose this comes into context, when I say that 80% of our Super for Life sales are occurring through the branch network. So, such a natural channel to support our own customers' needs around super products. But for me, the learning or listen out of this is a direct consequence of leadership from the Group Executive and from general managers, getting together, calling this out as a priority, and actually not worrying too much about who gets the benefit, where the balance is, who gets the revenue, but actually just organizing to make it happen.</p>
          <p>In terms of a forward agenda, it's very clear that we have a lot to do. Firstly, finalizing the merger with St.George, which hopefully is now only weeks away, the shareholder vote scheduled through November 13, and we are very well prepared. We've had our integration team in place for around three months, three to four months. And in December Brad, Phil and I will do a formal presentation to the market as Phil outlined, where we will talk to our plans, the synergy targets, and the timeframes, and really set up a schedule and a reporting approach that we can come back to the market in a regular basis.</p>
          <p>As indicated, significant work is underway, with regards to IT, and in our distributions and operations world. We have specific, funded initiatives underway; some are listed on this page, on this slide. And they're being coordinated with the merger work under Brad's overall directions. So that we can assure that the funding occurs in a sequenced and prioritized way, and that we are able to keep really good track on how we're going.</p>
          <p>Moving into the outlook, and just adding a few comments to what Phil has already said. Certainly we see 2009 will be another challenging year. Globally the economies are slowing, with the U.S, the UK and most parts of Europe already heading into a recession. And in Australia, while we're dealing with the challenges of slowing growth, certainly lower levels of consumer spending, and struggling consumer confidence, we believe that we will avoid a recession here within Australia. We're on a path of lowering interest rates, 125 basis points has been reduced over the course of the past two months, and the government's embarked on additional fiscal stimulus -- you would have seen that the 10.4 billion package that was announced a short while ago, and we think we're likely to see more on both of those fronts. In other words further rate declines over the next few months, as well as further fiscal stimulus, probably in the form of support for infrastructure projects.</p>
          <p>From a customer point of view, clearly this is going to be a challenging year. As Phil outlined, customers are deleveraging, they're seeking to manage their levels of indebtedness, they're pulling in their belts, businesses are reviewing their expansion plans, and sort of thinking about how to balance the different elements of their business opportunities. All I think are keen to rebuild wealth on the basis of having seen what's happened to their wealth over the course of the past year. All are looking for safety; all are looking for a bank that they can trust.</p>
          <p>So really let me then just quickly sum up and perhaps just return to those three key messages that I started the presentation with. Firstly, we see this as a good performance, a robust performance in a tough year and a strong portfolio of businesses that are delivering. Secondly, made excellent progress on our strategic agenda, on a strategic agenda that's clear, that's actionable, that's very much under way. And thirdly, we think that we are well positioned for this tougher environment in 2009 and are very well positioned to support customers. I liked Phil's words when he finished his presentation. I'm not sure I can add to those, what were they Phil?  He spoke about a year of challenge, change, stress and opportunity and certainly we will be thinking about the 2009 year in terms of how can we best position ourselves for that opportunity.</p>
          <p>So thanks very much all of you for being here today and we'll now take questions. So I'll ask Andrew to come up and help us with that. We have a number of -- all of my team here today to assist with any questions that you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>James Freeman, Goldman Sachs JBWere. I just want to touch on the capital, and particularly capital targets. The top end range there, 7.75, we've seen a lot of the other banks move above the 8% mark, just wondering so how comfortable you are with the top end of your target, That that will be enough over the next couple of years particularly as regulators push for more capital? And also just if you can give us some indication of what the capital position looks like once the St.George merger has been factored in? Does your capital position drop back into that target range, or you're still going to be staying above the top end of the target range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start off with an answer and then hand over to Phil, who'll talk specifically to the elements with regard to St.George, I'm sure. A lot of factors go into the determination of our target range capital and we are very comfortable with that position, that target range that we've set of 6.75 to 7.75, however in times like these, in more difficult environments, we want to operate at the upper end of that. And as you see at the moment, we're actually even slightly outside that range in the upper end there. So, we think we're well placed.</p>
          <p>There are a lot of factors that go to our business mix and our view of the cycle, and where we are in the cycle, that actually go into that range. But, pretty comfortable with where we are. We are seeking to position ourselves conservatively, and build additional flexibility, and that's the key reason why we are underwriting the DRP. It's not something that Westpac has done a lot of, in fact, I don't think it's -- we've underwritten the DRP in the last 10 years. So, but that's specifically in order to give us additional flexibility and additional conservative approach, and that will of course, take us to above the 8% range, when you add in the additional 51 basis points that will provide. But Phil, why don't you add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in the other comments I've made. I think James, the market is trying to determine what's appropriate and we're part of that obviously. When we looked at establishing those target ranges, we did very extensive modeling of our portfolio. And I think portfolio is different in terms of the geography you've got, the mix you've got. And when we looked at those things that's what drove the ranges that we called out. But as Gail mentioned, we're not going to say, well if we're at the top of the range, therefore we won't do anything. Clearly, we'll look at the circumstances that we're in. And we want to make sure that we have enough capital to support the customer activities that we're looking to pursue. In terms of the St.George merger, you should expect that our capital ranges -- our capital ratios will come back into that range as a consequence to that.</p>
          <p>I'd call out a couple things. First of all, how we come back and what level we come back to is a function of how we manage the rollover of the St.George hybrids. And so there is some issues there that we have to work through. We've got some flexibility in timing, and we will look to do that. But that will determine the outcome. And the second thing I'd call out is, obviously when you combine the St.George capital ratios under Basel I or under standardized Basel II, which is they're going with their own under advanced. By definition you're going to get a lower aggregate when you combine those two. And really what we'll be working obviously, diligently through 2009 is, we ought to move the St.George portfolio through the same metrics that we use for Westpac, and then you'll get to see what the combined group really looks like in terms of a capital position. And we'll try to share how that looks when we talk to you guys.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry Phil, just a follow-up. If the rating agencies and regulators seeing your target range in a more stable environment? Are they happy with where you set your target ranges --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've obviously talked through what our capital expectations were when we looked at the proposed merger with the rating agencies, and I think you've seen them reaffirmed the combined groups rating, and we think that that was even before we announced the DRP underwrite. So we can't think, I'm sure they're here, but I really think that I'll be supportive in what we're doing, as are the regulators.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Craig Williams, Citi here. Look, full marks to the team for delivering a better prepared institutional book than your peers would seem to have. As the cycle turns to Main Street, you're bulking up with the St.George acquisition. So if you could perhaps provide some color as to why you think investors can take confidence that Westpac can perform in a broader write-down commercial book, with respect to credit quality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just kick off with that one as well. Certainly our underlying business is in excellent shape, the credit quality of the underlying business is in excellent shape. And we've -- over the course of this year done some pretty significant stress testing and portfolio reviews. If property would probably be the biggest one that we'd be concentrating on, particularly in the light of the pending St.George merger, because clearly St.George has a strong position in property and Westpac also has a strong position in property.</p>
          <p>So we would be wanting to look at the combined concentration issues there and actually work through that in a systematic case-by-case basis. But the underlying credit quality disciplines that are inherent in the Westpac business put us in a strong starting position. And I think, you looked at St.George's result yesterday, their credit quality looks to be similarly quite robustly placed. But we will, when the combined books come together, actually make sure that we manage both in terms of the concentration limit issues, as well as diversification issues, and customer-by-customer just have a really good look and see where we are placed and what action we may need to take to improve the position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just pass, in front to Ross. Thanks, Craig. Thanks Ross.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ross Brown, Deutsche Bank. Just further sort of clarification on the capital question. You said that you'd fall back into the 6.75 to 7.75 target range, is that after the DRP underwrite, so the starting point is 8.3? So therefore you are expecting a plus 50 basis points, negative impact from consolidating St.George?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's correct. And I think you can do the sums, Ross, you've got the capital position that St.George is bringing and their starting point, which I've covered -- just need to be considered in the context of what the metric that they are using, which is a Basel I metric, but when you combine the two, it will bring us back into the top end of that range, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how long before you think you get Basel II advanced accreditation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that that's not necessarily within our control. We need to get our regulator to approve the usage of the models. The encouraging thing for us is that they've clearly been working hard to get their data in shape to allow them to pursue advanced accreditation in any case. It's not like we're taking -- merging with a company that hadn't even started that process, they're actually quite well advanced. And so really it's a case of how quickly can we combine what they've done, bring our own knowledge to bear, and then get the regulator happy. I would say you should assume it's going to take; it's the best part of 2009 to be able to do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jon Mott from UBS. Just following on the capital thing. If you look at your target now to be at the very top end, or towards the top end of that target ratio, and then you look at the 72% payout ratio that you had this year. Next year you've got most likely higher bad debt charges, you've got dilution from the DIP and also dilution from the St.George in the first year. How realistic is it to maintain or even grow dividends in this environment without really sacrificing the Tier 1 ratio or requiring further DIP underwrites or capital raisings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The call on modeling suggest that we are entirely in a position where we are able to maintain our dividend trajectory. We wouldn't be otherwise increasing the dividend in the way that we have today. So that's what all of our modeling suggests that we are able to do. Phil, do you want to say anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've pointed out all the issues that we have to deal through. The only thought, I guess, the point I'd add is that, you do have to look through what are the issues that are affecting your position today, versus what you expect to see in terms of earnings, and therefore, distributable earnings generation in future years. And that will be a very major factor that goes into our dividend deliberation, but we think our investors are keen to see consistency in dividend, and that would be certainly something that we'd be aiming to deliver into.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's trajectory and dividends rather than current dividend levels staying where they are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think the reality is, they'd start by saying they'd like to be assured that the dividends are going to be maintained at current levels, and then they'd be saying, well, and I'd like to see some growth, and it's a case of how you can achieve that, bearing in mind, the factors you have already elaborated on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, your target payout ratios going forward, what would they pay per St.George?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not -- we don't actually ever set a target payout ratio per se. In normal circumstances, we would say that our financial models of our business through time suggest that a payout ratio of 70% is, through time, the kind of levels that we can sustain based upon our earnings, and based upon our franking generation. And so that's a ballpark, but in any particular period, we're not going to be so slavishly saying, well it has to be 70, could be well below that and it could be above that, for the reasons I've said, which is, what's the future look like, versus what we're delivering in a particular period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, JPMorgan. Question for Phil, if I may. And by the way, I noted that the franking generation in the second half was pretty massively negative, which I suppose is worth pointing out. If you go back to what you released with the last result, you guys said, and I refer to slide 22 of the investor discussion pack from May 2008, you were saying that you are well ahead of the funding plan, which was 25 to $30 billion for the year. The figure that you've disclosed today is that you actually raised $39 billion of term funding over the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you reconcile where the extra 15 billion went, and perhaps more importantly, what is the term funding required for Westpac on a stand-alone basis roughly in 2009, and what is the combined group in 2009? And also, could you share with us what it actually grows to in the out years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the first thing, the franking generation, the franking credits dropped because of timing differences and it's really mostly to do with the drop in the A dollar. It came through in terms of timing differences, particularly in our forward foreign exchange derivative contracts, and it's just -- we expect that to unwind over time, and the franking credit surplus will go back to the levels that you'd expect to see from us, which is 400 to 500 million.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that we've stopped calling out, or what's the term funding program because at the end of the day, the reality is that if we can get more term funding at the right price, that actually supports the overall composition of our fundraising, and we won't be saying well, we've reached 25 and therefore hands off and think about it as if it was just one year at a time.</p>
          <p>Our view is that when term markets are open and appropriate for pricing, we will do term issuance. We'd love to get more deposit growth and certainly you've heard us talk about that. And so, I'm not going to call out a target, we basically have a Treasury approach, that basically is looking at a number of different factors that control the composition of our fundraising, and our natural bias is to raise term funding and to raise deposits. And we'll be looking over time through different markets to achieve both those things. So, if we have more opportunity to raise term funds next year on top of what we've already raised through 2008, we'll absolutely do that as well.</p>

          <p>Phil, I suppose that's disappointing to hear that change in the disclose, but what's more important, can you reconcile for us the 20 to $25 billion, the planned term funding that was announced in May 2008 that the market took considerable comfort from, relative to your peers, versus the 39 billion, it's a massive variance. Just be interested in --</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm wondering why you're saying that's a bad thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not -- I just want to understand why you've raised 39 billion whereas the market had been informed it would be 20 to 25. I just want to understand, was the 20 to 25 incorrect or is it -- has it gone to balance sheet liquidity, or where has it gone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>20 to 25 is what we were anticipating at that time. It would have been sufficient to both keep our ratios within our funding mix the same, and to accommodate our loan growth. Now, to tell you the truth, loan growth has been slightly higher than what we were forecasting then, and liquid asset growth has been higher as well. So that, if you like, added a little bit more in terms of demand, but frankly if the funding markets are there, as I said, we'll take advantage of them, because it's really prudent to actually get longer-term funding on board. And so I'm going to pass to the bit size pass to Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the other thing is -- obviously in May, the world was a different place than it is now. So I mean I think for us the prudent thing was to make sure when markets were open, we constantly -- we started in August last year of getting in front of it and we stayed in front of it and I think we probably had a view that things were not getting better, so we stayed in front of it. So, I'd like to think that we've done is, we want to maintain a good buffer there if markets stay completely closed, we can actually stare down the market and not have to issue.</p>
          <p>That extra 10 or $15 billion I think reflects the fact that we are now better prepared for what we're going into with the merger, and with other things potentially around us. So, I think, as Phil said, this should been very much as a good thing, in that we've been able to continue to access markets. The 20 to 25 was absolutely what we thought was fair and reasonable at that stage, with the anticipation of being on track to where we would be at the end of the financial year. Things have deteriorated, so we continue to try to stay in front of that.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you said, any potential six-month period or 12-month period of time, could we see it only being 10 or 15?  Potentially. But that would probably mean that we thought the world was a much different place. It could be because deposits are much faster, and it could be that we said we actually think now we don't need to be as far in front of things, but I think the reality of what you've heard on our outlook is ,that's probably unlikely. So we'd be saying that our expectation for next year is not going to be that much different than what we've said in the past, which is, we've said loan growth is easing off. Deposit growth looks to be a little bit stronger, so we're still anticipating at a 12-month period of time that the combined group is very achievable relatively down and probably less than what we've done in the previous 12 months.</p>

          <p>It's Richard Wiles, Morgan Stanley. Six months ago, New Zealand credit quality was deteriorating, but the Australian consumer and the Australian business financial services credit quality were pretty sound. And now we've got New Zealand continuing to get worse, and business financial services deteriorating in the fourth quarter. So what I would like to know is, for 2009, what are you most concerned about, the New Zealand, the Australian consumer, or Australian businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are paying lots of attention to all three of those, let me absolutely assure you. On the Australian consumer side, frankly that's held up really, really well. And we expect that it's likely to continue to hold up pretty well. The area that most suffers early on in any difficult downturn is the unsecured lending. And we've actually seen, if anything, an improving portfolio position with regard to our unsecured lending. That's partly as a consequence of quite significantly slower growth in cards over the course of the past 18 months, which is  partly because of a more conservative approach towards that particular market over this period, and partly because of the reshaping of our Virgin portfolio.</p>
          <p>So we don't expect to see any material pickup in that area, it's a well-seasoned book, and it's in good shape. Home lending has again remained really in excellent shape, with a 90 day arrears rates, something like 37 basis points. We already have something like 171, 165 properties in position across 800,000 mortgages. So really in excellent shape there with low LVRs -- LVR for the portfolio as a whole is still in the 40% zone -- 46% I think it is.</p>
          <p>So, clearly the key there is unemployment and the trends with regard to unemployment, and while we think there is likely to be a slight pickup in unemployment over the course of the 2009 year, we really do believe that the consumer portfolios, while they will deteriorate modesty, or a little bit on the fringe, will remain really robust. With regard to business, we've been really all over that. I don't know, Peter Hanlon, you might like to comment on the business portfolio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Gail. Yeah, we've certainly seen a deterioration through the second half and particularly in the fourth quarter. I think the important thing is it's been right across every industry. We haven't seen one industry stand out. From a state perspective, we've actually had a slightly worse experience in Victoria, but that's down to two individual losses that we had in Victoria.</p>
          <p>And in many ways, in fact those two losses we had in Victoria made the result for the half, and therefore the full-year, look worse than the underlying run-rate was. In terms of your question about where do we see it going, I mean it hasn't really -- if you'd like, bled into the very small business sector and to a large degree the small business sector is very linked to the household sector as well. So if we see the household sector worsening, the unsecured, the mortgages, then we'd also expect to see the small business sector worsen as well. And again, what that -- what's that built-on? It's built on the unemployment rate, primarily.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the comments on New Zealand. Look, New Zealand I think is well into its cycle. It's further into its cycle than we are here. And what contributed to our increased impairments in the fourth quarter were a couple of larger ones, rather than systematic deterioration across the whole portfolio. So it's well into its cycle and I think could stabilize into next year.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Matt Davidson, Merrill Lynch. A question on deposit growth and the government guarantee. You pointed to the accelerating trend, particularly in the fourth quarter of the year in deposit growth. Wondering if you could give us bit more of a feel, particularly the last month and how strong the deposit growth has been there, of leading into the guarantee imposed. And going back to the six-monthly performance, do you now view your deposit growth as back in line with system or above, or do you see that as, that was really something all the major banks benefited from over that fourth quarter period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think there is a combination of things that has come into play. There is no question that we have now a strategy, which is much more coherent and focused on segments and focused on specific delivery channels, and focused on specific products. So we have, for the first time for a while, a really strong and clear strategy in deposits, and we have a much stronger distribution and sales force in the frontline, who are incentivized appropriately and understand the power and importance of deposits, who are actually working that book really hard. So there's certainly been an improvement in our own performance and improvement in our own positioning, we've actually priced better, I think one of the reasons why we were underbaked in deposits in the first nine months is we were out of the market from a pricing point of view.</p>
          <p>We were still living in an old world of saying, gosh, these deposit rates are ridiculous. Meanwhile, because funding had come off so materially in others, smaller players in particular, having difficulty in accessing wholesale funding, they had, not surprisingly, increased their rates on retail deposits. So that's the one factor we've improved our own position. We have a clearer strategy. We're delivering stronger in our own position. Yeah, there is of course a flight to quality, and so we have seen customers actually return to Westpac or want to have their deposits with Westpac, because it's a safe institution, because it's secure, and because they know that they can trust the institution. Peter, I don't know if you want about specifically how you're seeing our performance relative to the market share in more recent times?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gail. I think all the points you've made are right in terms of the reasons behind the full-year's performance. Obviously in recent months we've seen the flight to quality and some change in that, to some degree, since the federal government announced the deposit guarantee. If I look over the full-year, we're still tracking below system for the year as average, but we've improved that as the year's gone on. And over the last few months, we've actually got to system and marginally above, so tomorrow. I think it is -- the September numbers will come out, and we're confident that will actually show that we're up, there either at system or marginally above.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[indiscernible analyst from ATTM] . Phil, really a question on asset quality. You put in the discussion pack, the slide which showed the result of the mortgage stress testing. I wondered if you'd done something similar from the property book and what that showed? And also what decline in valuations had you assumed in your property book when you're assessing your collective and specific provisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So working back to front, the specific eclectic provisions don't go in with an assumed property price decline, they go in based upon what's the credit rating of that customer or customer group, and that determines the probability of default, and then the loss given default is really a downturn loss given default. So, that has already got quite conservative assumptions in it around what the market would do and therefore what the losses would be from that customer in a downturn, and that feeds through into your overall capital risk weighted asset calculation and the like. In terms of the stress testing, we've looked at our property portfolio in a lot of different ways and stressed it for property declines of 10, 20, 30%. I don't know whether we went even further than that, but &#x2013; did we go? -- we did 40.</p>
          <p>So, they were all done to say, how bad could things get? And what would be the losses that would come with that, and then multi-year, because not every customer is going to default on their loan, even though asset prices have dropped to that kind of level. It really goes to, also focused around interest cover and what's the income generation of the company to match their interest cover. And so, I don't have a slide I can point you to, but I can tell you that when we looked at it as part of this group that Gail's talked to, we didn't come up with numbers that caused us to be so concerned that we had to race out and raise capital or do something dramatically different, it was a stress test that says yes, things would be pretty tough if that kind of situation occurred, but they would be ones that we could deal with. Did you want to add to that Phil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not, a lot to add to what Phil just said. We did do that, we did a detailed stress test for only the large portfolios, those that are managed in the institutional side of the business. And just to confirm, as Phil said, at 40% property declines it was a manageable number that you get out and that's a function of the low LVRs, of the stock position and the very strong interest coverage ratio. So, really that sums it up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would that be similar to the number then that you got from your mortgage stress testing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think you should say that -- because the mortgage stress test has got a bunch of factors in it, it's got price decline, it's got massive increase in unemployment, it's got higher interest rates. So, there is a whole bunch of factors that have gone into there. What we would say, and we would continue to say, is that the consumer portfolio losses and impairments are going to be much more closely connected to unemployment than any other risk factor. And you can see that in the stress test as well. But clearly, the LVR in the mortgage portfolio is much, much lower, I mean an average portfolio is weighted 40%. So, even if you had price declines, you'd have to have massive price declines in the mortgage portfolio to have any kind of material losses in a default situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the mortgage portfolio's, frankly, has actually been stable for quite a period, but it's not as though they're about to get a shock, particularly in New South Wales. Properties declined in residential space in the 2003, 2004 zone, and there have been stable to modest declines since them. So I don't think we're going to see a 10 or 20% shock in the mortgage market even in New South Wales in terms of price declines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe one of the things I could just share with you is that, if you look at our losses in our mortgage portfolio across Australia today, they're running just at one basis point. If you look at them in New Zealand, which is clearly a tougher market in terms of what's going on and we've already had some pretty big price declines, our losses are running between three and four basis points. So that gives you an idea of the magnitude of the losses, even in a stress situation like New Zealand.</p>

          <p>James <mark type="inaudible" /> Credit Suisse Another follow-up question on capital. We saw a couple of major bank results last week where there was some big optimization benefits as they really bidded in the Basel II regime. You didn't seem to call-out anything of that today, just wondering whether you saw benefits for your own capital base, and risk weighted assets in your own Tier 1 ratio from that?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Think we've taken some of those -- in the first half you would have seen -- and that's the quality of the Westpac business mix was coming to light and you saw that with regard to higher risk rated assets <mark type="inaudible" /> relative to some of our competitors. So I think that was mostly the first half story, really, wouldn't it be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. And the procyclicality slide -- James that was -- I was trying to make it clear. What were the component parts that shifted your risk weighted asset calculation, which is the point you are raising. We had some movement in terms of classification of some properties -- sorry, some business lines, and that had an impact in the business segment risk weighted asset. But that was the only extra element, and I think that we are bidding down Basel II. I think we're quite a long way through it. I think through pillar three we'll be able to show more of that. But I don't see that the changes in classification and those factors are going to have a big impact on us. It's going to be, what's the growth and what's happening on credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Once we bid St.George and hopefully we'll get some benefit there to being Basel being about one. Once they moved to bayle two their business mix, which is so heavily in mortgages. That should improve the risk weighted asset position overall, again. You should see a change then.</p>

I just wanted to follow up on the commercial property side, just if we get a bit of a split between what's in Australia and offshore and also just on the LTVs .You mentioned they are low, but we don't seem to have a number, just where they are and what proportion is over 80%, if possible?

          <p>Yes, I don't think I've seen a commercial property line with an 80% loan-to-value ratio. So, I'm pretty comfortable that it wouldn't be any of them. Typically, the portfolio I think Andrew has indicated, most of the portfolio, as we see depending on the nature of the assets, somewhere between 40 and 60 would be a very common LVR for that type of portfolio. Our property lending is almost wholly within Australia or New Zealand. Property is not a segment we use for our institutional bank offshore.

          <p>Actually, can I just make a comment. It's not going to be any worse than 25 billion. But I do want to get us off this factor of saying, well what should turn funding requirement in one particular year. I really think that over time, you should hope that we are looking to take advantage of extending that in terms of the maturity profile of our wholesale funding and over time increasing the proportionality of that funding that comes through retail deposits.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Craig. I mean I think the -- obviously the government guarantee is pretty significant. So, we are working through that with the RBI upper and Treasury to get that better down right. Certainly, initial reaction I think from offshore investors is going to be that this is going to be something that I think is going to show some interest. We've seen HBOS do a couple of deals last night. We've seen a deal done early by Barclays. So, we'd expect government guaranteed markets to continue to be a place, where big banks are going to look for source of funds and it looks to us that our government guarantee will stack up well on the global center. I think probably all markets are waiting to see how that develops, but I think we would expect to see that part of the government guarantee to be the place where we would anticipate potentially using it. Certainly onshore, I don't think there is a lot of expectation at the moment from feedback we're getting from domestic investors is that they're pretty comfortable with the Australian bank story. So as you've seen in the past, those markets remained very open to us throughout this period of time and we would expect that to continue. So we've had good support from domestic investors all across the curve and we would expect that to continue.</p>

          <p>William from Credit Suisse . Question on M&amp;A. You've demonstrated a bit of an appetite in these markets and this is an opportunistic time. Sort of on twofold, GE earlier this week announced that they are going to pull out certain business segments and it could be an opportunity maybe buyback AGC at less than what it was sold for. So what is your view of some of those business lines, are there practically on a risk adjusted basis? But also the Sun Corp. board has announced very publicly their AGM interest in perhaps exploring, separating the bank. There is a number of things that would have to be gone through. Certainly that's an attractive asset. How do you see your capability given the St.George activity that's going on, your ability or timeframe to take on something of a much larger size, should the opportunity at the proper value present itself?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Some of my fellow colleagues who were around at the time of AGC would be sort of turning gray with the concept of that so, that's on that one. I would look at opposition with acquisitions more broadly. I mean clearly we have a very <mark type="inaudible" /> and hopefully weeks away from being up and ready day one, December 1, with the St.George merger. And so very thorough planning all ready to go, but there's lots of work. Lots of things that have to be worked through, and that's going to certainly absorb capacity and absorb time and we want to get it right. We absolutely want to deliver and get this right. We think that we've got the -- this combination is an outstanding one. Strategically it's a transformational deal for WestPac. So this not some sort of bolt-on acquisition, this is a transformational opportunity that actually sits The Westpac Group up in a very different space. So, that really is our key priority and through that process also during the internal regeneration and refreshing of the Westpac franchise in a stand alone basis. So that really is the priority. Now that's not to say that we won't look at other things that are tossed up but they'll probably be of the most smaller variety and more bolt-on type of variety and there may be something in the wood space and may be something in wealth space, nothing on our agenda just at the moment.</p>

          <p>Brian Johnson, JPMorgan. My apologies, I've got yet another question about capital. Phil, I don't think something adds up here, you've got 7.8% Tier 1, under that the DRP, that adds up to 8.3. You're buying St.George with script, the only difference is, there's a 700 million restructuring charge, you're telling which wouldn't reduce it back to the -- back to within the range. Are you telling us there is some pretty chunky fair value adjustments, and could you also explain to us what the $700 million will actually be spent on, if we get a feeling for restructuring staff versus realigning some of the balance sheet provisioning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the biggest factor in terms of the impact is bringing on board the St.George business today as it stands at 6.6% or thereabouts on a Basel I basis, and then combining debt picture. Because we will have to account their risk weighted assets under the standardized approach as we move into a combined entity. There might be some fair value, but we're still working through that. We haven't come into lending, so that's not the effect that's driving the reduction in capital ratios that you're alluding to. In terms of -- the 700 which is another factor that will affect us next year, about half of that we expect to be spent on factors that technology related, and the other half will basically be spend on transactional elements of the deal working through -- with people working on the transformation and with the restructuring charge element. So that's -- that kind of gives you some idea of the break down, we will have more detail to share when we get together in December.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You are confirming that basically the fair value adjustment isn't the driver of this DRP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not the major driver at '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, the DRP is as much of giving us additional flexibility. That's what this is about. Right now at this time, actually capital measures and being conservatively based along capital measures, as you all know. So we just want to have additional flexibility, we have to deal with the St.George hybrids, we'll be consummating the merger soon. So we'd rather actually err on the side of being a little conservative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gail, this capital flexibility didn't give you the flexibility to increase the target range. Because if you look at this result, you're the first bank that has actually displayed some of the adverse impacts of proceed with price technicality and this result was going into an environment where asset value are probably even falling -- you are talking about raising loan losses, isn't that kind of telling us that the --.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The target level should, may well have to be increasing, because if you look at the history of it for Westpac in particular, the message just keeps on changing. 18 months ago, the message was that Basel II would release a lot of capital, than at the last result it was about cyclicality. This result is about increasing the target to well above the range, I mean, it's just --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know that, Phil, you're dying to talk to this. I could just see it next to me, this energy that's going there. So, but let me just say one thing. Let me just say one thing. I mean, this is a very different environment from last year. It's a very different environment from when Basel II was first implemented. That's point number one. Point number two, the targets are same with the long-range in mind, and the number of factors that have gone into those. But right now, as I indicated earlier, we want to be either be at the top-end or even slightly above. And because we have a merger coming, we wanted to build an additional flexibility. So that's the positioning. Phil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you've made the point that some other things have changed in the last couple of years as well, Brain, which have also influenced our thinking. So, yes, when we first started talking about Basel II, we expected that that would release some capital. It did per se, but it's been translated into better capital ratios, and our desire to maintain those capital ratios. One of the great things about Bal II is that it highlighted just how -- how much the quality of our portfolio really was, because under Bal I, you couldn't see any of that. Under Bal II, you can see a lot more of it. What's the appropriate capital ratio? Well, as I said, there is a number of things that have gone into it. One of the major things though, is our own modeling through all sorts of downturn scenarios of our portfolio and what it can do to add stress on your capital. I mean you're right. Price technicalities are a result of Bal II, but 16 basis points in the last year is not something that kind of gives us hot and sweaty. We think that and we've modeled what it would be like in the 1992 type of scenario, and that's another 120 odd basis down, if we had that applied to our current portfolio. So that gives you a sense of the kind of extreme scenarios that we've tried to accommodate in terms of setting that target range, and you should expect that, obviously the target range also has a buffer over and above the minimums. The minimum set by the regulator, the minimum set by what we would say, is too low a capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But even that, isn't that telling you a range, your minimum should be at least 120 basis points lower than your maximum? Because if you were saying that 1992 would happened, and 120 basis points off your Tier 1, you would actually be below your minimum. Isn't it telling you the maximum should actually be higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. 100 basis points range accommodates lots and lots of different scenarios. And you've called out like it will -- if everything went paycheck back as we did in 1992, you could lose 120. It depends on where we are and what we would do through that circumstance. It's not like we'd be sitting there saying, well, we can see problems emerging and we're just going to sit here and let it all just whack us and cause our capital ratios to drop below the target range. So it's a dynamic thing. The range indicates the kind of capital backing you should expect that we'd be looking to maintain. And the minimum is the minimum and that gives as a buffer. The target range gives you an idea of where in the middle of the range you'd normally expect to see and the upper end says that's kind of where we would be aiming for in the current circumstances.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then there is the other one, which is that you're actually running higher than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because we've got a merger on foot and we have the factors of that and we have hybrid rollovers and we don't know the timing of that.</p>

      <speaker id="15">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll call it to a close. Good afternoon everyone and thanks very much.</p>
