        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this presentation of the BBVA Group earnings for first quarter of 2012. This quarter, as has been said in previous occasions, has shown uneven growth in the environment in which we operate. Thus for, we've got Europe. And although there's been clear-cut progress, especially in fiscal matters, we still have to recognize that there are different fronts where there are still problems, like Greece, despite the bailout plan &#x2013; the second bailout plan and the restructuring of the debt, there are still problems, and contagion must be avoided to protect more solvent countries.</p>
          <p>The second issue is governance in Europe. Here, we have to speed up the movement towards a monetary and fiscal union in Europe in order to recover confidence and to stabilize the different economies and avoid future crises. Then finally, in this very complex recessive environment in Europe, it's vital to roll out adjustment plans in order to correct some of the imbalances, and also to boost competitiveness and get back on the road to growth.</p>
          <p>With this uneven scenario, we see differences in Europe. The peripheral countries were especially badly hit by the recession, including Spain, which is the focus of a lot of attention. I know that it's true that Spain is seeing big challenges, fiscal consolidation, debt and such. Nonetheless, its finance industry does have some sound fundamentals and the data are sometimes better than the average for Europe.</p>
          <p>And as I said before, if we look elsewhere in the world, there's a quite different performance. Asia, South America, Mexico, they're all showing very sound growth and dynamic growth in their economies and, of course, the United States, where recovery is being consolidated progressively.</p>
          <p>As I said, there's a lot of attention being focused on Spain, and so maybe we should shed some light on four fundamental concerns that people tend to have about Spain and see what's being done with each of them. First of all, fiscal consolidation. It is true that in Spain the main focus is on the structural deficit to get adjustment into the budget, and there are various initiatives that are being taken. And with respect to the national budget, the Budgetary Stability Act, and then the plans for rebalancing the regional governments' budgets and also a program for paying suppliers. In very little time, a lot of reforms have been adopted, but they're very deep reforms and there's still room for further measures to be taken. And I think that as the economy develops here in Spain, we will see new measures being taken.</p>
          <p>The other issue in Spain is level of debt. Here, we should separate out the public debt from the private debt. When we are talking about public debt, in Spain last year it was about 69%. And that compares very well against the European average, which was 88% to GDP. And it's below the French level or the German level.</p>
          <p>In the private sector, we should distinguish between households and companies. If we look at what's been happening in households, it's true that at the beginning of the crisis, they had borrowing requirements of about 2.7% of GDP. But at this stage in 2011, they have a net capacity that generates savings, which is now positive 2.3% to GDP.</p>
          <p>However, in companies, the picture is a bit different. If we take out real estate developers, leverage is about 50% on average, whilst in the European Union, it would be more like 53%. So in terms of the debt level, we could say that it's already sustainable. And in the real estate sector, although it is a cause for concern, there's very sharp deleverage and an overhaul of its structure. As I was saying, this is a sustainable debt level then and not too far from the kind of levels we see elsewhere in Europe.</p>
          <p>The third point of concern is the financial sector. Since 2007, a lot of progress has been made. You may remember that we had 45 savings banks at that time, whereas at the end of 2011, there were just 11. And we can expect that there will probably be about 6 by the end of this year. And over the last few quarters, we've seen that the process of closing down the number of branches has speeded up, with the closing of many branches. The main focus has been the last few quarters, and we can expect to see more closures over the next few months.</p>
          <p>Moreover, there's a new Royal Legislative Decree that came into force on the 15 of April, which will mean that a lot of provisioning will have to be set aside for the banking industry in Spain, which will lead to further restructuring throughout the country. If we look at the volume of provisioning set aside since 2007, taking into account what's included in this Royal Legislative Decree, we've got provisions of 15% of Spanish GDP. As you can see, after the provisions under this Royal Decree we'll be able to absorb drops in prices in land, in projects under construction and in finished housing units.</p>
          <p>And then fourthly, it's really vital now to start growing, and there, we need structural reforms. Lately, the best loan reform we've seen in the last few months has been that of the Labour sector. In our research department, they have estimates about what that will mean for the economy. And we think in the next four years, there could be 4 percentage points of growth added to the economy because of this reform. And Spain will have a different kind of employment market, which will be one of the most flexible in all of Europe.</p>
          <p>But there are also other elements that should boost the capacity for growth in Spain. For example, the export sector, which has meant that the current account deficit has been brought down 64% in three years, whilst at the same time we've maintained the export levels as a share of total economy, as opposed to the U.S., where it's dropped. Productivity per capita has gone up 2% on average in the last three years, which would only be 0.2% in the euro area. So we have to continue with more reforms showing the kind of determination that we've seen over the last few months so that we can get a real capacity to grow here in Spain.</p>
          <p>To sum up, we can say that there's no country in Europe at the moment that is carrying out as many reforms that are as deep as what we're seeing in Spain. But we have to continue with this kind of determination to push through further reforms in Spain. However, we have to have time as well in order to see the results of the reforms. But Spain isn't the only geographical area in this group in this complex situation in Europe. We might conclude that the earnings we're presenting the group this quarter because of the very recurrent nature of the revenues we get in all the geographical areas would lead us to think that we've had an excellent quarter in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>There are three highlights that I think reflect our performance this quarter; first of all, the growth of recurring revenues in nearly all the geographical areas, and they are growing faster than expenses despite the large investments we've been putting into growth over the last few years. Net attributable profit is over &#x20AC;1 billion. And after having normalized the level of net trading income, we've got more provisions than we had last year. And another thing is that we've managed to comply with that 9% core capital requirement of EBA early and we've also kept up our capital buffer that is required.</p>
          <p>So this is what's happening in all the different regions. And you can see starting with the net interest income, we've got growth of over 13%. And moreover, there's a tendency for the growth to speed up over the different quarters, even in Spain, where we see that we've got a stable growth, although quite low, at least the net interest income is going up, with careful pricing policy. In the U.S.A., it's gone down because we've changed the mix from the balance sheet both on the asset side and the liability side. And we also absorbed the impact of regulatory changes in the U.S. during 2011.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, the growth is significantly faster than that of lending. In South America, we've got nearly 30% growth, very buoyant activity. It's the driving force of growth in the group. And then in Turkey and China or what we call Eurasia, we're seeing sound growth of our net interest income. So I'd say that the news there is positive and that trickles down into gross income.</p>
          <p>And there I want to give you a breakdown of the most volatile parts, which are net trading income and dividends. But the underlying revenues, what we could call recurring revenues, are growing at the same rate or a very similar rate to net interest income at 12.6% a year. We've got a level of net trading income that we consider to be much more normal than what we reported in the same quarter of last year, where the positive impacts like the devaluation in Venezuela or the divestment of portfolio in the U.S., Mexico, or Spain, have meant that we reached a very extraordinary high level.</p>
          <p>And then in costs, in expenditure there, we're seeing a growth which is below that of recurring revenues, and they're growing in the countries where we are growing most. And in the emerging countries, expenses have been growing less than the growth that we've reported in revenues. But if we include everything, the cost-to-income ratio still shows excellent performance, and we are leaders in the sector in that percentage ratio in this first quarter of 2012. So, net operating income, aggregating the costs and the recurring revenues, gives us a growth or is showing a growth of &#x2013; after costs of nearly 16% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And provisioning, well, there are a few things I want to say here. The level of provisioning for loan loss and real estate provisions is similar to what we've had in 2010 and 2011. And in this quarter, in particular, compared against the first quarter of last year, we're provisioning about &#x20AC;200 million more than in the first quarter of the previous year. And that's mainly here in Spain, where we're seeing the highest level of provisioning, which is offset by the drops that we're seeing elsewhere in the world.</p>
          <p>Looking at the parameter under the new Royal Decree, according to the valuations of our assets, we've got provisions of &#x20AC;174 million. And at the same time, we are keeping the same level of generic provisioning that we had at the end of 2011. All of that means that our net attributable profit is slightly over &#x20AC;1 billion and well distributed over the different geographical areas, with Mexico and South America making contributions of 30% and 26%, and Spain bringing in 16%.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the distribution between the developed and the emerging economies, 72% is coming from emerging economies and 28% from the developed economies. So, that means that we have net interest income growing. And we're seeing normalization of net trading income, which means lower revenues in net trading income, with the absorption of another &#x20AC;200 million; more provisioning, which means that we have dropped about &#x20AC;600 million, which is absorbed when we come down to the after-tax net income.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the risk indicators, they're very stable in the group. We're seeing stable NPAs, stable coverage ratios. Over the last eight quarters, we've had this level of stability. And you can see that, that is for the group as a whole. And our ability to generate capital, I already said that we've got that 9% core capital ratio that was established by the EBA. And we've got our buffer of &#x20AC;2.3 billion, which is another 70 basis points which we could add to our capital. This is in an environment in which we still maintain our payout policy with two cash dividends and we have managed to avoid having to sell off any strategic assets in order to maintain our capital ratios.</p>
          <p>Looking at core capital under Basel 2.5 standards, we've got 10.7% at the end of the quarter. And what's most relevant is that we've generated 30 basis points of capital organically. Finally, liquidity. In liquidity, as you know, we've got a very solid position. As you know, we've taken advantage of the two European Central Bank auctions and we've used the liquidity of that in order to improve the liquidity of the group, covering all the debt redemptions for 2012 and 2013 already, and we've got an ample amount of collateral available to use for discounts from the European Central Bank. And we continue to be very proactive in the management of our liquidity levels, with some &#x20AC;4 billion less in the credit gap over this quarter, with senior debt issues made for &#x20AC;2 billion in the first quarter. In the balance sheet, we've got powerful liquidity buffers.</p>
          <p>Okay. So, let's move on to the business units, starting in Spain, as always. There are two keys to Spain here. The weak business levels, this has happened over the last couple of quarters. We've seen it in the first quarter, too. And this is a consequence of the delevering that we're seeing in general, both in household and also in companies, as I mentioned at the beginning. So, there's lots of price management here, which is improving our customer spreads, basically because of the better prices of the new assets that are taken on, both in household mortgages and in companies. As we can see in the graphs here, this has been going down over the last four quarters.</p>
          <p>Despite the lower business levels, over the last 12 months, we have managed to gain market share both on the lending side and on the deposit side. And this, of course, means that we can confirm that we've bottomed out on the net interest income, with a slight pickup in Spain, as we can see here; this together with the performance in fees in the first quarter of this year. The next major concept is cost management in Spain. Since the crisis started, we've been saying that we're seeing reductions in costs. And this quarter, once again, we've got a 1.6% fall in costs, and this leads us to a recurring operating income of 9.1% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Provisioning, once again, there is a stable &#x2013; that we're just as stable as we're seeing throughout their growth. They're hardly changing quarter on quarter, and the NPA ratios and the coverage ratios are very similar to the levels we've seen any recent quarters. And this leads us to the income statement, with a contribution of &#x20AC;227 million for the group, and as I said before, with the strong resilience that we've seen, especially in the net interest income. But in any event, one important factor here, in Spain, and despite the complex environment, is that we have almost &#x20AC;1 billion in operating income. That means that we can address any kind of significant provisionings that we have to do in coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Eurasia now, and there are two key players here, and that is reinvestment in Turkey, and the other is the investment that we've made in CITIC in China. When we talk about Turkey, we're talking about the best, the most profitable banks with the highest profits in Turkey. This is a bank that's &#x2013; in 2011, has generated a gross income of over &#x20AC;3.8 billion and attributable profits of over &#x20AC;1.4 billion, and the investment in bank in China, which is the seventh largest bank in China and which is growing very fast and is offering nearly &#x20AC;9.5 billion in gross income and attributable profits of nearly &#x20AC;4 billion in 2011.</p>
          <p>And apart from the fact that the wholesale franchise, which is based on the customers, which is going to show resilient revenues in coming quarters, too. So, basically, the numbers Turkey has started to contribute in the gross income, over &#x20AC;2 billion, and Europe, the rest of Europe is &#x20AC;368 million. So, from the point of view of the gross income from Asia comes basically from the revenues from CITIC, which is over &#x20AC;160 million. So, this region shows a contribution to the revenues from each of these areas that is very well balanced, which enables us to generate the resilience that we're looking for.</p>
          <p>So, attributable profits of almost &#x20AC;300 million with good growth figures all the way through from the top to the bottom line. Mexico now, where the market is very dynamic, especially in lending, especially in retail for consumption, finance, PMAs, we're growing at 6.6%. But the retail are growing by 13% and customer funds have increased by over 10.4%, and this has improved the quality of the mix of our resources on the balance sheet in favor of the cheaper deposits. And this means that we can, once again, improve the customer spread to 11.5%.</p>
          <p>And all of this has enabled us quarter after quarter to improve the growth in the net interest income at the close of this first quarter, it's 9.4% growth here, which as you can see, is higher than the average growth for the whole portfolio. And it also means that the recurring gross income is growing in line with the net interest income of around 9%. And if we included the volatile effect of net trading income because of the sale of assets that I pointed out at the beginning of the presentation, then the gross income would show a growth of around 5%.</p>
          <p>The important factors here, after strong investments in technologies and expansion &#x2013; organic expansions of branches, et cetera, what we're seeing in Mexico is that the share that we have in net income &#x2013; in operating income is growing year after year and we're close to 38% at the end of 2011. If we look at risk indicators, once again, there's stability here, both in the NPAs and the risk premium has gone up by a couple of tenths. But once again, the coverage ratios are still very high.</p>
          <p>The income statement shows a net attributable profit of around &#x20AC;430 million. If we take out the effect of the net trading income, this would be closer to 14%, which is the underlying speed of the growth in these incomes. And if we look at the resilient revenues, it would be closer to 9%. And we're starting to see how expenses are starting to grow at a similar rate to revenues.</p>
          <p>South America. We continued to see strong business, both in lending and in deposits, that is growing of around 25% on both sides of the balance sheet, which means that with an improvement in customer spreads, it means we can once again present growth in the net interest income of around 30%. This is down 18.7% if we take out the fall in the contribution from the net trading income in this quarter, in comparison with the impact of the devaluation in this quarter in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>So, we're talking about growth in this sector that's very similar to the net interest income and the operating income, given that the expenses are growing at the rate of inflation despite the measures that we've taken both at the investments we're making in technology and opening new branches and alternative networks. What we're seeing is that the operating income is growing by 22%, with expenses that are growing far lower than the recurring revenues. And this means that cost-of-income ratio has improved substantially year-on-year.</p>
          <p>And the risk quality are the best in the group, both in the NPA ratio, the best coverage rates and the risk premium, which remains stable throughout &#x2013; in the course of the last few quarters. So, this gives us a net attributable profit from South America of &#x20AC;370 million, which is 27% growth. And once again, I would say it is growing on all the different lines of the balance sheet. And once again, it's absorbing the effect of the Venezuelan devaluation that we saw in the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>The United States now. We're continuing to see how things are transforming there and how the mix is changing both on the asset and the liability side in the United States, thanks to the new business that's being signed up in the United States every month, we're seeing a sustained new production of over $1 billion. In March, we've seen peaks of $1.8 billion. We're continuing to generate deleverage in commercial real estate. And if we take the overall picture in the United States, we're starting to see growth of 2% in lending for the first quarter in a long time.</p>
          <p>And the important thing here is that performance of local businesses, the ones that we can locate in BBVA Compass which are growing at 7% year-on-year and as I said from the point of view on the liability side, we've improved the structure in favor of term site deposits, which are cheaper, which means that, overall, we can show a net interest income for local business and bearing in mind the effect of the markets, which are very, very flat, so we're showing year-on-year growth of 5.9%.</p>
          <p>But there's also a positive trend if we look at the quarterly averages from last year. Expenses are following along the same lines. They're well under control, with a drop of 2.3%. And don't forget that we are currently absorbing the effects of regulations and the major investments that we're making in the new platform that we're developing in the United States.</p>
          <p>Loan loss provisions, this has fallen by 66%. The risk premium is 0.3%. Net negative entries are negative, which means successive falls in the NPA. And despite the fact that the 66% drop in NPAs, we can see increases in the coverage rate up to 65%. So the net attributable profit is &#x20AC;750 million, which is 16% increase. But if we take out the net trading income effect and the fact that we've absorbed the impact of the new regulations that have been rolled out in the United States, the growth will be in higher in any event, if we take out the wholesale business. If we talk about the benefit of the local businesses, we're talking about growth of around 25%.</p>
          <p>Corporate and investment banking, the resilience of their earnings once again is the fruit of the distribution between the different geographies in the group, which means that we're generating revenues in a far more balanced manner and a far more resilient manner. And moreover, this is based on a balance and a diversification in each of the different business units. This can be clearly seen if we look at the revenues that come from this area, and then we can see that over 90% comes with this from trading and that the efficiency levels are the lowest in the industry.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the quality of the revenues that &#x2013; from net interest income, we can see that the quality is very high and it's very resilient and apart from being compatible with a very low-risk premium, especially from the point &#x2013; from a comparative point of view. And this gives us the income statement, which means that we can add an attributable profit of around &#x20AC;280 million.</p>
          <p>So, just to round off and in summary, the first key is resilient growth, highly diversified growth and resilient revenues in all geographies, growth that is above costs. The second concept is attributable profit of over &#x20AC;1 billion after absorbing falls in earnings because of the net trading income and provisionings of &#x20AC;600 million. And the third important fact is that we've met the capital requirement of the EBA. We've reached our 9% well ahead of time and we're maintaining our own sovereign buffer.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. We can now move on to the questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, &#xC1;ngel. As usual, we're going to divide the questions into blocks which will give us time to answer, particularly all the questions they're presenting.</p>
          <p>So, let's start with the questions about the macro environment. David Vaamonde from Fidentiis is asking about our best forecasts for the performance of restructuring the financial sector as of now, and he's referring more specifically to the funding, what is the deposit guarantee fund, the <mark type="ph" /> FROP (30:09) going to do with regard to the upcoming loans &#x2013; auction, sorry, of the Banco Valencia, the new savings bank, the Ca&#xE7;a Catalana, and are there any other additional operations in the sector?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, from the information that's available to everyone, Banco de Valencia is already up for auction. And very soon, Catalunya Ca&#xE7;a will go through the same process. And in a few months, we can expect we'll have the merged Galician Ca&#xE7;as as well up for auction. So, that's on the basis of public information. All of these cases have to be dealt with before summer. And from the information we have, it seems that the deposit guarantee fund will cover what is needed.</p>
          <p>So far, we haven't heard of any other transactions or what other kind of transactions could take place, or how they'd be dealt with. So, what's most important now is first of all, from the 15th of April, according to what the Bank of Spain has said, the plan has been handed in by all the different Ca&#xE7;as in order to comply with the latest regulations in the industry.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we know therefore what the business plans are in order to do the provisioning that they require. And we will then have a more consolidated financial industry here in a matter of months. And we're talking about the months here which are affordable for the Spanish economy as a whole. Therefore, I'd say that from now to August, we should have a much clearer idea of what's happening in terms of the rolling out and the enforcement of the new regulations and the business plans of the Ca&#xE7;as.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the other block, liquidity, we've got five or six questions about the subject which I'll sum up. Francisco Riquel from N+1 asks about whether we could give an update on the exposure to public debt here in Spain that the bank has, what kind of portfolios we have, what term, what's happened over the quarter and how much has been funded with LTRO?</p>
          <p>And then, Matteo Ramenghi from UBS asks about the use of the LTRO, and if we should reckon that this will be &#x20AC;10 billion of long-term refinancing operations and how much has been drawn down in Spanish government bonds in the trading book and in the available for sale and in the redemptions?</p>
          <p>Britta Schmidt from Autonomous asked about the &#x20AC;10 billion increase in available for sale quarter-on-quarter, and asks if this is the carried rate?</p>
          <p>David Vaamonde from Fidentiis asks how much the ALCO portfolio is now, what's its composition and what's it contributing to net interest income?</p>
          <p>And from <mark type="ph" /> Keith here (33:34), we have a question about the LTRO, and how much is deposited in the European Central Bank? And how we are expecting to use these funds in the future?</p>
          <p>And Benjie Creelan from Macquarie asks whether we can give some color on how the European Central Bank funds are being used and what our exposure is to Spanish government bonds? Basically, the same questions from six different analysts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We can give a full review over this. Basically, as I said in the presentation and then Manolo give us more details. But basically, what I was saying, we've used this money to improve the group's financing structure, both in the short term and long term redemptions or maturities, so there's less short-term funding, and less exposure in the long-term and long-term, I'm talking about market issues. So, this is the basic use, irrespective of the fact that there's about 15%, I think, that we've used for investing in ALCO portfolios outside of the perimeter of the Spanish debt. Manolo, maybe you can give us some color on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a lot of questions that have been asked here, but basically, there are three or four questions that I will try to address. As you will probably remember, we've always been highly transparent with the sums that we've taken in the three-year auctions from the European Central Bank. In December, it was &#x20AC;11 billion and the second one, we took a very similar amount, which answers Benjie's question on how much we're taking from the second auction, and this is reflected in the income statement if you compare the first quarter with the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So, the total requests for the three-year lending or funding has been less than 5% of our total assets. The reason behind of all this, in a cautious scenario, to cover all the wholesale maturities of mid- and long-term debt that we have in 2012 and 2013 in the euro account which, as you know, is the only account that is slightly dependent on the wholesale market.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're establishing a liquidity buffer in line with our policy of conservative prudence of the policy in a form of managing liquidity, and finally, to improve the euro balance liquidity structure by lengthening the maturities of this wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>And this takes us onto the next point, and that is how we've used this money that we've got in the two auctions. As &#xC1;ngel has just explained, about two-thirds of the money that we've been lent from the European Central Bank has been used to replace short-term collateralized &#x2013; instead of the short-term collateral funding, we replaced this with an ECB funding. And what we've done is we've replaced covered bonds or the need-to-recover &#x2013; maturities recover bond, and we've covered this with the money we've taken from the ECB.</p>
          <p>And another 15% of the other third, so about a half of the remaining third is a liquidity buffer which has been placed in the European Central Bank. And this also answered the questions on our deposits with the ECB. And another 15% and, i.e., the other half of the final third has been used in part to increase our ALCO portfolio during this &#x2013; the stability management portfolio, also on the euro balance.</p>
          <p>In other geographies, although this has nothing to do with the auctions, but the important thing, as &#xC1;ngel says, is that in this quarter, we have not increased our exposure to sovereign bonds to what could be called peripheral countries. In fact, we haven't increased our exposure to Spain. We've reduced our exposure to some other countries. And the purchase that we've made for the ALCO portfolio, and here, I'm talking about approximately, on the euro account, about &#x20AC;6 billion in the course of this quarter. And this has been concentrated on sovereign bonds from multilateral agencies or core European countries. And part of the money is being used to buy covered bonds or non-Spanish covered bonds and senior debt from banks. So, these &#x20AC;6 billion are distributed on assets of this kind, and this is the increase in the ALCO portfolio.</p>
          <p>The average maturity of all the purchases that were taken out his quarter is approximately three years and part of the reduction of the exposure to peripheral countries were of longer-term bonds. The contribution that the ALCO portfolio made on its side, in the first quarter of 2011, the ALCO portfolio amounted to &#x20AC;30.4 billion and the euro balance, with a contribution of &#x20AC;165 million in the quarter, with average maturities of three years. December 2011 figures for this portfolio, the portfolio in full, because we reduced our exposure at the beginning of the year, and also, we did this in 2011, so &#x20AC;26.7 billion, with a contribution to the income statement of &#x20AC;108 million.</p>
          <p>And in the first quarter of 2012, this portfolio once again has gone up to &#x20AC;32 billion, with the extra &#x20AC;6 billion that we took out, with a contribution to the income of &#x20AC;165 million. And the effect of the increase in the volume of that portfolio has been reduced and the most important factor is the improve in the ALCO margin has been the drop in short-term rates.</p>
          <p>So in short, I think all of this answers your questions. As I said, the important thing is is that our exposure to Spanish sovereign debt has increased slightly on the trailing portfolio, not in the ALCO portfolio. We're talking about a different total exposure, including lending exposure of &#x20AC;700 million. There was a reduction in other peripheral markets of &#x20AC;700 million, too. So the increase of the &#x20AC;6 billion that I mentioned as a consequence of exposure to other core European countries, banks and multinational agencies.</p>
          <p>One thing I'd like to add here is the effect of this auctions, the effect that they've had on our rivals &#x2013; on our competition and the bank sector here in Spain, because it's reduced the pressure that we've been under for retail deposits. This is &#x2013; in the presentation, I showed you a slide where we showed that over the last few quarters, the cost of term deposits have reduced and this is possibly one of the tremendously positive consequences of these auctions.</p>
          <p>One thing I've just realized, there are two details in the questions that I haven't addressed. The figure that you can see in the increase of the available for sale is &#x20AC;9 billion, so it's &#x20AC;6 billion in the euro balance and &#x20AC;3 billion comes from other group balances where we've increased the portfolio in the current environment in the United States, Mexico and other areas.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to point out that another part of the question, if we're only talking about the impact of the ECB three-year auctions on the income, this has been a neutral this quarter, because the improve in the margin, because the increase in the volume of the portfolio has been offset by the negative effect on the margin by substituting short-term funding, which is much cheaper, which is &#x2013; we've replaced this with funding from the European Central Bank. So the opportunity cost of keeping our deposit in the European Central Bank or taking their funding at 1% is limited use just to adjust our liquidity positions. We don't take money from the ECB to buy things with, per se.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the next block with lending quality. Matteo Ramenghi from UBS asks about what is the NPA ratio for individual mortgages in Spain and the SME segment, and what are the prospects for the next few quarters? Carlos Berastain from Deutsche Bank asked the same question. Maybe we could give a bit more color in the quarterly performance and prospects of NPAs in Spain by segment?</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> McQueen (43:15) from Nomura asks about NPAs by segments and the outlook for 2012. David Vaamonde from Fidentiis, his question addresses is how we are going to face Royal Decree 2-12 in the next few quarters and maintain our EBA core capital at 9% because provisions are going to be greater in the second half of 2012. And Antonio Ramirez from Keefe asked whether in this quarter we've sold any charge-off portfolios, and to what extent, if we have the kind of assets, and at what prices are we getting for these assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the NPA ratio. In Spain, what we're seeing is a stabilization in the NPA ratios across the board, with one exception, which is in the business world, where we're seeing increases quarter-on-quarter, which we've seen over the last four, five quarters. Very quickly, if we go to the end of 2009, when we brought forward some provisioning, we can say that we anticipated provisions for the next six quarters, more or less. And after that, what we've been seeing is impairment, above all, in the companies sector.</p>
          <p>This kind of impairment, what kind of impact would it have? Well, we think that it's quite affordable. It could be dealt with. We're talking about a portfolio of about &#x20AC;42 million. And in the presentation, I said that this is the portfolio that sees greatest deleveraging. A year ago, it would have been &#x20AC;48 billion. So, definitely there's a lot of deleveraging going on. This portfolio, the &#x20AC;41 million, has an NPA ratio of 9.8%. That's an impairment of about 60 basis points in the quarter. And we can expect to see a similar kind of impairment over the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>And that's where we're seeing the largest figure for net additions compared to other products or segments where, in fact, we are seeing slight drops. So we can see the other sectors are offsetting this one and so NPAs are stabilizing in Spain as a whole.</p>
          <p>If we try to analyze all of this, we can see that the NPA ratio can expect an impairment over the year of about 2%. So more or less the impact of the first quarter will be extended to the other quarters of the year. So we're talking about net additions of about &#x20AC;700 million, &#x20AC;800 million for the year as a whole, with that &#x20AC;11.3 billion figure that we gave for the year end. So, 30%, 40%.</p>
          <p>Here we're talking about provisions for the year as a whole of between &#x20AC;250 million and &#x20AC;300 million. That's more or less what we are assuming in our budget forecasts for the year as a whole, specifically focusing on this sector. Although this is the segment or sector that's showing the worst performance, nonetheless, in terms of deleveraging and the possibility of coping with future impacts, we are pretty clear about how it's going to evolve over the year. And really, Manolo, we're not expecting any additional impairments elsewhere. In fact, we're looking at individual accounts and we're seeing a slight drop in NPAs there, which is what we think will offset the worst performance of the companies portfolio.</p>
          <p>So the other question &#x2013; well, that's clear, isn't it? We've talked about the provisioning under the new Royal Decree. And in the presentation, I said we've set aside &#x20AC;175 million. It's not a matter of anticipating or not anticipating. It's just that according to internationally accepted standards that we're subject to because our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, so we have to comply with international standards and the IFRS standards. And according to market-linked valuations which are very conservative, we've provisioned &#x20AC;175 million.</p>
          <p>To give you the figures, we're talking about funding requirements or provisioning requirements. As Manolo said, about a month and a half ago, we set aside some &#x20AC;28 million in provisions, discounting the recurrent revenue impact, which would mean that for the year as a whole, we would need about &#x20AC;1.5 billion in provisioning, of which, before tax we've already set aside &#x20AC;164 million. So we expect over the next three quarters to make provisions such that at the end of the year with the revaluing and re-pricing of assets, we should cover 100% of the requirements in the new Royal Decree, with about the same level of provisions quarter-after-quarter throughout the year.</p>
          <p>We're not expecting to make any special capital issues to be able to use those issues for the provisioning. In the first quarter and in the next few quarters, we'll see it again. But this quarter, we've seen that the organic generation of capital has brought in about 30 basis points of capital more. And apart from that, we haven't seen a lot of positive impact from the internal models we're working with and there's definitely upside there, if we wish. And so we're expecting, say, 9% by the end of the year without even touching the sovereign buffer that we have of &#x20AC;2.3 billion and without selling any strategic assets, just organically generating capital and using the internal models, which we've hardly used at all so far, we have the target of reaching that 9% figure by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And then the sales, Manolo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in sales, over the quarter there has been no sale of any special or package or anything. We're just doing retail sales, where we've sold over 1,000 units over the quarter. And we're seeing the pace picking up compared to last year. But at the moment, we haven't got any transaction to package NPAs or foreclosed assets or charge-offs, so we're not doing that kind of securitization, but we think that there is interest in the market in getting involved in these kinds of transactions. We can't guarantee that we'll come to any agreement at the moment though, because the most important issue for the group at the moment is to conserve its medium-term values that it has in these portfolios. So with the level of provisioning, we think we've got a significant underlying amount there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, as Manolo said, the sale of these kinds of packages doesn't generate any tendencies in the retail business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More questions about provisioning have been answered, but Britta Schmidt from Autonomous and Jaime Becerril from JPMorgan and Antonio Ramirez from Keefe, Daragh Quinn from Nomura and Chandra-Rajan from Barclays and Morgan Stanley asked about what the COO was talking about. When will we be ready to meet the new Royal Decree requirements? And he said that it will be in the second part of the year and I think he gave the figures as well, both in his presentation and in the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>But there's another question about capital levels from Rohith Chandra from Barclays, asking if BBVA has met the EBA 9% requirement for core capital. And if it has, is it under pressure because of the weak economy? Under what conditions would BBVA sell off assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anything to do with provisions, I think, as we have answered. And, Manolo, capital, that's your ball, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I would like to remind you that last October we were told that we, in order to comply with the European Banking Authority, we needed an extra &#x20AC;6.3 billion in provisions, including &#x20AC;2.3 billion for a sovereign buffer. In March, i.e., two quarters later, and without any need to ask for any additional cash from our shareholders and swapping preferential retails with convertible bonds, which have to be converted into shares, we have been able to generate the amount of capital that we needed. And it is a significant amount. And we've done this in two quarters.</p>
          <p>So, there's &#x20AC;2.3 billion in swaps and convert preferentials for mandatory conversion. And as &#xC1;ngel says, I think this shows us that even if we think of additional or marginal impairment over and above the SME portfolio that we're already seeing, then quite honestly, it wouldn't really change our budgets which have already included provisions for impairment in the SME portfolio.</p>
          <p>This impairment comes from the deterioration we're seeing in the economy, especially in the second half of 2011. And it would appear to be stabling off in this first quarter of 2012. And of course, we hope that towards the end of the year, we'll see some signs of improvement that might translate in improvements in this area, apart from the &#x20AC;30 billion that the government is going to inject in the SME sector that our suppliers &#x2013; and this is going to be injected between May and June, and I think this will also help to alleviate the situation.</p>
          <p>But even if you think that things make it even worse, then the group is large enough and sound enough and the generation of margins or provisions are excellent all over, everywhere we operate including Spain, if we bear in mind the effect of the net trading income in the year-on-year comparison. So in order to comply with the EBA funding requisites and even what we're foreseeing in Basel III and to meet our commitments to our shareholders, I don't think the group will have any problem in this context, even if there is additional impairment if things get worse. In this context, any sale of assets can be considered, but not to meet any regulatory requirement. There might be other reasons for selling assets for positive management of our portfolios, but not to cover any regulatory requirement or any commitments we have with our shareholders.</p>

          <p>There are three further questions with regard to do with creditworthiness or asset quality, and our forecast for 2012 with regard to asset quality and these are made by <mark type="ph" /> Fabio Mastrachem (55:38) and Rohith Chandra from Barclays and <mark type="ph" /> Juan Pablo Lopez Cobo from Computer and Investments (55:42) concerning the following: NPA continues to rise significantly in Spain, and the question is how can we justify the relatively flat performance of BBVA? How can you explain the fact that the substandard and developers remain flat quarter-on-quarter? And how can you explain the flat performance in the context of the bank's exposure to developers? And this would close practically all the asset quality questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Manolo, should we divide it up between the two of us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, you're the boss. Okay, first of all, what's really important here is that if we look at individual accounts, we're seeing it's pretty stable and in fact slight drops in the NPA ratio over the last few quarters, but it depends on the asset quality of our borrowers. In the past, we didn't get involved with groups that had a high potential to not repay their loans and that's why, because of our characteristic prudence, we have such a low exposure. It's the way that we manage our risks.</p>
          <p>So for individuals we don't have a lot of non-resident accounts. We're very conservative in granting risk, and I think that's reflected in the results. We tend to look at the negative side, the unemployed that we have here. But we don't look at all the people who are working, who are paying their mortgages and who are paying their loans in a very normal fashion.</p>
          <p>Earlier on I said that in the companies segment, we anticipated the problems with developers. In fact, we were the first to do so. And from the end of last year, we've seen the NPAs go up to 23% at the end of last year. So we were the first to realize how important it was to recognize what might happen to the impairment of that portfolio and so we provisioned for it in advance and, elsewhere, the same.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2009, we set aside a lot of provisions, not as many as for the real estate sector, but enough to be reasonably comfortable to be able to cover the NPA ratio in companies. Over the last two quarters of last year and this quarter, we've actually seen this as the segment that's growing most, because we've got a highly diversified portfolio but with a good credit rating. We've got growth in the world of companies and we are offsetting that with problems that we're having with individual accounts, avoiding getting any unexpected negative impact from companies by anticipating what might happen and so we have sufficient provisioning and have had all the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've answered that very clearly. But at the moment, I'd say that it used to be more difficult to understand what was happening. But now there's more transparency about the exposure to real estate and developers. And I think we've always been even more transparent than others, always explaining where we had problems, even if we still had performing loans for land, for unfinished buildings and for homes that are finished and for loans with different kinds of collateral. So we've been explaining exactly what was happening.</p>
          <p>Some impairment on performing loans, although only marginal in real estate, but in our case, the exposure was substantially lower in absolute and relative terms compared to the figures for our peer group as a whole here in Spain. And in terms of the quality of our homeowner mortgages there are important factors to take into account, like how many mortgages are given to people in the workforce, that's about 25% who are perfectly able to pay their mortgage loans. So we have excellent asset quality. But we are aware that there has been impairment of this portfolio over the crisis, although we think that this probably bottomed out.</p>
          <p>And then the issue with the SMEs, we've reported on this all the time. But the non-performing assets have gone up &#x20AC;120 million in terms of net additions over the quarter, and that's what we're talking about. And this is concentrated in the SME sector, above all. And I think we've been quite clear and transparent about that. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the bank charges here in Spain. Britta Schmidt from Autonomous asks about the drivers behind the performance of bank charges in Spain with the bond auctions, maybe the issue of commercial paper? Is it sustainable? Can we expect this level of fees to remain stable in 2012. Along similar lines Carlos Berastain from Deutsche Bank and Juan Pablo L&#xF3;pez from Espirito Santo Investment ask about the same matter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to fees and commissions in Spain, remember that Spain includes business in Spain, so we're talking about the commercial banking division, our wholesale banking division here in Spain. There's a major increase in commissions and fees with regard to Q4. And year-on-year, the growth is 4%.</p>
          <p>There are several factors here. First of all, in this quarter part of the increase in the fees and commission has to do with corporate and investment banking business, where there have been operations that have generated commissions, but also in their transactional services, which are one of the strategic components of the area. And here, too, obviously, commissions have been generated.</p>
          <p>These &#x2013; in the transactional services, you're talking about recurring commissions, but specific operations are not as recurring because it depends on the transactions that are going to be put through in the quarter. The commissions are usually fairly recurrent. Quarter-on-quarter comparisons, they can vary.</p>
          <p>If we look at commercial banking now, here I think what we have is a comparison between one period of last year when we took commercial actions that could be defined as aggressive in the line of commissions. And this year, we're maintaining this but it's far more discreet this year. So to a certain extent, we can compare this. But we were comparing it with a period where commissions were quite low. So, I think the forecasts have to be for slight growth in commissions in comparison with last year, in a context of weak business. If the context increases, then we will quickly see this in an increase in commissions. So, in short, not all of the quarter-on-quarter growth is going to be recurrent, but I think there will be a structural improvement in commissions in our division here in Spain.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, capital and dividends, I have three questions here. Stanislas de Neuville from BNP Paribas, and he asks if we can confirm that we are committed to maintaining our dividend of $0.42 per share, including the two scrip dividends?</p>
          <p>Carlos Peixoto from BPI asks about the impact of Basel III on BBVA and what are the main drivers behind this impact? What would be the annual impact in 2012, 2013 and the phase-in of the different agreements within &#x2013; in the phase-in? And then from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:04:37), we have a question on the potential for improvement we can expect for risk-weighted assets for the group over the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you come back to the second part of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second, Carlos Peixoto. He asks what is the impact of Basel III and the main component of the impact and the phase-in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On dividends, right. That's simple, $0.42. Our target is to stay at around about that level. And the same policy, we've had two in cash and two in scrip. The kind of yield we're talking about, let's see, &#x20AC;0.23. So, that's a yield of &#x2013; well, it's an outstanding yield, I think. So, very high yield on the dividend paid out in cash. And apart from that, we are maintaining the payout policy. And I can confirm that here. And then, capital, Manolo, or you can talk about that and the improvement in RWAs under Basel III.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, we still have a density of risk-weighted assets which is high, compared to total assets, it's over 50%. And that kind of density is very high. It's the highest amongst the big European banks. And that's really a hallmark of our business model and the way that we have more retail assets on our books. Nonetheless, we're very conservative with risk-weighted assets to average total assets. We haven't taken all the measures we can in terms of getting approval for internal models. And we have been working on this even before the new EBA requirements came out.</p>
          <p>So, we can develop that further, there's some upside there. And here in Spain, we're seeing lower business volumes. Therefore, the consumption of RWAs is going down. So, we are obviously consuming RWAs here. But we can expect that it'll remain flat or even go down as we take more measures and get more approvals for the internal models that we've already set up. And then, what was the impact of Basel III? Do you want to talk about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. You go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then, Basel III, there, our best estimates internally at the moment suggest the Basel III will give us capital ratios of over 9% until 2015, which is when we're budgeting for or forecasting for at the moment. That's the kind of time horizon we're using at the moment.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of the phase-in, well, I don't know if you want us to go through what the regulations say, but that's what we will be doing. The deductions that don't have phase-in are software, <mark type="ph" /> access (1:07:58) in minorities and the expected losses and then tax deferred that aren't just for time lagging. So, there's no phase-in for that. That will be done all in one go. And then there are deductions that do have a phase-in, namely, tax deferrals because of time differences and investments in insurance companies and financial entities, taking into account that there's a deduction of these deductions established in the regulations.</p>
          <p>And then, there are the requirements for risk-weighted assets for counterparty risk, which we will be covering by the end of this year and then, risk-weighted assets which do have a phase-in. I think we're getting into too much detail, really. It's &#x2013; they are very technical details, but that's basically, we're just doing what it says in the regulations. And that 70 basis points that we've been talking about over the last few quarters? That's the figure that we're seeing, the difference between Basel 2.5 and Basel III.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, what's most relevant here is that according to our forecast to 2015, which is the time horizon we're using, when we're talking about being comfortably over 9% on a recurrent basis in our core capital under Basel III. I think really, that's the best answer. We've got this stability. We're very comfortable that we have enough core capital to meet the requirements and be well over 9% indeed, without having to divest any strategic assets in order to deal with any of the phase-ins as they come up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then, regarding the real estate regulations here in Spain. Carlos Peixoto from BPI asks, "After the latest news that came out in the press about the creation of banks specifically &#x2013; or companies created by banks specifically to maintain their exposure to real estate, do we think that would be a feasible option for the sector? And would it restore confidence in the system as a whole?" That's Carlos Peixoto's questions.</p>
          <p>And Rohith Chandra from Barclays asks for comments about <mark type="ph" /> our sense (1:10:29) vis-&#xE0;-vis the creation of such a bad bank in order to take over all the problematic assets with real estate exposure in Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have to divide this question into two, depending on which bank we're talking about. Banks like ourselves, there really isn't a positive effect, unless, of course &#x2013; and we don't need to improve our liquidity position through vehicles of this kind. But if you're talking about a bank with solid capital ratios, liquidity position, a bank that generates operating incomes to use for provisionings like ourselves, then quite honestly, that's fine. From other &#x2013; from the point of view of other banks who are currently undergoing restructuring, then maybe the advantage of this would be to isolate assets of this kind in a bad bank-type vehicle, which would isolate the negative effect so that it doesn't affect all their other assets. So you're isolating not only the current situation, but their potential future effects.</p>
          <p>But for us, we can't see any advantage of this. So, if we're talking about ring-fence solutions and ad-hoc solution for operations and these things, it is obviously more simple. I don't know if you wanted to add anything to that, Manolo? And the second part of the question, I've already answered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a final question on Spain before moving on. Matteo Ramenghi from UBS and Carlos Peixoto from BPI ask about the &#x20AC;6 billion fall in customer deposits and are the forecasts that we're seeing or the prospects for the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When Matteo and Carlos ask about this, what they're talking about is the balance sheet here in Spain, which we give in the quarterly documents. You should remember that the way we report in Spain is for the commercial banking department and our wholesale department as well, with the balance sheet that gives a summary which groups together items that are then broken down in greater detail in the consolidated account.</p>
          <p>So, if we look at customer deposits there, we're incorporating the temporary assignment of assets. And if we look at the loan book, that would incorporate all the movement from the temporary acquisition of securities in trading, so therefore, year-on-year in customer deposits.</p>
          <p>If we look at the data for December 2011, there's a drop of just &#x20AC;1 billion. The drop of the &#x20AC;10 billion year-on-year is because of the reduction of the temporary assignment of assets, which we've been doing since the first LTRO auction. And the short-term collateralized funding that we're getting for the medium term using ECB funds. Customer deposits or the most stable customer deposits come from the commercial banking and the core deposits in our &#x2013; with our large customers here in Spain, and they haven't gone down. In fact, they've grown slightly, especially taking into account the item debits represented by negotiable securities.</p>
          <p>There was hardly anything in March. At the end of December, there was &#x20AC;3.68 million, and now there's four &#x2013; sorry, &#x20AC;34 million, which includes the IOUs for customers and the commercial paper here in Spain in the commercial network, which is slightly below &#x20AC;1 billion in the quarter then, with a balance of &#x20AC;4.49 million at the end of the quarter. So, here we are talking about the markets and the trading, which is having an impact on these figures. The deposits in Spain, including commercial paper, have actually been stable. In fact, there hasn't been a drop quarter-on-quarter. And if we look at it year-on-year, there, in fact, there is some growth in the funding in Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then with respect to Mexico, I've got several questions all related to net interest income performance. Francisco Riquel from N+1 asks about net interest income in Mexico, saying it's flat. Can you give us an outlook for the next three quarters 2012?</p>
          <p>Antonio Ramirez from Keefe wants to know what we expect to happen in Mexico. Do we expect the loan book to grow? Will income grow? And what about cost and provisions? Have the expectations we had at the beginning of the year changed at all?</p>
          <p>Rohith Chandra from Barclays asks along the same lines, what kind of performance do we expect in net interest income in Mexico? It would seem that the outlook is weaker than was expected. What would have to happen to improve the performance of Mexico during 2012?</p>
          <p>Ignacio Cerezo from Credit Suisse asks about the sensitivity of operating income to possible drops in interest rates. Juan Pablo L&#xF3;pez from Espirito Santo Investment and Carlos Berastain from Deutsche Bank ask about a possible sale of business in Mexico, the possibility of an IPO. And Jaime Becerril asks about that, from JPMorgan. And I think that's it. And then there's that question then about the possible IPO of business in Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to explain how the net interest income performance is <mark type="ph" /> around (1:17:12). If we look at recent quarters, the net interest income has grown in Mexico. There were 5% increases, 7%, 8%, and it's over 9% now in the first quarter of this year. So, this is the performance trend.</p>
          <p>Second, when we look at the performance of net interest income in Mexico, we're putting together the operating income in local and the global business. In the global business, you see the behavior is pretty flat, which because of the fall in business in markets, not just in Europe, but also in the different areas of Latin America. And I would repeat, we're talking about a net interest income locally that's growing by over 13% and in the market &#x2013; in the wholesale market, the growth is flat. So that's the first thing I would like to say.</p>
          <p>Second key to this is lending that you are asking about. There are two kinds of growth that we're seeing. On the one hand, there's growth in the more retail segments, consumer finance, mortgages, and then there's the world of SMEs. Versus the deleverage that we're seeing with 30% falls basically in the developers sector, which is very similar to the effect we're seeing in Spain or what we saw before in the U.S. and the retail world, where lending is growing at rates of around 13%.</p>
          <p>So, we've got sound and dynamic growth on the retail side and far lower growth in companies and deleverage in the development sector. The local businesses are growing their net interest income by over 13%, which offsets the flat growth of the wholesale business.</p>
          <p>With regard to the business for the year as whole, I think lending will grow &#x2013; we'll see double-digit growth between 9% and 11%, I think. And so, we're seeing more than we're seeing at the moment, very similar in retail, and I think there's a bit more business in the company side, if we take out the effect of deleveraging of the development sector.</p>
          <p>Costs now. The objective here by the end of the year is to see &#x2013; and they should be growing by no more than recurrent revenues. And next year, there should be growth &#x2013; cost should be growing less than revenues.</p>
          <p>Provisions now. Provisions for the first quarter are more or less in line with our budget and what we're budgeting for the year as a whole, so we're seeing risk premiums that are very similar to what we've seen in the first quarter. I don't think there's going to be any great change there. So, that's earnings.</p>
          <p>The other question addresses a possible IPO. I think there are two issues here. First of all, from the point of view of capital needs, for the group as a whole, as both Manolo and myself has asked and answered in previous questions, we have no capital needs for regulatory reasons. So, for those reasons, there will be no IPO in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Second point, there could be an alleged capital need in Mexico because of a regulatory process, whereby new hybrid vehicles are being developed, which could be considered as capital in Mexico. This would be if the Mexican authorities think that they had to cover hybrid vehicles at that time. But at the moment, our capital ratios in Mexico are over 15%, and the minimum requirement is 8% or the recommendable would be about 10%. But we're clearly well above the regulatory capital requirement, so we don't need any IPO there.</p>
          <p>From a strategic point of view, which would be the third part of this, we're talking about the franchise where we continue to see opportunities for growth, especially organic growth, because of bringing new customers into the bank and the increased business in Mexico. So it wouldn't make any sense from a strategic point of view to deleverage there, maybe some alternative investment with similar levels of growth. But at the moment, this is not on the horizon.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have another three or four minutes and about 10 to 12 questions to get through, so I'll try to select two or three most important things. Then in the course of the day, Investor Relations will attempt to answer all of them.</p>
          <p>Concerning Latin America, Daragh Quinn from Nomura asked &#x2013; says that the earnings are quite strong, given the level of inflation in Argentina and Venezuela. Is this sustainable over time, these levels of recurring earnings? The charges to NPAs have fallen in the quarter. Is this a one-off or is this something we're going to see going forward, too?</p>
          <p>And then Irma Garrido from Ahorro Corporaci&#xF3;n, "Given the current situation in Argentina, what is our position with regard to risk if something does happen in Argentina?"</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you want to deal with LatAm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Matteo, I do think it's interesting to read the quarterly documents we publish. On page 42, you've got a detailed breakdown of the earnings in Latin America by country, and there you'll see, if you look at Argentina and Venezuela that, that's where we're seeing the lowest growth of all of the South American division. And Chile is growing at constant exchange rates, 24.2%, because the current exchange rates &#x2013; actually that growth rate will be higher. Colombia is growing 75.9%, so Colombia is showing impressive growth. Peru is growing 33.8%.</p>
          <p>These are growth rates of attributable profit in these countries at constant exchange rates. So, that shows that the kind of dynamic we're seeing in the income statement in South America is not associated to countries that we might consider to have high inflation, such as, for example, Argentina and Venezuela, Rather, we're getting growth because of the improvement of the core business of our South American division, like in Chile, where we're outgrowing the market or Colombia, where our franchise is fantastic and Peru, where we're also one of the best banks in the country, and it's not really focused in either Argentina or Venezuela.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And apart from what Manolo said, you should also take into account that there's a lot of diversification within that division with a lot of different countries. Some of them are showing wonderful institutional development and provide a lot of stability. This quarter, maybe in Argentina and Venezuela, we might see more positive performance than we can expect in future quarters. But the underlying performance of revenues in Latin America with some countries offsetting others will continue to be highly positive, with strong growth over the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>We also talked about Argentina. Well, I think you've got the data in the publication. &#x20AC;54 million generated in that country this quarter. Because of the accumulation of profits since the last crisis, we've got equity there. That's retained earnings after dividends of about &#x20AC;500 million, and that's the maximum exposure we have now in Argentina. So, that's in the very worst-case scenario, of course. But there's a possibility of devaluation and such like, which we have to take into account.</p>
          <p>But we look at the impact of Argentina on the group as a whole or even on the region as a whole and if we look at what's happening elsewhere, we don't think it could have a significant impact either on the accounts of the region, let alone on the group as a whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, M&amp;As. Three questions here &#x2013; well, four, actually. Juan Pablo L&#xF3;pez from Espirito Santo Investment asks if we can update the role that we want to play in the consolidation of the banking industry in Spain. Do we have an appetite for more? Carlos Peixoto from BPI asks along similar lines, what would our position be about Spain? And then, in international terms, we're asked if we are thinking of expanding in Colombia and how we might fund a potential deal there?</p>
          <p>Mario Lodos from Banco Sabadell asks about the role of BBVA given the latest news about potential interference with respect to the feasibility of using the deposit guarantee fund in such light, whether it is going to be allowed? What we think might happen?</p>
          <p>And then, the final question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca says, taking into account <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:27:00) of guarantee and in Turkey and CITIC in China and taking into account the penalization under Basel III, are we thinking of selling? What would the reasonable price be to get out of those investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The role in Spain, I have to be quick on this. We have always said and we continue to say that we all analyze all opportunities that are placed on the table. We analyze them, and we discard them, most of them and others. We analyze them, and we take a strategic decision, such as we did with Unnim. We will only deal with opportunities that we think will provide value for our shareholders. And we will continue to do the same thing moving forward here in Spain. There might be deals or there might not be.</p>
          <p>But the important thing, especially here in Spain, is to continue with the focus that we have on organic growth and price management and cost management and, of course, the focus on the risk indicators, because we want this franchise to be sound. We want it to generate resilient revenue over time. And that's the main focus of our attention here in Spain.</p>
          <p>Colombia, as Manolo has just said, growth in Colombia over the last few quarters, this is maybe one of the highest potential countries for growth in the region. And, of course, it's a country where we have a large footprint. But maybe you might not consider our footprint to be big enough. Maybe there would be opportunities there. But once again, it depends on the value we could generate for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>If we're talking about debt investment in non-strategic divestments and non-strategic businesses where we might invest in an asset with clear potential, yes, then we would. So, we continue to strengthen our franchise in Columbia. There is nothing on the table at the moment. We are not looking at anything that would enable us &#x2013; or that would offer us growth in Columbia. But as a focus, as a country that we &#x2013; with a top priority, is certainly eligible.</p>
          <p>Maybe you'd like to talk about our role in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I didn't hear the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Investments in Turkey and China, Turkey, first of all, it's a very easy question. We bought guarantee and we paid a controlled premium when we have 25% control and we've paid the first part of this over time. We continue to confirm in Turkey after a very fast integration process with a Turkish bank, with all the different units in the group, we can continue to confirm its potential, both the country and the particular potential of this bank.</p>
          <p>We do have initiatives that are already being led by our Turkish colleagues in the group for global projects so we can extend the best Turkish practices to the rest of the group. So, from the point of view of Turkey, we can confirm the potential of both the country and the bank in the earnings and the return that it's generating in the business model, so we have no thoughts whatsoever in divesting in Turkey.</p>
          <p>China, we also &#x2013; we've heard the discussion on capital consumption that we've heard today, this 9% that we've already met this target that is recommended by the EBA.</p>
          <p>When you go to China and you see the growth in the banking business and the potential that it &#x2013; for the future in some of the businesses that have enormous potential for growth, and here, I'm referring to the car sales boom and financing this. They don't have very much expertise here. I'm referring to the important growth in affluent sector. In China, there are already several hundred million of these. So, and the traditional Chinese banking industry cannot provide services from them.</p>
          <p>So, from a strategic point of view it's a region of high growth which is also debatable. We haven't talked about the behavior of the emerging world with regard to contributing economic growth into 2011, which is over 85%, and I'm sure we're going to see this in 2012. And I think what we will probably continue to see is a greater contribution from this world and, in particular, from China and Asia in general and in China in particular. So, the regulatory impact that we hear so much said about, much of this has already been absorbed in our capital ratios. So, we will continue to see, moving forward, earnings and revenues being generated from them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can repeat the question. The Banco Sabadell asked with regard to our strategy, we hear a lot about interference from the Competition Commission of the European Union with regards to the EPA, the guarantee funds and the auction of different banks, what do we think about this? And do we think the aid, especially from the deposit guarantee fund can be considered as a public aid from the point of your deficit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it would be a question that should be put to the government rather than to us. Nonetheless, I'm quite happy to give my comments. As you know, Brussels looks at any intervention in the financial markets and reviews the details on the basis of the European treaty regarding the kind of state aid that's acceptable.</p>
          <p>So, if the state aid is there, then the Commission will have powers to look at the restructuring plans that would use the state aid and establish an alternative plan of saving, if necessary. And they will always ensure that there's oversight such that the entity that comes after the restructuring will be feasible and profitable in the medium term and will be able to show sustainable growth. So, that's the role of Brussels.</p>
          <p>And I think it's important to understand this, because I think this is a guarantee for all the stakeholders in the market, to know that there is a second opinion there or an alternative analysis that we're getting from Brussels, and they go into a lot of detail as well. In 2008-2009, Brussels was very busy with a whole lot of issues with restructuring in the European banking industry. And at the moment, the key issue is South Europe and the restructuring of the Ca&#xE7;as savings bank in Spain. So, Brussels is putting a lot of time and energy into that. And that means we've got a greater guarantee that what is being done is correct.</p>
          <p>In the case of Spain, there's another important element, which is the deposit guarantee fund, which is used to cover losses. And those losses then are not going to be charged to the state budget at the moment, at least. This deposit guarantee fund is bringing in about &#x20AC;3 billion a year from the banking sector in Spain as a whole. So, it's a very specific way of improving provisioning, which is slightly different from what's happened elsewhere in Europe, where the government and state budgets have had to pay for these guarantees, as has happened in the UK, in Ireland and elsewhere, where it was the government rather than the banking sector that paid for the restructuring.</p>
          <p>And that means that if we add to the government debt, because it's the banking industry that's making contributions to this fund and will make more contributions in the future in order to do the restructuring and guarantee deposits here.</p>
          <p>And may I add something about &#x2013; something I didn't say about China before. I was talking about the performance of earnings and revenues in CITIC, but I didn't talk about the contribution to the group, which in 2011, which was over &#x20AC;550 million. But it's also important to look at the payment of dividends related to profits, over &#x20AC;125 million. That's double what we got last year's. With respect to repatriation of dividends, there are absolutely no problems with that region. And so, there's a cash payout related to earnings of 2011 of over &#x20AC;125 million then. And in the developed countries, that's not the kind of levels that we are now becoming used to.</p>
