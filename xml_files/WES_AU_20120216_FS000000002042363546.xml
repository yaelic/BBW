          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding, and welcome to the Wesfarmers 2012 Half-Year Results Briefing. Your lines will be muted during the briefing. However, you will have an opportunity to ask questions immediately afterwards, and instructions will be provided on how to do this at that time. This call is also being webcast live on the Wesfarmers website, and can be accessed from the homepage at wesfarmers.com.au.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the floor over to the Managing Director of Wesfarmers Limited, Mr. Richard Goyder.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon or good morning, everyone, depending on where you're at on. Joined in Perth by all of the management team: Ian McLeod, John Gilam, Dene Rogers, Guy Russo, Stewart Butel, Tom O'Leary, Olivier Chretien and Terry Bowen; all but Rob Scott who's <mark type="ph" /> diving out of (00:49) the conference because he has a family bereavement.</p>
          <p>So welcome. We've got a presentation to take you through, after which we'll be more than happy to do questions-and-answers. So if you move to slide four, I just want to give a quick overview of the results, and then I'll hand on to Ian McLeod. In terms of the overall result, we think it's a good result with our underlying net profit after tax up 5.2% to $1.2 billion there reported profit after tax in line with last year, $1.176 billion.</p>
          <p>On strong revenue growth, we've really good cash flow performance in the business as you can see on that slide. We also had ongoing strong investment in our businesses, with net capital expenditure up 29% to just under $1.3 billion. I said good cash flows and we've strengthened our liquidity position on all ratios in the half. The board, today, has declared a fully-franked interim dividend of $0.70, which is up just under 8% on last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide five, in terms of highlights, I'm very pleased with the retail contribution because I think given the external environment for four of our five retail businesses to increase their earnings is a very good outcome. The Coles performance obviously is very strong, and the turnaround momentum continues with a very strong focus. At the end, we'll talk about on what we're delivering to our customers.</p>
          <p>The Bunnings continues to go along very well. We're seeing good transaction growth and ongoing efficiencies in Kmart and Officeworks, and it's early days for Dene Rogers at Target, but already there's some good initiatives into that business.</p>
          <p>We've already come out with some information on our insurance earnings. We did that some time ago, but as you know, we've had a very high level of catastrophe claims and increasing reserves associated with the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. We've got very strong demand that Tom and Olivier will talk about in Industrial and Chemical products areas.</p>
          <p>And we're happy with the Resources performance particularly given the work that's going on in Curragh and Bengalla relating to expansion and the costs associated with moving to that expanded terms. And some ongoing expenses associated with recovery from the flood in the first part of the half.</p>
          <p>Terry will talk about other later on. There are some significant factors in other. Some cash, i.e. the sales of Premier and enGen and some non-cash including the impairment of Coregas and further write-down in the Gresham Private Equity assets.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to talk to slide six. That's there for your information. It's the summary of our earnings. And slide seven goes to the divisions and so we've got five of nine divisions with increased earnings on the half one with the same and three that have gone back, but overall, as I said, a pleasing performance.</p>
          <p>In terms of return on capital, the highlight on slide eight, I think, is the ongoing improvement in Coles and got to &#x2013; the other I'd want to make is we retained and maintained a very, very, strong focus on return on capital in the group where some of the businesses have gone back that's where we're investing heavily in the business and that's certainly the case in Home Improvement and Resources and it would be the case in the Chemicals, Energy &amp; Fertilizers businesses, the investment in the ammonium nitrate expansion starts to take place.</p>
          <p>In terms of our strategic agenda on slides nine and 10, eight of the divisional Managing Directors will talk about this. I'm not going to go through these in great detail other than to say, which I'll reiterate again when I talk about outlook that we are continuing to invest in all of our businesses, both in terms of capital and in terms of our customer offer.</p>
          <p>And at a group level, continuing to build our human resource capability, which I think is incredibly important. I think we've done a very good job this half in terms of capital efficiency which enables us to have a strong balance sheet and continued access to capital. And obviously, we maintain a very strong focus on delivering satisfactory returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>So now, I'll pass on to Ian McLeod, who'll talk through the Coles results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. I believe this result demonstrates that the five-year turnaround remains firmly on track. Total revenue growth of $17.2 billion in the half results, 7.2% a strong result in the current market environment. Food &amp; Liquor revenue was $13.4 billion in the half, up nearly 5% despite deflation of 2.1%, the highest level of deflation we've experienced. This is our 12th consecutive quarter of industry outperformance, our highest transaction growth since the start of the turnaround and our underlying volume growth remains very strong.</p>
          <p>Convenience achieved a strong result also of $3.8 billion in the half, underpinned by strong volume growth in fuel. The balance between price investment and efficiency improvement have been well-managed across the Coles business, with the EBIT growing at twice the rate of sales.</p>
          <p>And in addition, the 110 basis points of growth in return on capital to 8.2% continues the progress we have made in previous years. These results are built on hard work within the business and with our suppliers to improve efficiency and drive savings that we subsequently invested in lower prices, better-quality fresh food and an improved customer experience in our stores.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to comment on our turnaround progress in a bit more detail, beginning with slide 13. Our value proposition continues to gain momentum by attracting new customers and encouraging existing customers to buy more from us. The half-year volume transaction numbers in basket size growth show that we are making strong gains in key metrics, particularly in fresh food but our efforts throughout the supply chain have been rewarded by more fresh food items in the basket, more baskets per week and the fastest rate of growth in Coles.</p>
          <p>Our investment in quality, service and value is paying dividends, but there is still more to do. We've now added $4 billion in incremental sales over the last three years, significantly improving our sales density as a result. This has provided substantial operational leverage to the business and helps us fractionalize our cost base, and we expect further gains to come from this in future years.</p>
          <p>These improved efficiencies and better working capital management have enabled us to fund our $2.5 billion in capital and expenditure in the last three years. Despite the significant investment, we have still increased return on capital by 300 basis points in the three-year period.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 14. As a primary communications vehicle of our investment in price, our "Down Down" campaign has proved to be highly successful. As well as driving double-digit volume growth in key categories, it has also driven strong growth in products that our customers buy the most, such as <mark type="ph" /> mints (08:25), bread, eggs and milk.</p>
          <p>"Down Down" has also been supported by strong market-leading promotions and our produce Super Specials campaign has also been very well received by our customers. Fresh produce participation has now reached record levels and shows no sign of abating.</p>
          <p>Value confidence is critical for consumers at Christmas and so our Christmas price promise resonated strongly. It created a strong trust platform for customers, underpinned the record for Christmas for Coles. This is all building consumer confidence in Coles that will reap years in years to come.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 15. Throughout Australia First sourcing policy, we are working hard with our Australian suppliers to improve quality, innovation and in fresh produce even extend growing seasons. No added hormone beef took 18 months to develop with key suppliers and corresponded higher costs without charging customers for a more tender meat.</p>
          <p>As a result, we have seen meat sales increasing at double the rate of growth all our categories. Our new freshness campaign is also supported by years of work with our growers to improve farm processes, shorten supply chains and enhance how we stock, handle and display fresh produce in store. I'm confident this will give Coles a sustainable competitive advantage going forward.</p>
          <p>We are also working very hard to improve the quality and value of our Coles brand range, many of which are unique to Coles and provide us with opportunities to help small businesses grow as we jointly develop innovative new products.</p>
          <p>We're also encouraged by exclusive Mix fashion range of clothing, which is now in 57 stores across the country. It's early days for Mix, but results are pleasing with over 60% of customers buying Mix who have never bough apparel from Coles before. I'll now turn to slide 16.</p>
          <p>We continue to make good progress on implementation of critical supply chain efficiency programs with the integration of Easy Ordering and Easy Warehousing, a key step forward for we have only just started to leverage these programs. Despite some speculation, Coles has not had any significant implementation problems in the rollout of these critical IT systems.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, Christmas is one of the smoothest, operationally, I've ever seen. What does remain are opportunities  to increase supply service levels into our  DCs. Easy Warehousing will provide suppliers with far greater visibility on our stock requirements to facilitate service improvement to our stores.</p>
          <p>We've also started to reengineer our supply chain with a fast/slow network of distribution centers that enables us to better schedule deliveries from suppliers and deliveries to stores around the country. The bottom line is we are continuing to make solid progress in reducing excess stock and in the last 12 months we've reduced our net working capital by a further two days.</p>
          <p>We also continue to see significant reductions in waste in stores as a result of our total loss program and have developed efficiency programs to help mitigate potential carbon tax impact when they arise next year. A new rostering system which we are rolling out across the network has also facilitated improvements in store productivity with potential to drive additional efficiency gains over the next few years.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 17. Within our store network, we continue to make good progress in the quality of our fleet. In the last six months, we planted an additional 49 renewal stores including construction of new stores, store extensions and fleet renovations. In the last three years, we've opened 77 new stores, but we have also quietly closed 77. Despite this, our store's base growth has grown by 5% and our cumulative store sales have grown by over 20% over this period. We have also increased average store size and improved sales densities simultaneously. We expect net space growth to grow by at least 2% per annum going forward. In this coming year, we'll open one freehold shopping center per month from. When we arrived, we are opening one per year.</p>
          <p>Just as important as newer and bigger stores is the improvement in customer service within our existing fleet. We have now over 2,000 self-scan check-outs, which are helping to reduce queues in our stores and enhance the customer experience. We are broadening our training programs so we can raise the bar on customer service in store also and we are seeing solid returns on that investment. Only last month, our telco's online survey received 12,000 customer compliments about team member service in our stores, a record monthly result for our team members, and I thank them for their support.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 18, during the last six months, liquor has been the most challenging business within Coles. The liquor market continues to be difficult and we are seeing a continued consumer shift towards purchasing from large box formats. Given our presence in the sector through 1st Choice and the scale of convenience Liquorland stores adjacent to supermarkets, we have weathered the change better than most, growing both sales and share.</p>
          <p>However, liquor remains a drag in our combined and food and liquor sales and also on profitability, further exacerbated by transition problems as we implement the extensive but essential replacement systems for our legacy IT platforms. This has been a major distraction for the liquor management team, but we are over the worst. We posted managing capability under Tony Leon's strong leadership and are confident the results will improve. December, for example, was the strongest year-on-year liquor result in the half.</p>
          <p>Within Coles Express, compelling fuel discount offers have enabled us to weather rising oil prices and achieved record comparative volume growth of 3.7% in the half. The success of V-Power through our alliance with Shell has also enhanced the fuel margin mix as well as further rollout of diesel pumps to most <mark type="ph" /> forecourts (13:23). We continue to upgrade the network, try on new formats and develop our product range to further enhance our customer offer.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 19. All retailers are living in challenging times. The second half of this year offers more of the same as consumer confidence remains fragile. But almost perfect growing conditions recently we are seeing significant fresh produce deflation. We expect deeper deflation over the next few months where underlying volumes will remain strong.</p>
          <p>We have confidence in our turnaround plan and we'll continue to execute it at a pace with ongoing network transformation and renewal rollout, leveraging our supply chain, new business and category development and multi-channel and online growth. We also expect store and central efficiency savings to continue to help fund our future growth and value investment will remain the central pillar of our plans.</p>
          <p>Our customers expect and are rewarding us for it, giving us further encouragement and confidence that we are on the right track and we'll stay there to build a better course beyond the initial five-year plan. I'll now hand over to John Gilam.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ian. I'll comment first on Bunnings and I'm starting at slide 22. We were pleased with our first-half performance for three reasons. Firstly, longer term growth plans were well-advanced. Secondly, day-to-day trading was strong. And thirdly, we gained more momentum from our strategic agenda.</p>
          <p>Looking at the headlines, we achieved good sales growth with trading revenue up 6.8%. Our earnings growth of 6.1% was pleasing. Return on capital at 27% is industry-leading and a solid given &#x2013; historically high levels of CapEx and the large quantum of property on our balance sheet. Our trading EBIT margin although back a tick due to a range of factors is higher now than the level we reported just two years ago.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 23, trading benefited from our multi-pronged growth focus. We worked hard to make the customer office stronger with more value, new and better products, and further service enhancements. The customer response was terrific with transaction growth substantially higher than revenue growth. The merchandising range reset project, which started in 2010, is now close to completion, benefits the customers, our business and our suppliers are tracking ahead of expectations.</p>
          <p>Customers are enjoying breathtaking value within de-cluttered and easier to shop ranges. Shelf space being freed up the category expansion; winning suppliers are now enjoying a raft of volume uplift benefits. And, importantly, Bunnings has the leading brands by channel at materially-lower costs with better support in training, innovation and marketing.</p>
          <p>This work has also allowed us to drive positive deflation. As I explained at the full-year results last August, the price deflation we are experiencing is self-determined and is being consciously executed with good assortment planning.</p>
          <p>We have a proven long-term record of creating value for customers and the range reset work continues this. Network expansion and existing store reinvestment remains a key work area. Good lifts are coming from store refurbs and refits. The new store pipeline is in great shape and I can update you a little here. As of the start of this week, we had 18 new stores under construction, representing a combined new store area of just under 0.25 million square meters.</p>
          <p>Our capital investment levels in the half were $335 million, slightly ahead of the prior comparative period as we foreshadowed in August. The quality and depth of our new store pipeline is very exciting. The capability to find, develop and open strong sites is a great asset and allows us to forecast opening 16 to 26 locations annually for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>In terms of outlook, I'm now on slide 24, we expect to deliver continued sales growth in both consumer and commercial areas. The top line trading trend of positive deflation creating higher transaction growth is expected to continue. Q3 sales last year included one-off lifts from natural disaster recovery work, and that needs to be factored into thinking.</p>
          <p>There are five clear growth opportunities before us as listed on this slide. Our strategic agenda and work plans target growth from each of these. And if you're unfamiliar with these plans, please refer to the June 2011 investor presentation.</p>
          <p>In summary, the first half results for Bunnings were good. Most encouraging was the advancement of our longer-term growth plans and the momentum gained within our strategic agenda. We are very well placed to continue to perform well</p>
          <p>I'll now move to slide 25 and comment on Officeworks. Trading revenue of $710 million was up slightly on last year. Good operational and merchandising work supported by lifts and business effectiveness saw earnings grow by 9%. This is a pleasing result given tighter trading conditions and deflationary pressures. EBIT margin continued its upward trend, improving by 30 basis points through better buying, good re-weighting of the sales mix and strong cost control.</p>
          <p>If you please turn to slide 26, I'll comment on some highlights. Headline sales growth is modest, but underlying that are some very positive outcomes such as double-digit retail transaction growth across stores and online, making it easier for customers to research and shop either online or in stores has been a strong objective. More website improvements were made as part of Web re-invgoration work that started four years ago.</p>
          <p>Officeworks has traded online for a decade or so and today Web sales easily exceed $100 million and are growing well alongside store growth. Store merchandising disciplines delivered good results to offset challenging deflation in key categories such as tech and furniture. Improved service and an expanded suite of services and solutions are important elements of future growth and the revamped printing and copy offer continue to perform well. Given the reality of pressures on smaller business, growth in B2B sales is encouraging with good traction from our initiatives based around service, value and better products. During the half, one new Officeworks store opened and there are now six new stores under construction, with investment to upgrade existing stores continuing.</p>
          <p>The outlook for Officeworks, and I'm now on slide 27, is for moderate headline sales growth in a market with intense competitive pressures on sales and margins in tight underlying conditions. I think the first half results shows that Mark Ward and the Officeworks team are doing a good job, but they know more is needed to build on this positive performance.</p>
          <p>Merchandizing and service initiatives will enhance the consumer and B2B offer. The focus on lowering cost and increasing effectiveness continues particularly within the supply chain. Network expansion and upgrade works should accelerate.</p>
          <p>Officeworks has several key trading periods in the second half for the fiscal year, and good execution is critical to deliver the right result. January's trading made a good start in that regard.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now hand over to Dene.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very, John. Good morning and afternoon depending on where you are, everybody. I joined Target in early November, so this is my first results announcement with you. I'll start up in talking about the results for the half on slide 29.</p>
          <p>So operating revenue to Target declined 2.8% to $2.1 billion with comparable store sales for the half declining 3.5%. EBIT was $186 million, which is down 9.7% the prior year. And the EBIT sales margin was 9%.</p>
          <p>Just turning to slide 30, we found that customers continue to be cautious in their discretionary spend. And with the frequent use of deeper promotions and clearance sales, the retail environment was challenging. However, during the half, we focused on inventory management and we're able to reduce inventory significantly about 14% at costs through the half compared to the prior year and that enabled us to deliver an increase in margin of about 110 basis points through the quarter versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales by category, we had positive sales growth in homewares, footwear and accessories categories as customers responded to the quality that we offer and we're able to see positive customer responses there. And then the area that suffered the most sales decline was in the electrical area and that was due to reduced demand for categories like digital cameras, DVDs and interactive toys, as well as price deflation.</p>
          <p>Just moving on talking about inventory a little bit more, that has been a focus for the half and we reduced that 14%, that costs that helped to improve cash flow and also relieved the complexity of operating the stores. In the latter part of the half, we changed our marketing program and in December, we saw an improvement in our sales trend and actually had a sales increase for that five-week period after adjusting for new store openings as well as an extra day of trading. So we're very pleased with that.</p>
          <p>So, thinking about the future a little bit, we are continuing to focus on inventory management. We're also focusing on the online channel and looking to expand the amount of product that we offer online. And, so during the half, we increased our online offering to include women's wear and men's wear, electrical and entertainment. So far, the customer response and increased sales activity online has been encouraging and we'll continue with this focus throughout the rest of 2012 and beyond. Although e-commerce is a significant opportunity for Target, we view it as complementary to our bricks-and-mortar operations. And so we'll continue to invest in the network of stores as it makes sense.</p>
          <p>And so in the half, we opened eight new stores, which include three Target &#x2013; three Target Country and two Urban by Target stores, in addition to refurbishing 26 stores. So, at the end of the half, we had 175 Target stores, 123 Target Country and two Urban by Target stores, with our 300 store &#x2013; a third opened by Target due to open in South Australia next week.</p>
          <p>Talking about the retail environment, we do see this continuing to be challenging and competitive. And so, we'll be focusing on a number of aspects of the business including continued prioritization of inventory management, as well as improving our sourcing strategy and capabilities as well as increasing our supply chain capabilities.</p>
          <p>And then, finally, I'm sure that many of you'd be wondering about my initial thoughts of Target and the direction that we're going to take in the company, and so I look forward to be able to talk about those things at the Strategy Day in May.</p>
          <p>But, preliminarily, I think that Target is very well placed. I think it's an iconic Australian retailer. I think that being in the middle market portion of retail is an advantage for us, something that we could do very well in.</p>
          <p>So I'll just hand over to Guy who'll talk about Kmart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dene, and good morning or good afternoon to everyone. It's my pleasure to run you through the Kmart performance on slide 33 and also give you some insights into the main highlights for the half and where we see our Kmart journey progressing in the short to medium term.</p>
          <p>So moving to slide 33, our revenue for the half was $2.236 billion with the comparative store sales down 1.4% for the half. EBIT grew to $193 million, which represents a $90 million increase on last year or a 10.9% growth. EBIT margin for the half was 8.6%, an increase of 90 basis points and following a reallocation of goodwill, our return on capital is now 15.5% on a rolling 12 month basis.</p>
          <p>Slide 34, the changes we are making to Kmart are resonating with our customers and delivering improved EBIT performance. Low prices on Everything Everyday has resulted in consistently strong transaction growth. And in the half, we served over 3 million more customers than last year, which represents the eighth consecutive quarter of growth in customer transactions.</p>
          <p>The lower prices, combined with the adjustments made to the operating model, are resulting in sales of Everyday products rather than us requiring excessive discounting to drive sales. The result is a substantial improvement in the quality of the sales we generate, which is reflected in the improvement of profitability.</p>
          <p>Our investment in the business continues. In this half, a new distribution center in New South Wales became operational and a further four Kmart stores were refurbished. The Kmart Tyre &amp; Auto business has also focused on growth, with investments in eight new stores this half and over 150 stores have now been reimaged with the new Kmart Tyre &amp; Auto design format.</p>
          <p>In terms of outlook, if you turn to page 35, as we look forward, our aim is to connect more customers with Kmart and remain relentlessly focused on securing a product offer to deliver irresistibly-low prices on Everything Everyday. We know that in delivering lowest prices, we need to drive even more volume through our stores, which means improving our in-store execution and our end-to-end product flow.</p>
          <p>Our focus will continue on investing in our existing stores as well as expanding our new store pipeline. The new Kmart is all about satisfying customers, understanding <mark type="ph" /> nominal (26:28) family and meeting their needs with the lowest prices we can deliver them. The signs to date from our customers are very encouraging, however there is still more to do and we are very excited about our next steps in this turnaround.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Guy, and I'll start on slide 37. In the first half we achieved broking growth of 8.4%, Broking revenue increased by 21% as a result of bolt-on acquisitions and organic growth. In underwriting, gross premium increased by 11% due to the growth in the personal line and premium rate increases. Given the higher reinsurance cost, debt on premium increased by 6.7%. Consistent with earlier guidance, our EBITA for the half did increase to $23 million as a result <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:19), higher reinsurance costs and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:23). We were really pleased with the performance in Broking where earnings grew by 25% to $35 million in the half.</p>
          <p>Now, turn to slide 38. It has been well-publicized that 2011 was the worst year on record and <mark type="ph" /> that affected (27:40) Australia and New Zealand. As indicated in slide <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:43), in 2011 we experienced a very high <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:48) out of this. This <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:53).</p>
          <p>Our first half results were impacted by $28 million <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:00) and a $26 million increase in reserves driven by client deals. We made significant progress in the first half in line with <mark type="ph" /> innovation (28:21) for future earnings growth and to improve underwriting margins. Thirdly, we have achieved premium rate increases in Australia of 7.9% in six months and just under 7% rate increase <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:22).</p>
          <p>We also reduced our exposures in high-risk areas particularly <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:29) Christchurch. We reduced our exposure to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:32) by 7% in the first half. We also launched the claims optimization program, which is on track to deliver an annualized benefit in excess of $10 million of which half is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:44) financial year.</p>
          <p>As indicated in the financials, broking is now generating more significant and less volatile contributions for our divisional earnings. The momentum continues to grow in our Personal Lines business through our retail partners and more recently through our partnership with OAMPS that provides the market lead in Personal Lines offer in the broker market.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the outlook on slide 39. Our strategy continues to be to improve underwriting margins while driving growth in targeted areas such as broking, Personal Lines and supporting the key distribution partners. The premium rate and exposure improvement we have delivered in 2011 will help offset the higher cost of reinsurance to improve underwriting margins in years ahead.</p>
          <p>We are starting to see our competitors increase premium rate as reinsurance costs <mark type="ph" /> are up five (29:34) and as reserves <mark type="ph" /> releases from long tail clients (29:36) start to dissipate. We expect further growth in personal lines through our partnership with Coles and OAMPS and this growth will help balance our portfolio, which is presently more weighted towards commercial business.</p>
          <p>In broking, we continue to assess bolt-on acquisitions and invest to strengthen our clients and employee proposition. We want to retain and attract the best brokers and ensure that we leverage our account capability to deliver market-leading solutions to our clients. The key risks for the earnings in the future remain a higher frequency of natural disaster events and further decrease the interest rate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Rob and good afternoon, everyone. I'll refer you slide 41. Operating revenue at $1,087 million was 13.6% above last year. Revenue was up due to the higher coal prices, partially offset by slightly lower sales volumes and the stronger Australian dollar.</p>
          <p>Royalties for the half year are up $38 million on last year. This is very much reflected by the Stanwell royalty, which is at $88 million; it was $28 million up from last year. And that's very much reflective of a higher rolling 12-month average coal price for the half.</p>
          <p>Mining and other costs were higher due to once-off costs associated with final recovery from the January 2011 floods and costs associated with ramping up overburden removal and coal exposure ahead of Curragh's expansion to 8.5 million tons of export metallurgical coal.</p>
          <p>And to put that into context, Curragh moves in this half compared to the previous corresponding period last year, moved an additional 20 million cubic meters of overburden during that period. Earnings before interest and tax at $250 million was in line with last year. Looking at our safety performance, our lost time injury frequency rate for the division was slightly up on last year, reflecting increased activity associated with the expansion works on site.</p>
          <p>I'll now refer you to slide 42, resources highlights. The highlights for the year include solid revenue growth in the first half, which was driven by higher coal prices. The revenue growth was partially offset by increased royalty expenses and additional once-off costs.</p>
          <p>Metallurgical coal production at Curragh for this half was constrained at 3.1 million tons of met coal due to operational disruptions as we commissioned a new coal handling plant at site in the final phase of operational recovery following the January 2011 floods.</p>
          <p>During the commissioning period that we're undertaking at the new wash plant at Curragh, production is being impacted by a significantly lower plant yield, down around 7% to 10%. We're experiencing variable freight rates and constant stopping and starting to make repairs and adjustments to the plant. We expect the new coal handling plant at Curragh is expected to reach practical completion around the end of March, subject to satisfactory performance over the next month and a half. As previously announced, Premier was divested by Wesfarmers on the 30 of December, 2011.</p>
          <p>I refer you to slide 43, Curragh focus on cost control. The mining industry continues to be impacted by a very tight labor market conditions and industry cost pressures. During the half, Curragh was impacted by the &#x2013; an additional once-off cash costs of $55 million due to final recovery from the January 2000 floods, and costs associated with increased overburden removal, coal exposure and stock buildup ahead of Curragh's expansion to 8.5 million tons of export metallurgical coal. An operational review and cost review at Curragh is underway.</p>
          <p>I now refer you to slide 44, resources outlook. The export metallurgical coal market is experiencing softening of prices due to weaker global demand. Saying that, the long-term export market fundamentals continue to remain sound.</p>
          <p>The outlook for this financial year is as follows: Curragh's metallurgical coals sales guidance remains at 6.8 million tons to 7.2 million tons of metallurgical coal. This is subject to satisfactory commissioning of the second coal handling and preparation plant at Curragh, infrastructure constraints and no serious ongoing wet weather.</p>
          <p>Stanwell royalties are expected to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million for the full year. At Bengalla, there was a short-term negative impact on production from the recent explosive supply disruption in New South Wales. We will continue to focus on cost control at all our business units.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, projected completion of both the Curragh and Bengalla expansions is expected around the end of March of this calendar year, and feasibility studies for the next-stage mine expansions are continuing.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Tom O'Leary.</p>

      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Thanks, Stewart. Looking at Wesfarmers Chemicals, Energy &amp; Fertilisers and starting with safety performance at the foot of slide 46; it's encouraging to see an improvement in the lost time injury frequency rate for the division as we've continue to dedicate more resources to safety across our businesses.</p>
          <p>Turning to financial performance, earnings decreased by 34% to $99 million compared to last year's result, remembering that last year's result included $41 million of insurance proceeds associated with the Varanus Island gas disruption. Excluding that impact, earnings were down 10% on the previous corresponding period.</p>
          <p>The lower earnings were despite continued strong results from the Chemicals businesses and they were a consequence of three factors: the reduction in Kleenheat earnings which are flagged to the 2011 full-year results and again, at the operational briefing in December and the continued external pressures on our Australian Vinyls business and the exclusion of enGen's contribution following the sale of that business in August 2011.</p>
          <p>The gain of around $43 million achieved on the sale of enGen is excluded from the divisional result and it's reported as a non-trading item. Return on capital was 18% in line with the 18.1% return on capital achieved last year once you adjust for Varanus Island.</p>
          <p>Turning to highlights on slide 47, we announced in December that the Wesfarmers' Board approved the $550 million investment to expand our ammonium nitrate production capacity at Kwinana. This investment will increase capacity by 260,000 tons per annum and it underpins a continued strong growth of this segment of our division. At an operational level, we've continued to benefit from good production performance delivering a 10.7% increase in chemical sales volumes for the period and higher earnings than last year.</p>
          <p>That was especially placed in given the completion of the planned three-yearly ammonia plant shutdown during the half that was delivered ahead of time and budget. The ammonia, ammonium nitrate and sodium cyanide businesses benefited during the period from improved pricing outcomes and continuing strong demand from the resource sector albeit that was off to some extent by higher input costs.</p>
          <p>Australian Vinyls also experienced higher input costs relative to the PV selling price which is known in the industry as the PVC-VCM spread. And that, together with the higher Australian dollar, put further pressure on that business.</p>
          <p>In Kleenheat, LPG production was 14% lower than last year following declines in the LPG content in the Dampier-Bunbury pipeline. As I indicated last year, the business has also experienced a step-change in gas prices and transport costs adversely affecting production economics. Soft market conditions have also placed pressure on volume and margins resulting in significantly reduced earnings on the prior period. The Fertiliser business delivered earnings ahead of last with strong sales experience in the first quarter, as well as a good uptake of early orders and contracts.</p>
          <p>Turning to outlook on slide 48, earthworks have commenced on site in preparation for the ammonium nitrate expansion. Our expected completion commissioning dates are unchanged. More generally, on our business is exposed to the local resource sector despite some input cost pressures from increased gas costs and ammonia pricing. We're expecting to benefit from continued strong demand and production outcomes. The Australian Vinyls business is likely to continue to be challenged by the same factors. That's a spread in the Australian dollar in the short term.</p>
          <p>As I've foreshadowed, Kleenheat earnings for the full year will be well down due to production economics, and the immediate outlook for soft market conditions will continue to make volume growth challenging.</p>
          <p>Fertiliser earnings, as always, will depend on the seasonal break in the second half as well as farmers' terms of trade. As a result of the record harvest in Western Australia and strong summer rains though, we're expecting low levels of nutrient in soil and so the current outlook for Fertiliser volumes remain strong at this stage.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Olivier Chretien.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom and good afternoon. I will now cover the Industrial and Safety division. The division, as shown on slide 50, delivered a strong result for the half year. Operating revenues grew by 8.9% to $843 million. Earnings before interest and tax were up 22.8% on last year at $97 million. And return on capital increased from 11.8% to 14.5%. And the increasing activity was not at the expense of safety performance.</p>
          <p>Looking at some of the key highlights on slide 51, strong sales growth was achieved across most businesses this year and regions, particularly in the regions with higher exposure to resources activities and large projects. It was supported by a continued strong focus on customer service and on-time delivery performance. The division improved its competitive position across a broader range of industries while further developing its key account management and eBusiness capabilities.</p>
          <p>Network improvements also continued with the opening of one new Blackwoods branch and 11 Gas Depot in Australia, the closure of four underperforming locations and the opening of a new Blackwoods branch in Indonesia. The earnings growth also reflected improvements in most businesses, good cost management and growth in services. Return on capital improved, thanks to the earnings results and tight capital management.</p>
          <p>Additionally, as a consequence of the change in operations at BlueScope Steel and then associated with the Coregas business, we took a non-cash write-down in the carrying value of Coregas of $181 million at the end of the period.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the outlook for the Industrial and Safety division on slide 52, while global uncertainty remains, the division is well placed to leverage the continuing opportunities in the resources sector and achieve solid growth for the remainder of the year. The business will continue to target a greater share of customer spend while facing margin pressures.</p>
          <p>t will do so for growth in services, sales to major projects with targeted footprint, capacity expansion, increasing customer diversification and exposure to higher growth sectors, improving the effectiveness of the organization, as well as pursuing business expansion initiatives including offshore and acquisition opportunities.</p>
          <p>Labor access and costs will, however, remain a challenge in a number of areas. The second half will also be affected by the revised BlueScope Steel supply agreement with Coregas, which has been signed in January and is effective from 1 of January 2012.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I will now hand over to Terry Bowen.</p>

      <speaker id="10">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Olivier. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide an overview of the performance of the group to other businesses and corporate costs, as well as cover off on the group's balance sheet and some capital management initiatives.</p>
          <p>So turning to slide 54, earnings from our associates were lower than last year and they recorded a loss of $31 million. This loss was primarily as a result of downward non-cash revaluations of the Gresham Private Equity Fund investment. The downward revaluations in GPE mainly reflected our continuing contraction in market valuation multiples over the half, particularly in retail and mining services companies and our requirement under the accounting standards to mark-to-market this &#x2013; our investments to those contracting multiples. But downward revaluations were partially offset by a $7 million gain recorded by BWP and earnings of $5 million recorded in Wespine.</p>
          <p>Our interest revenue for the half was down on last year and that reflects lower cash on deposit during the period. Non-trading items were a negative $30 million in the half overall and there are some ups and downs, which I'll talk to on the next slide.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of the table in other, we recorded a benefit of $19 million in this half. That mainly reflects an improved claims environment, that's where our self-insurance program sits, and it certainly compares favorably to last half where there were a number increased provisions for asset damage following severe weather events. The group overhead expense for the half was $53 million and this was ahead of last year's expenditure of $47 million and largely reflects increased corporate activity around some of the sale events that we had as well as share-based payments.</p>
          <p>So turning slide 55 in non-trading items, as we foreshadowed to the market, we recorded a $181 million non-cash write-down in Coregas. Olivier has covered off on the reasons for that, and had been well covered on announcements. Just in terms of the accounting for that, $172 million in fact was a non-cash writedown in relation to the goodwill and the remainder property, plant and equipment.</p>
          <p>Other non-trading items reflect the group's return on capital focus, where during the period we divested to Premier coal mine, the enGen power generation business and our Boddington forestry assets</p>
          <p>We received in total $421 million of cash proceeds from that activity. The disposals also resulted in a gain for us of $151 million pre-tax, and we expect no tax payable on this as we have capital losses available as an offset.</p>
          <p>So turning now to slide 56, in our cash flow and balance sheet, the group's cash realization ratio at the half of 127.8% was ahead of last year. The period's result includes an increase in operating cash flows across almost all of our divisions which was pleasing. And at a group level, operating cash flows are up by nearly 11% to nearly $2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>As we previously mentioned though, the group's operating cash flows are traditionally stronger in this first half of the year, and that's due to the seasonal nature of some of our retail operations and sales over Christmas. And it's also worth pointing out that our reported cash flow can move around over the periods were potentially up to $400 million to $500 million depending on what day of the week that our period closes on and that's due to the nature of our creditor payment run. So, if we think about 2012 coming up in December, we will have &#x2013; which finishes on a Monday, we'll have a creditor payment run on that day which will be, if you like, a non like-for-like, we're closing off on a Saturday as we did this year, so just something to bear in mind.</p>
          <p>In terms of working capital management, on slide 57, the strong operating cash flow was helped by pleasing working capital performance. You can see in our retail businesses an improvement of $557 million. And given more subdued levels of consumer confidence in the retail sector, we had a particular focus on ensuring that inventory was well-managed during the period particularly in regard to the seasonal inventory levels and this focus resulted in lower closing inventory balances across both Target and Kmart in the same year.</p>
          <p>And as we spoke about six months ago, Coles inventory at the 30 of June started high due to a safety stock build that we've put in ahead of the Easy Warehousing rollout. Now pleasingly, the safety stockers have been progressively reduced over the period and combined with supply chain and store efficiencies, inventory days have continued to improve that Ian's covered off on.</p>
          <p>Bunnings and Officeworks, it's also worth mentioning managed their working capital well over the half as well. The strong retail performance was partially offset by an increase in working capital from our industrial businesses of $301 million. This increase is largely associated with the higher inventory positions and particularly, the ROM stock build at Curragh that Stewart has spoken about, as well as seasonal inventory-building fertilizer. So this further information on our working capital and key balance sheet movements on slides 46 and 47 in the supplementary pack and I guide you towards that for more information.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 58, on capital expenditure, given our approach to actively manage freehold property in our retail businesses, we think it's appropriate to talk about net capital expenditure because it includes both the purchase and the sale of property. And if we think about the pipeline of freehold property, we think it's appropriate. During the half, the group continued with the strong capital reinvestment phase. We invested $1.263 billion in net capital expenditure, and that was about 29% ahead at the same time last year.</p>
          <p>The investment in land and buildings related &#x2013; that you can see on the slide, related to retail network expenditures mainly in Bunnings and Coles this half and net totaled $481 million, was $136 million higher than last year. The increase was offset by $165 million in cash proceeds that we received from the sale of disposed of property. And again, that was mainly in Coles and Bunnings.</p>
          <p>The other significant capital investment that we undertook over the period included the Curragh and Bengalla expansions. We started early expenditure on the ammonium nitrate expansion. We continue to invest in the Coles store renewal network, as Ian's spoken to. Coles has also invested more on self-checkout this half as we rapidly roll that out. And across the group, we've accelerated expenditure generally on energy efficiency initiatives.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to the second half of the year, we anticipate a continuation of the strong capital investment phase that we're in now. And net capital expenditure is estimated to be somewhere between $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion, although I would caveat this by saying we always do &#x2013; it does depend on freehold property activity, which can move around a little bit. Importantly, this current phase of strong capital investment, as Richard said, we do believe is going to strengthen the group's future financial performance for years to come.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 59, on balance sheet, it's in a healthy position and as evidenced by improvements in our key liquidity ratios, their ratings remained unchanged. The group has announced an interim dividend of $0.70, as Richard has referred to, which is 7.7% ahead of last year.</p>
          <p>In line with our recent practice, we will continue to provide shareholders with the option to participate in the dividend investment plan and no discount will be allocated &#x2013; will be given to the allocation price and the program will not be underwritten.</p>
          <p>The required numbers of shares from that will be neutralized through a broker and share issues on that or share purchasing on market by the company. The record date for the dividend is the 27th of February, and interim dividend will be payable on the 30th of March.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 60, and refinancing, the gross debt at the end of period was $5.6 billion and net debt $4.5 billion, and this was broadly in line with our position at the 30 of June. Our all-in weighted average cost of debt for the half was 8%, and this represented about 74 basis points reduction against the same cost of debt this time last year. The decrease is reflective of the expiry of higher price swaps that we put in place prior to the global financial crisis and also the benefits of refinancing initiatives over recent times.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we expect the cost of debt for the year to be slightly lower again at around 7.9%. During the period, the group continued to proactively diversify and lengthen our debt maturity profile and that was evidenced by issuing $500 million in unsecured five-year notes, which will mature in November 16 &#x2013; or 2016. The pie chart on the slide gives you an indication of the broad diversification now of our debt sources including the new debt facilities that we've put in place in this year so far. And the chart at the bottom right of the slide shows you the group's debt maturity profile, which we think shows a relatively low level of debt repayment due in any one year.</p>
          <p>To slide 61, and the reallocation of goodwill between Kmart and Target in the half, During the period, we did identify areas in relation to the initial allocations of goodwill made at the time the Coles Group acquisition that impacted Kmart and Target. The areas arose from incorrect calculation of the terminal value in Kmart and the failure to consistently reflect the impacts of Kmart's and Target's business plans.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, we booked an adjustment of $496 million between the two allocated goodwills of Kmart and Target. I think, importantly, this correction has no impact on either our consolidated balance sheet, no impact on our earnings and no impact to either the current period or any prior period.</p>
          <p>Finally, to slide 62, in partially protected shares. During the half, the directors elected to extend the lapse date of the Wesfarmers partially protected shares. The new lapse date is now the 23 of November 2012. It's worth noting that the board has the right to extend this lapse date for a further 12 months, up for another three times. But this is subject to the original terms of these shares.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now hand back over to Richard.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Terry. Just quickly on the outlook on slide 64. Wesfarmers is all about creating value and we do that for our customers, I think demonstrably at the moment. We're doing that in all of our businesses. We do it for our employees in creating opportunities for them and providing a safe workplace. We're certainly doing that for our suppliers by building our businesses and growing opportunities for them to conduct their business through it. And we're doing it for communities in which we work and operate through employing people, paying taxes and other community contributions that we make. Primarily, and our objective is, to provide satisfactory returns to our shareholders and by investing in our businesses and investing in our people, we are growing shareholder returns over time.</p>
          <p>And so, as we look forward, we're continuing to grow our retail businesses and we expect earnings growth in those businesses through the strategic agendas outlined earlier by the divisional managing directors, ongoing investment in each of the businesses and very much a strong focus on our customers.</p>
          <p>We're anticipating and certainly hoping for improved performance in our Insurance business. I think, again, through, as Rob said, better circumstances in terms of claims but underneath that, we've done a lot of work in terms of the capabilities in the business, the underwriting risks we are writing, we're building a very strong broking business. And so we have a positive for that sector.</p>
          <p>In Industrial Safety, Chemicals, Energy and Fertilisers business, we're investing heavily in those businesses and we're well-leveraged to growth in the Australian resources sector there. And, as I said, we'll continue to invest, investing heavily in resources at the moment. As Stewart said, while the long-term fundamentals look good, where there are some short0term weaknesses that will impact the near-term results in that business and a very strong focus on cost control on resources.</p>
          <p>And at the group level, as I said earlier, a very strong focus on building our human resource capability, a very strong focus in maintaining a robust balance sheet and cash generation in our businesses and a very significant investment phase going on to generate future growth.</p>
          <p>So with that, we're happy to take any questions you may have.</p>

          <p>And the other element is what's happening in the market in produce, which has seen very significant deflation particularly in the second quarter. And I think that's set to continue over the next few months as well. Last year, you were in the situation where you had the cycle and effect. Again, prices were going in the opposite direction. This year, you had almost perfect growing conditions and abundant supply. So bananas have seen about 50% deflation; melon is 40%; avocado is about 40% and even apple is at 30%.</p>
          <p>So these are pretty significant, but I think what we're doing is making sure we're very much focused on our underlying core strategy and we're pleased to see the way that our underlying volumes have held up extremely well.</p>

          <p>I think you said, a little bit, Ben your question on &#x2013; I think you're asking really inflation on the cost lines and deflation on the selling lines. You're seeing something</p>
          <p>in the middle there which is what you can do with your cost of sales. From Bunnings' point of view, it's very <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:42) has put us in the driver's seat to use deflation to create more value for customers and really bring breathtaking value with high-quality products to more and more of our customers. And we're seeing about a 3% deflation across the half, to give you a rough guide there.</p>
          <p>There are obvious inflation pressures across the businesses on a number of cost lines that are well reported. So they are what they are. You've got to work out how to use less of those things and I think Richard alluded, and Terry alluded, to the capital expansion that's going into a whole range of things, around energy efficiency and similar things; waste reduction, et cetera.</p>
          <p>From the Officeworks side, I think we called out at the sales broadcast, of the sales announcement for Q2, the tech and furniture were really up against it in terms of cost-saving deflation in the broader market since. And high single digit deflation is what the Officeworks team are dealing with. Their assortment planning and their thoughts around sales and mix, et cetera, have really been very good work. And given the best control you can in those sort of circumstances and again, really thinking about how you buy, who you buy from and what you can offer a supplier &#x2013; and resetting your base has also been work that's been well done to make sure that their cost of sales position is in good shape.</p>

          <p>Yeah, largely it's been mix because I think we've always spoken about growth and us increasingly getting concerned that people would not be factoring in property sales, which is obviously what happens in the way we manage our retail and freehold portfolios.</p>
          <p>We probably versus the top end of that guidance, we're probably somewhere in the middle of our original guidance at the moment with some property sales. But I said it, it does move around and some of this, in our single property sale can be quite a large value and it's only going to slip by a month and falls into next year so there is &#x2013; it's something we're always cautious about giving too much guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. Just a question on Coles and return on capital. It's slowed down a bit, I guess, the growth there. If I look a bit further out, I guess you have less working capital improvements coming through and you're rolling out more stores. So, am I right in assuming that capital employed will increase? And I look at your EBIT numbers which are falling down as well and I get a sense that after five years of ownership, you're not going to have, I guess, a date on return on capital for Coles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ian here. I think that this is a long-term plan, and I think that both in terms of EBIT margin expansion and return on capital, we'd still expect those to see further improvement. There are more efficiencies to come in the business.</p>
          <p>And I think that's actually given the way that capital expenditures increased year-on-year and the rate of sales growth that we've had and improvements in sales densities have demonstrated, that's been judicious use of capital. So I'm pretty encouraged by the rate of growth we've had in return on capital. I mean, it's increased by about 300 basis points in the last three years. So, I don't believe it's going to stop here. So I firmly believe that the turnaround strategy is still appropriate and I still believe we're going to get further growth in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, I think the other thing about it is the investments we're making in new stores and in other parts of the business we expect we'll generate good returns and relatively-high return on capital. So as we make those investments, that will also lift the return on capital in the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And just a follow up there, I mean, you mentioned that one of the reasons the growth in Coles is this low is because of the, I guess, a slower market. But those results, you always told that two-thirds of the deflation is being caused by Coles. So I just struggled to see exactly how you can kind of blame the current market for what's going on for this lower growth from Coles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I mean as I said earlier on, there's been two factors that have impacted and I think that relates to the highest level of deflation that we've seen. It's investment in price which we'll continue to do in terms of giving better value for our customers and driving better volume.</p>
          <p>And the other comment is in relation to the circumstances surrounding produce. I think that if we look at the underlying position that we have and you strip out the produce impacts against each of the last two quarters, our underlying growth position is pretty much in line. And our underlying volumes have been between 6% and 7% for last six quarters, and quarter two is no exception. So I think that our underlying position is still as strong and robust as indeed it has been.</p>
          <p>And we're getting more transactions through than we've ever had before. We're growing the units in the basket and we're growing our fresh food participation. And once these elements sort of unravel in terms of those particular market conditions, then I confidently believe that the basket growth will still be there and so still will the &#x2013; so the increasing customers. So I'm absolutely confident that the turnaround is on track.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think you can assume that. I think what you got to look at is the underlying profitability and it's a mix of a number of things. It's a mixture of our overall sales growth. It's a mix of our overall volume investment and it's a mix of what we do in terms of underlying efficiency gains that we got in the business. So I don't think you should make those kind of assumptions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Just another one on the Coles business, it looks like the depreciation picked up by about 10%, presumably that's the investment in previous years coming through. What could we expect there going forward? Is this sort of the lump or will that trend continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I'll answer that one. I think it went up by, you're right, 10% by nearly $20 million, I think I was. So this is what we said. Last year it was helped as we said by write-off of some assets following getting a fixed asset register in place. So there's a little bit between the two years, but when you're renewing stores, you're now putting capital into stores that don't have a lot of capitalist depreciation come through, but that's factored in now in all our planning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's just a rebate? Do you think it'll continue from here or do you think we'll see an increase in deprecation ahead of top line growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't give predictions relative to top line growth, but I think we would expect with our current investment plan that depreciation will increase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then just another related question. EBIT margin for the Coles business I mean 25 basis points in this environment is pleasing, but it's a little bit slower than what we've seen in the past. It seems to decline as the EBIT slows &#x2013; the EBIT margin expansion that you need to get to deliver on the return on invested capital hurdle or does it need to grow back more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start and then I'll let Ian go, Michael. I just caution everyone to sort of place too much emphasis on sort of six monthly or three monthly risks on some of those numbers whether it's sales growth, comps growth or EBIT margin growth. But, Ian, I'll pass on to you now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what you got to do is maintain a context in this. This is a five-year turnaround plan and what we've got to do is make sure that we are very firmly consistent in terms of our underlying program and underlying strategy and we believe that the investment value that we've put in place, the improvement and efficiencies are things which are actually going to ensure that the company continues to grow and become more efficient and indeed more profitable, and I think we've seen that in these particular results.</p>
          <p>There are certain individual dynamics during the course of this half that have had a bearing and I referred to that in the earlier commentary. But I'm very confident that the position will continue to improve from where we are today as indeed it has been done in the past.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line David Errington at Merrill Lynch. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard and Terry. This is probably directed to you, this question. It's on the return on invested capital particularly from your capital spend. In the last couple of years I think in 2010, you spent $1.7 billion in CapEx which is nearly two times depreciation. In 2011, it was more than two times depreciation at $2.1 billion and in this half, CapEx depreciation is now 300% or three times.</p>
          <p>As far as you're concerned on growth now I've got now is that when you look at such a CapEx buildup and it's not just this year. It's been in the last two or three years. Your EBITDA this half only increased by $50 million. Now in coal in particular, in the last 6.5 years, you spent $1.65 billion on coal and you just not getting increase in earnings.</p>
          <p>So, what I'm worried about is given the economy we're entering into a very weak period, I mean, that's pretty well &#x2013; everyone knows that whether it be retail or general industrial. You guys are just spending so much capital that I'm worried that the incremental return on that capital, you just not going to see. I'd like you to comment on that.</p>
          <p>And the next comment I'd like to make is why is that retail <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:52) think that spending money on property is free? You have to get a return on property so why do you have to make such big deal of free or post arm or netted property. Property, you've got to get a return on as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the second point, David, absolutely. And our capital expenditure assumptions on property actually take into account a conservative view on our &#x2013; on any sale of property. The reason we're talking about net rather than gross CapEx is because with property, our desire usually is to once we've developed the property and created some value is to get off that balance sheet and so it's more from a cash point of view than an investment point of view we're talking about like that.</p>
          <p>Your question on investments is a good one, and I'll try and break it up a bit and I'll get Terry to add to it. So I don't resign away at all from what we're investing in our businesses. I actually think this sort of investment is great investment as long as your disciplines are in place when you make investments. And so if I go through the businesses we're getting &#x2013; we've had some, as Ian said, some significant capital expenditure in Coles in recent years. It's primarily been around investments in the store network both refurbishments, new stores and also investments through the supply chain. And I'm very confident that those investments will make a very &#x2013; more than adequate return.</p>
          <p>Bunnings, I think we've got a track record over many, many years of returns and we monitor this very carefully at the Wesfarmers board level. So I've got no issues with what we're doing in Bunnings and, in fact, we're usually conservative on our investments in Bunnings.</p>
          <p>We've got a lot going on in resources. I agree. The importance of that though is that once we commission the new wash plant, coal preparation handling plant at Curragh, we'll have export capacity of about 8.5 billion tons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the worry for me, Richard, because coal's just not delivering. I mean it's just not getting the tons, not realizing the price and costs are going up despite all the steady CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the price is obviously out of our hands. In terms of tons, this phase now, as Stewart said, we're hopeful the plant will be commissioned around the end of the March depending on work over the next six weeks in that. And once, that's done, then we will have the capacity at Curragh to produce the sort of tons I've just talked about in terms of export metallurgical coal. And as we are able to do that, subject to demand obviously, we would expect our unit costs to come down.</p>
          <p>And I think in the Resource business, it's not necessarily a simple business because in this half, as I've said earlier, we've had to deal with carryover issues from flooding, continued dewatering and the like. But also, as Stewart said, we've moved additional 20 million tons of overburden in the half to cater for extra capacity when we will &#x2013; we're putting on in place. So that's an expense that we've incurred for future earnings, if you like. So, judge us when the expenditure is made and when we do or we don't achieve the production outcomes at Curragh.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll probably make a comment there as well, Richard. When we originally got approval for the expansion to 8.5 million tons at Curragh, we expected the new prep plant to come online around about August last year. Now, that's been delayed by the best part of six months since that time. We've been ramping up production ahead of the expansion to make sure that, when the expansion and the plant is completed, we have sufficient coal available for us to see that plant at the 8 million to 8.5 million tonne rate. There's no point in lagging your ramp-up of overburden removal ahead of the &#x2013; or slow it down to coincide exactly when the plant comes online, otherwise, you will not have coal available, the wrong coal available to feed through the plant.</p>
          <p>So it's been a very conscious decision to ramp up our overburden removal ahead of the commissioning. Our issue has just been the commissioning has taken a little longer that what we thought. Certainly, the anticipated original date was August last year, when they are targeting the end of March. And in this interim period, we are experiencing a range of the issues associated with commissioning, not the least of which is variable feed rates, so the lower yields than what we originally thought, and that's all about settling down the process side of the new plant. And that will take some time and we do have to take some time before we get to, I suppose, a steady state operation when we get to 8.5 million tons. And that's the reality of we're at. As Richard said, we're very comfortable once we get past this commissioning phase we'll meet our targets that we've set.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, Richard and Stewart have probably said enough on various points. I'll help you with the net side of things though. Just with the &#x2013; I think when you're looking at CapEx, the depreciation in particular, because obviously land and buildings either has no depreciation or hardly anything and when you're in a really big phase as we're quite open with in terms of all our disclosures around property development in freehold which was badly needing in the likes of Coles and obviously has always been near in Bunnings but have been accelerated in recent times, then to do a ratio over that period of time, and refer back to a time when you're comparing apples with oranges, I think it's a bit misleading.</p>
          <p>I think that what I'd encourage you to do is look at CapEx less the property side and then compare that to depreciation, and then start to adjust this, as Stewart said, for things like a ramp-up of large capital projects which clearly are not going to deliver on day one a 100% return against those. That's going to progressively build up over time on these projects. So that's what I'd encourage you to do. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:14:43)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just looking at the CapEx you're spending, Terry, and the earnings uplift that you're getting. And it's not that much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you got freehold property on your balance sheet that you're taking in that you're developing over a period of years, in some cases, then realistically, there is no earnings at the moment from that activity. What we're saying is at the end of that development process, we will put it back into the market at an appropriate yield. We will recoup the cost of our investment on the property more times than not or very close to it, and then you get your earnings going forward in the future.</p>
          <p>So I think, the opposite worry would be &#x2013; I think it's the right challenge but you had the opposite worry at the moment if we weren't investing in this business at the moment, then I think that would be a much greater concern for the future outlook than what we're currently doing.</p>

Just in regards to Bunnings, John, can you maybe talk a bit about the impact on Masters &#x2013; I mean, from Masters on your business and should we see that weigh down the comps or EBIT margin, particularly given both Bunnings and Masters, if either have a greater focus on retail than trade and appear to be targeted at similar customers?</p>

          <p>Yeah. Thanks for the question, Shaun. Richard answered this question a week or so ago at the quarter sales call and given how widely he's reported -- widely reported his comments within, I don't intend to repeat his answer here. But perhaps it's timely to reflect on the fact that we're not going to give a running commentary on the performance of stores or any new competitor has opened and we've never done this in the past and we don't intend to do this now or in the future.</p>
          <p>Now, we compete with a whole raft of businesses from IKEA, kitchen storage, lighting, flooring, outdoor finish. So that's' what we compete with IKEA on. It's a big chunk of our store. We compete with the likes of Stratco, with Reece and there's just a whole host of them. It doesn't make any sense to think about just one competitor. You have to look at the whole competitive landscape, and what's clear to us is that the market is growing.</p>
          <p>2008 was the last time we really did a big research piece on the Australian home improvement and outdoor living market and we valued it then at over $36 billion. There are other valuations that are bigger than that. I saw one from CBA not too long ago that was a lot higher. What we believe the market is now about $40 billion and is still growing. We've only got 16% share of the market, so there's clearly a massive room for growth in our business and that's what we're totally focused on.</p>
          <p>And our long-term track record of delivering volume growth and turning that into earnings growth, and turning that into industry-leading return on capital and being a property developer in there, to go back to one of David's points, we aim for that to continue. And the rate, the focus on rate on sales growth is something that &#x2013; I noticed in the information you get and I'll just ask you and try make some sense on it. We don't run our business to achieve a quarterly sales growth rate. Some quarters will be greater than others. Some years will be greater than others. For example, Q3 last year had a material one-off positive lift from the huge natural disaster recovery efforts. Q3 sales this year will be lower. Those sales that were there for recovering from the floods are one-offs.</p>
          <p>And if you kind of adjust for it and then you'll try to interpret that as a slowdown of the business, I know I really struggle to try and make sense of how you're analyzing the business. And we're very heavily impacted by weather from a Bunnings point of view quarter-to-quarter and then you're likely to see some fluctuations. We've had quarters up 16%, other quarters which have been flat. That's reality, and one we're quite comfortable with. The aim is to consistently deliver volume growth, earnings growth and good returns and we've been doing it successfully and our plans are to keep doing this for the decade ahead.</p>
          <p>And finally, you made an observation on focusing on retail. We're a hybrid business. 20% or thereabouts, maybe a touch more of our business is in the wholesale market. And we're a very effective wholesaler and we're getting very good growth in what are extraordinary tough conditions for the housing, our new housing market which are well-documented. We're a hybrid business in the sense that we chase the spend around anything to do with home improvement and outdoor living that's necessity-based and discretionary-based. I'm not sure that's how I'd describe the new entrant, but that's up to them to describe it.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the broader market, there are category specialists, hardware stores, other home improvement players. You'll see very different rates of growth. There are some quite big chains that have grown across the last five years, and which has &#x2013; when you think of that complexity in the scale of the market, that's why I think this focus on Masters is really something that &#x2013; well, we'll certainly not going to contribute by having a store-by-store scorecard. It's just not useful.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And just, Richard, just in regard to Coles, there's obviously a bit of disappointment in the slowdown in the rate of earnings growth. You've gone from 20%, 21% down to 11%. Do you think market forecast in those are very well aware of what our market forecast so do you think forecast for EBIT growth with the markets you've got in Coles is too high?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Shaun, that's tantamount to giving a forecast, so I'm not going comment on that, other than to reiterate my other comment, but I just wouldn't get too concerned about one half to one half or even one quarter to one quarter on the sales growth. As Ian said, we've got a plan. The plan's on track. There are some really exciting and good initiatives underway in Coles about satisfying our customers and doing a whole lot more through the supply chain, making the business more efficient. But I'm very confident that the time will increase the earnings in the business and we're very happy with the way the business is going and happy with the way our investment's stacking up at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add to that, Shaun, I think there aren't many retailers around at the moment. I've got double-digit profit growth and they're growing a profit at over the rate of sales so perhaps, my disappointment isn't as great as your own. I think in terms of margin expansion, we still see there's a pretty significant opportunities. We've got volume growth that's underlying that's strong. We still got further opportunities and efficiency and we've got further space growth to come as well as we right-size our portfolio. So I'm still very opportunistic about the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess our concern is if you look at the share price of it today, that's many things but arguably Coles coming in a bit lower than I think what the market's grown. It could at least be a pretty material drive on the Wesfarmers share pricing and that's where expectations are and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:21:19) the reason for the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Shaun. There's no doubt, that's right. I think we've always said that actually in Coles, we're not focused on that EBIT to sales margin, that we're focused on the EBIT dollars. And as I think Ian said, it's hard to be disappointed with a 14% lift in EBIT in an environment where I'm not sure there's going to be too many other retailers coming out with that sort of number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Sorry to maybe harp on this point. Could you give us a sense &#x2013; you're flagging retail was a drag on that Coles number. Could you give any sort of sense of the materiality of that drag?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, we don't break out the differentiation between food and liquor, but we've sort of indicated there has been a drag there both in terms of sales and profitability. I mean, the market as in liquors, one area of the Coles business, where I think is the greatest risk in relation to consumer circumspection around discretionary spend. And I think we're probably seeing an element of that with the change in consumer shopping habits, perhaps a broader migration towards large box, away from standalone independent stores. We'd be well placed in terms of our approach to that. Our liquor performance is still encouraging in a contracting market, but what we thought is worthwhile doing was flagging that it has been drag on our overall food and liquor performance to ensure that people would have a broader degree of confidence in the underlying strength of our supermarket business, which is where the mainstay of the turnaround exists.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Phil, just to help you a bit more, there's some one-offs relating to system implementation in the half as well which, as Ian I think said, we're broadly through now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I mean, should you assume &#x2013; the fact that you're bringing it up, I mean it's going to be at least somewhat material. Otherwise, it would not have been mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that's pretty self-evident. I think you have to also look at the context of the total profitability of liquor in general against a business that's generated $1.1 billion of the profit last year. So I think that you have to put it context, but nonetheless, the performance of liquors in some of those was worthy of calling out on this occasion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then my second question is around just the balancing act and I know there's a lot of focus on near-term growth. But if you look at your investment into the customer also, arguably it's accelerated in the last six to 12 months but your dollar sales have decelerated. I don't know if I understand the deflation issue, but at the end of the day, it's dollars that drive returns, not volumes. So I'm just wondering, this philosophy around the price or value investments if the dollar sales don't continue, I mean, will that be varied because clearly there's a lot of cost savings coming, but if they're all reinvested and ultimately they aren't returning the EBIT dollars, you're not going to get the returns that you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can understand you making that comment. But I think as John alluded to, we're managing these businesses, not for quarter on quarter or half on half. This is a long-term game plan. And what is fundamentally important to us is that the value investment to engender high levels of customer trust is pivotal to the success of Coles, not just now but into the future. And I think it'd be quite wrong to try and undermine value in one area because of underlying circumstances that materialize in the way they have within the produce market over the last few months.</p>
          <p>So what we do, as I've indicated here, is look at where our underlying strength is coming from. And what we're seeing there are strong growth in volumes and strong growth in consumer transactions. Those elements are where you build the base of your business. And when we unravel the current inflationary &#x2013; deflationary environment, those customers and those higher baskets will still be there.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Firstly, just on the metallurgical mix that's forecast FY 2012 being 42% hard coke, and 35% PCI, and 23% semi-soft, it's obviously showing a big growth in the second half in semi-soft. And I'm just wondering if that's to do with the expansion and where the likelihood has been going forward of what the mix is going to look like from FY 2013 and beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the mix from FY 2013, I'll give guidance on that at the May Investor Relations Day. We're still going through detailed planning numbers at the moment, so it's a bit premature to make any comment on that. Certainly, if you look at the mix year-to-date, it reflects a high proportion of tons coming out of Curragh North. So hence, the PCI numbers are slightly higher. But with now the washing through of the flood impact, we're now getting more production out of Curragh, so we're starting to see PCI numbers come down and the semi-hard coking coal numbers go up. So we are going to see a lot of swings and roundabouts on mixes. Just there's a lot of moving parts. It's coal availability of certain seams at certain qualities at a certain time. It's a proportion of Curragh North versus Curragh production. So these numbers do move around a bit. So that's probably all I want to say on mix at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Thank you. And secondly, just on the Gresham Private Equity fund, you lost $60 million in FY 2011, lost another $46 million in the half. I was wondering if you can give some color on what the current written down value is for the funds invested in that business or that area and i.e., sort of how long can these large losses go on for</p>
          <p>before it's written down to zero?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well firstly, when you talk about losses, they are a mark-to-market value, not necessarily losses. And in fact if we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm assuming that that would be somewhat reflective of the underlying business though, is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we have to do in terms of valuing those businesses is you take into account multiples and then typically with these businesses you apply a fairly significant discount to that as well. And we take on the Gresham Private Equity valuations through our books. So that's what you're seeing at the moment. They are ultimately &#x2013; what will be realized will be dependent on what shape the businesses are in and what the market will pay when and if they get sold. But I'd also say, if you look through our time investing in private equity, then it's pretty much washed its face to date and, obviously, our <mark type="ph" /> come on (1:29:23) ultimately will depend on what we sell these businesses for.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">

          <p>Yes. Specifically, as to your question in relation to current date, it's currently carried at $80 million is the sum total Gresham Private Equity, two and three firms at the moment. That's the written &#x2013; that's, if you like, the current mark-to-market value of the businesses that are sitting in those funds.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Two from me if I can, one is carbon tax. If I look at your group, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions totaled about 5 billion tons. Are you expecting to have to pay carbon tax on all of those emissions? And how do you think you're going to be able to recover it or is that just going to be straight into the bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, David, on carbon tax, there'll be different impacts across the various businesses. We'll certainly be paying it where we have, if you like, direct energy use ourselves. There'll be fugitive impacts at our coal mine operations. And there'll be offset in the Chemicals business. Tom might want to talk about. So, prima facie, there is obviously an impact to the group. We're doing a lot to mitigate that through abatement in the Chemicals business through energy efficiency across all of our businesses but particularly in coals because coals is a high CO2 emitter in the group. So, we're pretty confident. So we will have cost, but we're doing a lot to mitigate that cost, and that mitigation will come through lower energy costs. Tom, do you want to just talk a bit about...</p>

          <p>Sure. David, you might recall from the operational briefing in December that we outlined a lot of the work that we're doing on catalysts to install in our nitric acid plants to reduce nitrous oxide emissions. And those trials and modifications on plant are continuing.</p>
          <p>In terms of financial outcomes, I wouldn't really want to add much to what we said at the operational briefing in December, and that's that given that some of our business recognizes energy intents and try to expose the impact and is obviously getting relief in the near-term., the impact is not likely to be significant in the early years. That's for the Chemicals, Energy &amp; Fertilizers division.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I think the bigger and this is actually what happens through the supply chain through transport costs and broader costs to the supply chain and we're just going to have to see how the whole thing pans out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, would you look to where the costs that you're getting or do you think that, especially in this environment, there is an ability to be able to pass that through to your customers whether it be in retail, individual consumers or whether it be in some of the other businesses further down the supply chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of it will depend on what the actual cost increases are and what the business is trying to do. And so I think that will be the decisions that people make on the way. John Gillam looks like he wants to make a comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm just going to make a point, David, that there are a lot of moving parts around all the cost and expense lines that go into running a business and sometimes you can get a real grade ahead of steam up through an efficiency action or some reengineering or something clearly you've done and really get something going the right for you. In other times, you're caught with something that goes in the wrong direction and then &#x2013; but you're asking a question about one single price line, one single cost line, and then trying to reflect on that with our overall pricing and that's just very, very hard to make an informed comment and the market sits where you need to be for pricing.</p>
          <p>And I think there's a very clear message from all of us running the businesses that value is king at the moment, getting better quality product and really making sure customers create value. It's what the key to getting growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As an overall comment, David, I am really pleased with the work that we are well prepared for the imposition of the carbon tax. We've been doing our engines reporting and internal compliance for quite some period of time. But most importantly, I'm really pleased with the mitigation work that's going on in the business, in each of the businesses. So I think we're in pretty good shape.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because if &#x2013; you see the latest stuff that's available from the government, you've got a potential cost, that $53 million, $54 million, which is if you can't recover that eventually,  a reasonable impact on your bottom line, so I'm pleased to say that you're looking to be able to mitigate that cost substantially.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a clarification now on the comments that David Errington or the questions that everyone was asking, if I look at your property returns, if I look at the profits that you made in this half on property, it looks to be about $12 million or $13 million on proceeds of about $165 million. But your returns there basically are just covering your interest ycosts, I dare say that you've probably kept that property for more than 12 months, so really the returns that you're getting on the property that you're flipping out at the moment does seem to be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:35:22) Is that the sort of returns we shall be expecting going forward as you continue to sell the property?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to answer that, David, it's not the way we think about property sale. The advantage of going in, when you do go in freehold which done more in Bunnings obviously, but increasingly in Coles in places is, one, it gives you access to a site that you may not, otherwise, get and you can move fast and do things to it. Two, it means that you develop it the way that you want it exactly and you're in control of that process. But the key thing is when you then put it back into the market, you can put it back in with the lease that actually suits your business for the long-term going forward.</p>
          <p>And often that what we will do in our businesses because we are long-term in terms of our view of, if you like, the earnings of the Retail business is going through, you're putting a lease that effectively nullifies the chances of making a profit on the property development side of things. You actually recoup it through your earnings going forward for decades going beyond that in the businesses that you want to run. And you can see that quite evidently, if you look at the work that Bunnings has done and look at its lease profile through BWP, and Coles is no different. That is, I would add, a big change from the way perhaps property was looked at prior in the old Coles group but that's the Wesfarmers philosophy around property.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, thank you. I just <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:37:12) a comment from Dene, perhaps a fresh set of eyes looking at the environment in which Target operates. Do you think you've got an earnings rate there that's sustainable, that you can work from and why do you think that's the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a good question. I think, as Richard said in his introductory remarks, we're optimistic about Target's future. I think Target complements Kmart and it occupies a different market space. So you will have seen over the last few weeks, for example, that we've been focusing on something called Target testing &#x2013; Target tested, I should say, which is an attempt to reinforce the fact that we occupy that middle market position. We offer higher quality than some of the deep discount stores and we would argue better value than some of the retails who are priced above us.</p>
          <p>And so we're looking to reestablish this middle market position and I mentioned that during the December timeframe, we saw a uptick in sales after adjusting for the additional day of trading as well as new store openings. And so that, to us, was an indication that the Australian customer believes in Target and trusts Target, and is looking for value and quality. And that we're probably somewhat uniquely positioned to be able to offer those lower price points with a higher quality. So, yeah, I think it's early days yet and we've obviously got to prove ourselves, but we're quietly optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Just a related question, I guess, on the transfer of goodwill from Target to Kmart. It strikes me a lot to start with, to be honest, to be writing up a goodwill on Kmart, but also what strikes me a little lot is that the assumptions that led to the write-up in Kmart exactly offset the reverse assumptions in Target. Did you actually revise down the business plan in Target or is this just a calculation error in the spreadsheet or something similar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just put in perspective, Grant. In terms of the adjustments, so if we look at the total goodwill on the Coles acquisition, it's less than 4% of the total goodwill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That had to be allocated around the price so obviously the degree of science in these things is always difficult. So you run PPA models at the time, or at models at the time, to allocate the goodwill around and they're allowed to be adjusted to a degree within the first 12 months. Within that, what we found is that in a peer review that's been taken this year, which is just part of our normal peer review process, someone looking at the documentation found that we actually hadn't reflected Kmart's turnaround plan appropriately in its goodwill allocation. So when you reallocate that, you then look at &#x2013; and also consistently in relation to impacts on Target, and so when you reallocate that it's not a case of writing off, but it is a reallocation.</p>
          <p>So obviously, I mean, the key point we've made is it actually has no effect at all in the growth to earnings, balance sheet or return on equity, and indeed either now or in the past. So you have to then go look at the past. The auditors obviously make sure that it would never affect the growth results in looking backwards as well. So that was the case. So in the scheme of things, it's pretty immaterial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm surprised the reallocation was only just between those two businesses, if that was the case. But I guess, the more salient point is I guess, did you have to revise down the business plan assumptions for Target? Is that basically &#x2013; did that happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I said, it's looking at it consistently. It's not looking at our original acquisition case. But effectively what we've done is because we've got to reflect the goodwill, because the goodwill wasn't appropriately reflected in Kmart in terms of its valuation, obviously, you go and look at the impacts of that business plan elsewhere, so.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I just had a question in regards to liquor or a couple of questions actually. Firstly, it was mentioned back in August that a potential rebranding of 1st Choice was being considered. Can you just talk about the progress on that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the 1st Choice brand is now across the estate of stores that we have. We've got 81 of them, so it is not a priority to rebrand. In fact, in a number of states, it's got a very strong brand orientation. So I wouldn't be looking for a rebranding anytime soon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought there was a comment back in August that it was &#x2013; through some market research, it was decided that 1st Choice itself didn't actually stand for anything. I don't know, a comment made by...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, there's market research on a number of different of things. I mean, at the end of the day a brand is what you make it and I think that if you had your time over, you choose that as a brand name, arguably not. But the fact is that it's got recognition across the country now and I think that's what we've got to build upon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a second question, Vintage Cellars is considered a convenience offer. Can you just comment on the view that as Dan Murphys continues to roll out and be available in more areas, does the convenience offer of Vintage Cellars become more redundant because Vintage Cellars certainly doesn't have a price leadership position? So can you just talk about what it actually stands for as an offer for consumers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we see is a very strong following in Vintage Cellars, I mean, particularly through the wine club that operates within that particular market. So what you find is you've got a strong core of customers that are very loyal to that particular brand. Also the majority of Vintage Cellars stores are actually co-located and therefore the supermarkets that are close to them offer some degree of protection in that regard in terms of people choose to move from large box to &#x2013; from small into large box. So I think there are still opportunities for further development of Vintage Cellars as a brand in its own right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if the two brands and the two offers are okay, in your view, where does the upside come from then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that you got to recognize that the market is moving in a particular direction and there is a polarization emerging between a large box format and a smaller convenience format, particularly if it's located next to a supermarket. I think that if you look at the market overall, your standalone small box liquor operations I think within the market are the ones where they're experiencing the greatest degree of difficulty. So I think as I said, the Vintage Cellars brand is well-recognized by the people that are shopping that particular brand and I think that it's still got opportunities for further enhancement going forward.</p>
          <p>I think there's opportunity for both brands and I think that what we saw at Christmas demonstrated that, where we saw good sales coming through and share growth in each of those particular brands and indeed in Liquorland as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, just correct me if I'm wrong but what you're saying is Vintage Cellars does have a place in the marketplace going forward but potentially with a smaller number of stores than it has at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a relatively small part of our total portfolio anyway. You're talking about 82 stores out of 886, include the hotels as well. So, out of the total mix of stores we have, it's a relatively small proportion. But it's a niche player in the total liquor market and the customers that value Vintage Cellars will continue to shop in it.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at all. We've started commissioning on the new plant late in November. These are very complex manufacturing plants. We call guys in and it gets washed through a number of circuits and product comes out, multiple products come out the other side. What we're doing at the moment, we're in the middle of the commissioning phase where we're having to stop and start the plant on numerous occasions to adjust the process circuits, to get the right pressures in those circuits. Yeah, I'm very confident that over time, over the next couple of months we'll get to a completion of the commissioning and we'll be able to step up our production volume.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just quickly, one for Guy, how material was the contribution from gross margin expansion in Kmart's earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In gross margin expansion, there were &#x2013; I think there's probably a couple of significant parts. Of course, there's EBIT to grow which I've been sharing with you, all of you over the last couple of years; part by direct sourcing as I've moved from local suppliers to Asia; part by still removing high ticket item sale products that we still have in our business that generated no profitability. And so the other part would be that &#x2013; was we're still on the journey on trying to achieve irresistibly low prices for consumers. By going into an EDLP model, the other part is that we have less markdowns to do on the high/low model that we inherited from before.</p>
          <p>So, finding those products, we've got our SKU count down, not as low as I particularly would like, but we're down to just around 55,000 at the moment. The majority of those are products, which is part of our strategy about doing items that consumers need every day for their home and their backyard. So, not needing to mark down product and keep the price &#x2013; and have our prices at a low point for consumers is working in our favor. But, yeah, it's still early days for us as we change the wheels on the cars that sit on the freeway.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard and Terry. I just wanted to ask a question on hedging. I'm going to start off by just referencing your sales release when in Q&amp;A there, you said there was about a $0.10 improvement in the hedge rate. I just wanted to clarify how that applies to each of the retail segments. Is that what would have impacted cost of goods sold across the discretionary rates of our businesses? And if you can also clarify the proportion of direct sourcing across Target, Kmart and Bunnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the first one. So what we referred to, that's the ending point of half-on-half. So it means that our hedge book, we were at about $0.91 from memory. And it moved to $1.01 in terms of our hedging that we've got in place. It's largely &#x2013; in terms of the main hedges largely Kmart and Target that undertake that hedging in terms of those amounts and it's done as we've always said on a declining basis as you look out into the orders.</p>
          <p>So, that would have gone through their results. So it's been a benefit for the cost of sales, for want of a better word, just on the currency side. But there's a lot of other movements in what makes up the COGS, obviously. And it would have gone through in relation to purchased product in this half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the proportion direct in Kmart versus in Target or in Bunnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll kick off first, Craig. Around 40% of what you see on the shop floor, in a Bunnings store is product that is sourced here, grown here, manufactured here, I mean, in Australia and New Zealand. And it's not &#x2013; that product is not really applicable for the sort of global sourcing you're referring to. So, 60% of the range clearly is coming from somewhere else in the world. When you look at that percentage, we go and get around one-sixth of it ourselves and we've got the world's leading brands bringing some of the best quality products in the world to us for the five-sixths.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Craig, on I think, either Guy or Dene want to sort of go into the detail, but yeah, a fair proportion is pouring in from overseas, some direct, some through domestic suppliers are bringing in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. My second question, I want to hop on the Coles business but maybe if you can just be very clear around the timing of initiatives that have impacted the business over the last couple of months and what do you expect going forward? You mentioned Easy Warehousing in place. Should the benefit, the cost savings from that Easy Warehousing and Easy Ordering deal in second half 2012 than what they were in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect to see that generating ongoing improvements, Craig. I think that now that we've got the connection between Easy Ordering and Easy Warehousing, it will certainly help improve the flow through of information to our suppliers and smooth the supply chain and also improve our availability in the stores. So, we'd expect working capital investments and benefits to come through as a result of that. And I think you've seen some of that come through in the hours that we've put through today.</p>
          <p>But that's only one element of the efficiency improvements that we're looking to put in place. And there are obviously other ones that we're going to see coming into play in the supply chain over the coming months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the other one that was mentioned in the slide was rostering but it was at a benefit during the first half as well or is that something still to come in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's been a benefit for the last half and there will be further benefits to come in the second half as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I can just float in there, this chart in your slide pack on page 16 which has the wastage, so not trying to be too a specific on a date, however, there was a pickup in the second quarter off that line. I mean it looks like about a 10% <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:52:39) on the wastage index that you've got there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any clarity as to why that has moved in that direction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good spot there, Craig. If you look at the chart a bit further, you'll probably see there's an uptick each time in equivalent courses in previous years but from a higher level. So I think what you get is you get an uptick coming through to the Christmas period as you're trying to manage your range options and clear out coming through towards the end of that period.</p>
          <p>But I think what you got to look at is the longer term trend and what we are seeing is a firm reduction in our waste-to-sales ratio, and I know we expect that to continue to improve. There's been a really &#x2013; in fairness to our stores, actually they've done a fantastic job in terms of managing that approach over the last 18 months or so and they're resolute in seeing quite an improvement going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just trying to make sure, there's been a lot of questioning with concern about the margin, types of margin improvement at Coles. It just seems like there is some investment that you're making upfront or at the moment that will pay dividends beyond the track and some of the indices of performance that you stuff a little bit in the second quarter might be it was from disruptions to the business that you're doing from a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:53:57)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't think there's an &#x2013; I don't think there's actually disruption. The key factors coming through, this is the underlying deflation that we've experienced we mentioned before and the impact that sort of happen in the headline sales and the liquor impact Richard mentioned as well. And there were the key elements have impacted on the rate of margin expansion. But notwithstanding that, I still think that 14% cash profit expansion is very encouraging and we expect there's more to come as I mentioned in relation to volume improvements, further levels of efficiency and space to go through into something going forward. So I don't think that this is something that people should be too exercised about.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Firstly, just a point of clarification. Stewart, the $55 million in additional cash cost that you referred to, was that a $55 million impact on the P&amp;L line or is part of that capitalized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Straight to the bottom line, okay. Yeah. Ian, just in relation to the liquor business, and in particular 1st Choice, are you comfortable with where that business is in terms of perception, price and range? Is that now just a function of scale to give you the return that you need out of that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's still room for improvement in each of those factors. There are areas of the country where 1st Choice is performing much better than in others and I think a lot of it has come down to where those stores are actually positioned within the marketplace, and a bit like we've had with supermarkets. We inherited a store infrastructure that we are looking to try and address. Some of those were placed in particularly ideal locations that suit that kind of consumer offer. We're seeking to expand the portfolio, increase the rate of new store acquisitions and right-size and get the right sort of level of demography that's associated with that brand as well. So it's an ongoing dynamic. People are shopping there primarily on range and price, and we believe that we've got a very strong offer on both of those factors. So as we improve the portfolio, as we add to it, I'm confident that the 1st Choice portfolio will continue to improve.</p>

          <p>It's not just that, but it's also about location as well in terms of access and egress and visibility, and even physical location between one side of the store &#x2013; side of the road and another can have a bearing in terms of the returns that you get out of an individual outlet. And all those aspects are being considered and put into the melting pot as we seek new sites.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Look, just one last question, very quickly. Is there any reason to think that the significant organic growth within the retail businesses is going to slow down at any stage over the next couple of years at a gross level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to make predictions in terms of where the growth is going to go. I think there's a lot of improvements that still are targeted within Coles. And we have grown significantly, I would argue, in the last two to three years. And we will certainly expect a further growth to come through. But I'm not going to make a prediction in terms of what that level might be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you'll add capital investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On capital investment, Terry wants to comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think again, we've got a fairly full pipeline as both businesses and in terms of our key businesses in property being Bunnings and Coles have indicated. Look, depending on market conditions, as we've highlighted, that you would see particularly in Coles, I think greater exits of stores in years to come because we're building up a portfolio at the moment as opposed to having a big portfolio of businesses or properties to fill.</p>
          <p>So, I think, inevitably these things move around a little bit. It would tend a little bit on access to finance as well from the banks into the property sector, which has been difficult over the last couple of years. I mean, one of the major reasons for our property slowdown in other areas where typically the leaseholders dominated this because developers haven't been able to get money as easily from banks. So it depends a little bit on the cycle as well going forward, I think.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. Ian, I just want to ask you a question about the market potential of your Coles superstores, you've got one on Burwood. I think there's one going to South Australia. What sort of macro views do you see as you're sitting on a whole bunch of sites that will let you roll that format out quickly? And if you're dealing with the landlord, are you still intending to pay the supermarkets rate of rent as distinct from maybe the discount department store rate of rent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the rental point is something that which we ought to discuss with individual landlords. I think over time, the superstore development will become increasingly important to us. We've actually got three in Victoria now. One was an extension in Berwick. We've got Burwood East and we've just opened the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:59:31) which we had under freehold. So we're targeting other opportunities as well.</p>
          <p>But the principle behind this isn't just about the superstores as both the average size of our property portfolio, when what we're essentially doing is what we believe to be doing is right-sizing our overall property stake going forward. So we're closing smaller stores that are in somewhat small locations that we inherited. We had a legacy pipeline which was at the opposite of what we believe the strategy ought to be where the previous management were seeking to and go for quantity rather than quality in our view and offering smaller stores which were diluted to the overall estate. And what we're doing is the reverse and the benefit we've got over the new stores that we're opening is that we're actually opening larger stores which are generating the higher sales densities. We've got greater levels of profit conversion and generating us better returns.</p>
          <p>So, we firmly believe that our strategy is correct and we will continue to close our or re-site individual stores if it don't fit our overall portfolio aspirations going forward. But over time you'll actually see that the space is beginning to grow even more and an expansion of the differential between our headline growth and our comparative store sales that perhaps you've seen in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And Richard, did the Target result have a financial benefit from the strategy of paying suppliers $0.95 and $1 for that quarter ending the middle of December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:01:07) No, I don't think so. I think that was less than helpful, frankly. But we're negotiating as we always have with suppliers and to Target one on one. So, yeah, but one thing, Greg, I would say, is that Dene, as he said, as I have been in the business for a short period of time but there were some initiatives taken in December under his leadership which I think had a very positive impact on the performance of Target in that month. And that's good for the business and it's good for the people to see that Dene's showing that sort of relationship at the moment</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I just want to clarify something that John said in terms of the number of stores. John, can you say &#x2013; reminds us what the planned rollout is for Bunnings on a per annum basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The planned rollout hasn't changed at all. And if you look at our documents from the last Investor Relations, we're talking 16 minimum is what we think we can achieve and we're hopeful of being able to do 26. So we've got a band there of 16 to 26 new locations per annum and that's a mix of Bunnings warehouses, some Bunnings small formats and some Bunnings trade centers. And I also commented that there's a number in the pack that talks about the stores under construction at the end of December and I just gave some guidance that that's now up to 18 as that started this week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, yup. Understand. Thank you. And can I clarify a comment re liquor, I think <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:02:55) saying that liquor's a drag on profitability. Is that in absolute sense or in a margin sense, i.e., did liquor actually deliver a positive EBIT for the half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we don't split food and liquor to that degree. But I think if you're looking at the model, you would see that and say that liquor was a drag both on sales and profitability, so <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:03:24)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it had a bearing this half but I don't...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You also talked about bolstering the management of liquor, of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:03:37) some other people in and around Tony Leon. Can you talk, I guess, a bit more details there in terms of who these people are or perhaps more specifically what skills they specially bring to the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well one of the benefits that we've had over the last two or three years is that we've managed to increase the calibrating capability of the senior management team operating within Coles. And we look at it as a group opportunity so at supermarkets, we got convenience and we've got liquor as well and where there are opportunities to kind of move people from one brand to the next and draw on their skills and we'll do that.</p>
          <p>So we've got marketing expertise and merchandise expertise. We've also introduced a new head of finance as well. And this is actually giving us an opportunity to look more broadly at the liquor business and assess and redevelop it for future growth. And it gives people opportunities to move into that part of our business and actually also gives people that are operating in the business now to move into other areas as well to develop their career. So it's part of our general transition, but overall we believe we've got a strong team in there to help move liquor forward into the future.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just had a clarification question. The fuel discounting picked up reasonably aggressively in the half and you've had very strong results in your convenience business. So I was just wondering, how do you treat that business? The food and liquor business where the cost of those promotions or do you allocate some of it within the convenience business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination. We get benefits both ways so we look to try a portion across that based upon certain ratios that we see. But again, we're looking at it holistically. It helps both businesses then basically.</p>

          <p>Hi, this one's for Dene. Dene, have you thought about putting target on EDLP or is that not something that you're rather doing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are looking to rollout a program called Target Essentials, which is an EDLP program and so that's more about opening price point type product and so it'll tend to be direct import and it will be EDLP. And it will cover all of the categories that we sell so that a customer can go in and find those opening price points at an EDLP and, as Guy pointed out, very well derive in-store payroll benefits, reduced marketing load and that program is going to be launched towards the end of this month.</p>
