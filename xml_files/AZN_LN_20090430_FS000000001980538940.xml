          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the AstraZeneca First Quarter Results 2009 Analyst Call. My name is Sharon. I'm your event manager today.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>And now I'd like to hand over to your host, Jonathan Hunt. Thank you, Jonathan.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to AstraZeneca's First Quarter Conference Call. Leading today's call is Simon Lowth, CFO of AstraZeneca. And also on the call are members of the finance and the investor relations team. As you know, today's a busy day for reporting in the sector. It's also our AGM. So with that in mind, we do have a hard stop today just before 2 o'clock U.K. time.</p>
          <p>And before I hand over to Simon, I would like to read the usual Safe Harbor Statement. The company intends to use the Safe Harbor provisions of the United States Private Security Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Participants on this call may make forward-looking statements with respect to the operations and financial performance of AstraZeneca. And by their nature forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will now turn the call over to Simon Lowth. Simon?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone. I'm pleased to be able to present a good set of first quarter results for AstraZeneca, particularly given the tough economic conditions. Our performance is the result of excellent execution, driving growth in key product franchises and in all regions, including continued growth in our emerging markets as well as continuing to progress the reshaping of our cost base for long-term competitiveness.</p>
          <p>We also experienced some revenue upside in the quarter from Toprol-XL as we were successful in our efforts to ramp up production to meet the shortfall in the market caused by the withdrawal of two generic competitors, which I'll come back to later.</p>
          <p>Today I'm going to cover five topics on the call. First, I'll summarize the headline numbers for the first quarter. Then I'll describe first quarter sales performance by region and by our key brands. After describing the sales trends I'll turn to operating profit and I will highlight the key drivers of our continued growth in core operating profit. I'll briefly touch on cash performance and our improved net debt position. And finally, I will confirm our guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>You'll have seen from today's press release that we achieved sales in the first quarter of just over $7.7 billion. That's a 7% increase in constant currency terms. You'll also have seen that the adverse impact of currency movements on the top line reduced the reported sales growth rate to zero.</p>
          <p>Core operating profit for the quarter was up 19% at CER to $3.36 billion, chiefly as a result of the increased sales, efficiencies in all our operating cost lines, as well as the increase in other operating income, which benefited from the gain on the disposal of the Abraxane marketing rights.</p>
          <p>Core earnings per share in the quarter were $1.58. That's compared with $1.28 last year. This is a 20% increase at constant currency.</p>
          <p>It was a busy quarter in terms of news flow in the pipeline, and these are summarized in the press release. They include: Advisory Committee hearings on ONGLYZA and Seroquel XR; an approval for Symbicort in the U.S. for COPD, and a response on our Symbicort pediatric application; the Crestor filings in the U.S. and Canada based on the JUPITER trial; and a positive opinion on Iressa in Europe.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to our first quarter sales performance. For the avoidance of doubt, when I refer to sales growth rate, they will all be on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>We achieved sales growth of 7% in the first quarter. Sales in the U.S. were up 7%. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, Toprol-XL sales benefited from the market withdrawal of two generic competitors. So sales of Toprol-XL plus the authorized generic increased by $112 million. We strip out the Toprol-XL, the sales in the U.S. were up 3%, and that includes strong underlying growth for Crestor and Symbicort.</p>
          <p>Sales in the rest of the world were up 7%. In our established markets, sales in western Europe were up 2% as growth to Crestor, Seroquel and Symbicort more than offset the decline in Casodex sales resulting from generic competition.</p>
          <p>Sales in Japan were up 10%, chiefly on sales growth for Crestor and the oncology franchise. Crestor was the primary driver of the 14% increase in Australia for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets, sales were up 15%. More than one third of the increase was attributable to Crestor and Nexium. The balance was achieved across a broad range of product franchises. China again showed strong growth, with sales up 35%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our key brands, I'll begin with the star performer for the quarter, and that's Crestor. Worldwide sales of Crestor increased by 35%, to $969 million. In the U.S. and in our rest of world markets, Crestor is growing at four times the statin market growth rate.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., sales were up 35%. Market share of total prescriptions increased to 10.3% in March, and all the other important indicators are looking strong. We saw positive net switches from other statins, including generic simvastatin. Dynamic share is around 15%, and Crestor enjoys a 15% share of total prescriptions written by cardiologists.</p>
          <p>Sales for Crestor in the rest of the world also grew strongly, up 34%. Sales in western Europe were up 22%, where volume share is over 20% in France and Italy. Japan and Australia continue to perform very well. Sales in our emerging markets for Crestor were up 41%. In Mexico, Crestor just overtook Lipitor to become the market-leading statin by value and volume share. So a very strong quarter for Crestor.</p>
          <p>Next, I'll look at Nexium. Sales were up 2% in the quarter, to nearly $1.2 billion. Nexium sales in the U.S. were down 4%. Dispensed retail tablet volume increased by 3.6%, although changes in IMS mail order data reporting may be causing an overstatement of a couple of percentage points. But it's still a very good performance in the U.S. PPI market. As expected, average net selling prices were lower, by around 9% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Nexium sales in the rest of the world grew at double-digit rates. Sales in western Europe increased by 8% despite the 35% decline in Germany. Sales in emerging markets were up 19%, including good growth in China.</p>
          <p>Globally, Seroquel sales were up 11%, to $1.1 billion. Sales in the U.S. were up 14%, to $800 million. We've launched Seroquel XR for the bipolar depression and bipolar mania indications, and while still early days, prescription growth for XR is encouraging. Total prescriptions for the entire franchise, including Seroquel IR, increased by 3% in the U.S. in the quarter, with more than 80% of the increase coming from the XR formulation. In other markets, Seroquel sales were up 6%, to $325 million, despite a 68% decline in Canada due to generic competition, and on the strength of a 19% increase for Seroquel in western Europe.</p>
          <p>I'm sure by now you're all aware of the FDA Advisory Committee meeting on the MDD and GAD applications, and we look forward to having further discussions with the FDA regarding both sNDAs.</p>
          <p>It was another good quarter for Symbicort, where sales were up 24%, to $515 million. In the U.S., sales in the first quarter were $99 million, fueled by continued growth in asthma and the launch of the COPD indication. Symbicort's share of new prescriptions for fixed combination products in the U.S. increased to 12.8% in March, paced by a market share of patients new to combination therapy that is now over 20%. Sales in the rest of world were 13% ahead of the first quarter last year, to $416 million. Sales in western Europe were up 12%, and emerging market sales increased by 19%.</p>
          <p>The other item worth mentioning is Pulmicort. As you know, whilst we settled the patent litigation on Pulmicort Respules with Teva in the fourth quarter last year, the approximately three month's supply that they shipped into the market at the end of 2008 was permitted to be sold through to patients. The Teva product had a market share of around 52% in the first quarter, which reflects a lower pull-through than we'd expected. As a result, the impact on our Pulmicort ex-factory sales, which were down 37% in the first quarter, will likely persist through the second quarter.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the first quarter P&amp;L and the drivers of the growth in core operating profit. And I'll focus here on core margins and profit. The press release does, of course, contain the statutory numbers and a detailed reconciliation to our core measures. As with sales, when I refer to growth rates they will be on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>Core operating profit rose by 19% to $3.36 billion in the quarter. That's $525 million in constant currency. The sales increase, efficiencies in all the operating cost lines and the higher other income all contributed to this increase.</p>
          <p>Core gross margin at 82% of sales was a 90 basis point improvement over 2008 in constant currency terms. Principal contributors were lower Merck payments as a percent of sales, efficiency gains and favorable product mix partially offset by higher royalty payments.</p>
          <p>Core R&amp;D expenditures were unchanged in constant currency in the quarter. Although with the currency impact reported, expenditures were 17% lower. We continue to drive productivity and efficiencies in R&amp;D, which allows us to absorb increased activity related to the maturing pipeline.</p>
          <p>Core SG&amp;A expense was 5% higher than the first quarter last year. We continue to deliver efficiencies in our underlying SG&amp;A costs. But the phasing of certain items in SG&amp;A such as employee benefit costs and higher legal expenses are biased towards the first quarter this year. I still expect the combination of R&amp;D and the SG&amp;A to come in broadly flat in constant currency terms for the full year.</p>
          <p>Core other income for the first quarter was $293 million, $142 million higher than 2008, chiefly as a result of the Abraxane disposal, the April approval of the Nordic OTC product disposal by the Swedish Competition Authority. Those proceeds, some $220 million at current exchange rates, will be booked in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Reported core operating profit for the quarter was 43.6% of sales compared to 36% in the first quarter of 2008. But please note that 340 basis points of that improvement were related to currency. Of the 420 points of constant currency margin improvement, 190 basis points came from other operating income with the balance of 240 basis points coming from operating leverage. Thus the 7% increase in sales has resulted in a 19% increase in core operating profit.</p>
          <p>Turning to our productivity and synergy initiatives, there were $72 million in restructuring and synergy charges taken in the quarter. The program is on track as to costs incurred and benefits being realized.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to cash flow. Cash generated from operations increased by $190 million in the quarter, driven by strong underlying operational performance. This is offset by a phasing related increase in tax payments of $325 million resulting in a small reduction in net cash inflow from operating activities compared with the first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Net debt at $6.85 billion has decreased by a further $321 million since the year end. And that's even after paying the increased second interim dividend of $2.1 billion. As you know, there were no share repurchases in the quarter.</p>
          <p>I'll conclude my remarks with some comments on our full year guidance. In the context of the continued deterioration in the general world economy, we as a management team do remain cautious in our near term outlook for the pharma sector in general and for our business. And you'll have seen these concerns echoed in IMS's revised forecast for the global pharma sector for 2009.</p>
          <p>We've posted a good set of first quarter results and that's a reflection of excellent execution on all fronts. Key franchises such as Crestor, Symbicort, Seroquel and Nexium are performing well against the competition. And we're driving continued growth in the emerging markets and making steady progress in our business reshaping initiatives and exercising discipline in managing everyday costs.</p>
          <p>We're also mindful that the revenue growth rate in the quarter was somewhat flattered by an easier comparison against the first quarter '08 in terms of destocking as well as the unanticipated upside to Toprol-XL in the U.S. where we have limited visibility as to how long that may last.</p>
          <p>For the full year, our guidance for core EPS is unchanged. We continue to target core EPS in the range of $5.15 to $5.45. The other guidance I gave at the year end for gross margins, operating costs, other income, net finance expense and the tax rate still hold.</p>
          <p>Just to be clear, there are no currency related changes to our full year guidance. As a reminder, our core EPS guidance is based on the average exchange rates that prevailed during January 2009 when the targets were communicated. Despite volatility, the actual rates in the first quarter haven't given rise to any meaningful currency variance on core EPS versus our guidance basis.</p>
          <p>Going forward, this guidance takes no account of the likelihood that average exchange rates for the remainder of the year may differ materially from the January 2009 average. As usual, I point you to our currency sensitivity chart to help you flex your own estimates on the currency impact to sales and earnings.</p>
          <p>I think I'll wrap up my formal remarks here and turn the call back to the conference operator to begin the question and answer session.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have a question now from Tim Anderson of Sanford Bernstein. Thank you. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A few questions. On emerging markets, you talk about growth being 15% in constant exchange rate terms. What would it have been in reported terms and can you tell us what your top five products are in sales terms not in growth terms in these markets? On ONGLYZA, can you talk about the competitive positioning of this product versus Januvia? I'm wondering what the subtle differences are that will help you differentiate the product. And you've got AZD6140 data coming up. I'm wondering if you can talk about your level of excitement with that product. It doesn't seem like you mention it very often.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks very much for the questions, Tim. In terms of the emerging markets, I'll just get Ed to get that number for you. But in the meantime, on ONGLYZA, we're obviously pleased that the Ad Comm voted 10 to 2 that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that ONGLYZA doesn't cause an unacceptable excessive CV risk relative to comparators.</p>
          <p>So we're pleased with that. And we're obviously announced last week that the FDA has determined it needs a bit more time, so the PDUFA date's moved from 30th of April to end of July. We continue to work very closely with our partner BMS to support the review of ONGLYZA. New time then hasn't changed our view on the drug, which we believe can play an important role in addressing the diabetes market. We're not going to be sharing our sort of thinking, positioning and marketing and plans until the drug's approved.</p>
          <p>On Brilinta, obviously it's one of 10 drugs that we've currently got in Phase III, in registration. It's an important part of our development portfolio. We'd indicated that we expected to be able to share the headline results of that in the &#x2013; by mid-year, and that remains the timetable. And so obviously, we'd hope to be able to share the results during what's now the second quarter. But it's a -- clearly an important drug in what we see as a strengthening pipeline.</p>
          <p>Ed, did you want to just touch on the emerging markets' reported growth rate in &#x2013; stripping out &#x2013; or in actual terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It was 15% CER, as you mentioned. There was a minus 16% exchange headwind to that. So obviously, that's the currency difference between reported and CER for the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of the top five products in emerging markets, it's Nexium, Crestor, Seloken, Symbicort and Seroquel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. I think the other thing to add, too, is that those are the top five. Actually if you look at the total portfolio, it is less concentrated than western Europe and North American business. So there's a larger proportion of the sales that are represented by a broader set of product franchises.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okey-doke.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from Paul Mann of Morgan Stanley. Thank you. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just had a couple of questions. Your guidance is starting to look quite conservative. But clearly, there are a number of fairly significant unknowns. I'm guessing the most imminent is the court hearing on Pulmicort Respules. When might we get an update on that, and how might that affect your guidance, if it was to go in your favor or against you?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just thinking about the timing of SG&amp;A expenses, obviously your guidance is for flat combined SG&amp;A and R&amp;D in constant exchange rate terms. You include Q1 by 5%. Are there any specific sort of large quarters, or quiet quarters, we should think about going forwards?</p>
          <p>And then finally, just thinking about -- I know you've had a trial ongoing, head to head ONGLYZA versus Januvia. Could you say if it's clear when that trial may report? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Paul. Thanks very much. Let me deal with SG&amp;A, and then I'll talk about the Pulmicort situation, and Jonathan can update in terms of the head-to-head.</p>
          <p>No, SG&amp;A, our guidance remains that we expect R&amp;D and SG&amp;A together to be flat in constant currency rates. You're absolutely right, Paul, SG&amp;A was up a bit in the first quarter, as we mentioned in both the release and I mentioned again in my remarks. We've had a few essentially phasing costs in the G&amp;A area around employee benefits and some legal costs. But the run-rate for SG&amp;A, I don't think there are any particular seasonal issues that I'd draw to your attention. We've had obviously some of those phasing issues that smooth out for the year. So no particular seasonal picture that I would draw to your attention.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Pulmicort situation, there is a court hearing sort of underway during the course of this week. It's not yet concluded. As soon as it does, we'll obviously update the market with whatever the outcome. In terms of its impact on our guidance, we face a number of opportunities and some risks for the year. Those are reflected, including potential outcomes on Pulmicort, in the $0.30 guidance range that we've reconfirmed today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Paul, on the ONGLYZA question, I don't have a specific timeline around publication or first presentation for that. To some extent, it goes back to the question that Tim Anderson asked, around the &#x2013; rounding out the competitive commercial profile for ONGLYZA. And I think that's something that we'll look at once we get through the regulatory process. And as you know, that's ongoing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from Danny Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Thank you. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Three questions, if I may. The Toprol contribution in the quarter, you mentioned that the operating leverage at the core EBIT line was approximately 240 basis points. What proportion of that came from Toprol, if you're able to quantify that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you could just indicate the significant price increases you took in the first quarter, in particular as it relates to Arimidex and Crestor?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just coming back to the guidance, just trying to understand, given the favorable currency movement through the P&amp;L, can you maybe just talk through a little bit more &#x2013; obviously we've mentioned Pulmicort, but the other items that you're focused on, as to what would limit you taking up the lower end of the guidance range, given the strength of the performance in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks for those questions. If I start with the improvements in the operating &#x2013; core operating margin, at 420 and if you strip out the operating income effect, 190 at the 240 improvement on the sort of core operational items, the majority of that comes from the factors that I called out in my remarks and we put in the release, which is operational efficiencies coming through in our cost of goods sold, R&amp;D and underlying in our SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>And we've had a bit of a mix benefit in the margin side. But essentially this is the results of the efficiencies and the operating leverage from getting more sales through what's a increasingly efficient cost base. The Toprol effect will have had some impact, but really not of a significant quantum that I would call out.</p>
          <p>In terms of the pricing questions you posed, I think overall, we face a tough pricing environment across our global business. Price has not formed a key driver of the revenue growth in the quarter. It's essentially driven by share growth and some market growth in certain markets. In a few areas we've had some positive net price movement. We've also had some negative net price movement. I called out the decline in net price on Nexium.</p>
          <p>It's true that some positive price increases have flowed through and have driven some of the growth of Arimidex in the quarter in the U.S. If we look at Crestor that's not really been a contributor to the revenue growth on Crestor in the U.S. That's been a share and some market growth story. So those are the price movements.</p>
          <p>In terms of some broader perspective on earnings guidance, I think we've had a strong quarter. We're pleased with the execution really on all fronts in the business at this stage. I did mention in my remarks, but let me elaborate on them a little bit for you, that the first quarter performance benefited from a number of specific factors, the many upside for the quarter.  I talked about the benefit from Toprol-XL. We talked about the one-off gain obviously from the disposal of Abraxane. Just let me add a few others, which you'll probably have been able to sort of pull out. The tax rate, you'll have seen, was a little lower than our full-year guidance. And that's principally around timing and doesn't impact our tax rate for the year.</p>
          <p>We had from a year-on-year comparison a benefit due to the destocking in '08 relative to '09. And then I think relative to our views at the beginning of the year, we've perhaps seen slightly lower than expected sales of Teva's Pulmicort product. And I mentioned in my remarks that that &#x2013; we think that impact may sustain through into the second quarter. So a number of factors which gave us some positive upside in the first quarter and supplemented what I think was a strong quarter in terms of just underlying performance.</p>
          <p>If you look ahead though, as I mentioned, we do remain cautious on the outlook for the global economy and its impact on the pharma sector. I think our views have not really changed since we gave our guidance at the beginning of the year. In addition, there are some further uncertainties that we need to take into account for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>We don't know, as I mentioned, how long the Toprol-XL upside will last. Paul raised the question about the Pulmicort situation. I think I mentioned at the beginning of the year that it's possible we may get multi-source generics into the U.S. PPI market in the second half, impacting Nexium. And we've also obviously got the Casodex patent going off patent in the U.S. So that will also be impacting our run rate.</p>
          <p>And I think you'll also recall we mentioned the unwind of the fair value on the bonds, which we've had a little bit of that unwind; but potentially could have some further impact from that for the remainder of the year. So there are some uncertainties, very clearly some opportunities for the business as well. And we'll be looking to drive those.</p>
          <p>So those are the factors that flow into our guidance and why we've confirmed the 5.15 to 5.45 position that we took at the beginning of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. We now have a question from Kevin Wilson. Kevin, please, can you state your company name?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Kevin Wilson from Citi. I apologize in advance for these two questions because I kind of go over ground you already covered. But I just want to be sure that we're not missing anything in your thoughts about the underlying business. Given that I don't believe that you assumed the level of benefit you achieved from Toprol in this first quarter when you set your guidance back in January, can you confirm that there is no new negative individual item in the business that would lead you not to change guidance, or lead to bottom-end of guidance, which  makes sense at this time of the year? It is just that the business has to run a bit harder to do what you thought?</p>
          <p>And secondly, it was my impression from Bruno Angelici's comments back at the fiscal year results that the emerging markets were likely to slow in their growth from, I think, the 12% that we saw at the end of &#x2013; at that point. And here we have a 15% performance, which is impressive. Could you tell us whether you expect a slowdown from this double digit growth to a lower level? And what do you now think, the emerging markets may do better than you had previously thought, which causes another element on the positive side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. I think to your first question, there are no, I don't think, new risks that we envisage at this stage that we didn't envisage and think and plan for at the beginning of the year. And I touched on some of those just a moment ago.</p>
          <p>To your first part, which was our thinking on Toprol at the time we set our guidance, at that stage we recognized there was a possibility that we might be getting some upside from Toprol. But we've now had three months of that. But again, really no visibility on how long that might sustain. But no new significant risks or issues other than that that was factored into our thinking at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets, we got good growth for the quarter. And I think we've seen strong growth in many of our brands. We haven't seen across the markets a sort of discernible slowdown in terms of market development and growth. Although there are one or two markets we've seen some of that. But I think as we look into the remainder of the year, our caution I think remains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Kevin, just to make sure we get the numbers right, the growth for emerging markets for the full year was 16% CER.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it dropped one percentage point to 15% in this quarter, rather than, as you described it, an acceleration up from 12.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And we now have a question from Marietta Miemietz from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. My first question is on CytoFab. I was just wondering do you already have the data from the additional Phase II trial in house? Are you going to move that into Phase III, or could you actually even file on the Phase II data if it's very good?</p>
          <p>Second question on Nexium pricing pressure, you gave us the year-over-year pressure. But I was just wondering how the pricing pressure is actually developing sequentially. And in particular, you mentioned additional competition coming in in the second half of the year. And I was just wondering in terms of the dynamics, when would that actually have a negative effect on your pricing for Nexium, i.e. would that basically already be affecting prices now or would that actually then play into the negotiations you have later in the year?</p>
          <p>And then I just wanted to really push my luck on the guidance question. Would you say that the following is a fair comment? If Pulmicort Respules sales were to stay at the current levels and if you have at least one more quarter of Toprol-XL to yourself then basically given that there are no new negatives cropping up, you almost can't help but beat the current guidance. Is that a fair comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me deal with the third question and then Ed why don't you pick up and talk a bit about sort of Nexium pricing and the potential for multi-source generics and its impact on the class. And then Jonathan, if you want to pick up CytoFab.</p>
          <p>I'm not &#x2013; there's a whole variety of different scenarios that one could paint around pluses and minuses during the course of the year. I don't think it's &#x2013; I don't want to sort of hypothesize a particular one. I think I've laid out as we go forward in the year a good first quarter. We've got some opportunities ahead of us, some risks ahead of us back built into the guidance range. We look forward to updating you all at the second quarter. Ed, you want to pick up Nexium?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of price variances, we flagged them minus 9% in the quarter. Sequentially, of course, it was against a flat priced Q4 of last year. But that was an artifact of the phasing. That's why we pointed you to looking at the full year price effect last year, which I believe was low double digits.</p>
          <p>So in that sense it's not &#x2013; except the deterioration in price from our strategy of trying to maintain competitive formulary position, hasn't accelerated. It's just an artifact of that quarterly phasing in the year ago period.</p>
          <p>In terms of the second half of the year, it's the potential for multi-source competition in pantoprazole as well as the rest as there might be a generic lantoprazole that factors into our thinking that there's a second half for Nexium that we will &#x2013; just want to keep a close watching brief on. And that certainly could see it's -- manifest itself in contract negotiations, but also could have a volume effective too. As these products go generic, you do see a bit more of accelerated substitutions.</p>
          <p>So I wouldn't lay it down to strictly price. It's just that the market environment, when we are competing in that marketplace, we are a rival to the other brands in terms of the preferred brand position in what is otherwise a heavily influenced market for generics. Having more generics and less branded product to go after in those formulary wins and gaining market share is the factor that we'd be thinking about in terms of the second half dynamic in the PPI markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just clarify, if you compare the pricing in Q1 '09 with Q4 '08, how does that actually compare? Is the price down sort of mid single digits compared to Q4? Would that be a fair assumption? I'm just trying to reconcile, like all the year-over-year rates you've given us, to really see what's happening sequentially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The best thing I can point you to is our full-year guidance, which is that we still expect selling prices to decline year-on-year. But I think our guidance was probably not at the same rate that we saw in 2008. In terms of parsing that out to a sequential quarter, the best thing I'd do is give you that full-year effect, because it is difficult to follow on a quarter-to-quarter basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there was an 11% effect last year, Marietta. So that gives you some way at least of calibrating for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So -- I mean, . Just the other &#x2013; the impact in the second half, I think it's &#x2013; the primary factor we watch is volume. Clearly the formulary access &#x2013; the formulary discussions start to impact in the following year, in terms of the price for access.</p>
          <p>In terms of CytoFab, Jonathan, do you want to just -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No real change to the program there. We expect to have that study result in the first half of the year, which means in the second quarter. We haven't got it yet. But as usual, we tend to do a more comprehensive R&amp;D update at the mid-point of the year. And that's maybe where you should look for an answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. We now have a question from Naresh Shoen of ING. Thank you. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Naresh Shoen from ING. Three questions from me. Firstly, could you tell us how much the destocking benefit was on Crestor, Seroquel, Nexium and Arimidex?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you give us a bit more color on the launch of generic Seroquel in Canada? Did the competition's matter patent just end earlier than the U.S., or is there more to it than that?</p>
          <p>And finally, I appreciate the guidance has many moving parts within it, hence the fairly wide range. So maybe we should just take one of those components. If Toprol was to stay at the current level for the remainder of the year, what would be the uplift to the guidance range? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I can only really refer you back to my answer to the prior question, which is we have a range of factors. And that's built into the guidance. And so I think I probably can't elaborate further on that question. In terms of the generic competition for Seroquel in Canada, Jonathan, do you want to touch on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the questioner is absolutely right. It was just the fact the Canadian patent expired a little bit sooner than the IP in the rest of the world. So there's nothing unusual there, just the natural end to the intellectual property in the Canadian market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In terms of your destocking, we mentioned a year ago that we had something like a 200 million impact on destocking that impacted us in the first quarter across the U.S. business. And what we've seen this quarter is a much more normal pattern in terms of pull-through in &#x2013; through the value chain. And so that's the sort, and it's actually slightly a little under that. But that's the sort of year-on-year comparator. I'm not going to break it out by the individual brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the next question comes from Alexandra Hauber. Alexandra, can you give your &#x2013; state your company name, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Alexandra Hauber from JPMorgan. I have two questions. Just on the general cautious outlook for the pharmaceutical industry in the context of global economic conditions, can you just tell us what you are most worried about? Is it slowdown of everything, which requires out of pocket costs? Is it government actions tightening in sort of the later end of this year; as in we haven't seen it yet, but we may see it? Or is it just more wholesaler problems? So that's question number one.</p>
          <p>And question number two is on Seroquel XR, on the MAD (sic) [MDD] indication &#x2013; MAD/GAD indication (sic) [MDD/GAD indication]. Is there any timeline you can point us to? I know you're in discussion with FDA. It appeared from the briefing documents that the review of the pediatric data was an important step in June. Is there any timeline you can point us to, or is it just like, we have no idea when the FDA is going to move on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me &#x2013; just the first one is, I'm afraid I can't really give you a specific time line. We're obviously in discussion with the FDA to firm up timeframe. But the first &#x2013; having had the Ad Comm on MDD and GAD, we've not yet &#x2013; we now need the opportunity to discuss the CRL broadly with the FDA. And that will then start to define the timetable. So too early for us to update you on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Alexandra, don't forget as well that there is &#x2013; the FDA is scheduling an Ad Comm on the pediatric use of atypicals. And that's in June.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>June, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But is the understanding that we have to wait for that in any case before even further timelines start on the firming of the timeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we can give a specific comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I go back to your question about the broader macroeconomic environment and its impact on the pharmaceutical sector, I think that there's a couple of areas that we're watching and built into our thinking for this year. And you touched on both of them really. There's &#x2013; clearly a key feature of our business is and has been in particularly public payor markets like Europe, governmental involvement in pricing. We've seen some of that in the past, Germany, Italy, for example, on Nexium. That could be a feature and an increasing feature as we move forward. So that's one risk factor that we're watching.</p>
          <p>The second is that in those markets where there is a heavy out of pocket expenditure, and some of our emerging markets would fall into that category, we're cautious about the extent to which the economic conditions flow through into sort of personal disposable incomes and then into the sort of buying behavior on some of the medicines. So that's the second risk factor we're watching. As I mentioned, it's not been a discernible trend across our business for the first quarter, although we have seen some impacts in some of our markets.</p>
          <p>So I think overall, we remain recession resistant, I think we've said. But there's no reason to think that we're entirely recession-proof. I think you might have seen some of that echoed in IMS's latest update. So thanks, Alexandra.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I wonder if you could discuss the potential impact from the supply shortage of Par Pharmaceuticals' metoprolol ER  product in the second quarter, if this may result in even more favorable impact on Toprol sales for the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And my last question, if you can confirm that the PLATO will be released as a late-breaking trial at the European Society of Cardiology? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the &#x2013; just dealing with your second one, in terms of PLATO, we'd certainly like to be able to reach the ESC in August. So that's certainly in our planning and thinking at this stage. Do you want to pick up the first question, Ed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we had to ramp up our production, both on the branded product as well as the supply that we provide to Par, as part of the <mark type="inaudible" /> and we've been working on both of those levers, to try to get product into the market. You might see in sporadic regions one supply &#x2013; in a particular region rather than the other because the wholesaler is trying to allocate what were tight stocks. But I think the bottom line is, we're looking to serve both the brand and the authorized generic with the increased supply to satisfy patient needs. And there's no &#x2013; I wouldn't say there's any differential gearing to the outlook going forward. We're trying to supply both arms of the metoprolol market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. I've got a question about the guidance. I was wondering, Simon, if you could update us on your thoughts on acquisition policy? I think you've talked recently about smaller deals. But David was recently quoted as expressing interest in 3 to 5 billion euro size deals. I was just wondering if that actually marks any kind of change in thinking. So an update on where you are on thoughts on acquisition?</p>
          <p>Similarly, I was just wondering if you could fill us on how you're thinking about the need to buy-in for the R&amp;D versus buying in in-market products as the patent expiration of Seroquel approaches. Are you actually comfortable to see your top line drop for a period before the pipeline comes through or do you need to actually &#x2013; feel that you actually need to sustain revenues to justify an ongoing cost base?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just on the outsourcing of manufacturing, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on the progress of how much your product volume now comes from third parties and if you had to try and split out fixed versus variable costs therefore in your cost of goods lines, where that is now and where you'd expect it to be in 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much indeed. Well, let's start with the acquisition policy and strategy. And to some extent that links really into your second question. Our strategy as a business is an R&amp;D driven integrated pharma business. We've got three key planks of that driving the top line of our marketed product, reshaping our cost base for long term competitiveness and investing in in house and, indeed, externalized R&amp;D to strengthen our pipeline. And I think we're making good progress on all three planks of that strategy. And you've seen, I think, some of that coming through in the results in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So within that strategy a central focus for us in terms of acquisition and externalization is bringing in technology and products that complement our therapeutic and disease areas. And that remains a strong focus for us. And that might be sort of early stage or in some cases it could be later stage products and indeed potentially marketed products where they complement our market positions.</p>
          <p>If there are opportunities to move from individual small products, in licensing deals numbered in tens and hundreds of millions of dollars up to larger acquisitions &#x2013; the sort of scale that you mentioned, if we see value creating opportunities to do that, we would take them into our radar and screen them to see how they fit with the market and pipeline strategy. So I don't think there's a significant change there in terms of strategy.</p>
          <p>To your question of what's the driving objective for the acquisition of product to marketed or R&amp;D to marketed product, it's very simple. It's to create value, which means looking at investing to get a return. We're not investing and pursuing acquisitions to fill any particular revenue target in any particular year. So that's what guides the acquisition strategy.</p>
          <p>Turning to your final question on outsourcing, the strategy really is to outsource all of our API over time, within the next five to 10 years; ideally towards the five year timeframe. And I think the current percentage &#x2013; I think we're moving up into more than half, I think, now of API. About 60% I think is now outsourced. And some of the deals that we're currently working on we'll continue to raise that level up. So we're well on track with that strategy.</p>
          <p>And to your question, that obviously does both improve the absolute cost levels but also the flexibility of our cost base, and improving the variability of our cost base is a very important part of the strategy.</p>
          <p>So thanks, Graham, for the question.</p>

          <p>Secondly, what is the timing of the filing of ZACTIMA? I believe the company had said it would be a second quarter event. Is that still on track?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, you mentioned that we will get the top line PLATO results in the second quarter. Could you tell us whether the last patient visit has occurred? And has the data been locked and is it now being analyzed? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Well, on PLATO, as I said, we would expect to share the top line <mark type="inaudible" /> in the second quarter. I can't give you exactly where we are in the process, but we're firmly on track for that timeframe. Jonathan, on ZACTIMA, do you want to -</p>

          <p>Yes, no change to the plan. We're on track for the guidance, which was to do a filing in the second quarter.</p>

          <p>Yes. And the Pulmicort hearing, the outcome of that, if we're successful, we would hope that that would indeed keep an injunction in place for us as we go forward. But we'll update the market as we hear the outcome of that trial.</p>

          <p>Okay. Well, look. Thanks very much indeed. And thanks for joining us on the call this afternoon. Just to close, it's been a strong first quarter, a good set of results posted. We've driven our key product franchises and growth in all our regions and I think continue to deliver improvements in operating efficiency.</p>
          <p>As I said on the call, we are cautious in our outlook for the year in the context of difficult global economic conditions. And we've confirmed our guidance of core EPS for the full year. So with that, I'll bid you all a very good day.</p>
