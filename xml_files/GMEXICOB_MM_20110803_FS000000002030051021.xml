      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator.</p>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today in Grupo M&#xE9;xico's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.</p>
          <p>Joining me today are Mr. Rogelio Velez, CEO of Grupo Ferrocarril Mexicano; Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper, Jorge Pulido, Head of Investor Relations; and other executives of the company.</p>
          <p>On today's conference call, I will first briefly comment on the economic environment of this quarter and the main issues impacting the company's profitability. Then, I will comment on our Mining Division's most relevant results, to pass on the call to Rogelio, who will explain the financial results of our Transportation Division.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, metal prices degraded, as a result of some industry specific issues, such as production disruptions and shortages due to strikes, weather conditions and problems with energy supply. Metal volatility was also the result of the overall macro-economic environment, which has brought uncertainty to all markets and, hence, is delaying the recovery of a metal demand.</p>
          <p>I will not get into much detail, but the most important issues are the U.S. debt ceiling; the European debt crisis, which affects the confidence of investors in the euro and, hence, the economic stability of the region; the Chinese and other emerging economies are facing inflationary pressures, which may result in a slowdown to their economies; the after effects of the Japanese disaster and its economy, which is the third largest economy of the world and one of the top copper consumers.</p>
          <p>We believe these worldwide macro concerns will influence the demand for metals during the next 12 months and will keep volatility in the metal prices. However, we maintain a positive copper outlook. On the demand side, CRU estimated a 3.4% growth during the second quarter 2011 and the demand growth was not matched by new supply. New copper production grew by 1.4%, less than half of the required growth to balance the market.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, CRU estimated a market deficit 200,000 tons for the second quarter. The average copper price for the second quarter was $4.15, 30% above the $3.19 recorded in the same quarter of 2010 and 5% lower than the first quarter of 2011. For the remainder of 2011, we believe the market fundamentals for copper will improve, as we expect to have higher Asian demand coming from Japan and China.</p>
          <p>On the other side, supply will continue to be tight due to strikes, extreme weather conditions and lower ore grades among others.</p>
          <p>Regarding the molybdenum, which as you may know, is our main byproduct. During the second quarter, it represented 7% of our Mining Division sales. Prices averaged, in the second quarter '11, $16.50 per pound, which is 9% above it's average price in 2010. We're currently seeing a soft recovery in molybdenum consumption. For the year 2011, we are expecting a relatively balanced market for this metal, with better prices in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Grupo M&#xE9;xico's financial highlights,. We're happy to report that in the second quarter 2011, our total consolidated revenues were a record high of $2.7 billion, an increase of 39% year-over-year. Net sales for the first half of the year were approximately $2 billion, an increase of 32% year-over-year. This increase was mainly due to higher metal prices and higher copper sales volumes, as a result of the production at our Buenavista mine, which has been operating at full capacity since last April.</p>
          <p>Our Transportation Division also increased revenues by 15%. As copper fundamental remain one of the most solid in the entire commodity sector, we anticipate that the good results will continue in 2011. Cost of sales for the second quarter was nearly $1.3 billion, an increase of 22% on a year-over-year basis and nearly 1% lower than the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales in the first half was $2.6 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year. This cost increase of $230 million is mainly explained by higher diesel prices, $51 million; power, $35 million; increase in the purchase of concentrates that rise mainly from the maintenance of the smelter in Hayden, $50 million; and the maintenance costs, $24 million. It was also affected by the reincorporation of Buenavista mine.</p>
          <p>The company will continuing with its efforts of reducing costs, improve productivity and maintain consumption and expense discipline, with the goal of strengthening our position as one of the world's leading copper producers.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the second quarter rose nearly $1.4 billion, with an EBITDA margin of 51%. This figure represents a significant improvement of 59% year-over-year, out of which $1 billion came from Southern Copper, with a margin of 60% of sales, an increase of 30% over the first quarter.</p>
          <p>EBITDA for Asarco reached $186 million, equivalent to 38% of sales. EBITDA for the Transportation Division reached $128 million, equivalent to 30% of sales. EBITDA in the first half was $2.5 billion an increase of 43% year-over-year, out of which $1.9 billion came from Southern Copper, $407 million from Asarco and $236 million from ITM.</p>
          <p>Net income in the second quarter was $657 million, a significant increase of 103% year-on-year and 24% higher quarter-over-quarter. Net income accumulated in the first half was nearly $1.2 billion, an increase of 70% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2011, total CapEx amounted to $284 million, of which $134 was spent in the Mining Division, $148 in the Transportation Division, and the balance in the Infrastructure Division. Capital expenditures in the Mining Division have been lowered because of the temporary suspension of our T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a SX/EW plant in Peru.</p>
          <p>As a result of the solid performance in 2011, we will continue with our mine expansions, particularly in the Buenavista mine, where we expect to increase annual production from 180,000 tons to 450,000 tons of copper, an increase of 150%, by 2015.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, in Southern Copper Conference Call yesterday, the company 2011 guidance for CapEx was revised to $700 million, and for Asarco, it remained $164 million, and we're further discussing this topic.</p>
          <p>In our Transportation Division, the investments go as planned, with acquisition of locomotives, the continuous expansion of sitings and improvement of safety measures. The CapEx budget for the Railroad Division in 2011 will be nearly $400 million, mainly for the acquisition of 58 new locomotives, out of which 44 will go to Ferromex and 14 to Ferrosur. 44 locomotives were delivered between April and July.</p>
          <p>The total consolidated debt at June 30 amounted to $4 billion, with a cash balance of $2.6 billion. Then the company's net debt stands at $1.5 billion. The company maintained a comfortable profitability and long-term debt amortization schedule, to keep with an ample financial flexibility going forward. Our current cash position, with our cash generation capability, will support our operational needs and CapEx and allow us to have ample room to explore additional value-generation opportunities as they arise.</p>
          <p>With respect to dividends on May 5, we paid a dividend of $0.40 pesos per share outstanding, which was equivalent to $260 million. For the second quarter of 2011, the company's board approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.45 pesos per share outstanding, which will be paid in cash on August 19, and represents a disbursement of approximately $300 million.</p>
          <p>Under our repurchase program of Grupo M&#xE9;xico, we bought back 7,695,000 shares during the second quarter of 2011 and 4.6 million shares of Southern Copper at a cost of $128 million.</p>
          <p>In regards to molybdenum, in 2011, in the second quarter, our production increased 5.3% to 4,502 tons, compared to 4,274 tons in the first quarter of 2011, due to higher production of La Caridad and Toquepala mines, which was partially offset by lower production at the Cuajone operation. When compared to the 2010 second quarter production, it decreased by 18.3% or 1,000 tons. Please keep in mind that 2010 was a molybdenum record year and that mine plans vary from year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Silver mine production increased by 16.4% quarter-over-quarter to 3.9 million ounces from 3.3 million ounces in the first quarter of 2011. These increases were partially the result of higher production in the Buenavista mine and of the Charcas and Santa Eulalia mines, which partially restored silver production.</p>
          <p>AMC's capital expenditures in the first half of 2011 were $224 million, an increase of 28% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Buenavista mine projects, the crushing, conveying and spreading systems for the SX/EW production projects are moving forward. Construction of the crusher building and earthwork for the conveyor platforms is advancing as scheduled. Overland conveyor and spreader installations will begin in August. Regarding the SX/EW three and four plants at the Buenavista mine, detailed engineering and acquisition of major equipment continues as planned.</p>
          <p>I will now discuss the main developments of our Mining Division from a medical mining company point of view, which comprises our subsidiaries Southern Copper and Asarco, as you know. AMC's mined copper production in second quarter 2011 increased 15% to 192,000 tons compared to 167,000 tons in the second quarter of 2010. This increase was mainly the result of 45,587 tons of copper produced at our Buenavista mine. That operated at full capacity since April.</p>
          <p>The higher production in Buenavista was partially offset by expected lower production at our Peruvian La Caridad and Asarco operations. Comparing quarter-over-quarter, we had an increase in production of 25,325 tons or 15%. Asarco's mined copper production in the first half of 2011 decreased 15.6% to 89,000 tons compared to 103,000 in the first half 2010. This decrease was mainly due to less production because of expected lower ore grades at Mission and Ray.</p>
          <p>For the second half of 2011, we expect an increase in ore grades at the Cuajone, Ray and Mission mines, which will partially offset the lower production of the first half, which was due to the expected lower ore grades, as I mentioned. Rods, cathodes and anodes production increased by 62.7%, 27% and 15% respectively in the second quarter, compared to the same period 2010. Rod production increased due to higher demand, allowing the company to gain copper premiums for their spot prices.</p>
          <p>The company has selected an engineering procurement contract and that is our EPC contractor for the SX/EW facility that will produce 88,000 tons of copper per year. We expected a start-up date in the second quarter 2013. The 2,000 tons per year of molybdenum <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:40) but the concentrator is also in that engineering equipment purchasing stage under the EPC contract.</p>
          <p>The new concentrator, with a milling capacity of 100,000 tons per day, is in process as scheduled. An EPC contract has been signed and flow sheet has been established. The company has received several supply proposals for main equipment, which are being evaluated. As indicated before, the new concentrator will have an estimated capacity of 188,000 tons of copper and 2,600 tons of molybdenum per year, with expected start-up date in 2015. The Pilares mine site, close to the La Caridad mine is being evaluated.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, 16,545 meters of drilling have been made, access roads developed and metallurgic testing and preliminary mining plans have been done.</p>
          <p>On the consolidated AMC operating cost per pound of copper, i.e. the cash cost, including the benefit of byproducts was $0.70 per pound in the second quarter of 2011. This compares to $0.657 cents per pound in the second quarter of '10. The increase is principally explained due to an increased stripping at the Asarco mines, higher fuel and energy costs an 18% higher copper production at Southern Copper.</p>
          <p>Some of these costs increases were partially offset by major product benefits. However, AMC second quarter operating cash costs per pound of copper produced before byproduct rates was $1.80 per pound. This cash cost compares to $1.87 per pound for the first quarter of 2011; this is a 4% reduction quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>The positive production increase from our Buenavista operation absorbed cost inflation coming from higher energy costs, as well as exchange rate appreciations. Considering the lower production cost of the Buenavista operation, we expect cash cost for byproduct credits to decrease in the second half 2011.</p>
          <p>Finally, I will add at this dimension as part of the new era in the development of our Buenavista mine, we signed on June 6, with the Confederation of Mexican Workers, which was &#x2013; that was a collective bargaining agreement for the Buenavista mine. CTM now represents approximately 800 workers in this mine. The company expects to work together with its employees and CTM to develop the Buenavista property to its full potential.</p>
          <p>With this, I will now turn the call to Rogelio Velez, who will discuss the main financial highlights of the Transportation Division. Rogelio, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Daniel, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Today, I will talk about the main developments during the second quarter and first half of 2011 for our Transport Division, represented by the holding company in Infraestructura y Transportes Mexico, ITM and it's principal subsidiaries Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, Ferromex and Ferrosur, which now is consolidated in ITM numbers.</p>
          <p>ITM load volumes transported during the first half of this year measured in net tons-kilometers were 25.6 billion, compared to 25.9 billion in 2010, representing a slight reduction of 1%. These volumes were mainly affected by two important factors, crop damages by freezes in the Northwestern states of Sonora and Sinaloa and the opening of the new Corona Beer Factory at the border for exports to the United States. These two factors had a negative effect in tons-kilometers of 6.5 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Ferromex's load volumes during the first half of this year were 22 billion net ton kilometers, compared to 22.4 during the first half of 2010, a reduction of 1.8%, affected by the same factors noted earlier.</p>
          <p>In terms of cars transported, Ferromex moved 419,000 carloads in the first half of the year, compared to 402,000 a year ago, an increase of 4.1%. The main increases were in the Industrial segment with 28% more carloads, the Mineral segment with 22% and Intermodal with 21% more containers transported.</p>
          <p>Ferrosur's load volumes during the first half of this year were 3.6 billion net tons-kilometers, compared to 3.5 billion in 2010, representing an increase of 2.2%. In terms of railcars transported in the first half of the year, Ferrosur moved 141,000 carloads, compared to a 132,000 a significant increase of 6.9%.</p>
          <p>The best results were achieved in metals, with 34% more carloads, industrial products with an increase of 21% and automotive with 14% more carloads than in 2010. ITM guidance for load volumes in 2011 has been revised to 54.1 billion net tons-kilometers, which will result in a year-on-year increase of 3.8%.</p>
          <p>ITM's net sales for the first half of this year were $806 million, a 15% increase, compared with the same period in 2010. Main increases were seen in Intermodal, rising by 40%, energy 30%, minerals 27% and metals 26%.</p>
          <p>Ferromex's net sales for the first half of this year were $645 million, an increase of 14% above the $569 million in the same period of 2010, a significant improvement considering the losses from the northwestern crops.</p>
          <p>Ferrosur's net sales for the first half of this year posted, again, record figures. Sales were $157 million an increase of 17% above the $134 million in the same period 2010.</p>
          <p>ITM's operating cost for the first half 2011 was $549 million an increase of 21%; this increase is mainly attributable diesel peso price growth of 11% over the last 12 months, an increases in labor, locomotive maintenance and leasing.</p>
          <p>ITM's EBITDA in the second quarter of 2011 was $128 million increasing 4% year-on-year. For the first half of this year EBITDA was nearly $236 million, an increase of 1% and we had an EBITDA margin of 29%.</p>
          <p>Ferromex's EBITDA in the second quarter of 2011 was $96 million, a decrease of 8%, compared to the $104 million in 2010, in the second quarter of 2010, but 15% above the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Ferrosur's EBITDA in the second quarter of 2011 was $23 million, an increase of 30% above the $18 million in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>ITM's net income in the second quarter of 2011 was nearly $53 million, an increase of 6% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures in the Transport Division during the first half of the year, amounted to nearly $175 million, of which $163 million were spent by Ferromex and $12 million by Ferrosur. This amount reflects the purchase of 44 new locomotives, which have been already received in Ferromex. Investments were also used for the construction and expansion of sitings and infrastructure improvements.</p>
          <p>Our 2011 guidance for capital investments is nearly $400 million, the highest in its history, of which Ferromex will invest $330 million and Ferrosur $66 million. In anticipation of a rebound in every quarter of production, Ferromex is also investing $56.5 million in 775 new high-capacity hopper cars, which delivery has already started and will continue through October. The cars are being incorporated into the Ferromex fleet to help transport this year's wheat corn and soybean harvest.</p>
          <p>I will now return the call to Mr. Daniel Mu&#xF1;iz.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rogelio. Thank you for the comments.</p>
          <p>I guess before passing on to the Q&amp;A session, I'd like to mention with respect to Grupo Aeroportuario del Pac&#xED;fico investment that we have, as indicated in their earnings report, we considered that any execution that exceeded tender offers, against the interest of GAP's minority shareholders and contrary to the Mexican Securities Market Law.</p>
          <p>We believe that the tender offer is valid and in accordance with law and it has come to Grupo M&#xE9;xico's attention that the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission has ruled that article 10 of Grupo Aeroportuario's Bylaws providing for the 10% ownership limitation is inconsistent with the law and should be modified, as we pointed out in our earnings report.</p>
          <p>But we are happy to answer any questions that you may have in the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Operator, if you will now open up please the forum for questions and answers.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, Daniel, and good morning, everybody. First question is can you give us an update from the Grupo M&#xE9;xico perspective, where we do we stand in the Americas Mining operation transaction with Asarco and Southern Copper? Why is it taking too long, any comment will be appreciated?</p>
          <p>Second is the GAP proposal, what I understand is that even if you acquired 100% of the Class B shares, you won't have the control over the company. So, what is the end game there from Grupo M&#xE9;xico's perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Carlos, thank you very much for your questions.</p>
          <p>Let me start off with the merger of Southern Copper and Asarco. Well, and I think that and I am very positive from Grupo M&#xE9;xico's perspective and from being the owner as well of 80% of Southern Copper. And why it has taken so long?  The reason it is taking so long is we've conducted extensive due diligence. As you know, minority shareholders of Southern Copper has to be represented or had to be represented by a special independent committee, which have retained Goldman Sachs as their financial advisors, Hatch as their mining advisors and Wachtell as their legal advisors in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So they've conducted extensive due diligence, not only of Southern Copper but also, I mean, I'm sorry, not only of Asarco but also Southern Copper. Given the nature of the structure that we have proposed, which is a share-exchange with Southern Copper in order to have Americas Mining Company being the company listed in the New York Stock Exchange and NYMEX exchanges and having Americas Mining owning 100% of Southern Copper. So the process has been, I agree with you, a little bit lengthy, but we feel very positive with the results of the process and the process and due diligence have concluded.</p>
          <p>We've agreed on the structure, we've agreed on pretty much the projections, the costs, the price decks, et cetera. We are just in the very final stage of trying to get to a place where valuation meets those companies; that's where we are, Carlos, and that's at this point. So I think, just in terms of timing, we expect to come back to you guys with a definition in the &#x2013; definitely in the following quarter. I think it shouldn't take us more than one month or so. But, well, it depends on our coming meetings.</p>
          <p>Going back to Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico, Carlos, let me just mention that, yes, you're right, there are two classes of shares, as you pointed out, and you have the B and double Bs. And the ones that are listed and trading in the Mexican and U.S. market are only the shares that, I mean, <mark type="ph" /> are able to be (25:37) combined in the stock exchange.</p>
          <p>We own 23.2% as of July 27 of the Grupo Aeroportuario's outstanding shares and that is all shares, including the 15% that are not listed. And it is the fact that, under Mexican law, you are required when you have an intention to pass the 30% threshold, to launch a tender offer. And that's what we've done to comply with the law. And that requirement is a 100% and that includes the controlling shares of the other class of shares, if you like, in the tender. So we are in the process of launching that tender, although as you probably know, we have not yet been authorized by the Comisi&#xF3;n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores. Does that answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure, but, you won't, exactly, even if you get 100% of the class B shares, you won't have the control of GAP, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not &#x2013; I mean, no, in order to get the 100% shares &#x2013; look, the B shares are the ones that trades. When the company was privatized the two classes of shares were created to give the operator and the controlling shareholders some particular rights that they currently have under the bylaws. Grupo M&#xE9;xico's idea, at this point, is not to take control or not to have to operate the company, we're happy the way the company is operated. And, I mean, I would think that they're doing a job, we like the asset, we like the industry and that's why we're participating. We are launching the 100% tender offer because that's a legal requirement under Mexican law and we're happy to do that.</p>
          <p>Although it seems like, I mean, that not everybody agrees and only the controlling shareholders and Grupo Aeroportuario have requested legally that we are not authorized to launch this tender offer. We think that that just jeopardizes minority shareholders position, but we're complying with the law and we would like the asset and we want to increase our participation and that's what we've told, not only the Comisi&#xF3;n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores, but also you guys.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning, good afternoon everyone. I have two questions, the first one, Daniel, is related to Asarco. If you could comment a little bit on how you are looking at the operation especially on the cost side, as we saw some cost increase in the quarter? If you believe that the cost should continue to be at this level over the last few quarters? And the second question is related to ITM, basically just wanted to have an update on how you see the potential IPO process of your Railroad business?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, let me start off with real quick data on the IPO process. I mean, this is a process that, as we've mentioned, I mean, we were authorized to merge Ferromex and Ferrosur, we're working to achieve that. We do have two different partners in our Transportation Division, as you know, United Pacific and the Carso Group or the Sinca Inbursa.</p>
          <p>And we &#x2013; in order to take more strategic definitive steps here, we need to all be in the same page and first to be able to merge Ferrosur and Ferromex. So that is, I mean, that's &#x2013; and our results have been proved. This was &#x2013; it was a very complex quarter. We had a great quarter for Ferrosur but at the same time we keep on working on the strategy and see how we can move forward. So, unfortunately, Felipe, I don't have any news to break here, but we're working on that. We think it makes sense, at least to focus on the merger and then to try to see what the right timing and what's the views of our partners in listing the companies?</p>
          <p>Going back to Asarco I think I like Oscar Gonzalez, who is our CFO of Asarco to explain a little bit on the cost side what's happening there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, Felipe there's two things, as was mentioned before. There's some costs related to diesel, to some steel materials, repair materials that is a smaller part, in this case. The other big event that happened in the quarter, although it backs to the first quarter, is we had a shutdown at our Hayden Smelter; it was a 25 day-shutdown and that affected our production of our cathodes and rod at our Amarillo facility in the second quarter. And we had in order to meet the needs of our customers, we had to buy some cathode in the market and that affected the cost of the period. So that is a one-time event for this year. And the other the diesel and the materials are still affecting us, although some of those are going down with the price of commodities.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Leonardo Correa with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. Thank you very much, good morning. My first question is regarding still, sorry to insist on the topic, on the AMC &#x2013; the SCC, and Asarco merger under AMC. Just to get sense on why maybe this could be delayed.</p>
          <p>Would the cancellation, would the potential cancellation of T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a project, would that impact the exchange ratio that was initially proposed? So the bottom line to my question is regarding all this, given that we have all this uncertainty regarding the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a project, would that potential cancellation be impacting the share exchange ratio that was initially proposed?  That's my first question. And how are the parties dealing with that issue?</p>
          <p>My second question is regarding the outlook for the mining industry in Peru, I mean, we heard Southern Copper's comment. But just to get maybe more comments from you on taxation under Humala, it seems that outcomes could be bit better than what maybe the market was pricing in some weeks ago. So just to get any insights on how conversations have been evolving and potential timing of when we can have a definition on taxation?  Those are my two questions. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leonardo. Let me start off with the share exchange ratio vis-&#xE0;-vis T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a and, of course, it does. I mean, let me just say first what our &#x2013; I mean, we feel positive with our T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a project. We think now that the new government has taken office that we are going &#x2013; we start our efforts because we may think that it's a very, I mean, environmental safe, they complied 100% with the regulations, et cetera.</p>
          <p>We're very confident that we are going to be able to start this project, which will bring a lot of benefits to Peru and to the local communities. Of course, I mean, the share exchange ratio we're swapping, we're exchanging shares of Asarco or, I mean, really of Americas Mining Company, who owns Asarco and Southern Copper for Southern Copper. So, any valuation changes that you make will affect a proposed exchange ratio, if you will.</p>
          <p>But I mean, in the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a project, once you do our projections or evaluation by <mark type="ph" /> several ministers (33:19), and you do a DCF and you discount the project, you would only affect the evaluation of Southern Copper in moving forward a little bit with a comp value of money and the cash flow that you expect from T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a. Of course, it has been delayed and that has affected a bit on the timing side because we never anticipated to have this amount of delays that we had in starting the project on the construction of T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a.</p>
          <p>But those are very minimal. I guess what I am saying is, I mean, there's a lot broader aspects to discuss when we talk about how much Asarco, vis-&#xE0;-vis and Southern Copper are evaluated, and that's really the discussions that we're having. And in order to have those discussions at a very solid and very educated way, that's why we've taken so much and that's why we've invested a lot of time and efforts from both sides in due diligence.</p>
          <p>And, I mean, I don't know going back to taxation and the new government, I mean, I guess, we do have the same views as Southern Copper expressed yesterday. We are very positive. We feel confident that we are going to be able to work out things. And I don't know if Raul Jacob, are you still on the line? If you can, please, add here.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, Leonardo, and good morning to everyone. Well, basically, what we are discussing with the government is how to impose a new taxation, which is their desire that does not affect the mining industry competitiveness, internationally speaking, in Peru, as well as being reasonable in terms of how to charge these taxes. The timeframe for making a decision on this, it's open, in the sense that we want to talk about this. This is a very technical discussion and it has to be done through the necessary time whatever it is. However, the new Cabinet has to present to Congress in about 30 days from now and that will be a possible time for having some news on this matter. For now, it's just a technical discussion with the government officials and we're expecting this to maintain the mining industry competitiveness for Peru.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the call. I have a couple of questions. First, on the Railway business, if you could give us some guidance in terms what's the sustainable growth rate for the next few years? And how much CapEx would be required for this? And if possible also on the railway, how the Pemex contracts are impacting margins and what's the outlook for them?</p>
          <p>And then I would also, if possible, like to discuss CapEx for 2011, as Southern Copper said yesterday they were revising downward. So I would also want to see from Grupo M&#xE9;xico's perspective, what's likely to be CapEx for 2011?  And if you could detail the main projects? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you, Rodrigo. Thank you for your questions. I think I'm having the benefit of having Rogelio Velez available with us in the call. Rogelio, if you can please start off with the Transportation Division growth rate in CapEx. And I'll complete on the core Grupo's CapEx, if you like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, Rodrigo. Well, we think that in terms of growth, we think that we should be growing between 1.0 point and 1.5 points higher than the Mexican economy. It should be between 4.5% and 6% in the next five years. And we have a lot of opportunities still with Pemex.</p>
          <p>Your question was about Pemex, can you repeat that question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I mean, how the margins of Pemex compares to the overall margins of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:45) business? Like if you get more volumes with them, do you think it's possible to improve margins further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, the margins with Pemex are very healthy and it's basically because it's a lot of volume. And because it's quite simple traffics to manage. We have trains, unit trains that are from 30 to 40 cars every day, which give us a lots of efficiency opportunities. And also the transportation links is also very long; it's usually between 800 and 900 kilometers, which is also very good a chance of having a very efficient operation.</p>
          <p>Basically, the 14 locomotives that we are receiving for Ferrosur in the month of September are going to be used for this new traffics. We should be starting a new traffic from Tula to Pajaritos that we planned in the month of September also of fuel oil. And about your CapEx question, this year with $330 million is the highest ever, $330 million, it represents about 24%, 25% of total revenues in Ferromex. A more adequate level in the coming year should be between 15% and 17% of total revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to add from a Grupo M&#xE9;xico perspective, Rodrigo, there's, I mean, Southern Copper, yes, it revised to $700 million for this year. Asarco we're maintaining at $164 million; that gives you a total of $864 million for our whole Mining Division. And then Ferromex, Rogelio just pointed out, Ferrosur $66 million, which gives a little bit less than $400 million, that's $399 million for IPM for 2011.</p>
          <p>If you add to that $17 million to our Infrastructure Division that gives a total of $1,280 million for the whole group that's our revised CapEx budget for the remaining of 2011, I mean, for the full-year 2011 results six months ahead of us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everybody. My first question is related to copper production. If you could comment a little bit on the copper production in the month of July, have you've already seen higher grades in Cuajone and also at Asarco mines? And also if you could comment on Buenavista production in July, as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, of course, I mean, July numbers are not part of this report. But Raul, can you give some color, just as to what we're seeing from the ground there at operations? <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:00)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding production we're expecting the Cuajone mine increasing ore grade to be impacting our production levels at the end of this quarter and at the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So far for July, we haven't had any important change in our production trend. Basically, it's keeping the same profile that we're seeing for the second quarter. But as I said on the Cuajone project, we're expecting an increase in production closer to the fourth quarter, rather than at the beginning of the third one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just very two quick questions here. On the hedging policy, ask you could comment a little bit of what you're expecting for Asarco in the second half of the year? You are maintaining what you showed in the first quarter, similar to what you posted for Southern Copper?</p>
          <p>And just a follow-up on the new tax measures in Peru and the new discussions. From the start-up of the discussions with the government, what do you think they will follow in terms of a reference like the Chilean example experience? Or what do you think will be the benchmark?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you, <mark type="ph" /> Rodrigo (sic) [Marcos] (42:23). Let me start off with the hedging, I mean, and I'll let Raul conclude his initial comments on the taxation.</p>
          <p>I mean, regarding hedging, we've not &#x2013; first thing is we've not hedged anything whatsoever apart from what we disclosed in the past. We haven't done any hedging, that is, in this quarter. So not for Asarco, not from Southern Copper.</p>
          <p>The way we view hedging and the strategy has been to do it on a, I mean, opportunistic, if you like, manner, given the stocks, the price, the price movements, the volatility that we're seeing, the amount that our board feels that we ought to hedge. As you know, we currently have, for the remainder of the year, swaps of 35% of AMC's, American Mining Company's total production, and zero cost collars, 35%.</p>
          <p>And so we have not increased our hedge position. We've seen an important price movement in the couple of weeks or the last three to four weeks. We have not increased our hedging policy there. We just had a board, and at least at these levels, we feel comfortable for the remaining of 2011, we are where we feel are the right level of hedges should be. So we have not included that.</p>
          <p>Raul, do you want to touch on the taxation again, back in Peru?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly, Daniel. Well, basically we're having several options at this point. I can't comment on any specific option to be the chosen one for &#x2013; on the government side. So we believe that this is going to solved in a very technical way, but at this point, I can't comment on how it's going to be decided.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I just add to Raul's point, the comment is we've been very active as a mining industry in associations and everything, and meeting with the government. And we feel that, I mean, at this point, there isn't anything clear yet.</p>
          <p>But we've been very active with that. We've met with several government officials. I mean, our team in Peru heads and participates in all those meetings as a industry with the new government. And as soon as we have any news, we will, of course, let you know. And of course, you'll find out. You've got your sources.</p>
          <p>It's hard to speculate at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, gentlemen, good morning. My question is regarding GAP, again. I really don't want to know about the process. I mean I know this can take a lot of time and I'm aware of that. But I would like to go a little bit further, a lot more further into time, as to if you were to succeed in the gaining control of GAP.</p>
          <p>What could you tell us about the synergies that this could have with Ferromex and Ferrosur?  And what we should look into for &#x2013; I don't know &#x2013; just to have a clear outlook on what you see in these synergies and how it can play off in the future?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Karla. I mean, first of all, <mark type="ph" /> I'll call it fills our transportation needs (46:11). It's hard to argue that there are synergies in both companies to be obtained immediately.</p>
          <p>We are really looking at the fundamentals and the business of Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico on its own, when we make our investment decision there, rather than to be focusing on any potential synergies that might exist in the future.</p>
          <p>So that is really the way we're looking at it, Karla. We're not really looking at it from a synergy perspective. We're looking at it from a fundamentals perspective.</p>
          <p>It's a company that we like. It has a very well diverse mix between tourism and business travels. We think the passenger numbers that we're looking at, at 2006 passenger numbers, which makes sense for us at this moment. We like the EBITDA margins, we like their dividend policy and we like the way the company's operated. That's why I pointed out that we are not in the idea of changing the operating team or anything. And that's why I was answering Carlos de Alba's question that way.</p>
          <p>So if you look at from a longer timeframe, as you pointed out, it's &#x2013; let's see what happens with the Authority. We believe that the tender should be authorized. We've set a price limit in a tender as a maximum that we were willing to put in our tender offer. And if we launch a tender offer, let's see how many shareholders would like the tender, and we'll take it from there. It's a little bit hard to speculate again now.</p>
          <p>But going back to synergies, I think I've been very clear, and I hope that that answered your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen. I have two questions.</p>
          <p>My first question is on ITM. I noticed that the freight rate has increased significantly year-over-year. And I'm wondering if your customers are giving you some push back on these freight rate increases, with the economic slowdown? And how should we look at your pricing policy in the coming quarters?</p>
          <p>And my second question is with your negotiations with the Peruvian government about T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a, I'm wondering if they have the resources to discuss that matter with you in an expedited manner, while at the same time, they are dealing with the broader taxation issue in the country? So I'm wondering if that could have caused delays in your negotiations regarding T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Sergio. I think it's better off if we start with Rogelio with the ITM. And Raul probably you can give Sergio the answer regarding the status of T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a. Given the broader perspective of that, maybe you can give him a little more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, Sergio. We think that our freight rate continues very aggressive, first of all, because of our new opportunities with Pemex. As I told you before, those traffics are very high volume traffics and very efficient traffics. We have opportunities with the fuel oil that should start before the end of this year, and we're still looking into other opportunities with the PEMEX people for the forthcoming years.</p>
          <p>The numbers that we are showing, especially in Ferrosur, which was very much negatively affected by the problems with the Northwestern crop are still very, very significant. This is the first time in 13 years that our most important segment has been affected by weather. And in spite of that, we continue to be very solid in terms of volume.</p>
          <p>Also the export in beer, the fact that we moved a lot of the volume from Zacatecas, which a year ago, we were supplying the U.S. from that factory, and now we're supplying a big part of the U.S. from Piedras Negras &#x2013; that, in fact, has helped us, because it has helped us have a less congested line in what is a key part of our network.</p>
          <p>So we think that we are going to continue having very aggressive resources, at least for the second semester. The Automotive segment is still &#x2013; are very aggressive. And now that they have more or less overcome the problems on auto parts, as a result of the tsunami in Japan, they're back in full production, and we are seeing a very high volume from all the automotives. And in minerals, there are still a lot of opportunities with mineral ore and in energy with coal.</p>
          <p>The pricing policy, we have been a little more aggressive also on that. We are making sure that all of our new freight opportunities are healthy and do not disturb operations, okay? They have to be &#x2013; the infrastructure in our customers has to be &#x2013; the railroad infrastructure has to be enough to handle the volumes that they are projecting, and they do not have a negative impact on our operations or an impact on the rest of our services.</p>

          <p>Okay. And regarding the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a talks, they are made &#x2013; they are between the company and the authorities of the Ministry of Energy and Mines. And the talks on the taxation are done with Ministry of Finance representative, the tax authority, as well as some representatives of the Ministry of Energy and Mines.</p>
          <p>The talks are evolving in a separate manner. So we are having a basically, in the case of T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a, talks regarding how to move on with the project. In the case of the taxation, this is a talk that is hold by the Mining Society; the company participates as part of the Mining Society in talks regarding taxation. So they are different environments where these two conversations are being hold.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning, and thanks for the conference. I'd like to know is there a possibility to see an increase in the offer for the GAP shares? Or is the $0.50 peso per share the maximum bid you're going to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pablo. No, I mean, at this point, it is clear that's the maximum that we've set up. And the company is trading below that. So we don't see any need to do that currently.</p>
          <p>But that's the price range that we've set out, and we hope that we receive authorization from the CNBV soon. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. One more question. Do you have any kind of relationship, I don't know with some of the major stockholders from GAP. I don't know maybe with the Mexican group or with Aena or abertis?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't. I mean, we know who the shareholders are, whom the controlling company of Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico, of course, but no we don't. I mean, we like the asset, we like the way it is operated and the shares that we're buying are the shares of the listed company that trade publicly in the market and that's the ones that we've been buying and that's the ones that we own, a percentage of it.</p>

          <p>We have a question from the line of Alex Hacking with Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, thanks for the call and taking the question. Just very quickly on the Asarco. Where there ever, did you ever finalize any updated drilling results on Asarco?  And when would we expect to see publication of any results of that? And if they have been finalized, are those part of the AMC discussions? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alex. I mean, first of all, yes, as I pointed, we've done extensive diligence and extensive work on both companies, but particularly as you know Asarco was in Chapter 11 for many years, so it operated under a Chapter 11 mode, if you like.</p>
          <p>And that didn't allow management to do a lot of drilling and a lot of planning, given the circumstances that the company was working under. We've &#x2013; it was busier, we've done a lot of work, us and the advisors of the special independent committee. We've revised mine plans. We've done drilling. We've done validation of reserves. We've done a lot of work really in our mines and operations. We believe the production can increase in the coming years.</p>
          <p>We do have a plan for investing and increasing the production of Asarco. At this point, given the lack of conclusions of our negotiations, I'll have to stay there and comment only that. But yes, of course, I mean, that's what we've been doing and that's what we'd be discussing with the special independent committee.</p>
          <p>As soon as we do have something to convey to the market, we'll definitely do it, Alex. But I think we're happy with the results that we're been &#x2013; I mean, with the studies and the work that we're conducting in the field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just to clarify you had published publicly the updated drilling results, after the situation with AMC is resolved? Is that when we could...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And, absolutely, and as part of the situation, as you know, with the transaction the way we have structured the transaction, we're going to have to publish. I mean, it's really a lot of disclosure to the detail that we have to publish that we've been working on in order to list American Mining Companies. So there'll be a lot of public information there to a very important amount of detail.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>And at this time there are no further questions. Mr. Mu&#xF1;iz, do you have any closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>No, well, thank you, I mean, once again. And thank you, operator. And thank you all for joining us to our second quarter conference call. We hope that you can join us towards our next earnings conference call to be scheduled around the third week of October. And with that, we will conclude the call today. And thank you and goodbye now.</p>
