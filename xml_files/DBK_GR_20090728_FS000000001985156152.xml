        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Maria . And welcome, ladies and gentlemen, from us here at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt to the Deutsche Bank second quarter results call. This morning, we published our second quarter earnings release, our interim report, our financial data supplement, and our PowerPoint presentation. And I draw your attention also to the cautionary statement at the end of that last document.</p>
          <p>Our Chief Financial Officer, Stefan Krause, is going to go over some of the charts in the PowerPoint document and then we will hand over to question-and-answers from you. We hope to get to as many questions of yours as we can and if we don't, then please contact the Investor Relations team and we will get an answer to you.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to hand over to Stefan Krause. Stefan?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gurdon, and welcome from my side as well. Ladies and gentlemen, let's quickly go over a couple of slides and then obviously, we'll gladly answer your questions.</p>
          <p>I would start with the highlights of Q2. We have revenues of 7.9 billion. We had to absorb a provision for credit losses of one billion, in &#x2013; which detail we'll cover later. Income before taxes was at 1.3 billion, net income of 1.1 billion. Our pre-tax return on equity was 16%. Very good.</p>
          <p>Our capital position and balance sheet objectives, we have been able to further work on them. Our Tier 1 ratio is now at 11%. We have reduced risk-weighted assets significantly and we continue to reduce our balance sheet. In fact our IFRS assets are down 18%, our U.S. GAAP pro forma assets down 6% to 928 billion. Our leverage ratio therefore is with 24 ahead of target, which we will not change.</p>
          <p>Level 3 assets are down 20% to 64 billion, both on de-risking and balance sheet reduction as well as improved market conditions, and very important to note at this point that our loan volume to German midcap clients, it's stable at 21 billion. So we do continue to lend in the German market.</p>
          <p>Next, to our strong capital position. We have said that our liquidity and funding position, it's important to us. We continued to have cash and liquidity reserves significantly exceeding our short-term wholesale funding and we have completed more than 80% of our funding trend on the both sides of the capital market issue and deposit raising for '09.</p>
          <p>As I go through the results in summary, revenue is up 7.9 billion as mentioned and income before income tax of 1.3 billion, and we achieved these results absorbing about 600 million of negative effects that I will show you in detail. That puts us in the half year at a 3.1 billion pre-tax and a 2.3 billion after tax result, well in line with our plan.</p>
          <p>The revenues, on next page, includes positive effects of 758 million, 392 million arising from a hedging of our restricted equity units related to our employee compensation. We had a gain of 334 million from derivatives related to Deutsche Postbank AG shares and 132 million arising from the sale of industrial holdings. I will refer to these in more detail later, but these effects were partially counterbalanced by an impairment on assets in our asset management alternatives business of 110 million, and we had only net markdowns of 11 million, certainly the lowest figure we have seen in a while in a quarter.</p>
          <p>On the provision for credit losses, I'm sure you've seen the significant raise &#x2013; rise to one billion in the second quarter. Thereof, 508 million were driven by IAS 39 reclassified assets, and 433 million were related to two specific counterparties. So they are non-recurring but occurred in this quarter, so a large part of the reserves we had to take were specific reserves with two counterparties. In the previous quarter, we only had 187 million related to these specific two counterparties.</p>
          <p>That's what we've decided to give you an update of the composition of our loans also on the following page, and go a little bit more detail because I'm sure there was some question around the current issues around loan loss provisioning.</p>
          <p>This chart demonstrates in principle the composition of our loan book and the provisions we've built throughout the quarter. And the provisioning ratio that we show on the chart basically confirms our view of the risk under different buckets. You see the low-risk bucket has 34 basis points, the moderate risk 99 basis points, and then the high-risk shows a mathematical number of 797 &#x2013; sorry 667, but it's obviously driven by these two relationships I refer to and it's certainly not affected on an ongoing basis, and that's why our high-risk bucket, as you see, will always be determined by one-off in case a further one occurred, that we don't necessarily see at this point in time.</p>
          <p>If you see, when you look at buckets that were affected, the PBC mortgages show a high credit quality and loan-to-value of about 70% right now. Our loan-to-value is based on very conservative valuation method. Typically substantially below market valuation, that's why we believe that this German markets portfolio is quite stable.</p>
          <p>And the investment-grade German midcap financing, our exposure is hedged to a large extent. 29% of this portfolio is hedged predominantly via CLOs and the investment-grade book even has a 67% hedging rather, we are seeing a name   at CDS. So we feel that book is very well protected. Where we had some issues definitely is in the small portfolio of consumer finance that we have, and most of that occurred outside of Germany. I think we've alluded to this risk in previous conferences.</p>
          <p>In the CI portfolio, it's the commitment of people &#x2013; real estate that we include there that obviously we are monitoring very closely, and as I alluded to again, and the leveraged finance assets include these two specific risks that cost a significant additional reserve in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On our commercial real estate, the split between the U.S. and non-U.S. was six billion versus eight billion non-U.S. So I think, we feel &#x2013; continue to feel comfortable and as you know from the news, we have done some further de-risking in that portfolio as well.</p>
          <p>So overall, obviously an area of our business that we closely monitor, looking at the general deteriorating credit environment, but based on the structure of our books, we continue to feel comfortable despite the fact that clearly we see rising loan loss provisions.</p>
          <p>On interest expenses, on page eight, were 5.6 billion in the quarter, significantly impacted by specific charges that you could also see in our release of 831 million. Compensation costs were driven by higher accruals for compensation and of course of severance payments of 321 million. Our compensation rate, the ratio adjusted for severance payments, of 36%, this obviously is impacted by several non-bonus revenues that we have in our revenue line. That's why this number may appear low.</p>
          <p>General and administrative expenses included a 316 million charge from the legal settlement with Huntsman as well as one-time exit costs related to our facilities that we don't need anymore because of our efficiency improvement measures. Our non-compensation expenses also include an impairment charge of 151 million, resulting from the bank's involvement into an &#x2013; a port asset.</p>
          <p>On page nine, we have tried to help you to make an assessment of the underlying strength of our current profitability and business developing. The quarter has very significantly impacted by a whole series of one-offs and within this category, we have really only used those items that had clearly a one-off character and are not recurring, are specific and are not recurring effects.</p>
          <p>So you see that on the one hand, based on the hedging in our equity, our Postbank gain in our industrial holding sales, quarterly profit was positively impacted by &#x20AC;758 million. And then we had a lot of additional charges, one-off type charges, the Huntsman, Maher, the RREEF impairments, and these provisions related to specific transactions that caused our profit to have a negative of 1.4, almost 1.4 billion. So on a net basis, after taking positive and negative one-offs; our profits had a charge of about &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>With &#x2013; as I alluded to at the highlights presentation, we had a 1.3 billion income before taxes and are well underway in terms of achieving our targets this year from an internal view.</p>
          <p>Our ETR on page 11 is relatively low in 2Q, I'm sure you've noticed, and mainly driven by nontaxable gains. Obviously for example, the Postbank  put cost structure and equity figure, the sale of industrial holdings, as well as the equity compared to the impact on nontaxable items, and they lead to this reduced charge. For the full year, we currently expect an ETR below 30%, but our mid-term guidance remains at the 30 to 35%.</p>
          <p>Very good news on the capital side with our Tier-1 ratio now being at 11%, that we, as you see, achieved on both sides of the equation. We improved profit of the Group on the one hand and on the other hand, had a significant reduction in risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>We had significant movement in the risk-weighted asset on the one hand. We did have to absorb a multiplier increase that was getting from the BaFin of about six billion. We also had obviously a negative on our risk-weighted assets based on rating downgrades by about six billion, but these two effects were compensated by movements in our market parameters, in our derivatives, by our impairments taking through P&amp;L. That then meant that we had to carry lower risk-weighted assets for these positions by &#x2013; also by a specific process improvement that we did, especially also improved vetting, but also improve the collateral recognition and then, of course, as you saw on the balance sheet in our general business development, significant risk reductions that then more than compensated the additional charges we had in the risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>So move on to the total assets, as you know, we have been very committed to risk reduction and balance sheet reduction. We've another quarter of significant reduction of our balance sheet. Our total assets the 30th of June were 1.1 trillion according to IFRS, significantly driven by lower derivatives values due to obviously the non-credit spread movements. But also our U.S. GAAP pro forma definition, our assets were 928 billion, a decrease of 54 billion or 6%.</p>
          <p>Since June 30th of 2008, therefore our U.S. GAAP balance sheet is down by one-third. I think that's really a significant reduction of risk for the bank. Also in line then, our leverage ratio decreased to 24, ahead of our target, but I clearly want to restate this here that we will not change our current target. We still think that 25% leverage ratio is appropriate for our business model.</p>
          <p>One strength of Deutsche Bank, next is strength in capital position continues to be our funding and liquidity position on page 14. We show how our funding position looks right now, &#x20AC;479 billion of which 14% are short-term wholesale funding, but however, this position is completely covered by cash positions in &#x2013; on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The good news is that our funding trend is likely completed as we show on page 15. And we always get the question how we are doing in terms of our pricing and issuance. So we have prepared this view, which I think, is a good reference to how we are doing, how Deutsche Bank credit is seen in &#x2013; and that we are able to secure long-term debt.</p>
          <p>As you see, our issuance is happening at low cost, comparatively low cost obviously that we have basically completed, both on our deposit and on our capital market issuing, about 80% of our funding plan, and then obviously with the issuance in the quarter of the Pfandbrief, it has really helped us also to diversify our funding base further. So we continue to believe that's a very strong liquidity and funding position.</p>
          <p>Let me quickly cover our segments' sales and trading revenues on page 17, at 3.5 billion after about 108 million in net markdowns and 130 million of fair value losses on debt. Our first half-year revenues of 7.5 billion show 1.1 billion of markdowns and about 140 million of fair value losses on debt.</p>
          <p>So after the announced recalibration of our business model that we have announced as a new strategy, our most liquid &#x2013; those products account for 45% of these revenues, our medium highly liquid of 54%, and our highly illiquid positions that we strategically wanted to significantly reduce only accounted for about 1%</p>
          <p>In looking at our market, we have market share gains in many of our revenue categories and in many of our businesses, so we continue to benefit from Deutsche Bank's strong brand.</p>
          <p>In &#x2013; on page 18, we showed some main developments that occurred during the month, to start obviously with our constant input VaR, which is an approximation of how the value at risk would have developed if market movements are neglected. You see how substantially down our value at risk is. It's a proof that at the same time while reducing our balance sheet volume, we've been also able to take down our risk as a whole. We show you the U.S. basis risk, which in the quarter-to-quarter comparison is down 44 &#x2013; 42% and as compared to the peak, is even more significantly down.</p>
          <p>Global markets U.S. GAAP pro forma balance sheet down in the quarter-to-quarter comparison, 7%. It was down in the first quarter 43% versus the peak. I think I've alluded to that in the same. You see our restructuring efforts continued at a slower pace with reduction of 1% on the non-comp direct costs.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the revenues in the sales and trading debt and other products, here you see a slowdown that we had versus a very good Q1. Several effects play here a significant risk. We had an excellent Q1 result. You know that we have decided to go with further de-risking and balance sheet reduction exercise, which have had an impact obviously on this business and later on when we go into the level 3 assets, as we've also worked on reducing our level 3 assets, these were the main factors impacting the performance in the sales and trading debt area of the business.</p>
          <p>On the sales and trading equity revenues, we've had a debt for six quarters now, even after 113 million of fair value losses on debt. As we've told you, basically in the fourth quarter, this was the area where we suffered most of our losses in the top trading area. We then went into the first quarter with restructuring, and we are happy to report that we recovered so quickly in the second quarter already.</p>
          <p>Our legacy positions are largely at risk in the equity derivatives position. Our cash equities both in Europe and the Americas, we continue to gain market share and develop nicely, especially in the U.S. we're gaining market share.</p>
          <p>Our prime brokerage again is a strength of the bank. We continue to exhibit strength as shown. We continue &#x2013; we're the &#x2013; we're a top-rated prime fund broker in the Global Custodian survey amongst prime customers.</p>
          <p>We move on now to Origination and Advisory, as you know, significantly down markets, low market volume, but we have been able to capture a larger market share. In the M&amp;A, we have a global position number five. In the EMEA, we have the number one position right now, but of course, that based on the low volumes of the market. We expect though to be able to capitalize on our market position as the environment improves in this businesses.</p>
          <p>Going to our Global Transaction Banking business, as you know, GTB has generated a pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;101 million. The business continues to be exposed to the low interest rate environment as well as to significant incremental regulatory charges for deposit protection in Germany that approximate about &#x20AC;50 million of a charge. This negative effect is partly counterbalanced by a benefit of 55 million from our redefined risk based funding methodology, which I will go in later in my presentation.</p>
          <p>So basically the main developments in this business area, we have higher non-interest expenses of 82 million that were related to the fact that we have higher comp in benefits driven by higher staffing levels, as we continue to invest into this business. We believe we can benefit from it, from the known strength in the future. We also had higher non-compensation direct costs, mainly driven by these regulatory charges that we had to deal with.</p>
          <p>If we move on to our Brokerage and portfolio/fund management revenues, you see that we are somewhat stable in the quarter-to-quarter comparison with 857 million revenues. We have shown that obviously markets continue to be down. We saw a little recovery in the quarter. So we see some customers coming back to activities which obviously then benefits our PBC and Asset and Wealth Management business. Still client activity continues to be significantly depressed.</p>
          <p>If we go into the Asset and Wealth Management business specifically, obviously the quarter &#x2013; in the quarter, we took RREEF impairments of 110 million related to different assets. And as we have said, are to especially restructure the asset management side of this business and we are working to improve its efficiency in order to achieve the target that we have set for recovery in the second half. We took additional severance charges of 54 million in this area.</p>
          <p>Our private and business clients generated a pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;55 million. The profitability was obviously impacted by severance charges of about 150 million, a significant impact. So &#x2013; but now obviously in this business, as we are restructuring it, that a significant bulk of the severance is now behind us with very modest severance forecast for the rest of the year of only approximately 50 million.</p>
          <p>The additional results were obviously impacted by the pension and deposit insurance costs that are rising in Germany. That increased the cost base by about 15 million. Obviously, this business area is impacted by the credit loss situation. We saw some stabilization of the credit cost, at least the worsening stopped in this business area. We continue to benefit from some revised parameters and model assumption on how we do our reserve policy, which in the quarter-to-quarter comparison showed about an improvement of 30 million.</p>
          <p>We have identified certain sub-critical portfolios predominantly outside of Germany, where management have now taking vigorous action and we expect some benefits of that action in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>To some extent, obviously, clients continue to or have started to shift deposits into securities as we showed in the previous chart, showing some first indication of customers returning to the market, but overall client activity remained weak which then puts pressure on the profit of PBC.</p>
          <p>Let me now go into a couple of key current issues. Obviously on the first one, we highlight again the issue of the problem loans, the whole situation around the credit environment, the difficult credit environment we are facing right now. Problem loans rose by 3.7 billion in the first half of 2009. This increase includes two billion in relation of IAS 39 reclassified assets principally in relation to these two specific counterparties I already discussed in the context of the loan loss provision development for the current quarter.</p>
          <p>The remaining 1.7 billion increase reflects the general weaker credit environment with 1.2 billion relating to our corporate lending to U.S. and continental European customers. Lastly, about 500 million relate to our collectively assessed loans, principally, obviously, the PBC loans in Germany, Spain, and Italy.</p>
          <p>The IAS 39 reclassified assets are also the primary driver behind the seven point drop in the IFRS impaired loan coverage over the last six months. These assets obviously carry on average significantly lower allowances of around 28%. Our average lower ratio has to be seen in light of the markdowns already taken at the time of reclassification. I would like to remind you that obviously when we reclassified these assets, we reclassified them at their current market valuation, which has to be taken into account when we look at the risk and coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>Also, let me remind you that our IFRS impaired loans are often collateralized and that including this collateral, our coverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 76%.</p>
          <p>Let's now go into the topic of U.S. &#x2013; of the monoline exposure that obviously continues to still concern the market. We are very aware of it and that's why we always like to highlight what the averaging affect of our assets and good exposures does to the overall ratios, and why in the areas in which we believe our risk is high, we are well covered. This is what this chart shows.</p>
          <p>Let us cover the U.S. RMBS. Our &#x2013; summary of our monoline policy as it relates to super senior and other subprime and Alt-A shows this first category provisioning ratio on non-investment grade monoline increased from 76% in Q1 to 82 % in Q2 whilst the ratio on AA rated monolines remains flat at 9%. So we have increased in the risk &#x2013; in the high risk position, we have increased our reserves.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, our exposure decreased 366 million, driven mainly obviously by foreign exchange movements and a decrease in the AA rated exposure driven by an improvement in the market value of the underlying assets predominantly in the Alt-A area and Radiant unwind. The majority of our exposure is to AA rated counterparties as you can see in the chart with Alt-A underlying &#x2013; dominating this exposure. So the quality of the majority of the portfolio remains high with very good subordination level. Our remaining gross exposure to ABS, CDO, and subprime assets is now relatively smaller, and as you can see on the chart, it's all highly provisioned.</p>
          <p>If I go into the other exposure, to the lower part of this chart, it's that &#x2013; I mean all the other than non-U.S. RMBS asset classes. Provision ratio on the non-investment grade monolines increased from 32% in Q1 to 38% in Q2, whilst the ratio on the better rated AA rated monolines remained flat at 9% as well. The overall decrease in exposure from six billion to 4.9 billion during 2Q reflect an improvement of the market value across all these assets classes on the one hand and to a lesser extent, obviously some exchange rate movements.</p>
          <p>So these positions are protected to cover a broad range of the generally high quality asset classes, that's why we like to show them as separate, because they have a different risk with high levels &#x2013; strong levels of subordination relative to the current and expected default rates on these assets.</p>
          <p>So we continue to believe, in summary, that overall in Q2, our monoline exposure was reduced by 1.4 billion by improved market realizations totally and the unwind of Radiant whilst our CVA reduced reserves looked then in comparison, and it's really only the averaging affect that make our general monoline exposures versus our competitors look lower. But we continue to be very comfortable with our monoline exposure.</p>
          <p>On page 29, another good news out of the quarter, that obviously our level 3 assets have been significantly reduced. 10 billion of this reduction in the derivative market values due the credit spread movements we saw in the quarter. 4.5 billion were reduction based on sales and unwind, and 1.5 billion we had a net trend out of level 3, which obviously is related to the increased pricing visibility in the market based on the improved market conditions. So overall, a good development. I would like to refer back to our credit trading activities. Obviously the asset reduction here in the level 3 had some impact on that performance.</p>
          <p>If we go to the impact of IAS 39 reclassifications that we show on page 30, the first information is that we have no further reclassifications from trading loss during the quarter. During the second quarter, we have seen an over-reduction from 6.7 billion to 6.1 billion in the ongoing difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets that we reclassified. This has been driven partly by an improvement of the fair value of some of the underlying assets together with redemptions and maturities of assets where the carrying value previously exceeded fair value.</p>
          <p>Redemptions and maturities have typically been at or above carrying value, which is very important to us. The reduction of carrying to fair value difference has not been more significant to-date due to the structured nature of many of these reclassified assets, which have not thus far seen the spread reductions seen more generally in the credit market. So we haven't seen &#x2013; that's the main reason why we haven't seen significant market value improvement.</p>
          <p>In addition, the steepening of the yield curves in the quarter will have had a negative impact in the fair value of longer dated reclassified assets, where the interest rate impact is generally hedged and the relevant hedge is subject to hedge accounting treatment. But the overall carrying value of the portfolio has reduced &#x2013; has been reduced by some 2.3 billion, driven by redemption and maturities, FX movements and the increased loan loss provisions recorded in the quarter as I discussed earlier.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to page 31, also as a clarification for you to understand the profit quality in Q2. We have segregated now the impact of the Postbank transaction on our result. The impact from the revised structure was in the quarter &#x20AC;234 million; for the half year &#x20AC;476 million, that is also the impact that we reclassified as a one-off in the earlier statement. And then obviously we have the ongoing recurrent impact coming both from the put/call structure and the equity pick-up impact at a 155, quarter or 150 million in the quarter, and the number is shown on the chart. So a total of second quarter impact of Postbank of 389 million, and approximately 860 million for the first half year.</p>
          <p>On page 32, I cover quickly the issue of risk-based funding, what motivated us to change our risk-based funding, It's basically two main effects. On the one hand, we just want to charge our funding cost is based more on the risk of the assets that are funded, and second, obviously we wanted to reward the stickiness of the deposit of some level of deposits, and therefore, we did some adjustment on transfer pricing. This is neutral for the Group as a whole, and in the chart, we show you which one of the business segments benefited from this change in transfer. Obviously, it solved the crisis. We have seen the importance of deposit funding. And we are recognizing this benefit with this new classification.</p>
          <p>On page 33, I therefore summarized the half year comparisons. As you can see, we had a much stronger revenue momentum versus last year. We are considerably more profitable despite the fact that we are digesting a higher loan loss provision.</p>
          <p>Our Tier-1 capital ratio is the best that it's ever been and I went into the effect, and our balance sheet is down by a third if I take the U.S. GAAP pro forma analysis as a base. And last but not least, not on the chart; we continue to show funding trends.</p>
          <p>So with that, I conclude and I look forward to all of your questions. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I wondered if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit on your expectations for credit quality. I think that breakout into the buckets is very helpful. But of those three, low, moderate and high risk categories, could you maybe give us an idea of what you think the peak non-performing loans or the peak charge-offs might be? And the second question I had is just on the dividend. Could you tell what level you're accruing at and how should we think about the targets for dividend this year in absolute terms or payout terms? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, two good questions. Let me answer the easier one first, that's the dividend question. We always had a system to accrue to previous year dividend until we get a new decision, that is a decision that the supervisory board in the German government structure takes. So we are accruing to our $0.50 that we use &#x2013; that we paid-out last year on dividend.</p>
          <p>On our credit quality expectations, on the three buckets, you see, most of these portfolios are performing good. That's why on the low bucket, we don't expect any further surprises. The moderate is impacted by our consumer finance portfolio, which is especially the consumer finance portfolio outside of Germany, which is not a big portfolio. We have taken some management actions &#x2013; management decisions and we think that both on the collection side in Germany as well as on the risk side in these countries, we should be fine. So therefore we don't expect a &#x2013; as I said, we saw some leveling-off on that one.</p>
          <p>The high-risk bracket is dominated obviously by the reclassified leverage positions. And these are one-time event-driven credit losses, so to do a run-rate projection on those is difficult. We, of course, based on our result, if we would have seen any further risk coming, we would have had to make provisions. At this point, we don't see any, but as the environment changes in a positive or negative, this may &#x2013; this bucket may be impacted, but will be more driven by one-off situations.</p>
          <p>We hesitate obviously a little bit to make a more detailed forecast and even to give you a number, because obviously it's &#x2013; as you know, it's very difficult in the current environment with the uncertainties coming at us the second half to deal with it. The good news, only one of the exposures that some other banks have reported issues with, which is the German midcap portfolio, we have this additional hedging feature, so we are protected in that sense additionally. So that's why, overall, with low and medium risk bucket, we feel comfortable.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Jernej Omahen, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi there. It's Jernej here from Goldman. Essentially just three questions, the first one is when you went through slide 20, I think you made a comment that there was a reversal of gain on owned debt of around 113 million, which is not a big number. But from memory, I seem to recall the Deutsche Bank stated on the Q1 and Q4 results calls that you were one of the few investment bank that doesn't mark-to-market the owned debt, and it's quite possible I got that wrong. But please can you just update us on that, if that is the case or not?</p>
          <p>Then the second question is on slide 30, you made a comment that redemptions that come through are done at or above fair value, i.e., at or above when they were entered into the &#x2013; essentially, accrual books. And I was just wondering where &#x2013; if a redemption is clearly done above fair value, where does the write-back comes through? And given the amount of reduction of this portfolio, where do we see it in the P&amp;L, i.e., the combined effect of both &#x2013; of these redemptions being done at what seems to be favorable levels.</p>
          <p>And the last question, I think, is relatively straightforward. It's on page seven. And I think what would be very useful here is the following. When you give us the three buckets, I think rather than asking what your peak NPL estimates are, I would like to ask what your current NPL ratios are for these buckets? And then I think &#x2013; and the sort of a logical follow-on question would be the coverage ratios as well. And the reason why I am asking this question is not to be, I think, excessively detailed, but because you report a coverage ratio around the 40% mark for the Group. So I was just wondering how that splits between the higher, lower and moderate risk NPLs? I am assuming that, by implication, one would then assume that the lower risk NPLs or the NPLs in the lower risk bucket would have coverage, I guess, of half of that, the Group earlier mentioned. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me go, on the fair value, number one, yes, we don't generally do the fair value on debt. There is very small positions that we fair value. Our position always has been that there is no true economic value in that and that's why we have stayed out of it. The amount for Deutsche Bank would have been substantial in the billions if we would have done it. So we only had a very small, and obviously also on the smaller side, we see some reversal and that's the one I reported.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And may I just ask on this point, what is the accumulated gain on debt at Deutsche currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The accumulated gain on debt is 161 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, that's indeed a tiny number. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a tiny number. And therefore I reported it because it switched, but it's not a meaningful number and that's why we also have the benefit on a going forward basis that the reversal issue that we see with others when the credit spreads were tightened more, it will not occur to us. So hopefully we will get some good payback for keeping the discipline in this issue, but obviously as you can &#x2013; it's not always easy as we deviate from common market practice in this area.</p>
          <p>The redemption at fair value, we &#x2013; obviously, the experience is that we really &#x2013; if we had a redemption, it was to the reclassified values or better. But we haven't done a lot in this, so it's very small. It's very tiny. It's not an important or material affect.</p>
          <p>Your question on the NPL here, it's very specific. So we would like to take that question offline and we will call you up to give you the answer. I don't have the data in details. We need to spread it out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. The first question is on provisions. I recall listening to an Ackermann presentation where there was a run-rate provisioning of about 2.7 billion &#x2013; 2.5 to three billion, and NPLs are clearly growing much faster than your run-rate of provision except one counterparty risk. So how should I look at provisions going forward? That's the first question on a Group basis, and if any change from this run-rate?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to risk taking. You're clearly reducing a lot of risk and what I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about risk-weighted assets at 295, where should we look at going forward Level 3 assets 64 billion, staff numbers, and I have CIB, et cetera, 14,000. How should we look at all these kind of different risk packets? And is possible, if you could go one-by-one, risk-weighted assets, Level 3 assets overall, and head count, how do you see them developing over time? Are we done with the de-risking on your balance sheet in terms of ex-structure credit or are we continuing with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Kian, thank you. And I can certainly understand that these are the questions moving us all. Let me start with your first question relating to the provisions. This run-rate, I must say I am not clear to what you refer to. We had, at the beginning of the year, assumed that we would have a lower run-rate. It did somewhat increase as you can see. But what's important, it continues to impacted by event driven one-offs, that obviously as we do them, get off our list and are &#x2013; that's why are related to legacy provisions that we had out of the crisis deal to deal with. So the good news is &#x2013; the bad news is they're increasing. The good news is that any hit we've taken, it's helping us on a going forward basis to ease this situation because these are one-off related things and the more issues we take off of our list, the better.</p>
          <p>I also alluded that, of course, based on our accounting regime, that if we were to see any other ones right now that we would have to &#x2013; have to take them, but based on the fact that at this point in time, we feel very comfortable that we took all of the necessary, now it's very difficult to me to predict any further one-offs. We don't know what the environment is going to take. We have reduced, as you saw, significantly our risk positions. So that's why, to some extent, obviously we do feel comfortable but it will obviously depend on how the general environment develops to some extent, but then on how specific business developments may occur in the one-off items.</p>
          <p>On the rest of the portfolio, the low and moderate bucket, I think, we're very much inline with &#x2013; based on &#x2013; whether out there, you would expect to be provisions at that level. We even, on average, continue to believe that we hold a good portfolio and are also one of the banks that has hedged this portfolio partially and therefore are also protected from it</p>
          <p>So that's why we, on the one hand, are pretty aware that we &#x2013; and our initial feelings that we have not been right on our initial feeling on how it will develop, but as we moved on and as we are taking provisions, we start to feel more comfortable with where we are and <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>We have addressed the portfolios that are in specific risk and I will specifically tell you we have taken management action in Spain, we are taking management action in Germany on the collection side to increase our benefit there, but we don't see &#x2013; so we have also taken operational action to deal with the issues. And the high risk bucket will be event-driven and the high risk bucket will continue to be event-driven rather than run-rate driven, very difficult to predict at this point obviously, again I allude to what I said.</p>
          <p>On the risk taking side, our risk-weighted assets, yes, we have &#x2013; we were able to reduce our risk-weighted assets in the quarter. I did explain the main swings effect, we have to also take some additional charges based on rating migration. So our focus remains it will probably stay below 300 billion, that's our current view, then it will depend on how substantially we stay below 300 billion we will &#x2013; either one.</p>
          <p>Our current, if I try to answer your, I think, surely complex last question, and to some extent, it's a question probably a little bit to what the Board's policy is right now. It always come back what weather we see ahead of us and we remain to be cautious in terms of what we see in the environment coming at the bank.</p>
          <p>If the environment gets much better than we believe, then we believe we will have a benefit from that but rather to be cautious right now. So at this point, we continue to &#x2013; don't expect to grow the balance sheet. We want to continue our capital and balance sheet discipline to further observe the environment. If the environment, let's say, substantially improves, obviously we may change but at this point this is our view. Our Tier 1 target remains at 10%, we don't see or any need for any increased Tier 1 target. Our leveraged target remains at 25% as well. We believe that for our business mix, this is okay.</p>
          <p>Our head count, we have done some reductions. We have done some adjustments to account for the new market levels of revenues, but we don't estimate that we have to do any significantly larger steps at this point in time other than ones that are already booked and they are accounted for with the severance charges that we took in the quarter, that as you know were quite substantial. On our Level 3 assets, obviously the parameter, if markets stay as they are, will probably come down. We want to mention a figure of around 50 billion Level 3 and that's probably in &#x2013; assuming that markets don't deteriorate any further and we get pricing information for some of these models, we probably stay around that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful. Just to &#x2013; so it's fair to say that the Board is still taking the view that we should be in a risk reduction mode at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say further risk reduction. I would say that that's certainly &#x2013; we have significantly reduced, but will we go back to risk-taking? At this point, the Board's view is that we should not do that, that we should keep our discipline. But we have already taken so much risk down that from our view the potential in speeds of taking down risk certainly will be reduced. So we are kind of &#x2013; let's say, staying on the middle ground outlook right now and see how the environment develops.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one more quick follow-up on the slide 27, the coverage ratio of 46, how much is that including collateral? And how does it compare to the first quarter number? I remember you gave it including collateral, I can't recall.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jernej I would like to &#x2013; very sorry Kian, I would like to add one point only. Obviously, our position will be different in a different mix. I made a statement on how we take the risk on a Group's point of view. You may see us altering between the businesses just on the &#x2013; as an addition. And our &#x2013; including the collateral, our coverage ratio was 76%. I mentioned it when covering slides, so the 46 goes to 76.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Serra, Algebris. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry for before. Can I ask a question regarding the geographic mix and the competitive landscape? Given your strength in funding the balance sheet, the core capital, are you seeing &#x2013; where are you seeing your position being mostly improved, particularly within the investment banking business, on a geographic basis and on a product basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we believe that obviously our European strengths will continue to dominate the bank, especially because also our stable businesses are mainly European businesses. So I think that in terms of largest share of our business will continue to be European. But as I alluded in presentation, for example, in the investment bank, in our equity business, we're making good step forwards in the U.S. We're gaining market share there. We see some opportunities to grow in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The same is valid for Asia in which &#x2013; in certain businesses, we see opportunities while other businesses, we might de-emphasize in Asia as we go right now. We continue to see China as a great opportunity. Actually our business performance in China is very strong and very good in a couple of our businesses there. So there is also an opportunity, but obviously whenever we talk about growth ratios for example in China, as they start from a lower base, it's not that any of these regions will take a predominant role in our profitability over time. We will continue to be largely European, but with market share gains both in the U.S. and Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the follow &#x2013; second question regarding &#x2013; because I see somehow in these numbers, a great top line performance reduced by some more marks. So if I look at the IAS 39 impact on page 30, if I had to see this as potential hits over the next; let's say, two, three, four, five years, how long it will take for them to fully unfold? And hence, what's the speed at which some of these mark-to-market potential impact are actually realized losses, and how fast are they going to come through, by basically reducing the great operating performance or top line level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I must disagree with you in the point that these are potential loss because the reason we reclassified it is because we absolutely do not believe -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; these are potential losses and I would again state knowing these assets, we have &#x2013; that the development in this area, the reason we reclassified them is we believe that due to the lack of pricing in the market, you have to &#x2013; we would have had to downgrade this to a completely unreasonable level. That's the reason why the accounting decided to say, in non-liquid markets, we need to allow the bank to value this position more according to the intrinsic value.</p>
          <p>We still have to reclassify them at the market value, at today's, after reclassification which already took a substantial devaluation of these assets into account when they went in to the accrual book. Now they're subject to loan loss provisions and as you saw, especially on the part of the leverage, shown &#x2013; shown you, a small part of these were classified assets.</p>
          <p>We have had some event driven loan loss provisions that &#x2013; but in comparison to the potential markdown, markets are still relatively small versus what the mark-to-market valuation of the entire portfolio, would have meant. So actually, we believe that; again, that the reclassification was important, was the right thing to do. And we do not absolutely believe that the numbers that we regretfully have to report, which our U.S. GAAP filers do not have to report, which to some extent an imbalance against IFRS filers, this number in my mind confuses most &#x2013; provide more room for confusion then it really provides clarity.</p>
          <p>So we don't believe &#x2013; we actually believe that zero of this market losses will be &#x2013; actually what you should expect in this statistics as market conditions improve, that the mark-to-market comes now closer back to what we hold these assets on the book and actually it may even surpass the value as they are already substantially downgrade in the accrual books. We may see even a swing in the other direction depending on the recovery of market values.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, morning. Talk us through &#x2013; I have got two questions, one on the revenues. You mentioned in the comment that the fixed income results in Q2 were impacted a little bit by having had an exceptional Q1 and also by some deleveraging. And I was wondering if could just conceptually divide how much of the decrease was the exceptional Q1, how much was deleveraging, and how much was just the ups and downs of a trading quarter?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I'll just echo Jernej comments about if you could provide NPLs and the coverage ratios by the different groups of assets, I think that will be very helpful to give the market more confidence about the asset quality of some of the underlying businesses. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We will provide that offline. Let's put these numbers together and then we'll share them with you. I think you're right that maybe help you to assess the situation a little bit better. And on the &#x2013; on your other question, to be honest, the effect for the &#x2013; on the trades and trading debt positions, it's obviously very difficult to assume what would be a normal quarter for Q1. It's only what's important to us in the comparison, I think we are a debt house, we continue to see strengths. We don't &#x2013; the results in Q2 should not show any differently. We have the technical affected obviously, as we proceed with the de-risking and the balance sheet reduction. We do have some impact on that business area which is a traditional strength of the bank.</p>
          <p>And also in the Q1-Q2 comparison, it was really an exception in Q1, and most of the good performances &#x2013; we were weak in equities in the first quarter. Most of the good performance that we exhibited in the Q1 was related obviously to the debt authorism. But just all-in-all I really &#x2013; the picture I would like it's not an area of concern to us, impacted by management actions and not by our traditional strength in this &#x2013; operational strength in this business, so &#x2013; and not a concern at this point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everybody. Couple of questions. I'm sorry to flog a dead horse again, but in terms of the increase in the nonperforming loans, the 44% increase, so indeed the increase in the impaired loans, could you at least in the short-term give us an idea of how much of that was in relation to the reclassifications, in other words, the increase from 5.7 billion to 8.2?</p>
          <p>Second question is, I'm rather surprised, the write-offs have shrunk to 99 or so, net write-offs have shrunk to 99 million during the quarter, which is interesting given obviously the vast increase in the bad debt charge. Can you perhaps just give us a brief comment on that?</p>
          <p>Third point, on the collateral, if &#x2013; this is an old banking adage of course, how much of that is commercial real estate, just roughly in your mind, would you say? And then final two points, the 321 million of severance charges, obviously you've been involved in a lot of jobs at the bank in terms of improving efficiency. What should we look for as we go into the second half in that area, particularly around the asset management area? And finally could you just tell us what you now own in Deutsche Postbank? Sorry for so many questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me try to go under &#x2013; your first question, the NPL. I said in my statement that's just about two billion in relation to IAS 39.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And was that &#x2013; how does that compare to first quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As don't have the chart, there is a number here. With your collateral commercial real estate number, that's obviously &#x2013; because there's lots of individual transactions, that we don't summarize it, that in that case, we will not be able to give you this data now. As obviously as you can assume, this is thousands of financing agreements, each one is independent, so it's very difficult indeed a question to ask.</p>
          <p>On your severance &#x2013; 321 million severance question, it will be the second quarter where we will be most impacted by the severance number. We should now come back to what you could almost call normal levels of severance that we've had. The reason why, obviously we had to find agreement with the labor representatives in Germany and as soon as this agreement is signed, at that point, we have to take the charge. Now as &#x2013; obviously the head count reduction will now occur over the next two to three quarters effectively, but we have to take the charge as soon as the agreement is in place and that's why especially the German business was impacted, for example, PBC was 150, that's specific to Q2. So we should come back.</p>
          <p>On your Postbank, we are not disclosing that at this point in time, but of course, we are still below 30%, yes. Because otherwise, obviously, we would be in a public mandatory offering that you don't see us exercising right now, so that can be your assumption at this point in time. But we are not disclosing the exact number at this point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I have already asked my questions. It was to do with the impact of the Basel II changes on your sort of market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, when we disclosed a number of 50 billion, if you remember, over the next couple of years, we've discussed it a couple of times in the conference calls here based on the fact that we &#x2013; on the other hand &#x2013; on the one hand, we see the working groups working and that was an estimate we made over the coming years that the market will change according to Basel II could really mean to us. On the other hand, we enjoy &#x2013; Ackermann has always specifically stated that in all his meetings, it's regulated. Obviously he continues to see that there is not necessarily an interest to really create more pressure on capitalization of banks right now. So to some extent, I also &#x2013; we always give out a cautionary statement that maybe some of the decisions, despite they will come out in an after-crisis scenario, they may not be around as quickly as the market is estimating right now, because obviously what sense does it make to put more &#x2013; the banks right now under more capital pressure wise. We are in a crisis environment. So that's what we have &#x2013; so that's what we do to respond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, it's 50 billion in terms of the impact as to what you carded previously, you're still sticking with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you've seen on the other hand, this is obviously a growth number. As we are reducing risk-weighted assets as you saw us in the quarter, on the other hand, the net impact to capital might not be the one you derive out of the 50 billion, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we are taking action. We will reduce this. So we don't anticipate our true risk-weighted assets growth to be 50 billion on top of our current numbers, yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think it obviously would change that mix. Okay, can we have the question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure sir. The next question is from Fiona Swaffield, Execution Limited. Please go ahead, madam.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I had three questions. The first was if we go back to the first quarter slide presentation in Sales and Trading, you had a slide 18 called earnings power and you alluding the market to look at &#x20AC;6.1 billion as the underlying number. And I'd like some help on what the relevant Q2 number would be, obviously you reported about 3.6. There seems to be a 100 million of write-downs and a bit of fair value of owned debt, so maybe it's something like 3.7 or something underlying. I mean can you help us with the delta? And that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is if I look on the slide on fixed income or sales trading debt, and I compare Q1 with Q2, in the Q2, there is no mention at all of commodities, yet in Q1, there was a very &#x2013; couple of arrows on commodities. Is some of the swing Q2 to Q1 in the actual sale trading debt due to commodities or is it due to flow because all &#x2013; all of the basis risk, I am still kind of struggling with what's going on in the underlying?</p>
          <p>And then the third issue is on the slide when you give all the adjustments of what you think we should adjust for. I just wondered why &#x2013; I think it's slide nine, why you hadn't taken out the additional Postbank revenue numbers, I think the ones that are towards the back of the slide pack on the equity pick-up and things like that, or am I missing something &#x2013; are those something you think will continue to repeat or am I double counting something? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay let me start with the last question. It is &#x2013; what we didn't want to do is to give you &#x2013; to add to our one-off slide, and we &#x2013; the slide that we show &#x2013; where we show the effects, we really wanted to go to one-offs only. They will only occur in this quarter. They have no recurring effects. So that's what's the definition we use to put the slide together to show you the different swings we had because of the substantial and material amount of one-offs that we had to record in the quarter.</p>
          <p>From the three, Postbank effect, the equity pick-up effect, and obviously the put/call structure which we have to market value, will be recurring. We will have a profitability coming from Postbank, positive or negative, yes. And we will have on our market valuation of the put/call structure we might have positive and negative evaluation as long as we are in the current transaction structure. So that's why we decided that these are recurring. And we should not include them in our table of -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just double-check? My understating of slide 31 then, in addition to the 234, there is another 305 million in CI? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. For the quarter, yes. But this will be recurring. So this &#x2013; that's the difference.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On our commodities business, yes, we have a slowdown in the commodities business revenue, which was one of the factors that included there, that is included in why our sales and trading revenues are lower in Q1. That's correct.</p>
          <p>And then the change of revenue numbers, I think you're &#x2013; it's about your calculation. It's likely you made it. You're &#x2013; obviously on the 6.1, we verified for Q1, but Q2 number I think your calculation is probably incorrect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that there are no losses from exited, so the business is down like 40-50%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in that sense, in that calculation, yes. But I also would like to mention this, but that we did take significant additional marks in all our positions. So I don't want to leave with the impression that we had a weakening in the overall performance here on a clean-up basis, but we did also take, obviously, the usual de-risking that we had in Q1, that led to that math.</p>
          <p>I don't have an exact number for you here, so I could give you the losses from the exited and repositioning businesses right now. The markdowns were substantially lower than they were in Q1 because we had a significant monoline charge in Q1. But the loss from exited, we didn't make this calculation to be able to provide you a revenue number on that one.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I was just wondering if you can shed some light on your sales and trading debt per the slide 19, 2.7 growth with the markdowns. You're running at the same run rate as the second quarter of last year. In the commentary on the rates, you said one of the best quarters ever. Clearly, we've discussed in the past, spread widening across the range of debt and fixed income products. And if you could clarify what the expression easing of competitive pressure and continued flight to stability means. I mean sounds like if there is easing of competitive pressure, you should be doing much better in those businesses. So, I think, given a year-on-year of 2.7 versus 2.7, somewhat disappointing given, I think, the trends that we thought were taking place in the market. If you could shed some light on that please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, first the sector that's alluded already, some of the de-risking we did happened in this area. And obviously that's a trade-off you run. We are taking out risk. We are reducing guaranteed positions, so to some extent, that will have a revenue impact.</p>
          <p>I talked about the commodities business being somewhat lower in Q2 versus Q1. And then obviously, in our finance and FX rate, we continue to be &#x2013; but you know what happened to the exchange rate, as to that part of our business, and we saw some contraction in the second quarter there as well. So we continue though to be a market leader, so it is a more market related contraction in the FX business than it is a specific to Deutsche Bank contraction because we continue to have a large market share and continue to be by far and we've been even able to widening the distance to the second competitor in this area. So it is really largely market driven, our development in that area. And we're somewhat being punished by a very good performance that we had in Q1 in the comparison. The comparison as you correctly said in a difficult quarter last year, which was the second quarter and if you compare to the second quarter-second quarter comparison, we are at these revenue levels.</p>
          <p>And still overall in the big view of things, we still had one of the best quarters ever in this area of the business. So somewhat, these comparisons make our performance look weaker than it really was in the context of a normalized business. We continue to see, like you correctly said, a flight to stability, a flight to quality in this business area. We will continue to gain market share in this area, but the reduced market levels, obviously, then will have the impact in the development itself.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, obviously as we've also worked on reducing our risk related to Level 3 assets, some of these reduction exercises also had an impact on this business now as well. So in that sense, I know that in a comparison, this may generate some concerns. But we are not operationally concerned at all, because we continue to have our market strength, our market position in this. We're just dealing with weakened markets and obviously also a weakened margin situation overall.</p>
