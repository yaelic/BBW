          <p>Good morning. Good morning, everyone. On behalf of Iberdrola, we would like to give you our warmest welcome for joining us in this event. As you already know, we are going to present our nine-month results followed by our outlook for the period 2012-2014. The agenda that has been delivered to you includes three different blocks. The first one will include the nine-month result and then start Q&amp;A session. Afterwards, Mr. Chairman will start the presentation regarding the outlook. Once he finishes, Mr. Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro will introduce the three different business of the company. I would like to point out that Mr. Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro will give his speech in Spanish. So you have a simultaneous translation, headphones, just at the door of the room.</p>
          <p>The first business that Mr. San Pedro will <mark type="ph" /> develop (1:01) is going to be the networks. And afterwards a coffee break, with no more 20 minutes, will be offered after this chapter. The second block includes generation and supply and renewables, plus an intervention of our CFO, Pepe S&#xE1;inz, related to the financial management. After Pepe S&#xE1;inz's speech, the lunch will be served outside this room.</p>
          <p>Finally, the third part will start at 1:30 p.m. and we are going to host three different workshops. You will find outside a notice board indicating the attendees for each workshop. We hope that you will find the day informative and productive.</p>
          <p>And now, I will hand over to our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Ignacio Gal&#xE1;n.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, thank you very much for attending this presentation. And for those of you who are here in London and those are through the webcast, we appreciate as always the interest you show in our company, particularly in those times.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:25) commenting with me, as usual as well, Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro, which as you know is Executive Director and General Manager of the company; Jos&#xE9; Armada, you know as well, he's the Chief Financial Officer. We will start the presentation of these nine months of the company and afterwards we will provide the outlook for the period 2012-2014.</p>
          <p>As for today's presentation, I will start briefly describing the highlights of the period. Then Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz will analyze with more detail the result and will give a quick overview of the group financial position. After, we would be pleased to answer the question you may have for all of us.</p>
          <p>Just starting on the nine-month result, despite the current difficult macroeconomic and now regulatory scenario, Iberdrola's international diversification that we start in 1997 together with additional information to increase efficiency and strengthening our financial position must provide a solid performance through the year.</p>
          <p>EBITDA of the group amounts nearly &#x20AC;5.8 billion with an increase of 3.4%, mainly driven by renewables and international network businesses. We have grown more than 15% of the total EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow has increased by 6.5% to more than &#x20AC;4.7 billion, in line with <mark type="ph" /> our objective (03:49), further improving our cash flow generation capacity.</p>
          <p>In order to strengthen our Iberdrola financial position, we've reduced total investment by 67%, focusing the organic growth of the regulated businesses. Moreover, we have already closed <mark type="indiscernible" /> (04:06) amounted to close to &#x20AC;300 billion up to now.</p>
          <p>Finally, net profit has grown 12% to more than &#x20AC;2.4 billion with international income increasing by 52% and representing nearly 70% of the total profit of the group. In the other hand, net income from Spanish operation is down 36% significantly impacted by this year regulatory measures, they have affected to our network businesses.</p>
          <p>As I have just said, the EBITDA of the group is up 3.4%. The breakdown of business shows a significant growth in renewables and an increased contribution from the most stable businesses: regulated and renewable which amount, as I mentioned before, 75%, including the Mexico &#x2013; the Mexico regulated generation.</p>
          <p>EBITDA network increased by 2.1%, a significant growth in international businesses is underlined by the negative impact or Royal Decree Law 13/2012 on the Spanish network remuneration was made in April.</p>
          <p>Renewables growth 16.4% at EBITDA level, thanks to an increase in output of 12.5% due to 7.5% increase in operating capacity and 4.8% improvement in load factor. Finally, the wind blows. We've already had years we will not &#x2013; to have no much wind. This year is becoming normal. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (05:36) gains have also contributed to the increase in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Finally, the generation businesses showed some EBITDA decrease of 1.7% as a result of lower output and the negative impact of certain non-recurring charges and provision in the United Kingdom. Again, the contribution of the international businesses to EBITDA has been crucial with an increase of 13.1% in the period boosted by networks and renewable business; we grew 15% and 13% respectively. Part of this increase is explained by the integration of Elektro incorporating the second quarter 2011. Nevertheless, excluding its contribution, international EBITDA will grow 10% despite the negative impact of non-recurring provision in CERT/CESP in the United Kingdom as I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, Spain shows a negative evolution with EBITDA down by 5.6%. The network business' EBITDA fall 16.1% in Spain affected by the regulatory measures already mentioned with a negative effect in the period of &#x20AC;175 million.</p>
          <p>Renewables in Spain grows 19.3% at EBITDA level as a consequence of an output increase of <mark type="ph" /> 12.4% (06:53) and significant efficiency improvement with net operating expenses down 5.7%, despite increase in operating capacity.</p>
          <p>Finally, the generation businesses shows a flat evolution in the period as 19.1% output reduction mainly due to the low hydro resource in combined cycle production has been offset by better prices and the positive impact of the Supreme Court ruling on social bonus. Despite this negative evolution, the solid performance of our international businesses has reinforced the group capacity to generate operating cash flow which amount to more than &#x20AC;4.7 billion with an increase of 6.5% more than doubling the 2011 growth.</p>
          <p>On the net profit, it amounts &#x20AC;2.401 million, 12% positively impacted by lower non-recurring taxes in our international operation. Net profit by geographies also shows our significant shift from national to international activities. The 36% decrease in Spain net income is more than compensated by the 52% increase in our international businesses, reaching &#x20AC;1,784 million, nearly 75% of the group total.</p>
          <p>In order to increase our free cash flow generation capacity and the strength in our balance sheet, total investment had been reduced by 67% in the period. Organic investment, our focus is on regulated businesses, which amount to more than two-thirds of total investment in the period.</p>
          <p>The divestment program in place for the period 2012-2014 has already been launched in closed transaction during this year amounting nearly &#x20AC;300 million. As I will explain in the outlook, we have already additional operation in final stage of closing to reach around &#x20AC;1 billion at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to underline that the efficiency plan for the period 2012-2014 that will be explained later is already as well under way, particularly the head count adjustment in Spain and United Kingdom has already resulted in provisions close to &#x20AC;100 million during the first nine months, which will allow to us to reduce personnel expenses by around &#x20AC;50 million per year in the recurring basis.</p>
          <p>Now, I give the &#x2013; turn to Jos&#xE9; Armada who will represent the group result with more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to everybody. We shall now proceed to briefly analyze the most important aspects of the income statement, the operating performance of the different business.</p>
          <p>As you see, despite the adverse market conditions, the group shows a 3.4% growth in EBITDA and a 6.5% growth in cash flow generation. EBIT is down due to several provisions that I will explain later. Elektro has fully contributed to the third quarter results, while in 2011 it was only consolidated since May.</p>
          <p>The exchange rate has been positive and &#x2013; or usually that has helped the EBITDA as 55% of it is coming out of the Eurozone. The dollar and the sterling have appreciated against the euro while the Brazilian real has depreciated.</p>
          <p>As explained in Q2 results, there are several non-recurring impacts affecting the net profit mainly positive physical adjustments and some write-offs. Net sales are up 8% to &#x20AC;25.2 billion, and procurements increased by 10.6% to &#x20AC;15.8 billion. Gross margin rose 5.3% to almost &#x20AC;9.3 billion, thanks to the higher international activity as the Chairman has mentioned, and the consolidation of Elektro.</p>
          <p>There is also a &#x20AC;225 million positive FX impact. The basic margin rose a little bit less, 4.2% to &#x20AC;9.4 billion as revenues from CO2 allowances allocated fell 47% due to lower prices and lower CO2 consumption.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses are up 5.4%. And as the Chairman has explained, this is based mainly due to higher personnel expenses associated with efficiency plans that will be later be explained by the Chairman and Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro. The recurrent net operating expenses excluding the FX impact actually are down 0.3% mainly to the lower net personnel expenses we are already reducing head count.</p>
          <p>Personnel expenses on &#x2013; rose 6.7%, driven mainly by the above mentioned non-recurring costs. Net external services rose 4.1%, affected by the consolidation of Elektro, higher costs in LatAm and in the UK due to DPCR5 requirements and the impact of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Levies are 5.9% up, despite the favorable Spanish Supreme Court's ruling that exempts generation companies from financing the social tariff. The increase is due to higher local taxes in Spain and higher costs related to the CERT and CESP in the UK as we will mention later.</p>
          <p>As already explained by the Chairman, the 3.4% growth in EBITDA is driven by Iberdrola's international business. Both networks and renewables have seen their EBITDA rising 2.5% and 16.4%, respectively, while generation and supply EBITDA fell 1.7%. Renewables and the regulated business, including the Mexican generation, contributed 76% to our total EBITDA. EBITDA for the international activities is 55% of the total as of September 2012.</p>
          <p>Analyzing each business' EBITDA, and beginning with networks, it was up 2.1% to &#x20AC;2.9 billion. 66% of this amount comes from the international activities, the UK, the U.S. and Brazil; UK representing 23%, the U.S. 19%, and Brazil 24%. In total, the EBITDA of international activities is up by 15%, offsetting the cost imposed in Spain networks remuneration.</p>
          <p>As I was mentioning, in Spain, our networks' results or EBITDA fell by 16% due to the &#x20AC;175 million cut in revenues following the Royal Decree 13/2012, which represents an 8.8% drop in the regulated revenues. As a consequence, the gross margin fell by 8.6%.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses rose close to 17% to &#x20AC;339 million, due to higher maintenance costs, and as we mentioned, non-recurring costs linked to efficiency measures. Also, levies increased by 17% due to higher local taxes.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the UK networks was up 14% to &#x20AC;766 million, driven by the higher revenues as a consequence of our increasing investments and a positive FX impact of 6.7%. Net operating expenses increased by &#x20AC;13.5 million due to the higher costs associated with the complying with the DPCR5 regulatory targets and the FX impact.</p>
          <p>The U.S. networks' EBITDA under IFRS rose by 24% to &#x20AC;545 million, including a positive FX impact of &#x20AC;50 million. The underlying evolution of the business has also been very positive, adding &#x20AC;56 million to the EBITDA, driven by higher revenues from rate cases and an increased contribution from the main transmission line, despite the sale and the consolidation of some subsidiaries during this quarter.</p>
          <p>Despite the dollar's strength, as you can see, there is an improvement in net operating expenses of &#x20AC;22 million due to the storm cost recorded in the nine months of 2011, and a non-recurring effect related to better conditions of our healthcare contract.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in Brazil has increased 9.4% to &#x20AC;693 million, with Elektro being consolidated for the full year versus 2011, when it started to consolidate in May. Furthermore, the 5.7% increase in demand and a positive settlements and tariff adjustments have compensated the Elektro lower tariff applied since August 2012.</p>
          <p>The exchange rate has had an adverse impact in the EBITDA of close to &#x20AC;50 million. Net operating expenses are up 30% to &#x20AC;70 million more, being &#x20AC;44 million are due to Elektro and the rest to inflation and higher activity. Excluding Elektro and the FX impact, the EBITDA in homogenous basis grew by 2%.</p>
          <p>Analyzing the generation and supply business that includes Spain, the UK and Mexico, EBITDA is down 1.7% to &#x20AC;1.6 billion, improving the 4.2% fall reported in June. Spain has had a better performance with an almost flat EBITDA and this, together with a good evolution of the UK and a positive FX impact in Mexico, almost compensated &#x20AC;117 million negative impact that we have accounted in this quarter for the CERT and CESP programs in the UK.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses are up 11.7%, mainly, as I mentioned, to the efficiency measures in Spain and the UK and the adverse impact of exchange rate. Levies are up 2.6% as a favorable Spanish Supreme Court ruling that exempts generation companies of financing the social tariff does not compensate the increasing local taxes in Spain and the higher cost related to the abovementioned CERT/CESP in the UK. So GEM has not allowed to delay its execution beyond 2012. So they have had to fully account it &#x2013; for it this year.</p>
          <p>About the generation and supply business in Spain, the output in the ordinary regime has been down 19.2%, driven by a fall of 48% in hydro production and a 70% lower production in combined cycles, partially compensated by a 5% increase in our nuclear production.</p>
          <p>For 2013, around 30 terawatt hours of production have already been sold at prices above &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour. Net operating expenses increased 3.5% due to the abovementioned non-recurring effects and other expenses related to supply.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the drop in levies as a consequence of the Spanish Supreme Court's ruling about the tariff compensates that drop in the basic margin. However, excluding this one-off social tariff effect, levies continued to rise in Spain by 11.6% due to local taxes. EBITDA, as I mentioned, is almost flat.</p>
          <p>The basic margin in the UK generation and supply business has reached &#x20AC;112 (sic) [&#x20AC;812] (19:11) million, a 22% increase driven mainly by the business supply. The supply &#x2013; sorry, the supply business with margins recoverings in minimum levels seen in 2011, thanks to the improvement of our procurement costs and the increase in tariffs in August 2011. It also reflects a positive FX impact of &#x20AC;54 million. All these effects more than compensate the 23% lower output due to plant stoppages and lower gas spreads affecting the wholesale and generation business.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses have risen 7.2% affected by the efficiency measures and the appreciation of the pound. Finally, as levies have increased by &#x20AC;117 million due to the CERT/CESP cost required to fulfill to the GEM targets, EBITDA is down 14.6% to &#x20AC;195 million. We are accounting a loss of &#x20AC;48 million at the EBIT level. Therefore, remain &#x2013; margins remain negative, being negative in terms of EBIT sales, forcing ScottishPower to rise tariffs as announced last week.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in Mexico grew 9.4% to almost &#x20AC;285 million, while the operating performance of the business has been slightly positive. 1.6% at the gross margin level with better margins compensating plant outages. The bulk of the improvement comes from the positive FX impact. Net operating expenses have increased &#x20AC;50 million, half of it from the negative FX impact, and the rest from non-recurring items due to lower compensation of insurance companies or suppliers.</p>
          <p>EBITDA at the renewable business is up 16.4% to &#x20AC;1,182 million. The main drivers are a 12.5% higher output with growth in all geographical areas. 1.2 percentage points improvement of the load factor to 26.1% due mainly to weather and wind conditions in Spain and in the UK and higher average prices, &#x20AC;71 per megawatt hour versus &#x20AC;68.5 in the first nine months of 2011, due to the exchange rate evolution and a higher contribution of the areas with higher selling price. All of these factors have driven a 22% growth in the EBITDA from pure renewable activities. The operating capacity is up 7.5% to 13,760 megawatts and the installed capacity is up 6.5% to 14,319 megawatts. Net operating expenses are slightly up, 1.3% but well below the increasing capacity. So the business shows an improvement of the net operating expenses per megawatt ratio of 4.6%.</p>
          <p>The EBIT of the Group drops 2.4%, showing a worse evolution than the EBITDA due to the 216 increase in provisions due to the Elektro integration, some non-recurring provisions in Brazil related to insolvencies and write-offs linked to development costs in renewables, cancelled projects for over &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
          <p>The 4.5% increase in amortizations is due to the integration of Elektro and the investments in networks and renewables, partially compensated by the increase in the usual life of wind farms from 20 to 25 years. Amortizations and provisions have also been negatively affected by the appreciation of the dollar and the sterling.</p>
          <p>The net financial results have increased 12.3% to &#x20AC;896 million, driven by two factors. First, the interest expense that are &#x20AC;31.5 million higher, as a consequence of higher-average debt, compared to the same period of 2011. The cost of debt actually has improved by 50 &#x2013; sorry, by 5 basis points compared to the same period of 2011 and 9 basis points compared to the year-end 2011, even after including a 6 basis points increase in the cost of debt of Elektro.</p>
          <p>Second, the lower market value of FX hedges linked to the results in foreign currency. As last year, both the sterling and the dollar dropped in value versus the euro; and in 2012, they have both appreciated. Leverages stands at 45.9% if the tariff deficit is excluded and rises to 48.4% if it is included. On a like-for-like basis, net debt at 2012 year-end is forecasted to be below &#x20AC;30 billion.</p>
          <p>Financial ratios reflect the leverage reduction and a solid financing position. Being on track to meet the year-end targets of FFO over net debt, above 20% and retain cash flow over net debt, about 16% even including the tariff deficit. Regarding the tariff deficit, it has reached a little over &#x20AC;3 billion at the end of September and its securitization is under way, as I will comment later in the outlook. As the prospectus for the &#x20AC;7 billion securitization of additional tariff deficit was approved on October 5, and we have information that some private placements have already been done.</p>
          <p>The reported net profit is up 12% to &#x20AC;2,401 million as positive non-recurring tax impacts and non-recurring results more than compensate write-offs and impairments. Excluding those impacts, the recurring net profit is down 1.7% to &#x20AC;1,850 million. The write-offs amount &#x20AC;188 million, of which &#x20AC;56 million are related to the development costs of renewal projects that have been cancelled, as already mentioned, and &#x20AC;124 million to the stake in Gamesa as announced &#x2013; reduction in value, as announced in the Q2 results.</p>
          <p>The non-recurring results amount to &#x20AC;70 million, mostly related to capital gains for asset sales in the U.S. As the Chairman has mentioned, we are &#x2013; we have already made divestments of &#x20AC;300 million. The effective tax rate is 1.8% as a consequence of the following impacts: Elektro goodwill deductibility in Brazil, already announced the reversion of fiscal provisions in Iberdrola USA. This was also announced in the Q2 results. A new reversion of fiscal provisions in ScottishPower, and 2 percentage points lower tax rate in the UK that we are accounting this year. Funds from operations, as the Chairman mentioned, have increased 6.5% to more than &#x20AC;4.7 billion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to draw some color on the tax effective break. It continues to be quite low and I've seen in the brochure mainly due to the U.S., reversal of provisions. But I would like to know if this will be continuing in the next quarters and how is the outlook for that, for this year and next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. This basically has been accounted mostly in Q2. There has been some accounting in Q3. In principle, the impacts of Brazil and the U.S. are basically accounted obviously. And in the UK, we'll continue because this is on a yearly basis. So we are expecting that the fourth quarter will normalize, but obviously we'll have a very low tax rate for the whole year. And next year, obviously, we are expecting a more normal tax rate in line which is the current that we <mark type="ph" /> pay (27:36) which is in the 25% area.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Alberto Gandolfi in UBS. I had a question on Q4 2012. If you can help &#x2013; perhaps you're going to tackle that later, but if you could elaborate on the profitability you're seeing, particularly in generation activities in Spain and the UK. If we have to expect somewhat Q4 in line with what we have seen last year, I think you had a net income of about &#x20AC;650 million.</p>
          <p>And also, can you give us your perspective on the 2013 forward curve? Since the speculation of tax throughout the supply curve in Spain has been introduced in July, we have seen the curve moving up &#x20AC;3, &#x20AC;4 per megawatt hour. Do you think that is justified? And do you see any further upside to the forward curve in Spain? Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the forward curve, San Pedro is going &#x2013; is one of the &#x2013; on the presentation of the forward plan, he's going to comment about that one. So I think we will not repeat twice the same thing, because it's in his presentation. Related to four quarter power generation, could you reply? I could reply about that about [Foreign Language] (29:09 &#x2013; 29:11).</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As everybody knows &#x2013; I'm sorry. As everybody knows, the results of the fourth quarter are very related with the level of hydro production, so our expectation right now are more or less similar to the last year, taking into account that last year was a very wet year, too, so.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning. This is Pablo Cuadrado from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just a quick question on cash flow during this quarter, you have provided a quite meaningful decrease in the CapEx levels versus last year, but the net debt is still very similar versus Q2. I was wondering whether you can tell us if there is any kind of working capital movement during the quarter that we need to take into account? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. There was a working capital movement at the beginning of the year where we paid some suppliers. Actually, in the quarter, the net debt, excluding the tariff deficit, has gone down by &#x20AC;600 million. It is been basically the tariff deficit that has gone up from &#x20AC;2.7 billion to over &#x20AC;3 billion, which has made the net debt to be in line. So basically, the impact is the tariff deficit. We moved, in the quarter, from &#x20AC;32 billion, that was in the second quarter, to &#x20AC;31.8 billion. The net debt, excluding the tariff deficit, is down from &#x20AC;29.3 billion to &#x20AC;28.8 billion.</p>

          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Shai Hill from Macquarie. Sorry. Just to follow on from that, could I just ask, did I miss it, perhaps, when you said that &#x2013; did you give some guidance for net debt for the end of this year? I'd be sorry if I missed that, and was that excluding tariff deficit securitization and any disposals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the idea is that the net debt, excluding the tariff deficit and disposals in the fourth quarter, should improve, taking into account that, in the third quarter, we typically pay taxes and we pay the final dividend. And the fourth quarter usually is a stronger quarter in terms of FFO than the third quarter. So actually, we're expecting that the net debt, excluding these impacts, should improve a little bit. Also, on a net basis, not affected by the FX, which has an impact on our debt, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just &#x2013; sorry just one follow-on, could I just check on the CapEx for this year? I think you've only spent about &#x20AC;2 billion in nine months, that suggests obviously we're going to see significantly low figure for the full year that you wouldn't even get above &#x20AC;3 billion crudely, or am I wrong there, for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; and the point I mentioned &#x2013; Pepe &#x2013; on the final debt, <mark type="ph" /> including this to X (32:43) scenarios of the divestment we mentioned, is already very advanced state that can be, I hope, closed before end of the year, that should help. I think we are in this moment in the process of close to &#x20AC;1 billion divestment that we hope that they will be &#x2013; most of them, completed before the year-end.</p>
          <p>And second, as the Financial Director mentioned, I think the securitization has already started again. So the prospectus register the first product emission has been done, and we have already the &#x2013; from very important instance of the administration, then they will continue with public and private emission in the following days and weeks. So all those thing is going to help, we hope, in important manner to the numbers. Apart to the numbers, Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz is already mentioning that normally four quarter used to be better than the rest &#x2013; than the third quarter, in terms of the FFO.</p>
          <p>In the investment, clearly, I think we will comment afterwards when we make the projection for 2012 to 2013 &#x2013; to 2014, you should see then the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:58) average level of investment we are planning during these three years is on the range of &#x20AC;3.5 billion, so I think this 2012 is going to not exceed these numbers also. It's going to be on the 3,000 &#x2013; around 3,000 something. So much lower than last year, in any case.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Javier Garrido from JPMorgan. Couple of questions on non-recurring items. Firstly, on the Spanish regulated business, you have book a non-recurring cost for the future head count reduction, if you could quantify the size of that non-recurring item in the Spanish regulated business?</p>
          <p>And then in Elektro, you also mentioned a positive non-recurring item in Q, thinking the first nine months due to some compensations for past year items, if you could quantify the number of the positive fee in Elektro.</p>
          <p>And finally, you could give us some light of what has been the impact on Elektro from the tariff review <mark type="ph" /> in-house (35:14) what has been the first impact on profits and what's your projection of what's going to be the impact of the tariff review on the ongoing profits for Elektro? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think here, somewhere <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:36) is Marcio Fernandes, which is the &#x2013; he's in the back. So Marcio, you are not anywhere? Yeah. Can you, Marcio, reply the third question related to how it's affecting to our sales, the regulatory measures taken by the [Foreign Language] (35:51 &#x2013; 35:55).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the case of the third cycle of the review in Brazil, we have a postponement in Elektro's case. We needed to have this in 2011. And due to the government postponement, we have it only now, and we have impact starting on the Q4 of 2012. And maybe Rodrigo can add some extra information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Good morning, everyone. The impact going forward of the tariff review will be &#x2013; the average impact for the sector in Brazil was a roughly 30% reduction in the EBITDA margins. In the case of Elektro, it will be slightly lower, because of the efficiency levels of the company. You should expect a reduction of 20% to 25% going forward.</p>
          <p>As Marcio said, it will be seen only starting Q4 2012. So if you take our 2011 EBITDA of roughly R$1 billion, and you take into account a reduction of more or less R$250 million, this will be the level of EBITDA going forward. And then in the first three years, things will be also giving back to consumers what was overcharged, because the tariff review should have taken place in August 2011 and it only took place in 2012, there will be an additional R$250 million non-recurring impact in the first three years.</p>
          <p>That's because we managed to negotiate with the regulator that this reduction will impact the company in 36 months, as opposed to the full impact in the first year. So this will be like R$80 million per year in the regulatory calendar. So the first R$80 million between August 2012 to July 2013, and this will continue until August 2015, when we'll have the next tariff review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only an extra information <mark type="ph" /> at that (38:18) Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro, will show us a little bit in more details. In the Elektro's case, we did already efficiency plan in terms of operating costs. And only in 2012 we already reduced about 11% in our operating costs to try to minimize the impact of the tariff review in Elektro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, perhaps, can you add as well what is the impact of another measure with the government is taking, which is not affecting ourself, related to the concessions, because I think most of the concession &#x2013; our concession, no one is ready on the framework. The government is already trying to reduce prices and that is affecting. If you can already explain what is affecting positive &#x2013; potentially positive to our business in the next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple weeks ago in Brazil, we have information by the government about the provisional law. The number is 579, but the focus is on generation and transmission. And even considering some weak point, some communication of this new provisional law in Brazil, in our point of view, the government public measures has been viewed by experts as a very positive law.</p>
          <p>This provisional law defines rules to renovation of old public concessions, especially discussed during few &#x2013; lot of few years ago by the regulatory agents and sector experts and was published now. And the companies that have an interest in maintaining the already fully depreciated assets, to review their prices for an extra 30 years contract.</p>
          <p>And this period of contract is already with defined rules. And only for you to know, the information newspaper in Brazil is about 169 companies with this kind of contracts finishing in 2014 and in 2017. And almost 100% of these companies already expressed their intention to get this opportunity. And it's only extra detail is about an average of 20% of reducing in the tariff fee.</p>
          <p>And in the point of view of the distribution company, our case in Brazil, the measure is also contributes for the reduction <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:11) due to the lower prices. In our case, that does not affect our EBITDA <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:18). So, in our point of view, it was good measures and has a &#x2013; any opportunity to be well communicated, but it's good for the country and very good for the investors there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just for our distribution, our concessions were not reached by this measure. As Marcio mentioned, that was basically an opportunity for those concessions that did not have the opportunity to renew without a new law.</p>
          <p>For the distribution business, I think we can see in the medium term a good measure for reducing loss, increasing demand and also with the debt for consumers. Also, for the generation business, I would see, a little bit of more opportunity to <mark type="ph" /> the new (42:27) investments in the <mark type="ph" /> business (42:29) because some of the big companies were &#x2013; had to renew their concessions now. We can see in general terms very good for our business.</p>
