          <p>Welcome to HSBC Holdings plc's Interim Management Statement and HSBC Finance Corporation and HSBC USA Incorporation First Quarter 2008 Results. Today's presentation is being chaired by Michael Geoghegan, Group Chief Executive, HSBC Holdings plc and Douglas Flint, Group Finance Director, HSBC Holdings plc.</p>
          <p>This presentation and subsequent discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial conditions, results of operations and business of the Group. These forward-looking statements represents the Group's expectations or beliefs concerning future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainty that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much indeed, and welcome to this conference call this afternoon. And with me apart from Douglas is Stuart Gulliver and Brendan McDonagh is joining us from Washington. I won't take up time running through the whole statement that we've issued this morning but let me pick up the key points before we take your question.</p>
          <p>I mean, the first quarter 2008 profit is ahead of the first quarter 2007. The pre tax profits are up in all the major emerging markets across Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.  European businesses performed well with the U.K. retail increasing pre tax profits. Record profits in Commercial Banking and Private Banking. The U.S. profit is down as a result of higher consumer finance loan impairments and the additional write-downs in Global Banking and Markets.</p>
          <p>Loan impairment charges in our U.S. consumer finance business were in line with expectations at $3.2 billion compared with 1.6 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2007 and 4.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007, and this in part is reflecting seasonal trends. It's a big situation, and we're managing it, and I think we are making progress. Also we're helping all our customers, and Brendan will talk to you about that further in this call.</p>
          <p>Profitability in Global Banking and Markets was up; lower than first quarter last year but ahead of quarter three and quarter four, even after write-downs from rising credit markets, etcetera.</p>
          <p>We had good deposit growth in all our geographical regions. And underlying Group revenue growth was comfortably ahead of first quarter 2007, even after absorbing $2.6 billion of additional write-downs in Global Banking and Markets, and remained positive after also excluding 2.7 billion of fair value gains on our own debt. Underlying cost growth over the same period was modest.</p>
          <p>The key financial measures we have committed to were achieved or exceeded. Finally, and part of HSBC's signature strength, our strong capital ratios are broadly in line with those of the end of 2007 on a Basel II basis, which allows us to weather circumstances that might rock others and to invest in future growth.</p>
          <p>Now Douglas, Stuart, Brendan and myself will be happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Roy Ramos from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Roy Ramos from Goldman Sachs here. Couple of questions, Mike; one, is there any sign of slowdown in some of your key Asian markets? And if no, is there anything in particular that you would be focused on in terms of implications for a slowdown for your key Asian markets? And then second question was, I noticed an encouraging fall or decline in operating expenses for HSBC Finance USA. My follow on question is, is there any scope for further restructuring, any further decline in the run rate for operating expenses at HSBC Finance USA? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Roy, and good evening to you in Hong Kong. Clearly, the markets in Asia are continuing in the same sort of pace that we saw last year. Order books remain strong, people are continuing to export to the USA.  They may be changing their pattern of orders, in other words what I'm seeing is more orders rather than larger orders, so people are keeping less stock in the USA. We're encouraged, not only Asian markets, also the Middle-Eastern markets, the Latin American markets, all of these are doing well. Europe, relatively strong, we don't see any sort of problems in regard to credit quality at the current time in the commercial market or the retail market here in the U.K. My biggest concern, frankly, is the risk of inflation. I think inflation is significantly higher than we are seeing through official numbers at the present time, and that is a worry as we go forward. I know you'll see it in Hong Kong and we're seeing it in the other parts of the Group as well. So whether that pricing power will be there to pass on to consumers and wholesalers is a question mark.</p>
          <p>On the scope &#x2013; in regard to the scope of restructuring in the USA, we're continuing to focus on that. Brendan McDonagh, who is now the CEO for North America, is pulling all those businesses together and getting commonality across those businesses, and that in itself is going to hopefully drive down some of our costs. We've moved into our new headquarter building in Chicago, that will mean more things will be taken into that, reducing costs in New York and elsewhere. In regard specifically to HSBC Finance, the reduction in staff, and there about 2,000 staff in the last quarter that left us, there will be further opportunities; not maybe so many, but clearly we're watching that. As I said, as we bring -- to get commonality of middle officers and top officers, there probably may be better savings there. The long and short of it is that we're &#x2013; not all the cost savings have come the whole way through the business and they will come during the quarter, but Brendan, you might want to add something there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, Mike. I think one of the first things that is happening, obviously, is that the organization has to adjust its size to the fact that originations in the subprime market have dropped-off considerably and even if there is some bounce back, it will not get back to anywhere near the levels we saw in '06 and the first part of '07. So you're seeing a rightsizing organization, and that's reflected in the 11% reduction year-on-year in the cost base. Mike alluded to the fact that we're also starting to run HSBC, particularly in the United States, as exactly that, HSBC USA. And the difference between the bank and the finance company is really down to customer segmentation, where we will have an integrated management going forward and I think the combination of all those should see a further reduction in our cost base as we go forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brendan.  Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Ian Smillie from ABN AMRO. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gents. Two questions please. The first one on GBM: if we take the commentary and adjust for the write-downs, then it looks like the, if you like, underlying performance in Q1 was extremely strong and, just to put a bullish hat on, could annualize up to something like 14 billion PBT which is clearly an extremely large number. So I guess the question is, could you talk to us about any degree of seasonality or one-offs which might be inside those numbers which are partially offsetting the 2.6 billion write-downs and indeed perhaps elaborate slightly on the comments you make about slowing volume activity on behalf of the clients as the quarter progressed? And the second question is in HSBC Finance, and I was wondering whether you could add a little bit of color to the comments or the observation that the rate of credit loss reserve rebuild slowed down in the quarter, yet your comments on the outlook suggest that you are increasingly uncomfortable about the outlook for the U.S. economy led by the housing market. And the question there is should we expect further credit loss reserve rebuild to come through in dollar millions in future quarters or have you fully captured that expectation inside the current numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, I'll ask Stuart to take the first question, I'll take the second. Stuart?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ian. There were no single one offs sitting behind the Global Banking and Markets numbers. So, there is no kind of granular one off event. However, what we've indicated in the commentary is that the first quarter, I think, was characterized by very high levels of activity from a number of clients, who effectively were re-hedging their books and in certain cases closing down activities. And therefore, to the extent to which certain of our clients have closed down activities, by definition you can't really just multiply that by four. So, I think the take out from the first quarter is that there is no one off, so there is no one off that you need to extract, but on the other hand I think it would be wrong to multiply it by four, because I do see already in April and May lower volumes going through on our client base businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Stuart. On the U.S. economy and impairments in HSBC Finance, certainly I think there is no question, we identified it earlier than others. And hence, we've had an opportunity to get into this business possibly before others.  And our impairments, while still large, certainly slowed in the first quarter.  However, what we are saying is we are not certain that is anything other than seasonality, and we need to watch this for the next few quarters. Our concern in regard to the USA economy is that there is a concern about inflation, there is a concern about world inflation, and I think this is going to eat into peoples' purchasing power and ability to meet their commitments. On the credit quality, on the housing side, I suspect we are going to start seeing deterioration &#x2013; more deterioration in the ALTA near-prime market and in the prime market; well, we are not big players in those markets. But it is a case of watching quarter-by-quarter and we're not calling victory yet. We've said at the beginning, when we brought this to your attention in late 2006, and in our results in early 2007, we said it was a three-year position. So we got no view different to that, we're talking end-2009 as being that three year period. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Tom Rayner from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. It's Tom Rayner of Citigroup here. Could I just stay on that question of seasonality &#x2013; I'm sort of looking at the delinquency trends coming through in the first quarter in the Finance corporation. You've mentioned, both in the text and in answer to the last question, that there is a seasonal element. I'm just trying to get a feel really linking from the delinquency trends, which do seem to be flattening out, to the reserve build; because when I look at the reserves relative to receivables they are clearly up quite strongly on the prior year.  But relative to net charge off, relative to non-performers it looks much more stable against the same period a year ago, but certainly against the year-end it seems to have even come down &#x2013; the reserves relative to non performers have come down. So could you explain the seasonality and help me get a sense of when we might see a linkage through from the delinquency trends towards reserve build and ultimately the impairment charge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first quarter is always the best quarter because of the tax rebates etcetera that come through the system in that quarter. And maybe because of the stimulus package that's coming out now at the current time, maybe the second quarter will also benefit from checks, etcetera, being issued.  Whether those checks are being used to repay debt or to be used in consumer spending is not clear yet, but in the past those types of checks have appeared to come back into repaying debt. The reality of the fourth quarter, there was a lot more judgmental provisions being made there. We've made a clear good start to 2008, but I am &#x2013; as I said, we are not prepared to say this is anything other than a quarter which we wouldn't like to take as a comparison for the whole year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just say any more, though, about your thinking on reserving levels and what's the key driver?  When -- at what point is it relative to delinquency trends, is it relative to sort of net charge offs?  What is the sort of key determinant for you that you can turn around and say okay, we are now fully up with events, we are not necessarily going to have to build these reserves any further. I mean what is the trigger point for that to happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the reserves come in two formats, specific and judgmental. The specifics speak for themselves, the judgmental take into consideration a large number of things across a number of different areas of the United States. We assess house pricing in over -- I think it's 200 different areas. It will vary from stock of housing, it will vary to unemployment, it will look at a number of different things to make that judgmental decision and clearly we'll take it on the run rate of the book and etcetera. So there are number of different things in this regard. I'm going to hand &#x2013; Douglas wants to add something to that. Douglas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; it's a big season and I think one of the factors that is contributing is that given that the mortgage services origination pretty much stopped in the second quarter of '06, there was a little bit in the third quarter and a very small bit thereafter, we are now getting into a period where the book is getting up to 24 months old and therefore the bad underwriting or the fraud or whatever it was that was really problematic has pretty much been purged from the system.  And we're then into more underlying what's happening in the economy.  And as Mike says, that is increasingly getting factored into the statistical reserves as indeed the probability of people moving through the delinquency buckets to charge off and indeed the loss severity that those delinquencies will generate is becoming more certain. So I think that the driver of the provisioning charge will be &#x2013; if the delinquency continues to flatten out,  <mark type="inaudible" /> so I wouldn't extrapolate anything at this stage, but if that were to begin to tail up then I think that the reserve build would respond to that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next comes from Michael Helsby from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Mike Helsby from Morgan Stanley. I &#x2013; on the &#x2013; when you talked about the 2.7 billion of gains in owned debt, mostly reversed in April, I was wondering if you could give us a comment on the write-downs that you took in the first quarter, whether you've seen any improvement there in April? And also, what about the 3.1 billion of gains on owned debt that you booked last year?</p>
          <p>And just as a separate question, in Hong Kong there was quite a lot of seasonality in the Hong Kong profits last year particularly in the second half, when there was quite a sharp increase in wealth management revenues. I was just wondering if you could give us a qualitative comment about the profit performance in the first quarter of '08 relative to the fourth quarter of 2007? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You take that one.  Douglas will take the fair market values. You take it, Douglas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In relation to the fair value adjustments, that was caused by the quite significant sharp spike in credit spreads, predominantly in March but through the first quarter. Most of that reversed in April. We haven't talked about global banking markets in April, but I think it's fair to say that the contraction in credit spreads was mostly in the corporate and financial institutions space and less in the asset-backed space. So, the recovery in terms -- or the debit that we took, the charge we took in April was because financial institutions and probably corporate spreads improved. I still think there is a great deal of illiquidity in structured credit and asset-backed. So, I think you should take that as a read-across. And now you, Mike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On to the Hong Kong element of it, we don't break out figures obviously for Hong Kong at the PFS level but the reality, as we've alluded to, our business in the emerging markets across Asia are up on this time last year. And we don't see a slowdown in Hong Kong impacting our business at the current time, and hence, the PFS business, which is built on wealth management, you can read it, is performing to our satisfaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I just asked as well about the 3.1 billion of owned debt gains you had last year, too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's cumulative. I mean, essentially you're marking your own debts to market and taking the deltas. So, what we are really saying in relation to looking at '08 numbers, we had a big credit in the first quarter and we gave most of that back in the month of April. But there will still be an element that is cumulative over time. So, we're just looking at the '08 &#x2013; the impact in '08 numbers for you, and what we disclosed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and good afternoon, everybody. I just wanted to touch on a couple of points, following on from what we've discussed already. Douglas, can you just confirm the split of the structured credit write-downs, U.K. versus U.S., and just confirm that that all came through as a negative revenue item as opposed to through the impairment line? And secondly, can you just update us on the Canary Wharf sale as well? There was no mention of that, that obviously didn't happen last year. Can we assume that's off the agenda now?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. A question please on the U.K. I am sort of curious on the statement that U.K. retail business has increased its pre-tax profit. But it sounds like that's largely a result of lower costs, and which in large part is a result of the non-recurrence of the ex-gratia payments in relation to overdraft charges. So, I was trying to get a picture, please, of the &#x2013; of what's the underlying picture in the U.K. on the retail side?</p>
          <p>Also, there wasn't a comment on the commercial bank in the U.K. So, I wonder if you could tell us just how they have been trading, and also how you see the outlook for those businesses at the moment?</p>

          <p>Firstly the &#x2013; on the U.K. Personal, do bear in mind that back in the end of 2006 we called the top of the U.K. property market and gave up quite a bit of market share to others, and we stood outside the market in 2007. In 2008 first quarter, we basically said to the market that if there was a requirement for us to take over facilities which were coming to maturity in regard to short term visa rate loans, etcetera, that we would look at this in a constructive way, and we have provided the LTVs which stayed within the 80 to 90%. And that's what we are doing. We have &#x2013; so we are back in the market, but we are back in the market with what we think are better LTVs.</p>
          <p>On credit quality, charges are actually down in regard to BFS and revenues are up. So we haven't seen a deterioration in credit cards yet, or on personal loans and in the commercial side we haven't seen any major deterioration in corporate debt. We expect them to come through but it hasn't come yet. Again, I think the biggest concern for commercial lending in the U.K. will be inflation. So those are the positions we're seeing, but clearly on the CNB at the present time revenues are up.</p>

          <p>Okay. But just for clarity though, the underlying business, if we take out this adjustment for the non-recurrence of the overdraft charge by ex-gratia payments, are you saying that the U.K. is ahead or is it behind? Or are you not guiding on that in either the retail or the commercial side?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. I have just two questions. A quick one. I probably missed it, but the changes in the AFS reserves, is there a dollar amount on that? And then also, a second more detailed question; is there an update on the fair value of U.S. customer loans, the North American customer loans? I noticed them in the 2007 annual report and accounts, there'd been a $27.7 billion gap between the carrying amount and the fair value of North American customer loans, up from $4.1 billion. And the commentary I think suggested it was mainly because of an illiquidity discount. I mean, would the loan restructuring that you're doing in the U.S. have an affect on this? And what if anything would trigger the transfer of this gap either on to the P&amp;L or on to impairment allowances on the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me deal with both &#x2013; the first one anyway, and then Stuart and I can between us do the other one. On the fair value of the loan book there is no update at the quarter; that's not a required disclosure. So, the figure at the end of December remains as at that date. You will of course, appreciate that in &#x2013; as well as credit impairment incurred, the fair value of the credit book includes credit impairment through the life, as well as incurred, plus a significant discount for illiquidity, plus a significant discount for the, kind of, unattractiveness to investors of that asset class at this point in time, as well as a number of other factors.</p>
          <p>So in other words, the mark-to-market is exposed to all the market based drivers as &#x2013; on top of credit impairment incurred. Whereas in the accounting for the loans as loans what we're recognizing is incurred loss. We don't also give a number at this stage for the move through AFS reserves, and indeed I'm not sure it would be a particularly meaningful number.  We have a very rigorous process that looks at all AFS bonds that have taken &#x2013; either have had a downgrade, have been put on notice of downgrade, or have got a mark that is meaningfully below the face value. And then we go into a very detailed process looking at collateral, excess spread, any other credit support that we might have in modeling the cash flows. And only to the extent that we judge that the discounted cash flows are less than the face value bond would we take a permanent impairment.</p>
          <p>I can't say that in the first quarter there was no significant permanent impairment recognized at all. Now clearly, if the marketplace changes, continues to deteriorate over subsequent quarters, that may change, but as we got to the end of first quarter, we continued to have comfortable levels of &#x2013; comfortable that there was no impairment that's permanent in these books.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Simon Samuels from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, it's Simon Samuels here from Citigroup. I just wanted to sort of give &#x2013; I guess it's really for Mike, a sort of an opportunity to kind of rearticulate, I suppose, the group's sort of growth and acquisition ambition.  Because I think a lot of &#x2013; if you were to caricature what a lot of people are saying about HSBC, it's essentially along the lines that you're primarily interested in making acquisitions in emerging markets, yet somewhat ironically the value in terms of buying banking assets around the world, it's really in developed markets at the moment.</p>
          <p>And since your annual results, you obviously had the collapse of Bear Stearns and further significant asset write-downs and other western or developed market institutions. So my question is two-fold actually. First of all, is there an appetite if the price is right to actually be looking at major acquisitions in developed markets? And sort of linked to that, I was wondering if you can just expand on the group's organic growth sort of strategy. And I'm thinking particularly the move in the U.S. I think to sort of start writing conforming agency, conforming mortgage product, whether that's the sort of a new grab for market share in the U.S. mortgage market albeit a different part to where you have been previously. And also, obviously the move in the U.K., they have got a lot of profile, you've already mentioned earlier in this call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Simon. We still want to focus this on developing 60%, developed 40, but at the same time, we don't rule out if there is an acquisition in the developed market that we wouldn't look at it. But it's got to have a connectivity to the rest of our businesses around the world. Certainly, I don't see that being in investment banking, so I think it's more in other things where we could add value from other management or capital; whatever it may be. And let me just be clear, I haven't got anything on the horizon, yet. But many of you &#x2013; our shareholders have so indicated, we wouldn't &#x2013; they wouldn't be opposed to us looking at something that had &#x2013; knows that sort of profile and we keep it in that process.</p>
          <p>Clearly, what we need to close on and subject to authority approval is the Korea Exchange Bank acquisition and that's what we're focusing on at the current time. And as you said there are things coming along, not just financial services companies per se, portfolios. And I think we've alluded to this at the results' time, we see some value in buying some portfolios where the yields are attractive and 15 to 18%. So we're certainly bringing those in where we see those opportunities.</p>
          <p>On the conforming loans in the United States, that isn't an enormous amount of business, we're not going there for market share, it's just that we are using our network of branches &#x2013; our consumer finance business to attract assets that we can on sale. But that's not a major player. I think where the major focus in the U.S.A., is managing the business we've got, working with our customers through the issues that they have and working that one through. So I don't see a growth play there.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone. Actually, most of my questions have been asked, so just one more on the outlook for the emerging markets businesses. And I think it might have been Steve, or I'm not sure, it might have been you, Mike, who mentioned in the past that you thought contagion from developed markets to developing markets might take until 2009 before you really start to feel it. Is that the comment that you stick with today? And also if I could draw you a little bit further on an earlier question about what sort of two or three indicators you think we should watch to judge how your business is performing in those regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Firstly, you would expect that there would be some contagion between Asia and the developed markets, particularly the United Sates. But, having said that, we haven't seen it, not as yet. As I said there has been a slight change in trend in ordering from the USA. In other words, there has been a lot of repeat orders rather than big chunky orders. So the prices are pushing the stock hold back to Asia rather than keeping it themselves. But it has been a fairly robust order book so far and it looks like it will continue for the rest of 2008, unless something unforeseen happens.</p>
          <p>Where that goes from there is hard to tell. I mean, I think, there will be some issues in other markets, but not necessarily in Asia. But as I said earlier on, the one thing that worries me most is where we're going to see inflation. Inflation is very much alive in the Middle East, it's certainly picking up in parts of Asia, and I think it's underplayed, frankly, in Europe. I'm not so sure we have an accurate reflection of what inflation is doing to household expenditure at the present time.</p>
          <p>And in regard to how to measure us, well, we have put measures out in the market there in regard to our return on equity, our cost income ratio etcetera. And what I think we're all going to reflect in the years to come is going to be quality of growth, is what &#x2013; what is the top line growth really, is it growth that comes back through the impairment line later on? So you should be looking for quality growth from HSBC and that's what we've always run the company on. Not looking to be the fastest growing financial service company, but the best managed one.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was actually talking in terms of kind of macro indicators that we might watch, but I guess, you made your view pretty clear on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the macro ones &#x2013; obviously, the fundamental in financial services is unemployment, and then I think unemployment and then inflation. Those are the two that we watch very closely, the government debt etcetera as well, but that's not been too bad in the markets we are operating in.</p>

          <p>Hi. Just a couple of &#x2013; well, one last remaining question, was to be answered. I noticed that in both HSBC USA and HSC, you've booked late fees and overdue fees. Could you comment on the collectability of these fees, or have these actually been booked in cash or are these just simple accrual items?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Is that in relation to the credit card business?</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, these are booked as charged, and if they ultimately are not collected, then they are &#x2013; ultimately will be written-off as part of the debt, is that what you mean? I'm sorry, I'm not really sure the &#x2013; your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your HSBC USA filings says that your fees went up on late and overdue fees, just wanted to get a sense of A, how big this item is, and B, I guess you've already highlighted that it's not collected, so there is a risk that this might be reversed, is that a fair understanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean the late fees have gone up. Obviously, as delinquencies go up, you're going to have a certain amount of increase in late fee.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Having said that, at the end of the fourth quarter we announced that we were eliminating a significant amount of different fee types particularly in the area of sub-prime credit cards with an impact '08 &#x2013; the full year impact, we expected around about $215 million. Because we feel that going forward, the marketplace is such, you have to have a product which is fair to the customer and just you can't keep collecting and collecting, compounding the issue for the customer.</p>
          <p>So, somebody increased, there was an increase there, because simply you have an overall increase in delinquencies. But it's not as high as it would have been because we have eliminated quite a lot of the fees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a quick follow-on, I don't know if you previously commented on any further thoughts on goodwill write-downs which you took in second half last year at the U.S. businesses or is the group comfortable with the levels of goodwill carried in HSC? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sure, we've no plans for any further goodwill write-downs. We took some significant write-downs in the fourth quarter, in fact the remaining goodwill is largely against the credit-card business which is very strong business and in fact it's been growing over the last few years. So, for the moment we don't see in the United States any further goodwill write-downs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, good afternoon everybody. It's Tim Sykes from Execution. The three questions if I can gents, and the first a very simple one, you mentioned that the income reported from the strategic investments grew &#x2013; increased significantly and obviously significant in the context of these investments could be anything from substantial to major or whatever type in Escrow do you want to choose. So, given the rate of growth of last year, I wonder if you could give us bit more of a feel about how fast they continue to grow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that's the first one. The second one is, if you could add some more color on Mexico where there is an air of caution I think in the system, is what you've talked about before. And then the third question is for Brendan. You've talked about moving to a single strategy for the U.S. and I wonder if you would move to a single SEC-registered company?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean they &#x2013; up several hundred million dollars, more than doubled quarter-on-quarter, but I mean you'll have seen that from their results going through 2007 on a quarterly basis, the results got stronger and stronger. So, it's not particularly meaningful for the group numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, and Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mexico was fairly &#x2013; there is a maturing of the book in Mexico &#x2013; bear in mind we bought Bank of Bital, we had a deposit business, and now we've been putting those deposits to work. We are certainly seeing some maturing of the credit-card portfolio for small business. I think you would have to be cautious of Mexico, bearing in mind its linkage to United States with Nafta etcetera. But it's not creating alarm for us. It's creating focus at this time of the cycle, that's all. And I asked Brendan, will you take <mark type="inaudible" /> in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely. The number of entities we have in United States under for which registrations are under, a large depends on the regulation environment, because in fact, if you take the bank, HSBC Bank USA, we actually have two banks. One charted out of Delaware and one charted out of Maryland, and the reason for that is that you still have in the United States some fairly archaic interstate banking restrictions depending on where you're domiciled.</p>
          <p>So, and then on the &#x2013; we have a third nationally chartered bank, which is out of Nevada, which we run our credit-card business through, again for certain specific regulatory reasons. The finance company itself is exactly that, it's a finance company, it's not a national bank and therefore we have 46 state regulators. So, we are constantly looking at ways in which we can simplify the legal structure.</p>
          <p>Obviously it brings benefits in cost, less complexity when it comes to reporting and compliance. Having said that, the flipside is what I explained. That you are still up against a regulatory environment in the State which is quite complex, particularly when it comes to interstate banking, but I think it would be fair to say that we will keep a very keen eye out for opportunities to simplify the legal structure in the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just have a quick follow-up for that, because that's helpful. Would you be looking as part of that process to simplify the entities that issue debt for whatever result and organizational mergers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That I don't know at this stage. I don't have a &#x2013; we haven't particularly looked at it from a debt-issuance point of view. We've really looked at it simply from an organizational simplicity and the regulatory and compliance point of view, because those costs seem to go up every year as we get increased regulation. In particular I think in the current environment, we are likely to see more regulation rather than less, and there seems to be no desire to simplify the interstate banking rules. I haven't actually looked at it from a funding point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, I mean to start with some in the &#x2013; there are clear delineations between consumer finance and banking and those are the two entities in the U.S. that issue debt. So, I think it's entirely unlikely that you would end up with a single legal entity, because of the delineation there is in the U.S. between banking, which is federally insured of causes and consumer finance. So, for that regard, it would be pretty impossible to separate these and then it would be pretty impossible to have combined-debt issuance.</p>

          <p>Hi. This question really for Brendan. It's about a statement where you make in the 10-Q about further refinements of risk profile and strategies and still evaluating optimal size of balance sheet. I just wondered if Brendan would like to elaborate a little bit more on that statement and if you can give us some sort of indication as to what sort of growth profile on a two or three year view you would be expecting from the finance business. I mean is this is something that pre-provision will grow from here or are you still expecting significant pre-provision contraction in this business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the question from a number of ways. Certainly in the early part of '07 up to the mid part, there was an immediate reaction as you know to the various problems we faced. And so, divisions like mortgage services, decision one, that they were all closed down. We significantly restricted tax for financial-services business. And so, there is obviously an impact immediately on our revenue sides when you do that. And then we made it very clear, in the case of mortgage services, the 49 billion portfolio that existed at the beginning of January '07 is in run-off mode, and we intend to collect that out ultimately to zero.</p>
          <p>So again, a shrinking balance sheet from that side will have an impact on our ability to generate revenue and grow in future years, because we will have a smaller balance sheet. Then we started also when we looked at the remaining products that we were prepared to sell and provide to our customers, we took a different view on our risk appetite and started to tighten the standard there. And that obviously means that's going to have a material impact on originations.</p>
          <p>At the same time in the marketplace, a lot less people are now qualifying, because the model in the sub-prime mortgage market in particular over the last few years was to borrow more money against increasing value of your home. And that has clearly stopped, and I think there's been some figures I think actually in today in one of the newspapers about the drop in originations in the sub-prime market in the United States, which is somewhere in the region of about 80%.</p>
          <p>So, you're looking at not only up, pulling back in less of the credit &#x2013; less of a risk appetite, eliminating certain divisions and products and then equally you have a market shrinkage. So, from that perspective, we &#x2013; that has a very definite impact on what we can grow over the next few years. I think also taking a forward-looking view of the economy, and you know on the risks that both Mike has outlined on this call in terms of inflation, we put in our statement about the potential for recession in the environment in the United States.</p>
          <p>We're not at this stage seeking, should we say, significant increases in growth and revenue. I think it would be fair to say that the emphasis on the finance company in '08 as it was in '07 is to continue getting our arms around the problems, getting the balance sheet down, working with our customers in particular to keep them in the homes, which is very important, because the foreclosure doesn't benefit anybody. And strategically refocusing several of our businesses and continue to do so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brendan. The only thing I would add to that is that as the balance sheet comes down, the capital is released, and we can redeploy that around the group and in our developing markets as we've always said we would. So, it's a work in progress restructuring as we go ahead. Next question please.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi everybody, Robert Law from Lehman. I've jut got a one question. There has obviously been sizable reductions in U.S. short rates during the year so far. Could you give us some indication as to what the impact on the revenue in the quarter would have been if we'd had the current level of short rates for the entire period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Douglas, do you want to take that one? Or if not, I have an answer for it myself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, sure. I mean we've positioned the balance sheet for lower U.S. rates, so the BSM line in the first quarter of '08 is better than in the first quarter of '07. I'm not sure what else you're asking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Brendan here, I could perhaps add a little bit to that. As the short rates have come down and the overall interest rates have come down, we've obviously seen some spread compression on the banking side. But the flip side is in the consumer finance division, it takes some time for that to flow in to the credit card businesses. And, equally, quite a lot of our mortgages are fixed rate. So you get the &#x2013; you get some uplift in the spread. And they kind of offset one against the other depending on the relative sides of the balance sheet. Is that question you asked?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As I understand, like there's some benefit in both the finance company and also from the balance sheet revenue and you're starting to see that. But my &#x2013; the reason I'm driving at this is that you wouldn't have seen all of it so far in this quarter? And I'm trying to get some figure of how much more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. I mean, we've positioned the balance sheet management for falling U.S. interest rates, that's continuing to flow through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other thing I'd add is that, they were &#x2013; those should be some benefit to lending goods elsewhere. But progressively, we will also see some strain that Brendan was talking about and the deposit taking franchise for a lower value of funds transferred. So there is some offset but the major industry risk, as we've always explained, is taken in global banking and markets, which positions itself ahead of the changes for declining rates and that where we are well positioned in balance sheet management for lower U.S. dollar rates.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sorry. Thanks. Two follow-up questions, if I can. Firstly, in the mortgage business the charge-offs were actually materially higher in Q1 than what we were Q4. Just wondering, is that a clean-up exercise in terms of what you're charging off or is that exact change in the less experience within those businesses?</p>
          <p>And then just a follow-up in terms of all the comments on inflation; they don't seem to go hand-in-hand with the comments that you're making about your overall cost experience. So I was just wondering if you could talk about something on &#x2013; from Asia in terms of stock cost and whether they're just offset everywhere else? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the second part and, Brendan, you take the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean, the increase related charge-offs is part that's largely do to an increased loss and when we sell the properties at the moment &#x2013; that you have a higher loss on foreclose and eventual sale of our property due to the amount that's in the market place. I wouldn't call it a clean-up exercise; I think as I said before, is we got our hands around the problem, we moved through the portfolio. We tied it up. You're seeing that. But at the same time, we're keeping reserves up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's also, of course, the fact that charge-offs lag delinquencies and delinquencies rose steadily through 2007. And now, you're seeing charge-offs, which is effectively just writing them out of the book as they go through the buckets, and get written off coming through. So it's not as much conscious as the fact it's just a build up of delinquency and that a charges also falling, one is a lag of the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I am &#x2013; sorry, can I just, should we expect then the charge-offs as we roll forward to be of around the similar levels because it's just stepped up so much? I hear what you saying about the buckets and it's a lagging indicative, but it does impact, obviously, the reserves if &#x2013; as it comes through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The reserves are driven by the delinquency not the charge-off. The charge-off is effectively taking them out the stocker provision and the delinquencies drive the need to replenish the reserves. So effectively the charge-offs are just balance sheet movements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, on the inflation aspect, what we were saying is it's more of a concern for the future. We are seeing it is picking up in a number of regions, in the developing markets, in particularly the labor cost, the utility cost, through all the things that you see in the newspapers. And experience through building construction costs, etcetera.</p>
          <p>And all of these countries are &#x2013; many of them have big construction projects going through them. So inflation is a big issue, a number of them are pegged to the &#x2013; sort of the Middle Eastern ones are pegged to the dollar. It doesn't look like that peg is going to change. So they are bearing that inflation and, of course, interest rates are having negative interest rate. So it's more of projection for the future in regard to where &#x2013; where that is going. And obviously, origination gets involved in that as we go forward, but overall it's we're looking forward rather than back in this regard.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Arturo De Frias from Dresdner Kleinwort. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. I have a few follow-on questions; I hope not to take much of your time. First of all in Hong Kong, you just have a less, I would say optimistic, if you want, wording when you talk about the strong, and you have mentioned already that you see a slowdown. Is this a slowdown coming from revenues and, if yes, is it mainly net interest income? I saw the other day that you are not cutting rates in Hong Kong, which might signal some spread pressures in your franchise after the falling rates in the U.S.? Or is it fees after we saw an extremely a strong 2007 in terms of investments and IPOs and etcetera? So is it revenues or is it provisions, which would be &#x2013; which would be a bit more worrying, are you seen any pick up in provision or any &#x2013; or any deterioration in credit quality in Hong Kong? That would be one question.</p>
          <p>Second one also on provisions, but this time on Mexico. We have had a bit of different comments from several international banks operating in Mexico, some of them have mentioned significant deterioration in credit quality, others haven't and I suspect this is mainly because of the different mix of the banks. Are you seeing any especially strong deterioration in credit quality in Mexico, and is it mortgages or credit cards? What is your personal experience there?</p>
          <p>The third one, on the U.S.; I thought this comment made by Douglas on the fact that the &#x2013; after the two years, the mortgage books will start to, kind of a stabilizing in terms in delinquency. I thought this was a very, very interesting comment and I would agree that in normal circumstances this should be the profile of delinquencies in a mortgage book. But I think the situation in the U.S. is now very specific.</p>
          <p>And in fact, I saw recently some information from the central bank that the curves of early delinquencies for the vintages of 2005, 2006 and 2007 are picking up after quarter eight or quarter nine instead of stabilizing. And I would connect that with some comments made by Wachovia recently when they said that because there are so many houses showing negative liquidity, there is a fundamental change in the behavior of the borrowers. So what &#x2013; how strong is in your view the likelihood that the experience after the GR2 in mortgages changes completely and we continue to see increasing provisions?</p>
          <p>And finally one question about buybacks, of course, it's still extremely, too early to talk about buybacks. We haven't yet completely understood what was the performance of the provisions. But buybacks is going to be a very important feature in some time from now. And I would just like to have your impression in your &#x2013; more of your gut feeling I would say than your impression at this point in time. Do you think buybacks are going to be &#x2013; are going to exist or not, are going to be substantial or not, you see that a 2009 or 2010 issue? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. There are a few questions there; I'll take the first one in Hong Kong. And your question, is it credit quality? No, we are not seeing deterioration in credit quality in Hong Kong what we're seeing is pressure for labor resources and hence cost of labor. Other than that the market is staying robust as we've said throughout the &#x2013; this presentation today.</p>
          <p>On Mexican quality, credit quality, the reason why it varies from bank to bank is because various banks are in different positions in the cycle. Last week we took over a bank that were having some difficult, Bank of Bital. And we obviously, had a liability from a surplus and we've put that to work. It's basically in cards, some in personal loans, and a little bit in small business.</p>
          <p>Overall this is a maturing business, as it relates to us. Others may have different views. And clearly you can see from some of the growth of revenues that some banks are pushing harder than others &#x2013; we're being mostly conservative in the Mexican market because we do expect it to slow, bearing mind what's happening in the U.S.</p>
          <p>On the housing &#x2013; sorry, and the vintages in the USA -- look, most of that is driven by unemployment. We can't tell you whether the two vintages &#x2013; if the unemployment is picking up in a particular area then clearly then the profile changes. But most of the point, I think the banks you're mentioning, they're now finding their near prime, their <mark type="inaudible" /> market books and their prime books deteriorating. So that may be where you're getting those comments from.</p>
          <p>And finally on the write back, it's too early to tell whether we'll write back, we all aware that the volatility and pricing of security does require us to adjust in the quarterly basis, sometimes very significantly as we did for the rest of the industry in March. But it's too early to say whether there'll be write backs.  <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just to clarify, these curves that I was mentioning whether delinquencies pick-up after a year or two instead of a slowdown, where industry curves and where U.S. prime rather than any specific bank?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi guys it's J.P. again, just a follow up for Stuart on the structured credit write downs. We get less granularity on your &#x2013; on the make-up of your structured credit exposures, against some of your peers, I wonder if you could just maybe just give us a comment on how you guys sort of build the impairment charge up from the bottom, if you like, and your level of confidence on that going forward? I suppose getting what we can look at it as the leverage finance lending where you probably bit below some of the most prudent estimates from the street and maybe can comment on that?</p>
          <p>And related subject, can you maybe just comment on your attitude of those assets &#x2013; so are you looking to give it almost as quickly as you can or you are happy with the marks and happy to work those assets out over time? Just see if you can get the high levels back for them in due course?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you'd expect, the numbers we come up with are the results of a very granular bottom of exercise done with KPMG. And what you are looking at is kind of higher level collective total. So, we are going line by line and asset-by-asset and coming up with these &#x2013; the write-downs that we're taking.</p>
          <p>On individual classes, I think its going to vary enormously. I don't think it's very hard to generalize. We are actually very happy with all leverage loan positions and may seek to work through some of them. But I think the important point is that each will be treated individually. Some of these assets classes I don't think will come back, some of them I think may come and, to the earlier question as pointed, they may well be right at- buybacks. But I think it's too early to say.</p>
          <p>In terms of, given this as a mid-year sort of statement, in terms of giving more detail, we have to review whether we do that the half year, but I can absolutely assure you this has come bottom up asset-by-asset and as extremely the broadest exercise. The one thing that you should take some comfort from, though, is we have an extremely little amount of our assets from mark-to-model, so our level 3 assets, substantially total trading assets remain very, very small. And unlike some of our counterparts, our mark-to-model assets are considerably less than our market capitalization, which is just not the case of that rebilling.</p>
