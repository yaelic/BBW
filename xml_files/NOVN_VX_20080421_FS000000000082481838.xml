        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.  With that I'd turn to the presentation.  I will give a brief overview followed by Raymund who will discuss the financials, Joe, Pharmaceuticals, Andreas, Sandoz business, and then I'll close with an outlook and of course everybody here is then ready to answer any questions you may have.</p>
          <p>I'm going to slide number 4.  If we look at the first quarter 2008, the performance I believe is on track, and we see that sales and earnings in dollar reported are higher from continuing operations; in local currencies, and we'll come back to that the picture is a little bit more differentiated.  But, overall pharmaceuticals had a very strong underlying growth in all regions which offset the drop which we saw in the US to a very large extent.  Vaccines and Diagnostics continued the year double-digit growth rate and is now in a preparation phase for Menveo which is the promising meningitis vaccine.  Sandoz has a first quarter which is in some parts soft; in other parts of the world very dynamic and Andreas will tell us more about that. In Consumer Health in a strong steady performance with a good contribution of all its businesses.</p>
          <p>If we look at the first quarter, my most pleasant surprise was the RAD001 results, where we are in a situation to now file earlier, as the patients with metastatic renal cancer who were resistant to a lot of treatments, responded unexpectedly well to this treatment and also the data on FTY continues to be positive.  Then, not really effective in the first quarter, but the strategic announcement on the Alcon intended transaction was certainly news for the market, while the efficiency program, Forward, is just the implementation of what we have announced last year and I think we were well advised go in this direction.  Overall, 2008 should be a year with new record sales and earnings.</p>
          <p>Slide 5.  You see the sales which increased to 9.9 billion, flat in local currencies, up 9% in dollars; operating income 2.488; net income 2.3 billion and EPS $1.02 all up significantly, while we were able to contain the growth in head count to a large extent.</p>
          <p>If we go to slide number 6, it is striking that all regions performed well, but the US and here the biggest impact certainly was the pharmaceutical business, which suffered from the generics and the withdrawal of Zelnorm which occurred last year.</p>
          <p>Next slide.  The emerging markets continue to grow dynamically from local currencies 13% in Pharma to 38% in Consumer Health.  And it is striking obviously that Vaccines and Diagnostics is limping behind a little bit: that is only due to phasing of tenders and over the course of the year they will go to double-digit growth in these countries also.</p>
          <p>On slide number 8 you see the increase in the different businesses of sales and operating income and local currencies, and you see that the most striking improvement in operating margin was in Pharma, which offset what is a little bit weaker in Sandoz and Consumer Health from a margin perspective.</p>
          <p>Vaccines and Diagnostics, the next slide, had a great expansion on the tick-borne encephalitis vaccines and also the Diagnostics and is on track to deliver 40 million-plus doses of flu vaccines to the US market.  Even more importantly the Phase III vaccine trials and registration preparations are on track.  Menveo had the best results ever seen in the immunogenicity of the vaccine infants and with that I think can cover a very important market need in the future.  Meningitis B results after three doses administered in infancy will be presented in May and then the Phase III will -- has started in fact in Q1.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health slide number 10.  OTC is driven by Cough &amp; Cold products from a top-line perspective, but also excellent performance of Voltaren and Neo-Citran in Europe and as already mentioned, the expansion in countries like Russia and in Latin America is double-digit and very dynamic.</p>
          <p>Animal Health continues to gain market share and this is led by the companion animal products and with double digit sales growth in Europe, LatAm and Asia Pacific.  And also in this business, the US performance was rather soft.  CIBA Vision going well DAILIES especially with the new Aqua Comfort Plus growing very strongly and obviously we are coming out of the production problems on O2 Optix with AirOptix now and that's going on according to plan.  And the product supply now is fully restored after the 2007 challenges.</p>
          <p>Slide number 11 gives you an overview on the key initiatives which we have launched.  In Research we had announced that we're opening the Shanghai R&amp;D center that is on track and going well, while at the same time, we also announced the closure of the centers in Vienna and Tsukuba, where we are transferring a number of people, hopefully successfully, to either Cambridge or Basel.</p>
          <p>The Biologics unit, which is needed because we have now 25% of our pipeline in Biologics some very promising molecules among them, needs really a dedicated effort.  We are underway not yet fully staffed and entirely where we want to be, but it's underway.  Step-up with the new leadership between Trevor Mundel and Andrin Oswald is going well and we're seeing here opportunities to accelerate development focus on the right indications and also pay attention to productivity.  I think that is very promising and Forward overall is on track and I am sure Joe you will probably comment more about what you are doing in Pharma.</p>
          <p>Slide 12.  I will not expand a lot, but we have presented the Alcon deal and strategic rationale investing in eye care, which will continue to grow significantly, among other reasons due to the aging population and expansion in the emerging growth markets.  It's a high-growth high-margin business, which will fit very well with the presence we already have in that space and with the blended premium of 13% I think it will be okay and deliver value I am very confident over time.</p>
          <p>Project Forward, the target to save &#x2013; I am on slide 13 now to save 1.6 billion by 2010 can be confirmed.  We are on track and target 670 million savings by the year 2008, by the end of the year; and year-to-date, the number is 160 million.  But more importantly, I think it's not just about savings, it's about speed, it's about efficiency and there I think we're making very important strategic progress.</p>
          <p>And all site closures, which are related to that have been announced and the social plans are either completed or under advanced negotiation.  So, with that I would like to pass along to Raymund.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'm starting on slide 15, the overview and my intention is to comment on the margin development for operating income and net income.  The operating income margin in the quarter is reduced by 0.5%, from 25.6% in the comparable quarter to now 25.1%, and the net income margin is up 0.4%.</p>
          <p>If we go to slide 16, then we have the explanation for the slight drop in operating income margin.  We have positive developments in other revenue, higher royalties mostly linked to the changed accounting for Betaseron which did accounts for 0.4% change, and we have a positive impact on the COGS line reflecting royalties mostly on Lotrel, lower royalties, and then favorable product mix changes in Pharma and Sandoz, and improvements in the supply chain.</p>
          <p>The one -- the negative developments are on the Research &amp; Development expense line, where Pharmaceuticals has invested significantly in late stage pipeline projects and Vaccines &amp; Diagnostics in the meningitis and influenza pipeline.  Finally, other Income &amp; Expense contributes a negative 1.1% linked to favorable long-term effects in 2007 and small increases in various lines across the divisions.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, we will see that this 0.5% negative development in operating income is offset by two positives, an increase in income from associated companies, driven by Roche; and then an increase in the financial income as the liquidity was significantly increased as a result of the divestitures and then the corresponding financial income went up as well and it's also linked to an excellent currency management.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, we give you a summary of the most important intangible asset charges and the significant exceptional items and would allow you to arrive at an underlying growth.  In Pharmaceuticals, the largest long-term items are restructuring expenses of 39 million in this quarter.  Income from major product divestments of 115 million; in the comparable quarter in 2007 we had an expense for the Zelnorm's expansion of 52 million, and then we have the release of pre-launch inventory provisions in this quarter of 45 million compared to 170 million in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>The other exceptional development was in Vaccines &amp; Diagnostics, where we had income from settlements of 49 million in this quarter compared to an income of 67 million in the comparable quarter.  In all other divisions these exceptional items are totally immaterial.  If you then look at the adjusted Group operating income increases you see that the numbers are very, very similar to the unadjusted numbers, as the effect is fairly small.  For Pharmaceutical the adjusted increase would be 11% versus 13, and for the Group an increase of 6 versus 7% -- so small numbers.</p>
          <p>On slide 20 you see then the adjusted operating margins for the divisions and the Group, for Pharmaceuticals, the adjusted operating margin will go from 32.2% now to 33.8% in this quarter.  For Sandoz and for Consumer Health we have slight margin decreases.  And for the Group, the margin decrease on an adjusted basis is 0.6%.  So very, very close to the reported number of a decrease of 0.5%.</p>
          <p>In slide 21, you see that for financial income, we had a contribution of 91 million in this quarter which is 168% more in the comparable quarter last year. That's obviously linked to the average net liquidity that we had available for investments: it went up from $0.9 billion to 6.4 billion in this quarter.  Taxes improved slightly from 15.2% to 15% of pre-tax income.</p>
          <p>On slide 22, finally you see the explanation for the development of the free cash flow. In the first quarter of 2007 we had a cash outflow of 352 million.  In this first quarter 2008 we have a cash outflow of just below 2 billion.  The main difference is in dividends.  Two reasons: first, we increased the dividends -- that accounts for 744 million.  And then we had in addition in this first quarter the full effect of the withholding tax on the dividend: in the comparable quarter 2007 this 806 million or the corresponding figure fell into the second quarter because of the dividend paid being a bit later.</p>
          <p>With this I hand over to Joe Jimenez for Pharmaceuticals.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Raymund.  There are two key messages to take away for the Pharma division during the first quarter.  First, we're on track to deliver solid financial results, so we're particularly pleased with our profit performance.  And then secondly, the change management program that we put in place to position Novartis Pharma to win in a tougher pharmaceutical environment is underway and already improving performance.  So I'll take you through some of the progress that we've made.</p>
          <p>On slide 25 you can see the first quarter sales increased 6%, $6.3 billion that's down 3% in local currency.  This was expected due to the continuing effect of the 2007 negative events in the US such as the Zelnorm suspension and the genericization of Lotrel.  Profit was up 13% due to good cost management, foreign exchange and one-time factors.  We've also begun delivering on our 2008 head count reduction goals with head count down 3%.</p>
          <p>On slide 26 you can see the underlying sales growth was strong at 10%.  This was not though sufficient to offset the continued effects of the major negative events in the US that hit us for 13 points.  And as previously discussed, we expect to have relatively flat sales in the second quarter and return to growth in Q3 and 4.</p>
          <p>Slide 27.  The first quarter has historically been strong for us on return on sales in this trend continues.  Cost savings and productivity improvements have helped and we also benefited from a one-time gain from the divestment of some minor brands during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 28, every region delivered strong growth, except the US.  Europe was up 9% and emerging markets were up 21%.  We have strong underlying growth in all franchises in Q1.  Oncology was up 15% to over $1.9 billion and Immunology &amp; Infectious Disease grew 18%, driven mainly by the Aclasta launch.</p>
          <p>Slide 30 shows that Glivec, our franchise Oncology drug for CML was up more than 20% versus prior year in local currency.  Exjade and Femara also continued to grow nicely.</p>
          <p>Slide 31, our hypertension portfolio is gaining share despite the genericization of Lotrel last June.  This growth is driven by continued strength in Diovan up 11% in local currency and the 2007 launches of Exforge and Tekturna.</p>
          <p>Slide 32, as we've stated in the past, Tekturna is a long-term play for us and we're going to invest heavily over the next five years.  In the first quarter, we launched Tekturna HCT which is our fixed-dose combination.  We're going to generate strong news flow through ongoing clinical programs designed to further strengthen the promotable data regarding the organ-protecting properties of Tekturna.</p>
          <p>On slide 33 you can see that Lucentis is off to a strong start in the first quarter with sales approaching $200 million.  Lucentis is the only approved therapy for wet AMD that actually improves vision.  Exelon Patch for Alzheimer's dementia also had strong uptake in Q1 and Aclasta is doing very well behind strong reimbursement levels as well as the start of direct-to-consumer advertising in the US in March.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to provide quick update on our progress to position Novartis well in a tougher Pharma environment.  So, three months ago I described this Pharma Forward change program that we began in fourth quarter, and we have made good progress in all four areas in Q1.  In development, our new project-based model is up and running.  We designed and implemented new commercial model pilots in the US.  We delivered on our productivity targets in Q1 and our emerging markets are performing well.</p>
          <p>Slide 35, we strengthened leadership of the division in many areas, including development and the commercial organization.</p>
          <p>On slide 36, in development, our Q1 highlights include the FDA approval of Tekturna HCT, which is now launched in the US.  We also received approval from the European Health Authorities of Eucreas, our fixed-dose combination of Galvus plus metformin, and we'll launch that right aside Galvus in Europe.  And also the early unblinding of the RAD001 pivotal trial that Dan talked about earlier.</p>
          <p>On page 37, you can see six of our most exciting pipeline projects including FTY720, which has the potential to be the first once-daily oral therapy for multiple sclerosis with best-in-class efficacy.  Our development pipeline includes more than 136 different projects, of which 59 are new molecules.</p>
          <p>On slide 38, you can see some of the progress we're making on our innovative commercial models.  This is changing our customer adaptation away from physicians and towards payers and providers.  So in the first quarter, we started three pilot tests in highly restrictive markets.  We built cross-functional teams, which include health economics, marketing and account management and we'll be monitoring these pilots very closely.</p>
          <p>From a productivity standpoint on slide 39, we're on track with almost 30% of our targeted savings delivered in the first quarter.  Additionally we reduced head count in our global and regional headquarters by more than 25% to streamline decision making and to clarify accountability.</p>
          <p>And then finally on slide 40 in Q1, we grew nicely in emerging markets of Russia, China and South Korea.  These markets are going to be increased areas of focus in the coming years as we build our business in high-growth markets.</p>
          <p>Now I'll conclude by providing an outlook for the rest of 2008.  So on slide 41, the first quarter was on track and in line with expectations and we are reaffirming our full year outlook for Pharma, and that is low-single digits sales growth for the year driven by the impact of the 2007 events, which will negatively impact the first half of this year, but we'll see growth accelerating in Q3 and Q4.  Profit will grow ahead of sales as our operating income margin improves over 2007.</p>
          <p>Slide 42, shows the sales progress: we expect relatively flat sales in Q2 accelerating to high single digit growth by Q4.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn it over to Andreas Rummelt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you I'll start with slide 44.  Sandoz grew strongly in many emerging markets, especially in Central and Eastern Europe.  Many of these markets, most notably Poland and Russia, now are contributing even more to the overall Sandoz business.  In Germany, we saw a significant market share upswing after the end of 2007 when the old contract with the AOK ended and new contracts came into place.  Sandoz will continue investments into growth in the emerging markets here with a special focus in the future also on Japan where from the 1st April onwards substitution becomes default rather than the exception and we expect increasing generics penetration.  We'll also continue to strongly invest into development and registration and here especially in difficult to make products like the Enoxaparin.</p>
          <p>Slide 45, looking into the numbers, third-party sales are up 2% in local currencies, 12% in US dollars. Central Eastern Europe grew by 17% in local currency especially fueled by marketing initiatives increasing of field force.  In Germany, as I said, we see a market share upswing which is not yet visible in the numbers, as we had an extremely strong first quarter in 2007 especially a strong March before the legislative changes 1st of April 2007.  Operating income expanded by 8% mainly by a gross margin improvement which came from favorable product mix and productivity gains here especially in procurement and our overall supply chain.</p>
          <p>Slide 46 shows that the operating margin is at 18.1%, 0.7% lower than last year and this is basically due to the fact that the favorable gross margin increase of 3.7 points was offset by the increased activities in R&amp;D, Marketing and sales and also our investments in IT and systems in the supply chain.</p>
          <p>Slide 47 shows the growth in the emerging markets and here most notably Russia and Poland as I have mentioned also Brazil and Latin America is developing very nicely, as does Turkey.</p>
          <p>On slide 50, there is a closer look into the situation in Germany. We see a positive market share development of the Sandoz Group.  The reason for this is &#x2013; are mainly new contracts with the AOK.  After the court decision that the tender process has to be stopped, now the regional offices of AOK have decided to also go into portfolio contracts, to sign portfolio contracts as all other health insurers in Germany have already done.  We have signed contracts with 10 out of 16 AOK regional offices, which are currently in implementation: five are already visible for the pharmacists in their software, which is the basis for a substitution, five will become available in this software in May, so we expect to see a continuous market share increase in an overall still difficult market.</p>
          <p>Slide 51 in the US, we had a slow start in the first quarter this year. We are comparing against a very, extremely strong quarter in first quarter of 2007 which was driven by the Fentanyl sales and semi-exclusivity on Ondansetron and Clarithromycin. Quarter one was weaker because so far there were only a number of small launches, the more significant launches to come later in the year. We also saw some higher-than-expected price erosions of our products most notably on omeprazole and cefdinir.</p>
          <p>Key launches in 2008 which are Enoxaparin and Metaxalone are expected to come later this year although the timing is difficult to predict due to the legal situation, due to citizen petitions on Enoxaparin, we have two open citizen petitions on the regulatory approval.  Overall, we have currently 108 pending ANDAs with the FDA.</p>
          <p>Slide 53, gives a closer look on the Enoxaparin situation.  So here we are moving forward and we expect to launch this product in 2008.  We expect to reply to the FDA deficiency letter answering the immunogenicity questions in the next few weeks.  But it's still open and difficult to predict in terms of timing of the Appellate Court decision of Sanofi against Amphastar and Teva, which is pending and as I said two open citizen petitions.</p>
          <p>So, taking all this into account, counting on an continued high growth, especially in the emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe and the situation in US with some launches to come which are as I said are difficult to predict and create a higher level of uncertainty for our forecast, we still count on high single digit net sales growth in local currencies for the full year on the Sandoz business.</p>
          <p>And with this I'll hand back to Daniel Vasella.</p>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I'm just closing with the outlook bearing unforeseen events Groups sales for continuing operations are expected to grow at mid single digit rates in local currencies and Group operating and net income for continuing operations should reach record levels.</p>
          <p>With that, I close the presentation section and am opening it for questions and comments.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  I just have three questions. First one the Vaccines &amp; Diagnostics Division, you talk about pre-launch marketing costs.  Could you just remind of exactly what products these are for, the numbers of doses of those products you intend to launch during the year?  And two other questions, one on stocking, was there any significant stocking or destocking during the quarter?  And finally tax, it looks like your tax rate of 15% was slightly below your guidance at 16 to 18, where do we see tax for the final year?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the increased expenditure primarily for our product Menveo, which is the ACWY vaccine, which we intend to file in the US and in Europe later in this year and will expect approval somewhere next year.  We will start to build a sales force effort by the end of the year and we'll obviously fully expand the sales force next year.  With regard to doses, we have so far not given explicit numbers as to how much doses we will be able to have available at the time of launch, but I can assure you that it's going to be sufficient to cover a very strong launch.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have started to produce the launch materials for ACWY this year which is also included in other income and expenses in the first quarter which was one contributing factor that our overall margin this year was lower than last year.  We will continue to build inventory during the year, so that for a second launch in the second half of next year we should be all set.</p>

          <p>Yes, the 15%, Paul, is our forecast for this year. Why is it lower than our mid-term guidance this year here we have a positive impact from a reduction in tax rate here in the Canton of Basel city: they are reducing the tax rate this year from 24.5 to 23% and next year to 22%.  So the long-term effect of these tax changes has an effect of reducing the Group tax rate by approximately 2.2%.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question.  I have a question first on the gross margin. I appreciate that there is less royalty payments to Lotrel but still this is almost one of your record gross margins and you have achieved that in spite of a negative transaction impact by the US dollar and also on the back of significant generic erosion or product losses.  So, could you maybe comment a bit more on that, and how you see that going further?</p>
          <p>The second question is on tail products, I notice that the tail products or the below 20 product line was down significantly: minus 47% in the US, minus 14% in rest of the world, and that compares to a much more stable situation to last year.</p>
          <p>And then the last question is on generics. You're guiding for a high single-digit increase; obviously the first quarter was substantially below that and if I remember correctly for the next quarters you are going into some baseline issues, namely Toprol, Lotrel, and Omnicef, which started making impacts, and please correct me if I am wrong, starting Q2 last year?  Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on gross margin, I think the COGS performance, we're happy with in Q1, and I think it does reflect the cost management and productivity in the quarter.  You should expect though that the recent currency exchange movements, particularly the strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro will impact on that, it will an impact on the balance of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what's going on the US is expected, in terms of the tail products.  So, if you look at the total products, where we lost expiry or, including Zelnorm, you look at those businesses: back in 2006, they were $3.2 billion, last year they were 1.7 billion, and this year we're projecting them to be 400 million for the full year.  So, we will lose 1.3 billion.  So, in total the &#x2013; we've lost 700 million, as disclosed, out of the 1.3 billion that we expected.  So, they're essentially on track, and that will be offset towards the back end of the year in the US with the launches of Exforge and Aclasta and Tekturna and the rest of the launches.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on generics.  We see that a very strong growth in a number of markets, especially in Eastern Europe and in South America.  These markets have become important growth drivers for our business, as their relative size has significantly <mark type="inaudible" /> I count on the contribution here.  In terms of the US, you're right: it's becoming more difficult but, as I said most of our launches are rather back end loaded, and of course now after three months the unpredictability of these launches in terms of the legal and the regulatory situation cause a higher level of uncertainty for us than before.  But, I'm still confident that we can make it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  A couple of questions. On generic Lovenox and the comments you made earlier, you described this as an '08 launch but, the tone of slide 53 seems to suggest that a delay is more likely.  My question is if a launch does not occur in 2008 when would it most likely occur?  Would it be an '09 event?</p>
          <p>And second question I have is on FTY720.  I think a lot of people look at that product and see good efficacy but also quite a few side effects and I think wonder how FDA and other regulatory bodies will come out on the net benefit with that product.  What is your level of concern about FTY clearing regulatory authorities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lovenox first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Lovenox, again it is very difficult to predict the outcome of timing for FDA approval.  It's a situation that we have to answer the deficiency letter on immunogenicity which will happen very shortly.  We expect that with these answers we have replied satisfactorily to the &#x2013; to address the immunogenicity issues. The Appellate Court decision should be due within the next few weeks based on the normal timing of these court cases.  And in terms of the citizen petitions, the experience is that FDA only starts to work on citizen petitions once each and everything on the technical file is completed, which I hope to be done after the immunogenicity questions are answered.  So I think we have done our part, but now to predict in which month this will happen is very difficult.  Based on our interaction, we are still confident that there is a possibility for a launch in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And if not '08, probably '09, but who knows? Anyway with FTY, Trevor Mundel will comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  So the recently released Phase II data which focused a lot on the excellent efficacy sustained over three years.  To my mind in fact the more reassuring part of that was around the safety message.  To the extent that a number of the previously flagged safety issues turned out not to be progressive or persistent over three years of usage, including serious infections, the PML risk we talked about previously, lung changes, hypertension.</p>
          <p>The other point I'd make is that a lot of the previous use of FTY has been at high dose, particularly the 5 milligram dose used in transplant and also used in that Phase II study.  The current MS program we have is a low-dose program.  So, it has the doses of 1.25 milligrams and 0.5 milligrams.  That's a big difference.  We have now about 3,000 patients in our Phase III program, and these patients are being intensively monitored.  In fact I'd have to say they're probably the most intensively monitored for safety MS cohort that has ever been tracked.</p>
          <p>Looking at the safety data coming out of this study is an Independent Safety Board, which met as little as one month ago and they continue to support the safety of the product.  Overall, you have to look at this: FTY is an effective oral therapy for really a very devastating disease, and to the extent that it has some safety issues which we can proactively identify, so far these look manageable and monitorable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There have been reports of skin neoplasms. Would you say a word about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Dan.  So, actually the general information on the skin lesions is not new.  It is true that effective immune modulators, and I've mentioned steroids or tacrolimus or Tysabri as well have this issue.  And we had already seen in the transplant program a low risk of skin lesions for the high-dose FTY, now the 5 milligram dose. In fact, we published that a few years ago. I would mention incidentally that five of the seven reported cases had been treated with the 5-milligram dose.</p>
          <p>So going back to the statement I made previously we have a low-dose program over here.  In the 3,000 patients that we are monitoring we have of course intensive dermatological examinations &#x2013; periodic examinations &#x2013; and once again the safety of patients who now have been on drug in that much bigger cohort, for some of them more than a year, the safety in this realm of skin lesions continues to be supported.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay in summary you are saying nothing which makes us doubt about the benefit risk ratio that the drug should really be an approvable therapy and in fact probably one of the best therapies available in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the efficacy is really outstanding. As you've seen the data you contrast this to Tysabri, where this really looks at least as effective as that drug.  I think it reflects a little bit on, and people shouldn't be mistaken about this, our approach now to safety is to be very proactive and look at all potential flagged issues.  So don't mistake that proactive stance for actual issues. Things will be flagged in these big programs, and as long as they are monitorable and manageable that's something we can deal with.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's <mark type="inaudible" />.  I had a few questions. First of all is there any further detail on one-offs including restructuring for the reminder of 2008?  Secondly your previous hedging policy was to minimize exposure by engaging in transactions where management deems it appropriate, would you confirm that that's still the policy and if so, how much hedging is appropriate currently? Then lastly, on margins for the BRIC and currently emergent countries: where do they stand currently and how important will those countries be let's say five years from now in terms of sales?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Raymund?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the exceptional items forecast for the remainder of the year, that's difficult to say, all because by the nature of these items they are exceptional and not forecast. At the moment we are not aware of major items that will be coming up in the remainder of the quarters.  For currency hedging our policy is unchanged, which means that we hedge transactional exposures when we know them, if we think that currency is under risk. But if your assessment is that there is no currency risk then we would not put any hedges in place. So it's an active program.  Currently we have virtually no hedges in place for the dollar against the European currencies, but that can change very quickly again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, on restructuring &#x2013; that is the one-off where there could be some visibility. Are there any forecast in...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No we have no further restructurings in the plans at the moment. Obviously it's an ongoing process, but at the moment I am not aware of any further charges that will show up in the coming quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the margins on the BRIC countries, I would say it's not the same in all of these countries, and it's not the same in all of these businesses.  So, overall, I would think that pricing-wise if you look at the product, it's often not very different from developed markets.  And in some businesses, I would mention just generics, it could be even better, when it's not an <mark type="inaudible" /> market and not a tender business market.  And so, I would say it's very attractive and of course the growth rates are high, continue to be high.  But we also know that the volatilities in these markets often is higher, because of reimbursement issues, because of budgetary issues of the governments.  So, it's easy to say it will be bigger, more important, but to what degree, I would not want to venture on that in five years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions.  I have one really, actually several related to the generics business. To what extent is your high single digit growth expectation for the business reliant on the launch of the generic Lovenox?  Then also on the same topic with Lovenox, would there be any circumstances under which you would consider launching this product through the Pharmaceuticals division rather than the Generics division, for example, if you were the only approved generic enoxaparin?</p>
          <p>And then also, it seems that in the mature market, growth in generics is increasingly becoming reliant on at-risk launches, and I was just wondering, what your position is regarding at-risk launches, and which part of the balance sheet have you earmarked to support such at risk launches post the Alcon deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andreas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So let's start with Lovenox. Of course as I said that Lovenox and Metaxalone are the two big launches in the US.  Our growth rate, especially in US, is dependent on this launch, no doubt.  In terms of -- have we considered to launch it not with Sandoz but with Pharma? No.  We have filed in ANDA it's in ANDA process which will, if approved like it is filed, it will go through the normal trade channels and will not require a field force investment so, we can go through key accounts.</p>
          <p>At-risk launches, you have seen that while we have 108 ANDAs open, 51 of them with Paragraph 4 challenges, I think once we have a clear view on where we are with these products we will make a risk assessment, and then based on the risk assessment we would decide if we had the opportunity whether to launch at-risk or not.  So, it's a product-by-product decision, and not a general strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be however correct, I think, to assume that we are not as aggressive as some of our competitors, because I think really -- really they have crossed the line in some instances.  And, that, I think is not something we think is reasonable in the mid to long-term.  And therefore, we are not earmarking anything of our balance sheet that don't have to earmark anything on our balance sheet.  Okay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Mr. John Murphy, Goldman Sachs.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, indeed.  First apologies, but to return to the issue of the Pharma gross margin. To sum up the response then, is it fair to say with the exception of the royalty change with currency and presumably with the inventory release, that the ongoing Pharma gross margin is a relatively sustainable one? Second Raymund, I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more information around the exceptional gain and the restructuring in Pharma what line items would they be in, please?  And third for Andreas, returning to Lovenox with the -- I guess with the ongoing issues on Baxter and Heparin in the US, do you see any change in the way that the FDA is going to be looking at Lovenox as a result of that, or do you think they are two very different and separate cases?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to get back on the question of gross margin, the margin you see for the first quarter you shouldn't regard as sustainable for the balance of the year.  The -- as I mentioned the FX impacts particularly around the Swiss franc for the balance of the year will have some erosion on the margin that you see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just a second if you take away the inventory release in the Lotrel, would it still be true what you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it's not sustainable. There will be some erosion at the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then John your question with regard to these exceptional items: the exceptional restructuring would be in Other Income &amp; Expense, the major product divestments is Other Income &amp; Expense.  The Zelnorm suspension last year only I think 12 million of that 52 was in Other Income &amp; Expense.  The other item, I think was in COGS.  Then release of pre-launch inventory provisions is in Other Income &amp; Expense, and the exceptional settlements in vaccines in development would be in Other Revenue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Lovenox the heparin situation has certainly taken some resource in FDA moving from Enoxaparin to heparin, as could heparin is, or unfractionated heparin is also for Enoxaparin; there is, it's a link.  I think in the meantime it is clear what the contaminant is.  It is also clear which two analytical methods will be used in order to detect and quantify this contaminant.   We have used these two methods since more than ten years, so our supply chain is clean, and therefore we don't expect any negative impact on our product.  So, it's more the resource issue and timing.</p>

          <p>Okay.  So, one question on Lovenox, I was just wondering whether you can give us some color on the studies that you actually did to show the lack of immunogenicity and in particular what you discussed with the FDA, i.e., whether the FDA said that if you show the following results then they are convinced or whether the FDA is still completely unclear on what they want, and you just try to anticipate what they want and will just submit the data and hope it's enough?</p>
          <p>And the product question relates to the Diovan-Tekturna combination data, are we still going to see that in mid-'08 and is that going to be free combination or fixed-dose combination data and what study is that?</p>
          <p>And then I finally have one question on the anemia market, I was just wondering if you can maybe walk us through the volume market share of the three generic erythropoietins that came out of Sandoz -- maybe the combined share for those in the countries where you first launched for example Germany? And do you actually see more pricing pressure, i.e., the likes of Amgen getting more aggressive on pricing now that there is generic out there or do you actually think that the pricing differential between the generics and the branded drugs is still on the order of 20 to 25%?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On the impact of the US restructuring, yes you can assume that the effect will be spread over the year this year in approximately equal installments over the four quarters.  The CIBA Vision profitability, we did not yet disclose it, but it's fair to assume that the operating income margin of the CIBA Vision business is very close to the operating income margin of the entire Consumer Health division.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the fixed-dose combination question on Tekturna, obviously we're working on a number of fixed-dose combinations with Tekturna and for competitive reasons we have not disclosed which ones are coming when, but there will be one towards the end of 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then we have the questions about EPO and enoxaparin, Andreas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Lovenox the interaction of the FDA, the FDA indicated in the letter which was published that they want us to give the answers to the immunogenicity questions, so we are in contact with the FDA.  But as other applicants have received the probably similar deficiency letters, you understand that I don't want to disclose what exactly we have done here for competitive reasons.  In terms of EPO this is launched in Germany and in the UK as of last year. We don't disclose individual market share for countries. In terms of pricing, this is currently stable between the generic versions and the originator product from Amgen, and the difference is somewhere between 25 and 30%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Philippe Lanone, Natixis.  Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Most of my questions have been answered.  But can you give us some indication about what will be the pricing points EPO and Enoxaparin post-launch, because you have a substitutable generics, so as you mentioned, there will be no need for marketing, but will you will be able to control price, or will this decline steeply after launch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this will depend on the competitive situation at that time whether we are alone whether there are others, so I think this is premature to speculate about pricing and we would not disclose our strategy currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If it was crystal clear, which it is. But in general, I would say it's absolutely accurate that as long as you don't have more than three competitors in the marketplace, the erosion is not as dramatic and I think it's also fair to assume that there will not be a ton of competitors entering that field quickly. So I think it should be -- you should look more at an EPO kind of situation.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So the last question is from Mr. Florent Cespedes, Exane BNP Paribas.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen.  Florent Cespedes, Exane BNP Paribas speaking.  Two quick questions, if I may. First of all, on your hypertension franchise, can you share with us what is your view on the new product that you are planning to file in 2010, which is LCZ696, the mechanism of action, and when do you anticipate to show us some clinical trials? As far as I know there is a Phase II, which is ongoing. And a second question on the Glivec franchise: given its strong performance during the Q1, is there any chance that you will upgrade your guidance for the full potential of this franchise?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  David, would you please comment on Glivec first?  Is David not in?  I thought David was here, so Joe may if you would.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just comment on Glivec.  We are very pleased with Glivec's growth.  It grew over 20% in local currency.  We're going to continue to drive that business and as long as it continues we will continue to -- we will support it with additional marketing support.  So I won't say that we will upgrade our guidance on the drug for the rest of the year, but we are very pleased with the growth rates that we are seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, I can provide more color on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah so and in France it was doing quite well as we penetrated into more of the GIST segment and also we no longer see much impact from SPRYCEL.  New indication for filing, the outlook looks quite good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David could you also quickly say something about Tasigna in this context?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tasigna is off to a quite strong start.  We believe we have in the US about 25% now of all the second line patients; there's about 45% in Germany and Switzerland.  So we think the combination of Glivec and Tasigna really makes for an unbeatable franchise.  And then last but not least on the topic of guidance we're also benefiting from currencies.  So we will continue to reassess our numbers and get back to you.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>And Andrin Oswald will comment to the hypertension products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, LCZ, we are continuing to develop.  It is in Phase II.  It's a combination of making these into one molecule which is, I think, quite an interesting new concept to treating hypertension, combining an ARB plus net inhibitor modalities.  We do not expect major data in Phase II coming out this year, but we assume you can hear from that compound in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you have already an idea how you will position this drug within your hypertension portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is too early to tell, clearly we'll really have to wait for this data coming out and then based on how it looks like, we will decide how we will match it with rest of our portfolio.</p>
