          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to the Zurich Insurance Group Annual Results 2012 Conference Call. I'm Goran, the Chorus Call operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will be in listen-only-mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.</p>
          <p>At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mrs. Debra Broek. Please go ahead, madam.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and hello to everyone. Welcome to the 2012 annual results of Zurich. It's a pleasure for me to be here today with our CEO, Martin Senn; and our CFO, Pierre Wauthier.</p>
          <p>So without any further adieu, I will turn it over to Martin Senn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Debra and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and also thank you for taking the time to join us today on this call. Our 2012 annual results reflect a very challenging year, but overall we are pleased with our strong underlying performance and extremely satisfied that we once again proposed a sustainable and effective dividend of CHF 17 a share. As the dividend payment will be paid from the capital contribution reserve, it is exempt from Swiss withholding tax.</p>
          <p>Our underlying profitability continues to be strong. We have made good progress in all of our core segments, and delivered an excellent investment performance. We were pleased to see top-line growth accelerating in our target markets and we continue to have a strong balance sheet with $34.5 billion in equity and $4 billion of cash flows to support our dividend, demonstrating our sustainable commitment to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>This all shows that we are progressing on our strategy to deliver on our 2013 targets. And with that being said, I am now more than happy to take your questions together with, my CFO, Pierre Wauthier. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from Mr. Michael Klien from Nomura. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I've got just two questions. So, first question would be on German Life. As I understand it you have substantial unrealized gains in Germany that you could use up to support the payments ZZR. But rather you're choosing to fund this from discretionary allocation from shareholders' equity at the moment. Now my question is if the environment were to improve with reference rates finally going above guarantees again, there would obviously be no need for further additional ZZR. But any allocation from shareholders' funds that you have already done would be lost.</p>
          <p>So, if this is correct, would it not be preferable therefore to first try to harvest gains to pay for the ZZR rather than pay the ZZR from discretionary allocation from shareholders' funds? And my second question is on the strong underlying improvement in the loss ratio. As I understand, it's &#x2013; the strong improvement seems to be coming from benefits that are coming through now from the re-underwriting, pruning price increases and so on. All these efforts that you have been pushing through and as I understand it, you're continuing to push through further actions. So what kind of underlying improvement can we expect this year and maybe also for 2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Can you repeat &#x2013; summarize the second question, which was &#x2013; is it relating to Life or is it the non-Life?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the non-Life side in terms of the improvements on the underlying loss ratio, minus 10 is that you've been achieving close to three percentage point improvement in the underlying loss ratio year-over-year. And I guess now we're seeing kind of the first effects from low hanging fruits from the assets that you have been pushing through and now that the efforts are going to be a little bit tougher to further the improvement, what kind of improvement can we still expect in 2013, 2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So, thank you Michael. So, on German Life, so first of all, you did notice I think an improvement in the German Life results for the fourth quarter, which was due essentially to two aspects. One is as part of the rebalancing of our portfolio there were also realized gains, actually, in Germany, which did help our results and the other big part was the lowering of the terminal bonus reserve, which will also help these results.</p>
          <p>Going forward, I think it's very difficult to determine whether a realized gains strategy is better or worse in the current environment. You're assuming that interest rates will go up. Frankly, actually, if they did we would be indeed very pleased because overall it helps us. You have to take into account first of all the aspect of how the ZZR works. Remember it's a 10-year average of a 10-year bond. So, the impact on the ZZR would actually take a long time before you would have a meaningful impact into appreciating the ZZR. And then with regards to the realized gains, you can argue that, right now &#x2013; the fact that we do not realize gains allows us to have optionality, I think is the best way I could described it, in that when you realize then it <mark type="indiscernible" /> (06:16) have either going to the policy holder or mostly to the shareholder, making that decision right now is in our opinion not the best environment and certainly if we do stay in the low interest rate environment, is just mortgaging the future, which we do not think is the right approach.</p>
          <p>And of course, we reevaluate that approach on an ongoing basis and I guess good interest rates improve further, then we could reconsider. But right now in this low interest rate environment we feel it's an appropriate strategy. With regards to the underlying improvement and perhaps Martin, you will want to assert it further &#x2013; I think we continuing just on execution of our strategy, which is on rating action, pricing actions, constantly reviewing and optimizing our portfolio.</p>
          <p>We're &#x2013; there are still some further improvement to do. I think on the claim sides would be one of the aspects. But also we can further improve the re-underwriting of the portfolio and then as mentioned, and as you saw in the earlier part of the analyst presentation, we'll also have rate increases ongoing. So &#x2013; and then I guess we're also continuing on the execution of our expense program, which should also help the combined ratio further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add to that, I fully agreed of course. It's very difficult, Michael, to try to pinpoint a specific rate in the underling loss ratio, in fact, impossible. I should say, though, there's going to be a limit how much further that the attrition loss ratio can drop. You mentioned it correctly; low-hanging fruits have been harvested. In fact, we were stumbling over fruits lying on the floor. Now it gets a bit softer, but continue executing on the strategy, which is to work on our combined ratio, three to four percentage points lower relative to our competitors. That has been the plan designed in 2010. This plan is valid until the end of the year that we'll be working on. And Pierre as well mentioned that the point on our efficiency program where we have made good execution by the end of last year and just reiterate what we said at Investors Day, we will deliver as well on that program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Mr. Michael Van Wegen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Mike Wegen, Bank of America. Two questions, first one I would like to go back to the German Life operation. Could you &#x2013; listening to what you said previously, my interpretation is that the strong profitability that we've seen in Q4 is largely one-off and going forward we likely should see a similar trend as seen earlier in the year in terms of impact from the ZZR. Is that fair to say or do you think actually profitability for the full year is a fair reflection of earnings power for the German business &#x2013; German Life business going forward? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two is, in relation to your updated reinsurance program and the trends that we see in large claims and Nat cats. We've seen large claims and nat cats creeping up over the past few years for yourself. Do you expect the updated reinsurance program to have any impact on sort of the normalized five-year average level of your large claims and nat cats or do you think that would still continue to have a similar trend? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very happy to do that, Mike. So to your first question, our business operating profit was 13.3%. We indicated I think a more of $300 million run rate for our ongoing life operation. I think indeed there were some &#x2013; it was a very strong result due to some very specific actions. Going forward, I think 3 to maybe $300 million plus run rate is a good proxy, but you also have to take into account that we added Zurich Santander, which added $105 million to the BOP and that of course we not only expect to be ongoing, but also hope that we will continue to see the strong growth that we've experienced in 2012, and that therefore would give you a good basis for your run rate going forward.</p>
          <p>On the second point, on the reinsurance program, we have a slide on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> aspect (11:12), which is slide 43, which gives you an idea of the five-year quarterly average, which is 9.4%. We obviously watch this spend very closely. We take it into account on our fund going forward. So, I think it is therefore priced on a going-forward basis into our estimate. And then with regards to our reinsurance program, we've slightly altered it and it's on the following slide; and what you will see in particular is that we have increased the retention to $750 million on our U.S. program from $500 million the year before, but we've also increased the top layer and we feel given the strength of our capital, it's a more effective way of protecting it. And also addresses your point which is well if you have an increasing CAT environment, wouldn't you want more protection, which is exactly what we are doing by giving and adding this additional layer to our reinsurance partner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Atanasio Pantarrotas from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon to everybody. I have two questions. The first one is back on the Life. I saw that there was a sharp increase driven by good volumes, but also by the market effect in unit link liabilities and investment count of liabilities of around some $15 billion in 2012. So I wonder if this could inflate in a higher net profit in the Life business in 2013 thanks to the higher commission income, and if this could offset the likely further margin investment margin decrease due to the lower interest rates. The second question is on hedging. Do you have any program to implement a hedging strategy also in 2013 in order to lower capital consumption in the investment side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just briefly starting on question two. If I correctly understand, you were asking if we have an equity hedge plan for 2013. Was that the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, basically yes, I know that this will be something that should expire in the next quarters, if I remember well, and if you think to roll forward this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:04) strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for the clarification. Typically we do not ex ante give any indication and forecast on our hedging strategies. What I only want to elaborate is that keep in mind the context of the hedge we did execute at the time. It was in a situation where we had an increase in the event risk in the euro zone and at the time we communicated the basic driver for that equity hedge was as part of tail out some of this tail risk due to a potential breakup in the euro. Now that tail risk has substantially decreased and at this point we just leave it as such. But we do not know how markets evolve and our investment strategies to manage asset relative to liabilities on a risk adjusted basis and that's how we will continue to do so; maybe I can quickly hand over to the first question to Martin. Do you? Yeah...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I will be happy to. So on the unit-linked, if you look somewhere in the annual report the $115 billion is indeed a substantial increase over 2011, and if you look at the competition, the very vast portion, I think it's around 75%, or let's say three quarters is equity. And the equity's increase has driven the increase in asset management, which would indeed increase therefore the fees and is a good thing for our business. Partly mitigating that, as we communicated earlier, we have also protected the margins, which means that there's a dampener effect as well on the upside and on the downside risk in order to stabilize, if you want, the profit margin that we derive from the unit-linked business. But of course, we're very pleased with the increase in the equity market, but also recognize that equity are volatile, which is why we have this partial hedge in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hello there. Two quick questions. Thanks. Pierre, at the Investor Day, you helpfully sort of gave us some pointers to think about the growth or potential growth in cash flow for the Group in 2013. I wonder if you'd just briefly revisit that. My core assumption is that the normalized cash flow should grow because we should be looking at the bulk or net income number adding back Germany, because that's already been reflected in 2012 cash flow. Farmers, I'm assuming you'd expect to release a bit of capital at Farmers Re given the decline in your share of equated share. And I guess on the changed Group reinsurance program, I appreciate your retention's gone up in the U.S. but the tail risk has gone &#x2013; tail risk protection has also increased. Are there any cash flow effects from that changed reinsurance program? So maybe just the overall question is, just give us a sense of how to think about cash flow trajectory for the Group in 2013?</p>
          <p>Second question, could you just talk a little bit about running yield in non-Life? The running yield fell something like 40 basis points to 50 basis points out over the course of the year. I'm talking here discrete General Insurance only. I think the running yield in Q4 discrete was around 2.6. You guys have indicated you were reinvesting around 200, 225 or maybe just give a sense where you think you're reinvesting now and what further kind of degree of yield compression we should think about. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Andrew. On the potential cash flows, I think you can &#x2013; by and large what I indicated last December was correct. The &#x2013; that the BOP is, generally speaking, a good indicator of General Insurance. We've already incorporated in our cash flow forecast, both the Germany insurance adjustment as well as Storm Sandy. So I think on a going-forward basis, when you look at the cash flows, you would not have that influence, or it's already incorporated into our cash flow forecast.</p>
          <p>Farmers, so you're right, of course that the fact that we reduce the quota of shares does reduce the RBC. The vast majority of the cash flows really come from Farmers Management Services and a 1.5% reduction in the quota share. Yes, it does reduce it, but it's not really material if you look at the total AFR of our group, which is in excess of $35 billion. So, yes in theory, in practice, it's not going to make a huge difference to our capital requirement.</p>
          <p>And then your last point about the change in reinsurance. So, thanks for coming back to that because one of the key benefits, or one of the benefits of the reinsurance program is that by insuring at the higher level, it actually reduces our capital requirement. So we are getting actually indeed a capital benefit from that. Now remember that we manage our capital within a target range of 100% to 120%. And as long as we're in this target range, we do not foresee in principal any material capital action.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But in effect, it's an economic capital generator to some degree, that change of reinsurance structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a way of describing it. Oh, sorry. And on the yields, so, as you remember our maturity on the GI side is shorter than on the Life. And our running yield has indeed decelerated a little bit faster. Our current running yields on the GI book is 3%, almost exactly and then on the &#x2013; so, that's around 20 &#x2013; a little over 20 basis points reduction and on the Life side, we're around the 3% to 5%. This is actually a very small decrease compared to the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, where are you reinvesting GI at the minute in terms of &#x2013; what do you think you're getting on your money right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the very minute, I have information that the reinvestment yield on GI is 1.8% and at the very minute, I would assume it's higher, because interest rates have gone up since the beginning of the year. On life insurance, it's a little north of 2.3%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That was 1.8% as of year-end 2012, you're talking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>

          <p>Right, okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a blended yield, of course, with all currencies taken into account.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Andy Broadfield from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Two questions. The first one's on the combined ratio. A lot of focus on your loss ratio improvements year-on-year, which has been &#x2013; feels like it's been going on for a long time. But I'm just conscious, if I look at the reported combined ratio, and it really hasn't got better since 2008 I guess. And &#x2013; but when I look at my calculated underlying combined ratios, stripping out all the reserve movements, large losses, et cetera, it seems to have got better year on year on year. So I guess my question is, do you think you're going to finally get the reported combined ratio to catch up with what seems like an improving underlying, or do you think this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:17), which is what gets measured gets done, perhaps there's a few things that aren't being measured that need to be measured to &#x2013; putting that gap in? So that's my first question on combined ratio.</p>
          <p>The second question relates to investment yield again, and away from the specifics a little bit, but you have quite a clear investment strategy I think, which is relatively, I don't know, mechanical might be the wrong word, but it's a very strict regime that you run on it. I was just wondering whether you started to readdress that at all, whether you think there's any need to. And within that, whether you can just give us some indication of how much you're prepared to explore illiquid assets or investments as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andy. Maybe I'll start and then Pierre probably will flavor up my response. With regard to the first question on the improvement on the combined ratio deriving from the improvement in the underlying attritional loss ratio, and clearly, we don't have &#x2013; we have all the same crystal ball. We cannot judge what sort of nat cats to hit us. We had &#x2013; for last year we had Sandy; the year before, you remember, we had quite a few nat cats, the floods in Thailand, the floods in Australia, the earthquake in New Zealand, the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear fallout in Japan and of course these are events which do hit the combined ratio. But you are making a very important point, Andy, in recognizing that the underlying profitability substantially improving in the combined which is the attritional loss. But as well I think on the expense ratio, we expect to make further progress as we have this efficiency program in place. And with that we become basically much more resilient, we become much more profitable and Mother Nature hopefully is going to help in the future and that is then as well going to drive combined ratio together. It's just a holistic statement.</p>
          <p>Now with regards to the second question, you called our approach mechanical. I think maybe I find a better translation and call it disciplined. Disciplined in a way that we really are driven by a continuation of risk and we think how many units of risk do we have available and where will we bring these units of risk best to play to get the sweet spot for our shareholders and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:47) as well the best bang for the buck. And so we do not in principle intend to change that, whilst we're always exploring, of course, new asset classes, new opportunities. But let me be very clear, we may be rather intent and be bit late to the game than a bit too early to the game because we obviously want to test all different new asset opportunities in a stringent way before we are executing on those.</p>
          <p>So I would &#x2013; as we speak now we will not expect any radical changes from our strategy, from our investment strategy as we have it in place. There will always be some fine tunings, there will be some rebalancing as we have seen in the fourth quarter. But there will be no massive changes because our liabilities, we do not expect to change massively. And before we put much more money in the investment strategy, you want to think on the equity, put that capital and that risk capital in the underlying business before we then lever up in this portfolio &#x2013; you might even think about how to give it back to the investor before taking more market risk. So do expect kind of a continuation of the approach we have had in the past. And I think Pierre wants to jump in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just two clarifying points, Andrew. Look, at the end of day, what matters is actually the net income, okay, because that's what gets to the shareholder. And then you work all your way up through &#x2013; up combined ratio, expense ratio, loss ratio. So the underlying loss ratio is important, but certainly not the only component. And it is clearly our intention to focus and continue to focus on  BOP and NIAS and therefore we not only have actions on the underlying, we take into account, as I mentioned earlier, what are the trends that we observe in terms of nat cats and large losses to incorporate it &#x2013; and incorporate it in our pricing. We're focused on reducing the expense ratio; as well, we have our expense program to reduce debt across our businesses; and of course also focusing on the net technical expenses. There is, as you may recall also the &#x2013; what I call, Zurich Santander effect which is indeed that you see the improvement in the loss ratio and there is some offset in the expense ratio. But for us and from a management perspective, the clear focus is on business operating profit, improving the overall combined ratio, and not just the underlying loss ratio.</p>
          <p>To your second question, just to complement what Martin said, and just give a slightly more touch of granularity, everything he said, fully agree; that's really our philosophy, it's important. Not mechanical, because it means we do adjust and we constantly review the relative risk and optimize within that. The liquidity risk within our portfolio, as you may recall, we look at it from a risk-based perspective, is 8%. And it's true that from that perspective, there is room for potentially further increasing it but it's all about the risk return and making sure that we understand it, which is what Martin also said. He said look, it's important that we first understand before we go and being a first mover is not necessarily the best thing to do in this, or any environment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may just very quickly come back, I think the &#x2013; just on the investment side of things, I guess the only &#x2013; in part my challenge or question is risk-based models have few <mark type="ph" /> substance (28:33) about the risk capital that any asset class requires. And if you work very closely with that, then you're making the presumption that the model's right, which I guess we have to to some degree. <mark type="ph" /> Not to answer (28:48) myself, but have you tried to challenge some of that, those assumptions that go in? You talk about 8%, well, frankly, in someone else's model that might be 2% or 20%. So I just wonder whether you've re-visited some of those assumptions at all and challenged them a bit or whether you're just pretty happy with where you are. It sounds like you're pretty happy with where you are with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we are pretty happy where we are, without any doubt; and the challenge is obviously coming to look at the other opportunities that we have as you have said with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:18) more liquid assets, but then again we need &#x2013; we truly need to understand the behavior of any new asset configuration, the behavior in absolute terms and relative terms to liability. And of course what we're always very interested, whether we get as well any diversification benefit and enhancement of diversification benefits because that would really then risk adjusted, give us a more return and excess return and just to get more return, without looking at the risk adjustment of that is not how we look at things.</p>
          <p>That's why we don't look isolated at the opportunity out in the financial market. We look at the opportunity in combination with liabilities as we potentially want to keep the risk allocated to assets stable and increase return, or obviously if you take another base, even keep stable returns and lower the risk. And if we don't get that formula right we wouldn't do it. Just to get more return is not a consideration we're doing. There are always two sides to the equation, there is a risk and an expected return expectation. And we feel that we have quite a good experience and a good handle on that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions from my side, both on GI. Firstly the Swiss business reports a combined ratio of 65% in Q4 and maybe you could explain what was going on there and whether there were again some reserve releases related to the whiplash cases. Then on Germany where you're expecting that the operations should revert to business as usual. Now it's been a while since Germany was running as usual so I'm just trying to get a sense what to expect going forward, so if you strip out $130 million of additional reserves in Q4, the underlying combined ratio was probably around 95% which is actually not that bad for Germany.</p>
          <p>So my question, would you consider the underlying Q4 result as sustainable, or were there the attritional or large losses farther below average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'd be happy to take this answer. On the Swiss business, you're right. We did see some further benefits on whiplash. So, a large portion &#x2013; the vast majority &#x2013; I should say, of the result is linked to that. The underlying performance of the Swiss business, we're happy with.</p>
          <p>With regards to Germany, your calculation is correct, but I would like to highlight that Q4 was relatively low in terms of catastrophes. So, the number is perhaps slightly flatter. Of course if we don't have storms we'll continue to be good. Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the reinsurance support in Farmers Re, kind of what is the thinking there going forward? Because as you pointed out, it's quite a small program at the moment, but just wondering whether there's potential for that to increase.</p>
          <p>Second point is, you commented &#x2013; you made two statements about realized gains and unrealized gains, which is that the realized gains obviously had gone up because yours have gone down. And you've done a little bit of rebalancing in the credit side.</p>
          <p>How do we &#x2013; how can we think of what are the &#x2013; level of realized gains going forward? I understand this is obviously a very difficult question to answer. But I mean, overall level of realized gains obviously didn't increase that much year-on-year. Is that &#x2013; given the vast increase in the available unrealized gains to Farm, is there going to be an increase in realized gain rate going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is, &#x2013; and thanks, Farooq. Let me start with second question then Pierre takes the first one. We cannot make any forecast and this is not how we manage the portfolio &#x2013; we do not manage the business by realizing and not realizing any gains. So to give you a bit of a flavor, <mark type="ph" /> re Re (33:39) we did have to rebalance the portfolio and our manager's rebalanced portfolio simply due to the fact that we have a massive movement in financial markets with equities going up and credit spreads narrowing. And then with that, what really happened there was &#x2013; as you correctly stated, credit and spread securities were rebalanced, you had probably some sector rotation; within credit products, there was I think a rebalancing with strong performing sovereigns. There was probably a little bit of raising cash to pay large claims in the U.S. There was, as well, an outright sale of some equities to reduce the exposure to stay within strategic asset allocations and some of that gives you this kind of realization. And if markets stay flat then you don't rebalance; if market moves then you start rebalancing. And we do not predict markets, we manage simply assets relative to liabilities rates adjusted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so, one last comment on that, keep in mind there's a mechanistic effect, the higher the unrealized gains, any time you touch anything, you're forced to realize a gain and since your underlying gains are bigger, the realized gain becomes bigger for the same activity of purchase in a sale.</p>
          <p>On Farmers Re, so it's a small reduction, from 20% total shares to 18.5%. I think the key rationale or the reason why we thought it was a good thing for the Farmers Exchanges is that it does provide further diversification or flexibility. We're very happy with the reinsurance program. We have in place this quota share. So, we're very happy with the reinsurance program we have with the Farmers Exchanges, sorry. And going forward, we will continue to have discussions with our partners and the Farmers Exchanges for our and their benefit of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may just very quickly follow up on unrealized and realized gains. I mean, I realize this is an accounting thing, but can you provide just one more piece of information? If yields remain where they are and spreads remain where they are, how quickly would that unrealized gain on bonds &#x2013; the bond part of it, pull to par?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer it differently. The average maturity on the GI book is roughly five years. And the average maturity on the Life book is around eight years, I think. So, that gives you an idea of how it would naturally mature. But we always have a minimum of the bond sales that we would also have. So just taking the maturity probably &#x2013; it's a little bit too low in estimating by when the bonds would go to par.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. Pierre, you mentioned on the video this morning that &#x2013; around the general review that the remaining phase is not focused on financial items, so other things. I was wondering if you could just maybe give a bit more color about what that means and what other maybe implications it has for other parts of the business.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just, if I may just follow back on some question from Farooq just now regarding the Farmers quota share. You answered the question really more from the Farmers' perspective giving them more flexibility. But thinking from your perspective, is this the start of a trend of much lower quota share participation going forward, do you think? Or at the very least, much more competitive economics around that quota share from your perspective? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the first question which is what's going on, it's really we want to have &#x2013; I think on the financial side we've established what is the financial impact and therefore made the necessary adjustments. What we're continuing to review is really to understand, what were the contributing factors to that? And that's really the part that is still going on and which requires a little bit more time.</p>
          <p>On the Farmers side, I think it is a decision of the Exchanges in terms of how much reinsurance they want to buy. We have a longstanding relationship. We are and have been happy to reinsure the Exchanges over the last year and I would expect that to continue. And I think it also aligns the interest of the Exchanges in Farmers, which I think is also a good thing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you and good afternoon everyone. I have two questions, one on Farmers, the underwriting performance of Farmers. Of course I appreciate you don't own the Farmers Exchanges, but the liability of the Exchanges of course critical for the fee business. I note that looking at slide 67, that the underlying loss ratio excluding Mother Nature, so to speak, has deteriorated significantly over the past years. And I wonder how you think about what could be done and what is being done to improve the situation there. And secondly with regards to the U.S. business, we note now two or three years in a row of good rate changes and I wonder how this has impacted your view on the robustness of the long-tail U.S. reserve of Zurich. Has it improved as you would expect or it is still as a situation like 12, 15 months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so let me understand the &#x2013; let me answer the first part on the underlying performance of the Exchanges. If you look actually at page 67, I agree with you that the dark blue line doesn't look good. If you look just a little bit finer, you start to see a slight improvement over the recent quarters. Keep in mind that we've put significant rate increases through the system; 12%, double-digit in most cases, both homeowners and auto, and we're also taking some significant re-underwriting action on the non-standard order book as well as on the commercial book. And these two are really focused on improving the combined ratio of the Exchanges in order to ensure that they can grow their surplus and maintain their profitability and maintain a healthy capital base. So all the actions that we took in 2012 are really or &#x2013; I'm sorry, that the Farmers Exchanges took and that we of course help them in that are really meant to ensure the profitability and the surplus growth over time so that they have enough capital to support their business. Because these actions were taken in 2012 and that they need time in order to earn through into premium, that &#x2013; these measures are only showing through relatively slowly.</p>
          <p>And then on the rate increases, I think your question was, we've made some rate increases, that's good. How do you see that going forward? Look, we have in many markets a &#x2013; first of all, it's maintaining profitability, making sure that we meet our returns and that we get the appropriate rate in the current environment. The current environment is supportive. I think what's happening to us is also happening to others, namely that we do have a lower investment income. So there is a structural need to lower further the underwriting profitability, all other things being equal, in order to compensate for the lost investment income. And that, I think, is giving support to the trend that you've seen in rate increases and we're hopeful that if the market remains disciplined, then we should continue to see a trend of moderate rate increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And then how does that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're really seeing the power &#x2013; we do have the power and the pricing power to do that as well as growing the business as you saw in the fourth quarter, when we accelerated growth despite the fact that we continued to have those rate increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And should we then think that the reserve robustness in the U.S. is getting better as you get a stronger margin? I think the rate increases are slightly above the need here for &#x2013; to compensate for lower running yields.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we book our reserves as we &#x2013; through our best estimates. What we do expect is indeed the rate increases will contribute for the lower the combined ratio; that is absolutely correct.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I've got a couple of questions. The first one is on business mix. How much impact do you think &#x2013; sorry, German Insurance, how much impact do you think this has had on the underlying loss ratio? Just looking at the year-on-year change in premiums you guys report that it's gone up 8%, so I'd assume it'd be a higher margin business? And the second question is on UK personal lines. Slide 40, reporting that you're seeing14% increase within UK personal lines rates in Q4. Just interested in a few more details about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll answer the UK personal lines and I will ask you to repeat the first question which I didn't understand. On the UK personal lines, we are continuing to take strong rate increases to the 14%. It is not hugely different from the 15% we had in 2012 nor is it very different from the rate increases we had in 2011. Keep in mind that this is a market that is very competitive and which was not profitable by a long measure back in 2010, 2011. We're pleased with the progress we've made. We've substantially reduced our combined ratio and actually are profitable in that line of business. So we're quite pleased with that. And we need to remain disciplined of course.</p>
          <p>The second was <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:08), if you could repeat it, because I'm not sure I understood it exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, just come back from the first question. I think I'm just surprised that you're seeing 14% increases in personal lines given the kind of &#x2013; the rate moves being reported by market indices. On &#x2013; the first question was on business mix in German Insurance and what impact you believe this has had on the underlying loss ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay. I get it. All right. So, look, the rate increases of 14% in Q4, remember this is a rate increase Q4, 2012 over Q4, 2011. Okay, so there were still rate increases going on in that; it's not just a discrete quarter over the previous quarter. And that's what it is. I mean, we eventually will report it.</p>
          <p>Yeah, for the UK.</p>
          <p>Then on global corporate &#x2013; the business mix, clearly the fact that we've grown global corporate faster than other GI businesses and that the combined ratio in the Global Corporate was in the low 90s relative to the other businesses, has been a contributing factor to the improved combined ratio. I didn't do the exact calculations but you could work it out. I just would like to keep in mind that Global Corporate, we're very pleased, of course, with the progress we're making; it's also a volatile line of business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, then. I have the two questions. First one is on top line especially in Europe in non-Life. I saw like, in Q4, Germany was down roughly 10%, Italy was down 8%, Spain 12%. Is this a trend? Is that deliberate action you have taken there, just maybe, if we can get some feel here in how much maybe is &#x2013; FX related as well. So, I ignored that one. And the second question is on restructuring charges. You basically report $118 million of restructuring charges in Q4. Is that it now, or should we expect more to come in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think restructuring charges we reported overall for the year to $100 million of which $72 million for the fourth quarter. And I think you dropped your first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry? I mean restructuring charges, I just asked in Q4 statements there was $118 million. So maybe I was mistaken on that. And you got my first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Europe, I thought you had dropped it. But anyway, look, the point on Europe is that we continue to be focused on profitability, taking the necessary rate actions that are required. We just discussed about the UK where we took 14%. We continue to take rate increases in other lines of business and the impact this has is while we're satisfied with the profitability that we're experiencing in the business excluding Germany, but if you look at Spain, you look at Italy, we're having really good combined ratio. I think it's reflected in the overall 97% combined ration that we have for Europe. And that's really at the core of our strategy, which is that we focus on getting the return required for the risk-based capital at &#x2013; in these, if needed at the expense of limiting our work. In Europe, we have very limited growth &#x2013; GDP growth overall, and we're seeing the impact of the recession on our ability to grow premium.</p>

          <p>Oh, hey, good afternoon. Just I wanted to put the focus a bit more on the Global Corporate growth. I mean, it's been local currency flat for two years and suddenly in the fourth quarter, we've seen &#x2013; probably 15%, 18% growth, local currency basis. There could be one-off contracts, but could you give some color on where this is coming from? Why this is happening now? Is it pent up demand over two years, is it &#x2013; but, I've also noted that the price increases remains constant. So clearly you're still being disciplined along with this growth. And that's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second thing, on the Life &#x2013; just staying on the risk margin side, there has been an uptick although in the fourth quarter there was also an expense margin increase. But, there has been an uptick in the Life risk margins and if you could just comment on &#x2013; is it fair to assume that that trend kind of increases or stabilizes going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, look, in Global Corporate, yes, we have been experiencing strong growth. I mean, it's mostly in North American and in Asia &#x2013; sorry, in international markets. Europe growth has been <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:16) growth has been more subdued. We've seen strong successes, we've won a major contract. I think we enjoy a very promising <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:23) Global Corporate and I think that is the underlying reason of the progress. The results &#x2013; so just to keep in mind as we show it on slide nine, there has been a transfer right between North America Commercial and Global Corporate. So while the reported growth in Global Corporate is 12%, it's 9% on a like-for-like basis. So, that's &#x2013; within that 9% I think it's fundamentally, I think we're doing a good job versus our competitors. It's just as simple as that. And we've been in this Global Corporate business for a while, been very focused on that business. I think we're starting to see the dividends paying out.</p>
          <p>And then on the risk margin, I think you were referring to the business operating &#x2013; no, sorry. By source, the risk margin improvement has, in local currency, actually improved slightly even though you see here on a reported basis a slight decrease and then there has been some negative impact on the &#x2013; in the U.S., which has &#x2013; and was a one-off effect and has had an influence on that results.</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, all together. I have a sentimental question and the very simple one. The sentimental question is following. We had a pretty benign claims year overall in terms of nat cat. Because at the end of the day, yes, we had Sandy, but business even exposed to natural cat budget of companies and those are for you. It was a claim but nothing dramatically. Still is it away from 17% of your bulk?</p>
          <p>And actually it provokes volatility into your results. So, the question is &#x2013; and sorry that I go back to this reinsurance coverage. But what we're seeing is an increasing amount of nat cat. We are seeing retention rate of primary insurance company and you in line with those as well going into this trend. But it seems, actually, that we are assisting to earnings volatility shift from the primary, from the reinsurance to the primary offer.</p>
          <p>And so my question is, are the market share becoming very tough or the prices of the insurer &#x2013; or the insurance, which are too high or is actually the appetite is for more underwriting risk, which start to take &#x2013; to force, actually, company to take more risk of charge of the shareholders. So, it's really a fundamental question I need to understand why you did this increase of retention.</p>
          <p>And the second one is a very simple one; if you could update on the dividend BOP of the one without tax charge after this year's dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer perhaps the second question because it's simple. We have about $10 billion of remaining additional paid in capital. The proposed dividend would amount to $2.5 billion, roughly speaking, which after dividend means that the remaining reserve would be around $7.5 billion to $8 billion. On the more fundamental question, it's &#x2013; look, if you look at our program relative to our peers of a similar size, our retention is towards the lower end, interestingly, and then many others have a much higher retention. And for us it's really being about what is the right balance between the retention we hold, our capital position and what it does on economic solvency. And the reasoning has been that we have a strong capital, the last reported one was 110%, double A solvency ratio, 178% SSP, and the benefit of that is that if you do believe indeed in the trend of increasing catastrophes, and then actually increasing the higher layers would be the thing to do. It protects our capital base, protects our solvency. That's why I mentioned &#x2013; and it's mentioned on page 44, that we have an overall reduction in RBC.</p>
          <p>Now it's true that then any of the losses between $500 million and $750 million would hit us harder. If you go just a little bit further into the details of this coverage though, you will also notice that we have also reduced the co-insurance part. The co-insurance part last year was 36% on average. We've now reduced to 10%, so that we get a much better protection at the $750 million layer. So overall when we look at all these things, we feel this is a better protection and yes, we could argue about it that you can a different view. But I think given where we are and what we want to achieve, we felt it better suited our earnings.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry for coming back on this one, but the increase that we are assisting on the nat cat, not on frequency actually.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The frequency's actually the problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you will notice actually that we, first of all, have a global aggregate cat treaty and we have further increased the level of coverage for this global aggregate cat treaty for exactly your point. So, we agree with you.</p>

          <p>The last question for today is from the Mr. Andreas Frick from Bank am Bellevue. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. And thank you very much. I just have a, I think a very simple monitor again. Sorry for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:50) on the German non-Life reserve strengthening. We all know you have announced $426 million reserve strengthening for Q3, 2012. Now, I have recorded, in my model also $100 million reserve strengthening for the second quarter 2012. And then also $100 million for the third quarter 2011 and $120 million for the fourth quarter 2011. And as I understand now, as you say in the press release, you have $60 million for the lines impacted in the previous quarter plus another $70 million for other business lines.</p>
          <p>So, I would say there is not additional reserve strengthening in Q4, 2012 of $130 million, for the first question, is that correct? And then, if that would be correct, I had a $656 million reserve strengthening in 2012 overall. And if I compare that with your slide 10, where you have the underlying loss ratio, then I have a number for the Germany reserve increased in the third and fourth quarter of $372 million, which is far below my number of $656 million. Can you maybe explain where I do the mistakes on the calculation?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and in closing I would like to note that there were a number of factors, complicating factors affecting our results in 2012. It is a challenging economic environment, weather-related claims such as Sandy, we've spoken about it and we have also spoken about reserving issues in our German General Insurance business.</p>
          <p>With all this, we delivered a strong underlying performance with improved underlying profitability and I want to stress that our group continues to generate strong sustainable cash flows. We remain focused on the execution of our strategy. We are growing where we want to grow and we are very well capitalized with our solvency at double A target range. We remain committed to delivering sustainable long term value to our shareholders and to being, of course, as this is our high ambition, the best global insurer. We measure that; we measure that in terms of our customer satisfaction. We measure that with regards to our employee engagement and we measure that as well with our shareholder satisfaction i.e., total shareholder return we're able to generate with all of that.</p>
          <p>And I want to thank you for now for the dialogue, for your questions, for your critical feedback we always receive. We tremendously appreciate that. This is a basis for us to continue to improve in how we run Zurich. And I wish you a great rest of the day and good luck in the market. Thank you.</p>
