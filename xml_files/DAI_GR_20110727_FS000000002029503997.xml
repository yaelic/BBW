          <p>Michael M&#xFC;hlbayer speaking, on behalf of Daimler, I would like to welcome you on both the telephone and the Internet to our Q2 Results Conference. We are happy to have with us today the Chairman of the Board of Management and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, Dr. Dieter Zetsche; our CFO Bodo Uebber; and the Head of Daimler Trucks, Andreas Renschler.</p>
          <p>In order to give you maximum time for your questions, Dr. Zetsche will begin with a short introduction directly followed by Q&amp;A. Now I would like to hand over to Dr. Dieter Zetsche.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael. Ladies and gentlemen, we announced our second quarter numbers earlier today, and they are good numbers. At the Group level, we posted EBIT of &#x20AC;2.6 billion. That is an increase of 23% compared to the previous year and one of our all time best quarterly results. Group earnings at &#x20AC;1.7 billion were also at a record level. At the same time, our industrial operations generated solid free cash flow in spite of Mercedes investments in new products, technologies, and markets. In the second quarter, it reached &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Our net liquidity remains high, although we paid out roughly &#x20AC;2 billion in dividends. So how did our individual divisions perform from April through June? Let's start with our Passenger Car business, which sold more vehicles than ever before in the second quarter. Even compared to the first quarter of this year sales climbed further still at both Mercedes-Benz and smart. Production is in the fast lane. With exception of those plants affected by model changes, all others are running with extra shifts. We anticipate continuing production right through summer and next winter.</p>
          <p>At &#x20AC;1.6 billion, our results at Mercedes Benz Cars also set a new best. Never before has second quarter EBIT at our Passenger Car division been higher. Our return on sales was 10.7% and with that we exceeded our targeted long-term average mark of 10% in the second quarter and with an RS of 10% for the entire first half we're right on track.</p>
          <p>On the product side, our new model offensive continues unabated. After bringing the refreshed C-Class, the new C-Coupe and the new SLK to the market in the first half, we will now add even more. The new M-Class will be available in the fall. In addition we'll sound the charge on the compact segment at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt where we will introduce our new B-Class. We believe we can achieve sales of more than 1.35 million units for the year and that would fulfill our expectation of making the anniversary year of the automobile a record sales year.</p>
          <p>Full year results for our Passenger Car business are likely to be higher than 2010 even if EBIT in the second half is slightly under that of the first half due to our many product launches, unfavorable developments in currency exchange rates and higher raw material costs. On the whole, our trend toward sustainable high profitability will continue.</p>
          <p>Now how do things stand at Daimler Trucks? The short answer is also good. Business is picking up at Trucks Europe. Latin America our truck sales increased by nearly one-third. At Trucks NAFTA sales are up by more than one half. Sales were only down at Truck Asia as a result of production interruptions at our suppliers in Japan.</p>
          <p>The good news is this: overall the catastrophe in Japan had a less dramatic effect on full year than feared. We booked a total of &#x20AC;38 million in extraordinary expenditures in the first half related to damages and production losses. There was added pressure due to a sharp drop in sales and revenues.</p>
          <p>Worldwide our Commercial Truck business recorded EBIT of &#x20AC;474 million in the second quarter. In the second half of this year, we expect on the one hand, high expenditures at Daimler Trucks primarily due to preparation for the new Euro VI standard, the market introduction of the new Actros as well as our continued expansion in growth markets. On the other hand our Truck business will noticeably pickup. Our order books are well filled, incoming orders in the first half of the year were consistently higher than sales. The bottom line is that Truck's second half EBIT will come in higher than the first.</p>
          <p>One of the many sources of our confidence in the Truck business is the aforementioned Actros. We're convinced it's the best product in the market by far. We put 10 years and invested about &#x20AC;2 billion into the development of this truck and both will now pay off. At the same time, with the acquisition of Tognum we created an additional source of revenue that is closely tied to our core business. Together with Rolls-Royce, we secured 94.2% of the stock at the close of the offering period.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our Van business, it generated EBIT of &#x20AC;206 million in the second quarter. That's the second best result in the past 10 years. Return on sales was 9.2%, again even higher than our long-term objective. In the second half, we intend to make a strong improvement in sales, first and foremost in China where the market launch of Sprinter is imminent</p>
          <p>Daimler Buses generated second quarter EBIT of &#x20AC;61 million. While business in Latin America and Turkey is going well, the market for complete buses in Western Europe and North America remains weak. 2011 full year sales at Daimler Buses should still come in higher than last year.</p>
          <p>Daimler Financial Services with EBIT of &#x20AC;340 million markedly exceeded the prior year's result. Expenditures for risk and interest rates both developed advantageously. We anticipate further growth in new business and contract volume in the second half. So much for current development and our perspectives on our individual businesses.</p>
          <p>Next, what does this all mean for our outlook at the Group level. For the full-year Group EBIT from ongoing business is developing better than expected. It will clearly come in higher than the previous year's result. One reason is our good performance in the first half; another is the continued improvement in automobile markets. That leads us to expect that 2011 full-year revenue will significantly top the &#x20AC;100 billion mark. This all goes to show that in mid-2011 we are not only on plan but ahead of it. Yet, we are still not yet driving our highest gear, we are capable of more. Therefore, we are confident we are on the right path to achieve our long-term average return on sales goals on a sustainable basis in 2013 at the latest.</p>
          <p>Now, Andreas Renschler, Bodo Uebber and I look forward to your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much Dr. Zetsche. Ladies and gentlemen, you may ask your questions now. I will identify the questioner by name but please also introduce yourself with your name and the name of the organization before asking your questions. Two practical points, firstly please avoid English mobile phones and secondly please ask your question in English. Before we start, the operator will explain the procedure.</p>

          <p>So, we will take the first question from John Lawson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much indeed, good afternoon. John Lawson from Citi. Could I first ask about the costs that you must have incurred, even if not as an extraordinary nature, but certainly rather high costs in Japan in the quarter, you were 7,000 trucks down in Asia deliveries overall, I mean, is that a reasonable guide to your lost production in Japan, and can you help us in any further way to understand the impact of that disruption in the second quarter?</p>
          <p>Second question, you did have a very hefty, I think, around 26% ROE in your Financial Services in the second quarter. That's quite materially above your guidance for the running rate and I wondered if you could help us understand how clean the Financial Services number is whether there is much provision release still running through there.</p>
          <p>And then finally I note your decision on funding pensions or pending decision on that? You've got just over &#x20AC;5 billion if I'm not wrong of under funded status in Germany at the moment, do you plan to fully close that gap over time or is this &#x20AC;2 billion the measure of it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John, I try to answer your first question in terms of the situation we have at Japan. First of all the second quarter of Fuso is from March to May that means always one month behind so it was more or less fully impact the second quarter at Fuso from the earthquake and all this other issues that are connected with that. Basically it's tough to say like we said production was more or less on a very limited number, got close to zero because we had no suppliers who could deliver it. And though we lost if we compare this to the second quarter of 2010 at least &#x20AC;300 million to &#x20AC;400 million in revenue. This gives you an indication to that and of course the domestic market is a very important one for us at Fuso, though the Japanese market in other words and this includes of course after sales &#x2013; and sales that we lost there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, to your remaining questions, first to your Financial Services question whether the &#x20AC;340 million are clean and the run rate. So we had &#x20AC;20 million of releases of provisions. So that makes a &#x20AC;340 million pretty clean. It's &#x20AC;320 million. But we expect the next quarter the run rate of &#x20AC;250 million. It depends a little bit on the credit loss development. If it is so low as it was of course in the second quarter it needs to be seen, so minimum I don't think &#x20AC;250 million in quarter is out to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question to pensions, with regards to pensions we will put, have yet decided on that at the Supervisory Board. So we have the official goal to do that and we will put &#x20AC;2 billion once into the German pension plans. &#x20AC;1.5 million (sic) [&#x20AC;1.5 billion] (13:12) most probably in the third quarter and &#x20AC;500 million in the fourth quarter and that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have no further plans or further steps in this regard?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We take the next question from Christian Breitsprecher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. I have a question little bit with regard to your guidance. I mean on the one hand I think you said that definitely H1 came in better than expected, but when we look at the general macro framework I think the conditions have become probably tougher than what they looked like five to six months ago so what I want to know, how is your confidence with regard to the second half of this year, has that also improved significantly versus what the picture looked like three, four months ago or is the upgrade in guidance mainly a function of the very strong first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a combination of both. Of course, we see what's going on in the U.S., the Euro zone, in China and we see the clouds and the increased risks. At the same time, we see our order intake, we see the mood in our markets and we are definitely ratcheting up production, for instance on the car side to the last unit possible in order to satisfy the &#x2013; to a high extent already existing demand. We were not able to fulfill their demand in the first half to the full extent because of lack of production, so yes there are those both aspects increased risk but stronger expectation for the second half independent of the first half than we planned for at the beginning of the year. That is true for cars and is pretty much true for trucks as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next in line is Jochen Gehrke [Deutsche Bank].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Questions if I may, two for Mr. Renschler. First of all, on Fuso, could you give us a feel for when you expect Fuso to be back fully operational so that we will be in the position to judge whether or not Fuso on an underlying basis is actually successfully turned around given that we're coming to the end of your restructuring actions.</p>
          <p>And then secondly with regards to North America, you've obviously followed the comments yesterday from PACCAR, could you just give us some feel for where we stand with regards to supplier shortages and so forth with regards to production volume ramp up?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, you said that you are going to inject &#x20AC;2 billion into your pension fund, historically when we've seen something like that at competitors, then normally the other side gives up something as well. At BMW, this was the dividend cap. What is it at Daimler, have you injected the &#x20AC;2 billion and got something from the workforce back for that or is it just going in in order to fund existing liabilities? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Gehrke, I would like to start with a few truck related questions. First to Fuso, since <mark type="audio gap" /> (16:30) came back to 100% production that will impact of course the third quarter of trucks, <mark type="audio gap" /> (16:37) mixture is somehow a little differently, but still we are on a good way to recover. Order backlog is very good because the order intake already took momentum latest in May. So now the question is what can we produce and how can we &#x2013; how fast can we deliver it in the so-called third quarter. And of course and, from the second quarter on we expect to be positive again. Then you can also judge the restructuring issues like you mentioned before.</p>
          <p>In NAFTA it is indeed there the ramp up is going according to our plan like we explained also a couple of weeks ago. We are increasing production over the month. We started in Mexico like I described once and now the American clients are coming into the capacity extension. Of course, there are months where you have certain supplier shortages because if the whole industry goes up, there could be a month that you are missing some parts, but like I mentioned we have very good partnership with our suppliers. Went into the year 2011 with very, very high volume already and so we have good chance that we can such monthly oriented issues there over compensate over the year. So production ramp up is like it planned in NAFTA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jochen, we are in discussions with the unions, with the German <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:06) of negotiations of a new pension plan. We have an understanding that this pension plan should be a defined contribution plan, and it should be implemented towards the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, that's clear. And just following up on Fuso Mr. Renschler, usually post these events there is reconstruction activity going on, and from today's standpoint, do you see that in your order intake and should we therefore expect a stronger than normal 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I cannot see it so long now in the order intake but the momentum seems to be there. We saw as I said already a momentum in the month of May with, when it comes to order intake. If it's sustainable, if it goes through things it looks like that we see there a good chance for 2012 in Japan. Besides everything else, we mentioned before certain other issues around the world, but when you look to the local area of Japan, there is a good chance for 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay our next in line is Stuart Pearson [Morgan Stanley]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just had a few questions relating to Mercedes into the second half, just started the second quarter though on the average selling price maybe you could just explain a little bit more the decline in the second quarter versus Q1. How much of that is seasonal and how much of that's to do with currency and how that might evolve into the second half? The second questions was just on your utilization rates, maybe if you could update us on the utilization of the Reshadat plant in the second quarter? Any idea of how much of a burden that has been on profitability and how that might develop in the second half. And just finally given what you've said on the high utilization rates through the summer, can you just talk about the pricing outlook into the second half of the year? Maybe just confirm your pricing position in the second quarter versus Q1? Was that an increase or flat quarter-on-quarter or a decline? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. When we try to somewhat structure their per unit revenue effect you were talking about, let's say there are three element structure mix then secondary business which means that we are not realizing the revenues right away, but over time and third let's say a combination of net pricing and foreign exchange rates. The three elements are about a third each, the third one little less than that. When I said net pricing we continue to have a better price realization than last year. We have some specific effects, which relate to the supply chain interruptions from Japan and which had some effect on our options, which we could not totally deliver to customer demand and therefore sometimes quite simply give something more expensive without pricing it because they didn't order it. So simply put and this we calculate as negative pricing effect but really it's logistical aspect in the aftermath of the earthquake. So altogether foreign exchange rate of course is depending on the further development. If you want the ongoing effect, the others I don't see as base effects, which would have changed our overall revenue realization versus the first quarter versus last year. So I think all together we are in a healthy development.</p>
          <p>Reshadat obviously we had the change over for the new generation, which almost idled the plant, which had a major impact on our ability to fulfill demand in the compact segment. We had perhaps less than 50% utilization that's probably a fair number. Now looking forward, we are not only coming back to 100% utilization but we're adding cash commit of course with a significant capacity on top. Therefore we'll see over the time with one launch after the other of this new family significant better contribution from compact car segment than we had in the past. And this is one of our drivers for strong growth as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Again just as a follow-up to that quickly if I may the MSA platform that arrives with the new small car roll-out. Can you share with us any idea the potential cost saving on that versus the current platform at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this new product first of all has a very different performance than the old one, certainly most important the fuel efficiency which is benchmark. We leveraged on the one hand the module approach. Secondly, we have to admit quite frankly that we were benefiting somewhat from the crisis as far as supplier contracts and tooling costs are concerned so that we came in below our target as far as the cost for this new vehicle is concerned so we have a very good competitive cost basis with this new vehicle, a vehicle which is much more competitive independent of its cost than the former one. So we are very bullish about compact cars in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. Horst Schneider here from HSBC. I have got three questions if I may, the first one relates to your inventory development. I'm seeing that inventories have slightly declined at Mercedes but only at 10,000 units. I would have expected a higher inventory decline so could you maybe update us if we should expect higher inventory decline in the next few quarters. In that context, also I would like to ask a question on China, is it true that your locally produced cars in China sell worse than the imports so it seems to me as if the import to local production ratio could not be 50-50 as guided beginning of this year and in that context maybe you can elaborate again on your expansion plans for China. Ad the last question that I have is on Vans, I see here also in the second quarter an excellent development by Vans, maybe you could update us or provide us some outlook for H2 in terms of earnings margin development. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your questions. As far as inventory of Mercedes is concerned, it stands below plan. We have on the one hand, and we talked about Reshadat before some prebuilt inventory to bridge that production gap in Reshadat, which basically you have to discount from the overall numbers. Secondly we have shift more and more to export markets. Germany is now less than 20%, which means the pipelines are getting longer for the same volume and that adds the incremental volume, which tells you that out of the total inventory, a relatively small portion is ready for sale and available in the different places to be sold to the dealers. Quite frankly we do not have enough inventory. We are short of inventory which clearly relates to the fact that we have higher demand than our production could keep up with, and now we have to see that we are coming to August where even though we try to maintain production as far as possible of course we have a decline in production numbers so that we are really hampering our sales because of lack of inventory.</p>

          <p>Well, it's across basically all C-Class models from this platform so including GLK and so on &#x2013; it's the S-Class, it's M-Class, it's A&amp;B Class so it would be easier to tell you where it's not the case.</p>
          <p>The China topic, we have just announced in China today that we move the next step in further joining forces between the two joint venture partners by combining our sales efforts. In the past, we had separate sales organizations, wholesale not on retail going for CBU cars and locally produced cars dealing with one brand that was not a very satisfying situation. We have overcome that by 1st of August. We do that together. That's a major milestone, a very good one. It might be that your assumption will come true that at the end of the year we will not come up to this 50%-50% entirely but getting close. So I'm very happy about the last move I was just talking about as our sales is concerned. And therefore we continue to be very optimistic about China.</p>

          <p>It will clearly give one face to the customer to their market altogether, it will have, it will lead to one integrated marketing and branding approach which is most important. And therefore the differences which might exist today in their perception of the customer versus the two channels will definitely be reduced and ultimately limited.</p>
          <p>You had a third question regarding Vans. First of all I would like to agree with your assessment that they're doing great. Secondly, we see strong demand for vans in Q3 and Q4 as well so the momentum is ongoing, and we see a very satisfying profitability levels for these quarters as well whether we continue above our strategic target as we did in the second quarter remains to be seen but in any case there's a very strong development in that division.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Good, but I mean looking to your guidance from Mercedes and Truck, is it fair to assume for Mercedes-Benz that H2 that if it will be as strong as H1 right?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon. Steven Riesman with Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Looking at the Mercedes margin, I think the 10.7% is the first time you have been back in double digit since the end of 2007. I think in a sense you were a little behind the BMW and Audi, who have obviously have got through the 10% &#x2013; through the 10% threshold lot earlier in the last few quarters. Do you think the over 10% rate is now looks quite sustainable for rest of this year and into 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly everything is relative, whether I would call it a lot earlier it doesn't matter. We were the first to come back with strong profit margins last year. Then the others caught up and passed us somewhat in the last two quarters, that is true. We told you already two years ago that 2011 is somewhat a challenging year because of our internal product cycle. We told you about the product renewals and that we expect reduction in profits in 2011 versus 2010. Meanwhile, we are talking about our improvements in profits and probably even an improvement in the profitability for 2011 versus 2010, so I think we can be very satisfied given our internal cycle with the year 2011 in spite of these weights we are already at this level. We cannot promise that every quarter we'll now be at 10% and we didn't do that. We said we stay with our target for 2013, we might reach that earlier.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes thanks and good afternoon everyone. Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse and the first question is for Mr. Uebber and it's on currency. I'm estimating $16 billion net dollar and RMB exposure for next year so obviously it's a significant position. And I guess so far you told us that you have hedged 50% roughly of that number and could you just give us directionally some color on how much your currency will be a headwind for Daimler for the second half this year and also for next year. So if we model this exposure on spot and taking some assumptions on the hedge rates would it be fair to assume $500 million headwind let's say for the second half of this year and potentially $1 billion again assuming spot rates for next year that's my first question and then I follow-up with a second one, thank you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Arndt for your question, the $16 billion of exposure is quite a right assumption for 2012. We have disclosed this quarter to roughly $200 million headwinds in the first quarter so we will see also some headwind in the second half compared to the first half as we already commented this morning, and for 2012 there will be at the current spot rates a headwind of roughly &#x20AC;400 million to &#x20AC;500 million for total Daimler. You don't have a second question, then Arndt I do think I was very complete.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Three questions please, one is could you comment on the order intake and outlook for truck demand in Brazil. The second question could you tell us whether smart is incurring operating losses or not and if those losses are going up or down from where we are today? And the last question is on your investment for capacity in China. My understanding is you have chosen to build an engine capacity, an engine plant in joint venture in China as opposed to owning it, is there reason why you did that, is there a reason that prevented you from owning 100% of your engine facility as I think is legally possible. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with your first question of the situation in Brazil. As you know, they have cut somehow in the first half of the year the incentives of the state for the truck purchase. That was the reason that we have still a very high demand, but the momentum and dynamic of growth potential in the first half year was little bit lower. We still expect that kind of a pre-buy effect because you may have heard it, but in 1st of January next year as the new emission regulation, Euro V coming and the Euro V truck is of course more costly, that means the price will go up and so we expect in the second half year still the pre-buy effect. That means we will see from our expectation level at least higher demand in the second year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, smart. First of all you saw the numbers that the development is very positive 2011 versus 2010. Secondly, there is a positive sales contribution from smart to the Mercedes bottom line.</p>
          <p>As far as the engine plant in China is concerned, yes it is true that there are 50% max ownership does not applied necessarily to component plants. You typically are discussing and negotiating full packages in the development of your partnership going forward, the engine plant being one piece of it. We did not have a very strong intention to be the only shareholder in this plant. And therefore we came out with the shareholding as you described it 50%/50%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question we take from Jose Asumendi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got three questions, Jose Asumendi, RBS. Starting off with Brazil and Euro V, I have not seen yet your competitor's hiking prices for the new technology. When do you plan to do that and what kind of magnitude should we expect and also around Brazil if the market collapses let's say 30% next year, how flexible are you to cope with this demand drop. And second one on Mexico, on the plant in Saltillo, this is obviously going to be a large boost for your profitability in North America. What proportion of trucks are you currently sourcing from Saltillo into North America at the moment? Are we still at a very early stage or is this starting to help your profitability in the U.S. And the last one on Cars, I am just looking at the seasonality in 2010 and just trying to figure out what's going to happen in the second half. Should we expect the similar seasonality in terms of production on the Cars side i.e. should we expect higher production in the second half versus the first one or should it be more or less in line? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, your question if I understood right, is the price increase in &#x2013; for Euro V in the Brazilian market, we have not announced it and we plan it to announce it in the second half. To give you an indication when we introduced a Euro IV, V solution here in Europe, the price increase was approximately &#x20AC;6000 per truck. It gives you only an indication because the technology is a little bit different in Brazil. But again we plan to announce this in the second half year.</p>
          <p>Your second question in Mexico, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:42) has two plants are ready, one is close to Mexico City and the new one is in Saltillo. At the moment we are producing 68% of the overall volume in Mexico. We started there to go into full capacity very early. So we are utilizing the capacity of the two plants by 110% and the second move is now &#x2013; it will come in the second half year of starting now will be to ramp up in our plants in Cleveland, Mount Holly. So overall we could generate already a cost advantage out of our Mexican plants, and we are at the moment looking into further capacity increase also there. As far as Cars production is concerned, we plan for higher production in the second half of 2011 compared to the first half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question we take from Laura Lembke.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I've got a couple of questions on the Trucks. First one is on order intake. I mean you increased your guidance for Europe recently. But when I look at your book-to-bill for Europe it actually dropped from 1.4 times to 0.9 times. I'm just wondering if this is related to the Actros change-over. And also if you look at NAFTA, it's kind of the same picture here again your book-to-bill dropped and actually in terms of order momentum you are weaker than your peers, so I'm just wondering what is driving this?</p>
          <p>And then the second question I would have is actually on headwinds from raw materials and content related costs. I was just wondering if you could quantify this amount and your expectation for the full year and how much of that is actually offset by efficiency measures or pricing? And then lastly I mean on your guidance you are targeting 8% margin by 2013. Now you have become more optimistic on the market outlook for example in Europe and you already post a clean margin, which is closely 8% in Q2. So my question would be when and under which condition you would feel comfortable to actually give us an upgrade to your guidance for the Truck? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Laura. First of all when you look to the order intake, as I've said very often you should not only look into months on a quarter, look at the half-year. Second I think on the side level you announced here from Investor Relations you have to add to Europe always Eastern Europe and then compare to the rest because Europe is both. And there we have a very good order intake and also a very good book-to-bill. It's 130% and it underlines what we said before that we expect deliveries will be higher in the third and fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, in NAFTA we had a very, very strong first quarter. Always we said this cannot be going through the year because if there are big fleets ordering you can't just look into one quarter and the other. The level is still very satisfying and we have a book-to-bill in NAFTA over &#x2013; what was it here, over the half year 144% so again there is the production ramp up coming up and we will see some more deliveries as well there.</p>
          <p>The material issue, we have some headwind this overall, no doubt, firstly we can also look into NAFTA for example we have the contracts. We are looking into with our customers they have some momentum into that we can hand it over &#x2013; escalate or hand it &#x2013; that was is the word &#x2013; escalate I think, that we can hand over this raw material price increases also to our customers, of course with a time lag. But basically the efficiency and this kind of potential will minimize the headwinds. Still there will be a headwind but with such mechanism we can limit this somehow.</p>
          <p>And now the 8% question &#x2013; if we say 8% that is for us not absolute figure, it's a relative figure because it depends always on the market development. If all the markets would be on a normal level then the minimum is just 8%. If the markets are going up like let's say 2013 they are back in before the pre-crisis level let's say this way or they're at the pre-crisis level, it will be 2% to 3% higher. If it's going back to a level that's under the normal year it could be lower. So this is on an average over the cycle and not a absolute figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay maybe I can just ask a follow-up question on this. So I mean right now if you look at how the market is developing I mean would you be comfortable in saying that maybe you will already achieve an 8% margin or even exceed it next year?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon, Fraser Hill from Bank of America. Just three questions. Firstly China, you've seen yourselves over the last three to four months, now broadly flattening at around about 17,000 units a month. Is there anything that's worrying you about that sort of flat progression, do you see that as just normal seasonality and do you still expect a pick up in the second half of the year? If you do, is there any basis for that as far as you see it today? Following on from that on China, looking at pricing and product, you've now talked about producing the GL locally, are there any other sort of higher priced models that may be brought under a local production in China over the next year or two that you're perhaps thinking about or mulling over? And again while we are talking about China any sign of price competition or any competition sort of picking up across the product categories? So a few issues around on China, the next issue from me on cash flow, provisions in the quarter, if you look at the cash flow about &#x20AC;610 million taken, can you confirm that those are consumption of provisions as opposed to provision released benefiting the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>China, when you take, the mentioned 17,000 monthly rate and you multiply by that 12, you already exceeding our forecast we were giving for this year. So independent of the question how strong last year's quarter were &#x2013; and the second quarter there for instance was a very strong quarter &#x2013; the development within this year, is according to our plans, and we stay confident that we will see further significant growth in China and 2012. '11 obviously is one year where we will not have there almost three-digit growth as we saw for a number of years, and we can't have that forever obviously but we see a clear path towards the expected 300,000 &#x2013; at least 300,000 units in 2015 and is more likely that we will exceed this number than we would fall short.</p>
          <p>GLK, as rightfully said, is the vehicle which will be localized next. And as we said MFA, which means compact &#x2013; new generation compact car vehicles will be the next to be localized. Currently we have no plans for higher priced vehicles except for the E-Class, which is already in production as you know to be localized in China. Price competition China, it's a competitive place and even in times when the growth rates were 60%, 80% for many of the competitors in the premium segment, there still was a competitive environment and some price pressure. So I don't see anything unusual there. Yes, of course we see some slowdown of the growth in China and the economy altogether and in the automotive market as well but the least of all in the premium automotive markets. And once again therefore we stay very confident.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, Charles Winston from Redburn Partners. Just a couple of quick questions, I seem to remember when you changed your accounting policies for leased asset disposals and started including the revenue in Financial Services, the profit or loss from those disposals appears in the Mercedes' result; I think I'm right in saying that. I was just wondering if you could update us on if there is any sort of significant profit or loss in the Mercedes results in this quarter because obviously residual value still have been very, very strong. And I've just a second question, really just relating to Stuart's question earlier on, the FX impact on revenues, obviously to get an underlying idea as to sort of price mix, it would be useful if perhaps you just give us an idea as to what the FX impact on revenues was in the quarter particularly for Mercedes and Trucks that would be kind. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your first question on the residual values, the impact on the used car business of course it is booked within the industry part and not in Financial Services, but with this element in the second quarter there was nearly no impact, so not negatively and positively, so minor impact in the second quarter. Your second question the currency effect on revenues on the Daimler side I do think we disclosed the increase of revenues was 5%. Excluding exchange rate effects we had an impact of 9%. Of course the total impact of the currency effect is mainly related to Mercedes-Benz cars.</p>

          <p>Okay. Next question from David Arnold.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's actually Arndt Ellinghorst here again from Credit Suisse. Thanks I was dropping off my phone earlier on. Dr. Zetsche, you have &#x2013; or Daimler in general has received some fairly critical investor feedback most recently. And I don't want to be impolite asking this I rather want to give you a chance to share with us what your thoughts are how much of that was new and does this trigger something within Daimler or how do you deal with this feedback you are getting from the financial community?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we generally try to listen to the market and to the investors &#x2013; sell side, buy side, and we try to take comments serious and learn from them, that is generally true and that is true in this specific case and I think that's all what can be said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess investors would love to see a better performance of your stock, and I'm pretty sure the answer to that is a better fundamental performance, right? And you have mentioned many times that Daimler is highly committed to close the performance gap and margin gap to its relevant peers. What's your thought process there? Is this just a rolling target or do you have a timeframe in mind by when you can really be on top of your peers?</p>

          <p>First of all, we have defined strategic profitability targets for all divisions to be accomplished in 2013. We have just finished a quarter where a number of the divisions were already ahead of time exceeding these targets and others coming awfully close. There of course the world is a relative game and that's why of course we will have to watch our competition as well. We have to do that &#x2013; look at that at every quarter, but not get crazy about every quarter, but look at the trends &#x2013; mid-term trends and there we are clearly very confident that we will come to these leadership positions benchmark positions we are striving for. Of course profitability is one element; growth is the other element, which is at least as important, we are aware of that as well. And we are setting our plans as well to, on the one hand achieve and if possible pass our own growth targets, which is the case within this year, but there again it's a relative game so our objective is as well to grow faster than our completion. And where we are not in this position today, we are setting the foundations to get there. Product is key in this regard, we are convinced that we have a very strong product pipeline in all divisions and therefore we are very confident in accomplishing our targets.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, many thanks, and also thanks Mr. Uebber for the straight answer on currency. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next in line is Ranjit Unnithan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, Ranjit Unnithan from JPMorgan, just a quick question, I just wanted to clarify an answer from earlier. So in the second quarter, the Mercedes revenue per unit declined quite meaningfully from the first quarter and yet margins expanded quite nicely. So if you, could you just explain why that should be? I think you were trying to answer something about your option mix being different from what is normal, but I would have thought that hurt you rather than benefited you on margins. And in general your sequential contribution margin or your operating leverage was quite strong at about 35% odd, which is at this point in the cycle, when you are talking about very high level to utilization, a bit surprising. So if you could just help me understand why margins were this strong relative to a lower revenue per unit that would be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all we have seen a strong quarter as far as volume was concerned, which definitely helps the margins. Secondly, we are seeing overall as I mentioned before further improvements in our pricing capability. I talked about some exceptions for some logistical reasons but directionally we continue to <mark type="ph" /> discount (54:39) around the globe. The revenue decline per unit as we said before, to some extent it's related to exchange rate translations, which obviously do not affect our margins directly then &#x2013; but this is a very minor effect at that point of time where we are having a change from CBU units to locally build units in China, you have a positive impact on your return on sales that is very true for Audi and Volkswagen and BMW as well to a higher extent than for us because that they have much higher local volumes. But this is one element, which does not have a substantial impact on Q2. So these are perhaps a few elements of this picture. On the other hand of course the bottom line is always the top line plus the cost side, and we always said that is very important to stay disciplined on the cost side. In the good times, you're basically spoiling the picture in the good times not in the bad times and that's what we tried to avoid, and we are pretty successful in this regard as well which obviously helps the margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have two more questioners, one is Michael Tyndall from Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Mike Tyndall from Barclays Capital thanks for taking my question. My question really is around Trucks. I'm trying to understand the outlook for Trucks, you mentioned the EBIT in the second half is going to be better than the first half, am I right in thinking you've got about &#x20AC;300 million from Euro VI to come through and then I guess you've also got the increase in staff numbers both in North America and Brazil. So just wondering what impact that will have, are we talking about a rise in EBIT but not in margins in the second half? And also I guess a bit more of a longer-term question when I look at the operating leverage, Trucks has the lowest operating leverage of all your businesses. I'm just wondering where are you in terms of capacity, why is that lower, I would have thought that you actually had more excess capacity in Trucks than you were in Cars and therefore it should actually be higher as volumes come up? That's my two questions. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first of all, if we are hiring staff now in the United States or in Brazil that it's very clear to follow the production ramp up because there is a volume there that we expect to sell and this has no impact on &#x2013; negative impact on margin. It will help us of course because the volume is increasing. When it comes to Euro VI and then new Actros and indeed that's true, it will have some effects in the &#x2013; majority in the second half of this year. Basically, we are there, the first one was introduced to Euro VI with totally a brand new truck, the new Actros. We are ahead there of others and if you have looking to some of the competitors they are expecting now increased spending in R&amp;D and others to be prepared for Euro VI, so we have done this already and we see there a good chance for market success because nothing is more important than fuel efficiency and with the new Actros we have some good potential to gain this.</p>
          <p>The second thing is we have of course markets that are growing up in the United States for example 30% to 35%. Are we utilizing already 100% of the capacity no because we expect another growth in the market next year. So this is one of the things to try to answer your first question with leverage, or was the second question. So we have the capacity and now we are going up. Mexico we're utilizing it only 100%, already 100% in the first half year. For example that the two plants or the 2.5 plants we have in United States we utilized only to 50% and now the production ramp-up is going up and you would see the effects also there.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The last questioners is Thierry Huon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, it's Thierry Huon speaking from Exane. Just a quick question regarding what you said about the Chinese contribution, could you confirm to me that you are not booking the revenues from the locally produced cars in the auto divisions but you are just booking the EBIT margins, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is almost right. We booked the revenues of the parts we sent to build these locally produced vehicles, but we are not booking the incremental value being built in China and that is the same approach as our competitors take just our percentage of locally produced product in China is lower than the one of our direct competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah but I guess your competitors are not booking the EBIT from the JVs but you are doing this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry to say that's clear accounting rules. We have a production joint venture 50%-50% and that is an equity consolidated means the proportional net income effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but this is booked at the division level not below?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly it's booked at the respective division level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly the same as our competitors do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not sure, okay, thank you.</p>
