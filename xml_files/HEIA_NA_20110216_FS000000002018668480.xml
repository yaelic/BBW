          <p>So, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen for our 2010 Results Presentation. As ever, for those who also follow the webcast, welcome. I don't think you have the occasion to look at our advertising and then you'll miss the best part of our presentation, I'm afraid. There is a strange echo here. Am I right or is it just in my ears? You feel that? You have to put it a bit softer perhaps. Is that okay? Better? No. It's okay? Good. Fine.</p>
          <p>I'd like to take you through our annual results. As ever, I'm joined by my colleague Ren&#xE9; Hooft Graafland who will take you into more financial details than I will do. We'll try to keep it as short as possible in order to leave you as much time possible to address your questions.</p>
          <p>2010 has been for us a transformational year. We started the year with the announcement of the acquisition of the FEMSA Cerveza in Mexico and Brazil, and we closed the year with, or we opened &#x2013; in fact, this year with the announcement of the acquisitions of another five breweries in Nigeria to reinforce our position over there.</p>
          <p>What we have been doing, and that is not only over the last year but since a number of years, the FEMSA acquisition has certainly being a great milestone to that, is to expand strongly into emerging markets. Now it is the best worth, but what works in emerging markets is that the population growth times the economic growth times political stability, that is what creates a sweet spot for the development of our industry. And over the last years, and I will come back to that, we have been investing quite a lot of our attention, money and development in that part of the region.</p>
          <p>And in contrast to that, in Europe, we are shifting, as from this year, our prime focus to volumes and value share building, and I will more elaborate that. Value share and volume share growing is the idea the pie might not grow but we have to increase our share of the pie. And that whilst maintaining a very strict attention to cost management, as you have been accustomed from us from now a number of years, but also our organization is now comfortable working that way.</p>
          <p>What changed also this year is that we have taken a more globalized approach on how we manage the Heineken brand worldwide, and I will also elaborate on that. We have redesigned our operating principles to leverage global scale. We have gone through an extensive review of our management processes and have led to an array of changes, but all designed to leverage more our global scale. One has to realize that we have been, for ages, a very decentralized company. Now, Heineken is certainly not on the trail of centralizing its management but a number of things have been reviewed in the management processes to make sure that the sum of the parts is really stronger than &#x2013; the group is stronger, sorry than the sum of the parts.</p>
          <p>And finally, and not unimportantly, we have launched in April a new and integrated approach to sustainability, launching our Brewing a Better Future program. On all these points, I will elaborate a bit during my presentation; 2010, a transformational year; 2010, we continued to be concentrated on our operations; we posted a good financial performance, I will come back on that one; and the Heineken brand, which is the cornerstone of our company grew yet another 3.4% this year.</p>
          <p>We concentrated on the TCM program, which yielded this year EUR280 million in pre-tax savings on an annual basis this year. The Hunt for Cash program, which is designed to contribute to maximizing of our cash flow, in addition of course to the operating profit, we reached EUR2 billion of free operating cash flow this year, allowing us to reduce our net debt and going out with an end-year ratio of 2.2 times EBITDA, which is very well in the limits of the 2.5 EBITDA that we have set for the company. We improved the profitability in our recently acquired operations across the board with a particular good note on the U.K.</p>
          <p>Finally, we started off with the integration of FEMSA Cerveza activities Cuauht&#xE9;moc Moctezuma breweries in Mexico and what we have now renamed Heineken del Brasil. The first eight months that we have been consolidating were strong. If you would take it on a pro forma basis, like-for-like 12 months comparable, that business in euro terms in operating profit grew 44%. And on the announced program of the EUR150 million of cost synergies, we have already realized EUR42 million cost synergies over these two countries.</p>
          <p>So when we look at highlights of our performance, Ren&#xE9; will come back more into detail with that, but you will see that we had to deal with lower volumes, particularly in the consolidated side of our business and that is still by and large due to depressed sales in the mature markets of Europe and the United States.</p>
          <p>Our revenues declined 2.2%, which is lower than the volume decline, because we could still improve price and mix. Our excellent TCM programs and also the margins coming out of our emerging part of the business, think about Latin America, Africa, Middle East and Asia, yielded an increase of 8.6% of our operating profits.</p>
          <p>The strong free operating cash flow deleveraged us, hence bringing lower interest cost and that is where we ended up with net profit there, up 19.7% year-on-year. Diluted EPS went from EUR2.15 to EUR2.56 and that brings us to a proposed dividend of EUR0.76 per share, up 17% from EUR0.65 per share and that taken into account that we have 85 million new shares to serve dividend to, so overall, a good performance over the year 2010.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to take you through the first theme, which is the transformation from overweight mature markets as we were 10 years ago, to, I think, now well weighted into emerging markets. If you only look at two years, '09 and 2010 in terms of group beer volume, the effect of FEMSA and the consolidation of UBL, United Breweries in India has brought us from EUR88 million equity just to EUR135 million equity just coming out of these markets bringing two-thirds of our group volume is now based and coming from emerging markets. Remember, the emerging markets defined as population growth, economic growth, political stability.</p>
          <p>On the right side of the graph, you see what it translates in EBIT or operating profit, if you will. The thing here is that this is a reconstruction as a large part of our group volume in these emerging markets are through joint ventures like APB or United Breweries or CCU. We have been reconstructed 100% of the volumes and 100% of the profits and so that would on the like-for-like put the profits at &#x2013; for 66% of the volume, we would make 57% of the profits coming out of these geographies.</p>
          <p>One has to realize that 10 years ago that green part was only 22% of our volume. So en route for the transformation, we are busy now already for a number of years to do that and another way of illustrating that is this graph where we have reconstructed the situation for 2007 and showing also over the acquisition of Scottish &amp; Newcastle plus FEMSA plus UB and an array of smaller greenfields and acquisitions, how that has been evolved. And so over the period 2007, 2009, you see that 16% of our additional volumes came from mature markets, but the bulk, 84%, have been generated into these emerging markets. So just to show you how much we have been transforming the business and lately, with the FEMSA acquisition, making a big step in that direction.</p>
          <p>Now, as ever, let me highlight the performance of Heineken. This is the cornerstone and the largest differentiator of our company. We have again posted a strong performance. Now since crisis unfolding, or the financial crisis unfolding, we have been showing consistently always the same graph, just to make the point that in every geography where we are under pressure with our overall portfolio, Heineken brand is performing better than that overall portfolio. And in all geographies where we're growing, Heineken is again outperforming in the growth, to make the point that Heineken is still a very important factor of our development, and that even in a context of economic crisis and even if we have geographies, like noticeably the United States where Heineken is under pressure, overall stays the brand with the highest growth in our company and also in its potential the highest growth.</p>
          <p>We grew 3.4% last year and reaching the 26 million. Our market share in the international premium grew from 20.2% to 20.7%, so it's another 0.5% added to our market share. We're still twice as big as our immediate followers in the industry, and we very much care to improve that gap.</p>
          <p>As an introduction, we showed you a commercial which is called The Entrance, that's one of our new global campaigns that we launched. It's actually the first one of a series, which will follow with the global tagline, Open Your World. We have taken the view to manage Heineken going forward, as I said earlier, much more as a global brand. Just an illustration, we were using 23 different ad agencies all over the world. We now use four anchor ad agencies in order to create the advertising and having a much more global approach of the brand than we ever did before. We think that it is fitting the brand not only, but also makes a lot of economic sense overall.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, you have then to think about the platforms we have been acquiring in Brazil or in Mexico, what we building in the partnership with Diageo in South Africa, our investments in UB in India. Those are huge beer markets where the premium segment is still to be developed. And if you take what we have been doing over the last 10/12 years in countries like Vietnam or Chile and the market shares that we have been able to reach in these countries, and you project that to these huge markets like Brazil, Mexico, India, South Africa, even China, you will see that there is an enormous growth potential for the Heineken brand in the 10 to 20 years coming forward. That's also one of the primary reasons why we did all these deals.</p>
          <p>If you look at what the position of Heineken is in premium position in Europe and you would extrapolate that to these new markets, I can tell you, we still have 20 years of enjoyment of growth of the Heineken brand across the world.</p>
          <p>I leave the Heineken brand now to go for our traditional regional tour, which I will keep brief. Starting with Western Europe, Western Europe as ever, posted again an increase in its organic profits on the backdrop of sales, which were down. The contrast between markets can be from time to time steep. It is not only in the markets which we would suspect where we have the highest decreases, actually the situation is easier in Spain than in the Netherlands, I would say. And Spain has more to do with the economic crisis with the Netherlands. So you have very differentiated pictures country by country, so don't treat Western Europe as one country. But overall, if you look at the situation we have to do with decreasing beer volumes, the revenues even more, but that is entirely to do with our wholesale operation, which is heavily under pressure, and in the process of being aggressive, I will come back later on that, but that is what explains the gap between the volume development and the revenue development.</p>
          <p>And the excellent work on the TCM program, but also working on our margins and pricing, particularly in the U.K. has led to operating margins which have been improving quite a bit this year. And if you look at the 200 basis points of increase, a big chunk of that is coming out of the sole U.K., which has still a few miles to go to reach the European standard as we envisage and we have the ambition to come there.</p>
          <p>So Europe, again strong cash flow generation. They are one of the big contributor to our cash flows. And it's also the largest single contributor to our TCM program with savings half the program, EUR144 million was saved by that region.</p>
          <p>I now move to Central and Eastern Europe. The picture looks also even more gloomy in terms of volumes. Now one has to say it is what it is, but we had particular problems in Russia and Greece. We had steep increases, as you all know, from the excise duties, now the Russian situation has been depicted and well known by all of you. Greece perhaps a bit less, but the Greek government is also in need of restoring its public finances and has been particularly heavy-handed on our industry in that country and leading to heavy volume losses. So if you would exclude Russia and Greece from the picture, the volumes in Central and Eastern Europe would have been down only by 1%. So I would say that it's very pretty much localized at the moment in two countries. We had countries like Romania, Austria, Serbia, Germany and Belarus who posted even volume increase and also share increases. So, overall, a contrasted picture, but bottom line, leading to a decline of our EBIT, we can't hide it, and a deterioration of our margins.</p>
          <p>Then if I would look across Europe, and joining Europe, and considering the strategic intent that I told you in the beginning of my presentation, i.e., we have to grow the share volume, but essentially the value of our business in Europe. This is a little bit the wash list of what we have to do to fulfill the strategic intent. The common problem of Europe is weak demographics. And there is nothing you can do about it as a manufacturer of goods.</p>
          <p>Europe is a scattered picture. Northern Europe has been facing rising preference for wine for the last 20/25 years. On the contrary, if we look at Southern Europe, the preference went into the direction of beer. And in Central Eastern Europe, it has been weighing towards beer too coming from vodka. Now the common factor between all these three Europes is the demographic, the ageing of the population and the cohorts of younger drinkers are not that big as they were 20 years ago.</p>
          <p>So as the tail of the baby boomers generation is now crossing their 50s, we have been seeing a decline of the market. Whether we like it or not, that is the reality. So if the cake ain't growing, you'd better grow the share.</p>
          <p>Now to do that, we will have to invest more, going more after segmentation of the market, new proposition, premiumisation and you have then to look beyond the crisis and invest consequently in innovation. The Heineken brand still offers a lot of growth opportunities across the, let's say, 27 countries of the Union. We intend to expand our premium portfolio with higher margin products and pack types more. I just take the example of Desperados our tequila mixed beer drink, beer that we roll out across Europe. I think about cider, Strongbow, that we start to roll out progressively into Europe just as example in proxies and how you can in a pan-European way develop new propositions.</p>
          <p>We will, of course, continue to also to invest in key local brands. You have to nurture brands to make them attractive. So that is what we want to do on the top line growth. We have been en route since this year to increase our focus on the modern trade. Traditionally, Heineken is a company very much geared towards the on-trade, because traditionally there is where the market was, and there where the profits were.</p>
          <p>Now over time the shift from the on-trade to the off-trade market is only accelerated by the crisis, and so, proactively, we are investing more to boost our share in that particular segment taking steps like the creation of central account management for key customers like Carrefour or Tesco or Metro in order to leverage our European scale because their beer industry is very much the localized industry. We are the only ones to have our brand in the 27 countries of the Union in a very harmonious way.</p>
          <p>And so we have the brand which with we can serve category leadership with our clients. That is what we want to do in the off-trade. We will focus also more on the wholesale profitability. It would be a chapter, but as you know, and you regret it very much, we don't report the segment of the wholesaler selling activities. Historically in our group, they have been organized to serve the on-trade sales. Since the on-trade sales are declining fastly, these wholesale operations have to re-tailor themselves and reinvent themselves to address also changing demand for part, but also a diminished and a changing business environment. So we will put much more emphasis on that. The creation of a pan-European management for wholesaling is one step in order to address that much more forcefully as we did before.</p>
          <p>Finally, we will continue to address our cost base in a forceful way as we have been doing in the past. Our European organization is used to that; it's in their genes now. So the TCM cost management is finishing this year. So you can imagine, it's a process that never stops. There will be a TCM 2.</p>
          <p>However, in the accent and the priorities of these programs, we will shift our attention to other things than just breweries. In the last 10 years, we have been closing 44 breweries and malting plants across the Union. We have re-engineered our footprint quite well. We don't suffer from over capacity in our group. However, we still have opportunities in purchasing from central countries to central transactional center, financial shared services, the way we go about IT. I just named a few, but we are currently reengineering our organization and we have been announcing the creation of the Heineken Business Services. Those are all steps in the direction to yet make our cost base more efficient and less expensive. And for that, the organization is in full swing to cater for that and to adapt itself.</p>
          <p>With the whole menu of actions to leverage our scale and increase our share in Europe, I now would like to make the transition to the other side of the Atlantic and that's the Americas. Now, turning to the Americas, this is a region, which more than any other regions combines a mature part of it and a very emerging part of it; it's all combined in the Americas. You see that the 2010 change in the left column is the consolidation of FEMSA Cerveza is really boosting big time this region as you see. Americas has become a mega region within the Heineken Group, also thanks to the FEMSA Cerveza acquisition.</p>
          <p>If you look at the organic performance, we have had a very good performance in the Caribbean, Chile and Argentina, also the rest of Central America performed very well. Muted performance in the USA, where the total portfolio of Heineken USA, the depletions went down 2.7%, which was in line with also the declining market. But in our legacy business of the Americas, the U.S., of course, weigh a lot in the business.</p>
          <p>Going forward, as I said, we have been integrating FEMSA Cerveza. We have had very good results over the first eight months on a pro forma basis. I told you already the business is growing 44% and we realized EUR42 million of costs synergies. If I go into the details of the new markets in Mexico and Brazil, those are the menu of the highlights of what we have been doing and how the things are going and the integration went very smooth. And I guess that by doing many integrations, we are better and better at doing that. But I must say that this is an integration, which went for the size of it in a particular smooth way.</p>
          <p>We have been redefining together with the people of CCM, the regional strategy, and I talked you that through already at the last meeting we had at the half-year figures of how we redefined the portfolio strategy, specializing the brands in their strongholds. Remember we have a stronghold in northern Mexico and in southern Mexico, and we are &#x2013; our competitor has the stronghold in central Mexico, okay. And our strategy is much more of the one of gain sharing around the strongholds than was done before. That is the core of the strategy, and also the launch of Heineken locally produced and going from the niche status into developing the brand as we did in Chile or Argentina or Vietnam. That's going to start in March where locally Heineken will be launched in Mexico.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, we enjoyed an exceptionally strong ride of the market. Brazil as a country is on fire. We have there another kind of position; we are distant number three. Our strategy is very much geared to pushing the Heineken brand in the premium segment. All brands have been increasing past year. We could deliver cost synergies. We posted a positive result, which was a major turnaround for this company. And the Heineken brand on its own grew 50%, and it's already the third consecutive year that it is growing. And it's extremely encouraging for the development of the brand how it is growing so far in Brazil. So far, so good for FEMSA Cerveza.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Africa and the Middle East. I think it's now for the fifth consecutive year that we reported double-digit growth coming out of Africa. This is by &#x2013; it has been over the last years, and certainly over the last seven years, consistently the largest single growth engine of the company. It flew for many years under the radar screen. This is a continent where population growth goes hand-in-hand with economic development and political stability, plagued by a lot of problems still, but overall, and I repeat it once more again, growing middle classes, strong urbanization. The telecom industry changed dramatically how African societies function and for the better.</p>
          <p>And if the mobile phones took, I would say in the late '90s, early 2000, a little bit of share out of our business, they are now really contributing to the economy and giving it a real boost. All countries have been growing with a particular mention for Nigeria, the DRC, Egypt, Burundi who have stellar performance, the Republic of South Africa where Heineken was up 29% and Windhoek &#x2013; 19%. The Heineken brand overall in the region grew by 16% and, at the end of the day, of the year, we have been acquiring an additional five breweries in Nigeria, alleviating our production constraints that we have kind of started to feel during the year 2010. So we were very happy to buy these five breweries. They give us a much broader logistical footprint over the country. And because that is a company which is only turning at 50% of its capacities, there is 50% capacity immediately available for our company over there. That's for Africa, Middle East, short, but stellar.</p>
          <p>And another short and stellar one is Asia Pacific, which had also a fantastic performance. Here we operate much more -- practically all our business through joint ventures. Two key joint ventures: APB, which took over in the course of last year the breweries in Indonesia and New Caledonia. You will remember that we have been deconsolidating our breweries and bringing them in the APB vehicle.</p>
          <p>APB grew over 40% in its net earnings, in its past fiscal years, stellar performance. Stellar performance especially in Vietnam, which is a key market for us, but most of the markets, practically all the markets in APB have been on the growth. Also China, where Heineken brand has grown to a satisfactory degree and we are completing now &#x2013; we have completed a new brewery in Guangzhou, which is entirely dedicated for the production of the Heineken brand in order to cope with the growing demand.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we have an joint venture with Dr. Mallya with UB. This was the first time we have been consolidating it in our group's volume. It contributed EUR9 million to the net profit, grew 27%, went for the first time beyond the 50% market share. India is booming and United Breweries is also a booming company, they are doing a fantastic job. It's certainly one of these growth reservoirs on the long-term. Remember, beer consumed in India is 1.4 liter per capita, that was what China was consuming 30 years ago. So you have to take also the long view, but it is growing at an impressive pace.</p>
          <p>We will launch Heineken locally produced somewhere at half-year. We are taking now all the preparations to do so. And my colleague Ren&#xE9; has the pleasure to serve on the Board of the United Breweries, so he has the pressure of our partner and the pleasure to travel to Bangalore and to be part of that fantastic adventure.</p>
          <p>This closes my tour of the world. I realized I've been longer than I intended to do, but I get passionate when I speak about India. I would like to finish my presentation on Brewing a Better Future. We launched that program in April. It is not that we were not doing anything about sustainability. In fact, we do a lot about environmental sustainability since the early '90s already. We have done a lot of community work and agricultural support upstream in Central Europe and in Africa. This is a long tradition that we have been built up over decades.</p>
          <p>What we did in April is to recalibrate our commitment in a very clear transparent way. It's published on the Internet. It's in our sustainability report. And setting a vision for 2020 was the deliverables of what we want to do in terms of sustainability.  Build on three strategic imperatives, which are the improvement of our environmental impact. It's the empowerment of the people in the communities, that's a big basket where we put Medicare, education, agriculture, you name it, and the positive impact that beer has on society.</p>
          <p>So don't look at the alcohol producer only at the harmful way, but also at the positive way. Address the harmful side and also work with the positive way. All these things are quantified, reported from year-to-year, things like 40% of the reduction of our carbon footprint; 25% water reduction in the coming 10 years to 3.7 liter per liter beer produced; our commitment to invest further down the line only in green cooling, think about the hundreds of thousands of fridges or cooling installation that our 135 breweries across the world are placing in the marketplace, our commitment to make these cooling techniques and equipment more environmental friendly. Those are only examples of what we want to do in practice.</p>
          <p>All our senior management will be incentivized on that, i.e. 500 top people at Heineken across the world will have part of their bonus paid on what they realize on sustainability. It is not based on an index. It is based on concrete action, because at the end of the day, we believe that sustainability means business. This is not charity. This is nothing that you want to buy yourself a good name, no. It is another way, a more sustainable way to make good business in the future. And that is how we look at it, because at the end of the day, better support to the communities and lesser imprint on your environment means that you will higher revenue and reduce costs. That's why we all do it for, and also, when we look at the new generations who work at Heineken, they expect us to do that and consumers in the street will vote with their feet, if you as a brand owner, you wouldn't do it by the way.</p>
          <p>So, that closes the presentation 2010. The most delicate part is the outlook 2011, but luckily you've read it all already in our press release. We expect the volumes to continue to grow, of course, in Africa, Asia, Latin America. We remain cautious on the beer consumption in Europe and the USA for reasons of demographic decline, but reinforced by economic malaise. But we do believe that the international premium segment will continue to grow and outperform the general market, which gives further opportunities for the Heineken brand to grow.</p>
          <p>We can assure you that the performance of our recently acquired businesses will continue to improve. We are very committed to that. And we have also to underline that the shifting of prime focus in Europe, going for an increase of our revenue share will imply higher marketing cost and higher innovation investment and that driving a long-term volume and value share growth will affect profit development in the near-term in Europe.</p>
          <p>We will, of course, deliver on our TCM program, but we say at the lower rate. Remember that the delivery of the program of 2010 was at a high side of what we historically do. And finally, just to give you guidance that the input cost prices, they rose for us with a low single digit and that we expect to mitigate that affect by higher selling prices for this year.</p>
          <p>With that I close my presentation. Thank you for your attention. And before handing over to Ren&#xE9;, we show you a commercial to give you a breath, and the commercial is coming from the RDC in Africa for a change.</p>

          <p>This is probably a commercial only Nico understands, because he knows the power cuts in Africa. Good afternoon. Thank you, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. As usual, I will guide you a little bit more in details through the figures. I will update you on the global programs, Hunt for Cash TCM, and I will give you a further insight in the FEMSA beer businesses.</p>
          <p>But let's start with the revenues, which grew 9.7% to over 16 billion. The first time consolidations added EUR1.3 billion, and that is obviously driven by the businesses in Mexico and Brazil. And that is partly offset by the deconsolidation of our businesses in Indonesia and New Caledonia, and the sale of the wholesale business, Waverly, here in the UK.</p>
          <p>Currencies added EUR447 million to the revenues, that is 3%. And that is mainly the Polish zloty, who appreciated 8%, the Russian Ruble, up 10%, the Nigerian Naira and the British Pound, both up 4%. On an organic basis, revenues were down 2.2% and positive price mix, as already said, also by Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois of 1.1%, clearly driven by the Heineken brand. That only partly offsets the effect of lower volumes, which had on revenue an effect of minus 3.3%.</p>
          <p>Then moving to EBIT, I always talk about the beia figures before exceptional items, and amortization of brands and customer relations. And EBIT, obviously the share of joint ventures with then on a net profit basis is included. On an organic basis, our EBIT beia grew 8.6% or EUR179 million. When you compare that with the 5.7% organic growth in the first half year, you see an acceleration of that EBIT growth that is very much the result of higher cost savings in Western Europe in the second half of the year, and the very strong volume performance in Africa in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>When we look at the total year, the strong performance is 8.6%. That was driven by a better price mix. So Heineken brand, again, outperforming the total portfolio, but also a number of strong local brands like <mark type="inaudible" /> or international brands like Desperados contributed to that, and obviously, the very high level of cost savings in the second year of the TCM program.</p>
          <p>The good thing is that all regions, except Central and Eastern Europe grew profitability on an organic basis. Western Europe was the biggest contributor to that growth, adding over EUR130 million versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>Apart from that strong organic performance, we benefited from the currencies that increased EBIT by EUR69 million or 3.3%. And then finally, we had the impact of the new consolidations on balance. So again, FEMSA on one hand, the Asian assets on the other hand added EUR264 million or 12.6%.</p>
          <p>This is an interesting chart and a different way of looking at the 2.2% decline in organic &#x2013; organic decline in revenues. Obviously, that decline is fully realized in our developed markets. Our developed markets declined revenue-wise by 4%. But despite the decline in revenue, which is almost looking at the demographics and natural trend, you see that you can make very good profit in these markets.</p>
          <p>And when you look at the profit development in the developed markets, that is quite strong. Two main drivers behind it. First of all, people drink less, but better, so more higher margin products and obviously, we benefit from that with brands like the Heineken brand; and the enormous focus on the cost side of the business.</p>
          <p>So our strategy works in these developed markets. They deliver profit and they deliver an enormous cash flows. The profile of the emerging markets is obviously completely different. In these markets, it is the revenue growth which drives the profitability. In 2010, both the revenue and profitability were a bit held back by the developments, for instance, in Russia, which had a quite exceptional year. But also, the fact that this organic figures show the FEMSA acquisition is not yet in these figures. But going forward, obviously, we see huge possibilities, huge potential in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Then switching to the net profit, on an organic basis, up 20%, driven by the strong EBIT growth and significant lower interest expenses as a result of the strong cash flow generation. And our total net profit beia increased 37%, helped further by the currencies and the first time consolidations.</p>
          <p>On a diluted basis, EPS beia per share increased 19% below this 37% net profit beia growth and that is due to the increase in the weighted average number of shares, which moved from EUR489 million to an average of EUR562 million in 2010. In the back of your presentation, you will find the detailed calculation how we get there.</p>
          <p>And as said, we are proposing an increase in cash dividend from EUR0.65 to EUR0.76 per share, despite the higher number of shares, which we have now out in the market and that represent a payout ratio of 30%.</p>
          <p>Now have a look at FEMSA, this is the picture we showed you already on the half-year figures, but it is now completed for the full year with the volumes, the revenues and the EBIT on a comparable basis. On a full-year basis, the beer volumes grew to over 41 million hectoliters. Volume in Mexico was down 3% in line with the market, whilst volumes in Brazil were strongly up.</p>
          <p>FEMSA obviously is included in our figures as of the 1st of May, and in this period of time, the business contributed a bit over EUR2 billion in revenues and EUR315 million to our EBIT beia. The revenues include EUR160 million exports to the U.S., which will obviously in the consolidation fall away.</p>
          <p>If we would have owned the businesses for the full year, so since January, we believe that the revenues would have been EUR2.8 billion, slightly over EUR2.8 billion and the EBIT beia, EUR397 million. And so on a pro forma basis, the growth in that business has been 44% versus 2009. Very strong results and that was driven by the price increase which we had in Mexico, we had a 7% nominal price increase over there and that has led to revenue growth, despite the fact that the volumes were under pressure.</p>
          <p>The strong volume growth in Brazil, the fact that the we realized EUR42 million of the synergies and last, certainly not least, we benefited from the appreciation of the Mexican peso and that accounted for EUR37 million of the total increase.</p>
          <p>And as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois already said, we are absolutely excited about the potential of the Mexican and Brazilian beer markets and our businesses over there. When you look at these results, we really had a flying start, and we are absolutely confident that we can further drive the long-term profitability through revenue growth and the realization of the cost synergies. There is still a lot to do. It's a hell of a job, but we are very positive on this acquisition.</p>
          <p>Now, switching to TCM. As you all have seen and many said already you were surprised, that had a substantial contribution to our profit growth this year. It's really accelerated in the second year, generating this EUR280 million of savings and that is almost double the level we had in 2009. On a cumulative basis in the program, we are now at EUR435 million, which is almost nearing the total level we had in the three-year program, Fit 2 Fight, which ended in 2008.</p>
          <p>The success of both these programs highlight the strong cost discipline which we have now instilled across the organization and although, as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois said, we will put more focus and shift some focus on winning market share in the markets, you can be absolutely sure that cost and cost management will stay very high on the agenda of all management teams across the organization.</p>
          <p>When we look at the regional level, 51% is coming out of Western Europe, 39% out of Central and Eastern Europe. So the two Europes contribute the majority of the program, 90% of the program is coming from these two Europes. And that underlines what Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois was saying when he was talking about Europe and how can we leverage the scale in Europe. You see that also back in the cost base of Europe, the way how we deal with supply chain, the way how we deal with purchasing, the way how we deal with IT, that is helping to drive the cost down.</p>
          <p>Looking at the cash flow, our Hunt for Cash program, very positive also in 2010. Our free operating cash flow, almost EUR2 billion and net debt decreased by EUR1.2 billion, if you take into account the EUR1.6 billion which was added to the net debt as a result of the FEMSA acquisition. The net debt/EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.2 times, taking the pro forma of 12 months FEMSA in it, and that is below what we have set as the threshold, the target that we have set. We want to be below the 2.5 times, and we achieved that earlier than planned, I can say to you.</p>
          <p>The strong cash flow in 2010 was driven by another year of very strict management and very strict, disciplined way of looking at CapEx, CapEx again at a low level and a significant reduction in working capital, main working capital and you see it on the slide here, halved to 2.4% of revenues.</p>
          <p>And for the second year of this program, the cash conversion rate, so free operating cash flow divided by the net profit before minorities, largely exceeded the 100%; in 2009, it was 149%, 2010, 126%. So two years of very, very strong cash generation.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we expect this ratio to be around 100%, as we will expand CapEx, and you have seen our guidance, EUR850 million on CapEx to cater for the growth in the emerging markets and to finance a number of commercial investments in the more developed markets.</p>
          <p>To summarize, we delivered, again, a very strong financial performance, not always in easy markets and in an very transformational year. The integration of the beer operations of FEMSA proceeded in line with what we expected, even a bit faster, business delivering on a pro forma basis 44% EBIT growth. The Heineken brand continues to do very well, continues to gain share in the international premium segment and outperforms our overall portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our corporate programs, TCM, Hunt for Cash delivered very strongly, and will continue to play an important role in supporting the profit longer term. But at the same time, very importantly, we have taken steps to shift the focus more towards volume and value share growth in the markets where we operate. That is what I wanted to share with you.</p>
          <p>Before we go into Q&amp;As, you will get a nice commercial from me. This time, it is a commercial of Desperados in Poland. I must say, I like Desperados very much, not so much because I'm part of that party-loving Facebook generation, no, but because of the extremely high margins of Desperados. It competes not only in beer, it competes with spirits and cocktails and commands a price premium of at least 100% in the markets where it operates, so like markets like France or Poland, and doing absolutely great and fantastically. Let's have a look how we built that segment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think it's me first, then. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, I think I heard you rightly, or I hope I did, in saying that there would be a TCM 2. Could you just clarify that? And if it's the case that there is a going to be a named cost saving program after TCM 1 comes to an end, will you continue to report the savings that it has generated with each of your half-year reports?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why would we change that good practice? Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you. And one more, if I might. You mentioned that you're going to focus more on wholesaler profitability in the European business. Is that something that's in the next few years, we would see acting as a drag on your reported sales growth or are you happy with the sales base and it's more just the cost side that needs to be tackled?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is both. I think you &#x2013; we have been working quite a bit on the cost side of the wholesaling, and that inside already Fit2Fight program, so it's not new. What we also have to address is the growth sides on the revenue side of the wholesaling. There are different avenues, you have the classic avenues of the beverages, but there are also other avenues.</p>
          <p>So I won't dwell into that, but I think we have to face that the wholesaling business &#x2013; look, I'll give just an example, we'd divested Waverly, essentially because Waverly had no strategic impact on our beer and cider business. This was a wholesale business, which was serving essentially cask ales, spirits and wines, doing a great business, but it was not our business. So in that case, we decided to exit that business.</p>
          <p>You have various responses, depending the marketplace, that you have not only to see it at the cost base and so far, we have taken the business as it stands and tried to optimize it. And we were quite good at it, but that is not enough. So what I'm suggesting here is that we will look in the future into a more strategic way of how to improve these businesses and ultimately, their profitability.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Andrea Pistacchi from Citigroup. A couple of questions, please. On Europe, on the Heineken brand, could you give us a bit of color on markets where maybe Heineken brand is doing well and gaining share, albeit in declining markets and other markets where it's a bit more problematic, and where you intend to take action?</p>
          <p>And also in Europe, you talked about your new strategy aiming at taking share that will have an impact on profit in the near term. But what timeframe would you expect positive returns of this new strategy? And the final thing, I want to ask about the U.S. market. You talked about the plans to turn around to improve top line in Europe. Could you say something about the plans for the U.S. improvement in performance there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Heineken brands, clearly the stellar performer in Western Europe is France, where the brand is performing very well. It has now, I think, a market share of around 12%, whilst maintaining its 42% or 45% price premium built in a very consistent way. And it's interesting that an important part of the growth each time is driven by innovations.</p>
          <p>So new packages, propositions like BeerTender and DraughtKeg are adding to that volume growth. They keep the brand alive and kicking and very premium in the market. That is certainly the best example of what we have in Europe.</p>
          <p>When you look at the impact of the investments we are going to do in Europe behind brands and new propositions, it depends very much. If it is on existing brands, your return will be quicker than if you want to create a new segment. If you look at &#x2013; we will further build cider as a category on the Continent. That is not something where you get the payback in one, two or three years.</p>
          <p>Ultimately it is longer-term, a very strategic and important move to further enlarge our premium portfolio. You see how we have played that with the Heineken brand. If you can play that with more brands, that will work, but the payback there is much longer. Desperados will probably be a little bit more in between.</p>
          <p>So we will judge all these things obviously in an economic model, but ultimately it's markets, it's brands, it's consumers, so you can model what you want. Ultimately, you need to believe in a number of things and there, put your money where your mouth is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. To underline Ren&#xE9;'s point, I think we very much look into opportunities which are on the short, medium and long-term. We wouldn't put all our marketing investments only on opportunities like cider, which will yield a big price perhaps in 10 years' time. I think that would be wrong, we would have a void in our business.</p>
          <p>But we have enough opportunities with our local brands to add, take an example of <mark type="inaudible" /> Radler, the Australians did a superb performance over the last year, because they have been just leveraging existing brands in a superb way.</p>
          <p>So it's really in every portfolio, that you take things that you can do today and yield and then the medium-term and then the longer term, and that combination. But to Rene's point again, you never know whether it's going to work or not. So, there is a dimension despite all the marketing research you do, there is a dimension of trial and error, because ultimately, it's the consumer who has to judge. And so it's much less of a science than a cost cutting management program.</p>
          <p>And so finally the U.S., the U.S., we have been following the same kind of route, but the U.S. is really a U.S. problem. First of all, we are not a mainstream player, we are a niche player, we specialize and import premium beers. So our position in that market is obviously different. So &#x2013; but there also over the last year, we have being reviewing our &#x2013; the way we do business, and it was an eye on recapturing growth for our portfolio. We have good growth with Dos Equis, but the performance of our Dutch portfolio is still not yet satisfactory.</p>
          <p>On the one hand and I repeat it there every year, you have to realize that this brand is ubiquitous. It's a brand that is everywhere in the United States and it's an aspirational brand for the lower and middle classes. These people are affected by the crisis in a big way. And it is not necessarily brand disaffection, but it is also a lot of downtrading, i.e. people cannot afford or will not afford themselves as frequently Heineken anymore as in the past.</p>
          <p>Is that a reason to lower down our investments in the brand or our belief in the brand? No, one day the crisis will go over. One of the strong points of America is always to deploy optimism, things &#x2013; business will get back and we have to prepare for better times and invest in equity, i.e. more into innovations, more people on the street for supporting the on-trade channel in the United States and also more people concentrated to key accounts into distributorships who help us commercialize our beer in the United States and who are key to the work we do there, to have a renewed and a more focused approach of our key distributors in the United States.</p>
          <p>And finally, there was the advertising part and there, you have to look at our stance that we are more and more growing into global advertising campaigns, which will not be necessarily U.S. specific, even if some global campaigns will be created by an ad agency in the U.S. But we will engage on a path, which will be clearly much more global as you have seen in this first sample of advertising in the entrance.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Mitch Collet from Goldman Sachs. Just to continue on the push for growth in Europe, can you perhaps tell us how you expect your competitors to react to your increased investment in marketing and innovation? And perhaps could you also give us a feel for how much that's likely to cost? And finally, can you maybe talk about why you've decided to do that now? Is it perhaps because you've done pretty well on the cost side of things, and perhaps there are less obvious opportunities to drive profit growth through cost reductions? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you talk about competitive reaction, ultimately, yes, you are not alone in the market. But we are not trying to do that by discounting and making &#x2013; over promoting our brands, et cetera. No, we were really building the market, building propositions, expanding occasions, bring innovations in the market. I think that is very healthy for beer markets, and I only hope that competitors will do the same, because ultimately, we all will benefit from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the timing of why we decided to do it now and making it public, look, we are working on that now for 1.5 years. You have to realize that a few years ago, we were seen as a company which was really sub-par on its cost base. Now, not only that, but also the market in Europe is declining for that main demographic reason that I highlighted in my presentation. We have been embarking in 2005, 2006 on a program called Fit2Fight, followed by TCM. Those are programs designed to re-tailor totally your business imprint in majority in Europe and to boost your productivity.</p>
          <p>It took our organization quite a while to get into that. There was a kind of a fear, never that was done with Heineken. The people did not have the practice of doing that. And so, we have been embarking on the first three years, and then said, well, it's not the end of the day, it's a way of life. It will ever continue. A company, I said it many times, who abandons the idea that it can improve its efficiency is a dead company. So it's important that we continue to do that.</p>
          <p>Why did we choose the moment now? It is because you cannot cut yourself to greatness. Yes, the pie is not growing, but if we are not investing to have a bigger share of the pie, we are not fulfilling our role of leadership, right? So arguably in the first years, the organization needed the full attention to go about cost cutting. They have realized a huge job. And we are confident now and the organization feels in itself that only or disproportionately, I would say, disproportionately only have that attention to cost-cutting is not making &#x2013; doing the trick. The trick, certainly, because Europe is a highly cash generative business.</p>
          <p>So providing that you can re-tailor it, as we did, to new market reality and then you can create platform for growth of your market share, being the innovation leader of an industry, that's the direction where we have to do &#x2013; to go and this is the moment in which the organization is ready, I would say, and is convinced to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to check I've got it clear, you hope that your competitors also invest in marketing and innovation and hopefully, therefore, that drives category growth? Is that the right way to think about it? And could you maybe give us a feel for which regions you think you can gain share and have category growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You could say that to a certain extent, conventionally, you are right in the sense as &#x2013; Spain has been a beautiful example, where all brewers invested in their brands, but all brewers together invested also in the category and they have been growing the category quite nicely. Now, the world is a competitive place, and every player in the market is choosing a strategy. It might be so that we will trigger something in the market, we'll see. But for this moment, as a clear leader in many markets in Europe, we will take the initiative to grow our business.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is one from the phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have a question from Gerard Rijk from ING. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions, if I may. First about your cost cutting success, probably also remuneration for your management there, and now your focus is a bit shifting towards the top line in particular in Europe. How is that &#x2013; how do you view that instrumental? Also, is there an increasing focus on remuneration on the top line success versus the cost cutting?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the A&amp;P investments in Europe. You are talking about the pressure on short-term profitability here. Do you mean here that you are expecting in the first half lower profits in Europe or is that excluding the deferred TCM savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, TCM is indeed part of &#x2013; an important part of remuneration, stays there, but top line gets much more important -- will become a much more important element of the remuneration of our senior management. And on the A&amp;P investments, we have said that will impact the profit development in Western Europe. We have not given guidance for the company, nor we will do that for the individual regions.</p>
          <p>But it's obviously, when you increase your marketing spend in a region, that will have an impact on what bottom line stays there, as long as you realize that these investments are not yielding immediately their effect, and we are not doing it by investing in just promotions and price actions, et cetera. It is a consistent longer-term brand building. It's the launches of new propositions, so that will have an effect on Europe short-term profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that effect larger than the further TCM savings in that year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you should not combine the two. These are two complete different decisions. One is what can you do on the cost side, and we have been very clear. 2010 has been an exceptional year on the cost side, so 2011 will be lower. Secondly, we said we will increase our investments in the markets behind the right propositions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions, please. On your cost savings, sorry to belabor the point, you've announced the Global Business Services Organization, which was formed during 2010. While it can't draw exact parallels, but it sounds very similar to strategies underway at two of your competitors that will be yielding between 2% and 4% of net sales in terms of efficiency savings. If we apply that to your old business, ex-FEMSA, that would imply something in the scale of Fit2Fight. I don't know if you can comment whether it is a realistic assumption for the sort of procurement savings?</p>
          <p>And then can I understand your cash flow guidance? You said you expect cash flow, operating cash flow to be equal to operating profit, but your CapEx guidance is below the depreciation for the year as it's reported and that doesn't even include the extra four months from FEMSA. Is there a big working capital outflow to offset that? And then finally on Mexico, you talked about a 7% price increase. Can you talk about how the pricing environment and your competitive response is in Mexico and should we think of Mexico more about pricing rather than volume from here, versus, say, what you were you presenting a year ago when you made the transaction? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all in TCM, I don't want to compare with guidance others give. If you look at global business services and what ultimately will yield to cost savings is, for instance, they're going to explore going to financial shared services, which are cross-border and not country-by-country. These are things which obviously will save cost, which will yield revenues, but it is certainly not something you will do in one year. And these are very &#x2013; they interfere in a big way in the business, so that you have to manage that in a gradual way. Your second question was about...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was on your cash flow guidance. CapEx is below depreciation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So you see that the 850 is slightly below the depreciation still. If you look at the very high cash conversion we had in 2009 and 2010, that was driven by a CapEx level much below depreciation and a huge benefit from working capital. Those you won't have going forward, hence, we say it will be around this 100%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But there is no reason to assume that working capital becomes a drain on cash flow for any specific reason that you're aware of?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And your last question about Mexico and the pricing, whether Mexico is becoming more a pricing market than a development market in terms of volume, I think it will remain a development market in terms of volume for the size of its population and the opportunities that exist there.</p>
          <p>In terms of pricing, we believe that the segmentation in the market will signify price, not just pricing today, but our ability to segment in terms of pricing more the market on the longer right. You don't do that, obviously, in one day. You always start with Heineken, because Heineken is an obvious proposal, but over time, we intend to do that in all markets including the developing markets. We do it in Africa too. We start to segment the market and that ultimately offers better opportunities on the long haul, but this is a long haul at work.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Yeah. Go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd be most interested on your comments around pricing in Russia in light of the issues you faced last year and also in light of the fact that probably it is the region around the world where you face the highest input cost pressures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we were very clear about it in our press release. We have been facing a hike on the excise duties which was unprecedented, and our reaction to pricing has been overly optimistic. I have said it at the half-year figures, well, that did not change now. This is done and it's very difficult to repair, because you can, of course, lower your prices but the intermediaries are growing with the margin. So whatever route you choose, you are offset for at least a year taking the wrong decision. So let's be very crystal clear. This has been something which happened. The problem is for us that we are not a number one or a number two in this market. We are a number three.</p>
          <p>There is a clear number one, and then there are all sorts of other players. So we are not in the strongest position. We concentrate on repair, we lost a lot of volume. We have been there also re-tailoring our production base and our organization base to do that. We continue to invest in our portfolio, which is much more reduced, as it was before, and with disproportionate effort on the top end of the portfolio, which of course, generates the best margins and you see also that if you look at the results of brands like Heineken or <mark type="inaudible" />, which are more in the top end of the market in Russia, we gained share with these -- with these brands. But the road to repair will be long.</p>
          <p>Now, the last comment I'd like to make is Russia is a big market in terms of volume for us. That's absolutely true. On the other hand, if you look at it in the total collection of our business, the problems we encounter in Russia, when you are in 70 countries in the world, you would like that every 70 country is a top performer. You have a few, of course, that are performing less, but it is not bringing the Heineken ship into disbalance, let me put it that way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One of your competitors there in Russia has been kind of guiding to a 9% increase as what you need to offset the input cost pressures that you are facing locally. Is that something that you're looking to follow or do you see an opportunity to be lagging in terms of the price increases, which is most of Carlsberg competitors did last year? And also lastly, if I could ask what your capacity utilization rate is at the moment in Russia, it would be very helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, we are not going to comment on our pricing strategy upfront, but it's good news that Carlsberg increased its prices by 9%. That gives opportunities. And capacity, we have taken out quite some capacity in Russia. I don't know the exact figure, to be honest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a bit of overcapacity, but it is not to &#x2013; if I look at our fixed cost ratio, nothing to really worry about. We have taken out two breweries in the production system that's what we have been doing. But we have seen &#x2013; Russia is a market you can drop very easily down and you can have also strong rebounds. So before closing more capacity, it's manned capacity, which is expensive and manned capacity, if you do it cleverly, it's not that overburdened.</p>

          <p>Matthew Webb from JP Morgan. Three questions please, first, just a point of clarification. When you talk about increasing your investment in Europe this year, are you referring just to Western Europe or the whole of Europe? Second question on TCM. So far obviously, it's been very focused on Europe. Do you expect that to change over time, or is that still where the main opportunities are? And then finally now, that you've achieved the &#x2013; well, more than achieved the 2.5 times target for your net debt to EBITDA ratio, and we're looking at another year of strong cash conversion, what are your plans for the cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, investment, you mean marketing investments? Yes, that is the whole of Europe. And TCM, yes, Europe will continue to be an important part of the cost savings realized in the Americas. Our report are not on the TCM, but on the synergy thing of the former FEMSA, things sort of EUR150 million is out of scope of TCM.</p>
          <p>And our net debt to EBITDA, yes, we have a target to be below 2.5 times, but that is a sort of a threshold. We have nothing against to be for the time being between 1.5 and 2 in a market which is still in a phase of further consolidation. We still have a lot of shared delivery instruments to deliver towards FEMSA sort of are enough things. We're not worried that we are just piling up cash. But we will continue to focus on capping the cash in one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Nico Lambrechts from Bank of America. Just back to Western Europe as well. The underlying business, ignoring the TCM cost savings, should we assume that the EBIT margins would be down as a result of the increased A&amp;P? And maybe could you give us some more detail, what would be the stepped up A&amp;P? Would it be above the line or would it be more music festivals? Is it just increased activity or is it pure innovation, doing it new? So that's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think eventually, it's more of innovation than purely the increase of activity, that we mean by that. There is where you have to step up, that is one. Secondly, on the EBIT margins, what is important when you do that? And to Ren&#xE9;'s point, you can do two things. You can bring cheaper products, you can discount them more and you will create top line and hectoliters. That's not our intention. So we would accept a margin decrease, as long as we see our gross profits going up, i.e. what we call GP and GP net, before and after marketing investment.</p>
          <p>The one has to go up, the other can go down temporarily, because you are in investment mode, that is what we envisage. It's certainly not the kind of things which are starting to dilute our gross profit margins, because we are just investing for the sake of volume, and then in our investment, we will privilege innovation. So innovative proposals, whether that's a line extension or new renovation or innovation, but that is what we would privilege.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify. The EBIT margin for the division, as we see it, if we strip out TCM, when you report it full year next year, there is a likelihood that, that EBIT margin could be down, because of the stepped up A&amp;P in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you strip out TCM, theoretically, yes. It depends a bit on what will happen on the pricing side....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And volumes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And obviously volume side. So, it becomes a bit an artificial discussion, and I find it a bit early to say, even including TCM, what will happen with the margins across the company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Then moving on to Mexico and the synergies. The synergies target that you gave us of EUR150 million, I just saw that you wrote approximately EUR150 million. I assume this is set at the 19 Mexican peso rate, so we can adjust that for the stronger rate? Would that be a fair assumption, with the Mexican peso now about 15% stronger than when you gave the target originally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Obviously we managed the program in local currencies. When we set it, the currency was at a certain level. You will see that, that goes up and down, therefore we say it's approximately. I think what is important is that the elements we have identified in these businesses, that we drive them out, that we realize that, that we're realizing them probably or hopefully faster than what we thought. We went off on a very good start, the team there is doing an excellent job, and let them continuing doing that instead of jiggling it a little bit more because the peso appreciated or the other way around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And on revenue synergies, which is a significant portion of reaching your 12% return on capital in, I think, four or five years. Could you give us an indication on timing of that and which specific efforts? Would it be first the Heineken brand and make sure then the pricing initiatives and then those brands, offer maybe a little bit of clarity around, because obviously in the investor community, we get a lot of skepticism around revenue synergies. If you can tell us how to think about that or model it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; as we said earlier, it's a build-up of several things. It's getting price laddering in the markets or price differentiation in the market. There, yes, the Heineken brands plays an important role to lead the market to much more differentiation and which will create opportunities also for other brands to benefit from it.</p>
          <p>It has also to do with putting your money behind the winning brands, if you see and we discussed that before, that quite a lot of marketing efforts were set about brands in regions where we think they don't have the huge &#x2013; the biggest opportunities. So put your money there where you think it can work and drive the business in that respect.</p>
          <p>Yes, the volume of the launch of local Heineken, we have quite some expectations of that, because we feel that the Heineken brand has good resonance in that country. But when we start building a brand in the country, it's not volume-driven, it's equity-driven. Make sure that it is felt by consumers as the best and the highest quality brand in the country instead of just pushing it by the big machine of CCM into all corners of the country.</p>
          <p>And so you can make quick wins, but longer-term, you shoot yourself in the foot. So also how we set targets for that organization is much more on equity than on volume in the beginning of that launch. So we're not going to dump Heineken in 250,000 point-of-sales from day one, that would be the wrong stuff to do. It's a gradual build of selective distribution that gets you there and that's over a horizon of 10 years, you have to realize, in which the first three years are years of investment, without any doubt. That is how conventionally the introduction of Heineken works.</p>
          <p>But as Ren&#xE9; said, it fixes you a start of a reference point in which in between, you can start to build a price lever with different brands, as we have done in countries like Nigeria, for instance, where there was no price differentiation 10 years ago, and now there is a lot, right? And that is how you create that, you have to take that over time. So that is where we will create revenue in addition to that, and that is the crystal ball. The population growth is there, it's the economics who will make the difference, and the prosperity.</p>
          <p>And Northern Mexico is already a market which is pretty mature. People drink 100 liter of beer. The price differentiation there will be &#x2013; will go quicker. Southern part of Mexico, still lower per capita, but also that again, an opportunity to selling more beers. So there is a part that you cannot &#x2013; there is always a business risk to that, but the fundamentals are quite good. And do not forget this, this is still a beer culture, and it will remain a beer culture for a long time offering that opportunity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally if I may, thanks for that. Could you possibly give us an update on that trade in January, February in key markets like Nigeria, Western Europe, Russia and Mexico? And has there been any pricing agreements concluded so far this year that you can disclose to us?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Ian Shackleton from Nomura. It's really two questions. One, I mean, you've probably surprised the market a little bit with your input cost guidance, low single-digit. I wonder whether if you can give us a little more granularity of how that works by region, where one assumes you've got less cover for example, in Central and Eastern Europe? And equally from a phasing point of view, you had a minus 8 on input costs this year. Do you still see some tailwinds from that at the beginning of the period? And I was just interested in the wording that you used there when you talked about mitigating this impact through increased pricing. And I don't know, I was thinking about mitigating. Mitigating means partly offsetting, not fully offsetting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So pricing may not fully recover that, is what we're saying, just sort of make us clear on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last thing, it's too early still to say, but clearly, we will try to offset it as much as possible. And the minus 8 you were mentioning is including the volume drop, so that's not a price benefit, but it's in the total lower of input cost. On a regional basis, yes, there are differences, because we have both at different times in different areas, we said let's keep it overall on the low-single digit, but it is and that is in mix back, obviously from &#x2013; of countries, which are less and some countries which are more, of which grow and packaging, of which Russia is obviously on the higher side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, my question was as we go through the years, there is a line that keeps going up and up and up, and obviously, we get slightly worried about 2012, where the hedging starts to run out and it spikes a few more. I mean, how do you envisage the trajectory there of that input cost line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2012 will be a difficult year. I think because the expectations are set quite high. The crop last year was not very bright. There were a lot of discrepancies. There are always factors of how much you seed, what your price expectation is and finally what you don't know is what the weather is going to do, right? And so there are a lot of uncertainties casting over this market. It's early days to form a view. We are, for cereal, in the barley market and specifically in the brewing barley market.</p>
          <p>Now that is the smallest of the smallest of the cereal markets, right? This is a niche market in the cereals, but we need that variety specifically for our needs. But the motivation of a farmer to grow for barley and then for brewing barely is, of course, a derivative from what maize is doing and from what wheat is doing, right, that is hard work. So we are a tributary to what the big market of cereal is going to do. But at this moment in time, it is still early days to see &#x2013; to say how that is going to unfold.</p>
          <p>I would like to have that crystal ball. But to point out that the situation is volatile, you are absolutely right. 2012 will not be an easy game to handle. 2011 was already not easy, but 2012, we expect to be even more bumpy. There is an imbalance in the &#x2013; slight imbalance in the cereal market of 1% provokes price hikes of 30%. So it's a very touchy subject. And also the roles of governments and the fact that they are doing some hoarding, all these kind of things, they intervene. And finally, the crop, the weather is a big part of that. So we are very much in preparation and wait-and-see. At the half-year, you will hear more about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jason Derise, UBS. Just continuing on the input cost and the pricing, excuse my voice. Why not take more pricing this year, ahead of what you know is going to be a tough year next year and smooth out that pricing or are you just saving up the pricing for next year? And then I wanted to talk about the savings, and if you can break out of that 280, if you think of all it is structural, and permanently there, or if you think some of it is just reactionary to the top line pressures? And then if the top line recovers, some of those costs will have to come back in, materially thinking about that section that's described as other cost savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second part, I can give you an answer. We are very keen that savings are structural and sustainable. Obviously, you cannot prove that to 100%, but in all projects that we do about restructuring, we're very keen to do exactly what is permanent, right? If &#x2013; and I had that case, somebody who came to me and said he could save a couple of million euros across Europe of standardizing all our lease park on just two brands, right? And I refused to do that. And you know why?</p>
          <p>Because when things are getting better, this is the first one that any manager is the position to let it go, let's go, and then you can have your Mercedes and you, your BMW, et cetera. These are things which you can maintain for three years, but not forever. So just to give a very trivial example of how we look at these things, we've got to be sure that that will stay, right? And that's how we go about it. And that's &#x2013; for us, a solid guarantee that these restructurings are &#x2013; when you close a brewery, it's easy, it's done, right? But in all reorganization, we make sure that it stays permanent.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Tony Bucalo, Credit Suisse. Thinking about your EBIT progression going forward, at what point do you think that the EBIT in your core business, the growth of the EBIT in your core business will exceed your cost savings, i.e. represent more than 100% of the organic EBIT growth looking ahead? And the second question is, the Heineken brand is obviously struggling in the U.S along with the other mega brands from the big domestic guys. Would you consider making Dos Equis your flagship brand in the U.S. as your primary brand, your primary flagship brand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You'll take Dos Equis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Dos Equis is a fantastic brand. And of course, it grows from a much lower position. It is 10 times smaller than &#x2013; or eight times smaller than Heineken. So frankly, I do not see the point of declaring Dos Equis our key flagship brand in the U.S. It is one of our flagship brands in the U.S., we moved a few years ago from only Heineken to a broader portfolio of premier import brands.</p>
          <p>And we think that is, going forward, a better proposal to kind of address different segments of the market. And once more, I underline that the position of Heineken once more is ubiquitous, is we're very largely spread, and we indeed suffer from the economic downturn and the consumer behaving going forward still. But that does not mean that we do not have potential going forward. But the answer to that is certainly not to declare that Dos Equis will be the flagship brand, even if we, of course, fully exploit that fantastic growth opportunity, I guess, for the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then, I find it always and at the bar, we have the discussion again about it. A bit artificial to say you have so many million cost savings, and this is your EBIT growth and you strip them out. That is not how it works in the company. And so, if you look at these cost savings, these are there. But you have only your cost base. On one hand, you have the inflationary side. On the other hand, you have growing regions which have expansion in cost.</p>
          <p>So just to compare an EBIT with the cost saving figure doesn't work. Ultimately what is the most important is that you get your top line growth, there is where it starts. Hence, we are so happy that we rebalanced the portfolio towards markets where it is much more logic or markets which are driven by top line growth and not by the cost containment.</p>

          <p>Well, you have to look that, it's certainly, I would say, intrinsically more volatile in Africa than it is perhaps in Latin America, and less volatile than Europe. Though there are two factors here, there is the perceived political volatility and then there is the predictability of how a state is going on with its investments base or with its industry. So to that extent, it's not only the political stability per se, i.e. having a stable, transmittable democratic process, but also how predictable the business environment is for the operators within that country.</p>
          <p>So those are these &#x2013; it covers these two dimensions. And then you can have some surprises, whereby factually, Nigeria is a more stable environment for the business than Greece is. But obviously, Nigeria offers a degree of volatility about political stability as we define it in the newspapers, which is higher than Greece. But for our business, both dimensions matter. And those are evaluated region-by-region, country-by-country and of course, that you don't have a lot of influence on it, one has to realize. You have to evaluate it correctly, let me put that way.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Trevor Stirling, Sanford Bernstein.  So you say to &#x2013; with such good numbers, it seems churlish to focus on a little bit of top line weakness. But there were two areas that seemed intriguing. The first one is the UK cider, after many years of growth, the market does appear to have swung into a decline. Is that something that's a category problem that's affecting all brands equally or is it a more of a brand-based issue?</p>
          <p>And the second one relates to the Americas. Americas had reasonably good volume growth in Q3 but must have had a very weak Q4 in order to give you your H2 decline. Could you just give us some more color on what was the source of the weakness in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Question one, the cider, yeah, exactly. The market went slightly, went down this year for the first year in many times. Is that a weakness of the category or is that general spending? Early days. I would not jump to the conclusion that the category's starting to suffer. Relatively to beer, cider is still doing better as a market than beer. So I would put it on the economics rather than on the structural and consumer preference, my guess at this moment in time. And on the U.S., I think you're right, the quarter four was bad, plain bad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the weakness that was the Dutch portfolio in the U.S., that's a bit, of course, the problems in Q4 or --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was &#x2013; Q4 of December weather, snow, Northeast much more affected than other parts. So the Dutch portfolio has suffered more from it than, for instance, the Mexican one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. When you compare your margins in the Western Europe with your competitors that report the margins for this region as well, you're still 300 to 500 basis points away. And obviously, there are very different exposures, and I presume that UK is a headwind to yourself, because of the large exposure in a low margin market. But is there room to get to the level where your competitors are some years from now? And is that possible to give any kind of timeframe for that or is that structurally low and it will be like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It's a good question, but as I &#x2013; we have a large wholesale business, which we incorporate in our European regions, so we don't do segment reporting. Now typically, these wholesale businesses have very low operating margins. This is just a working capital business with distribution. And therefore, we always look as we have lower margins. Your observation about the UK is spot-on. The UK is strictly a market which has lower margins than on most of continental Europe, perhaps Germany excluded. But on the other hand, yes, our nominal margins are diluted by our wholesale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a second question. Do you see potential for cider in the U.S.? Do you have plans to take Strongbow <mark type="inaudible" /> to the U.S. market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are in the U.S., we have a distribution agreement with a company called Green Mountain. And they are carrying our cider brands, and they have been doing so far an excellent job. It is a niche product in the U.S., but we will certainly continue to put some efforts in developing that as a longer-term line extension of our business in the long range category, we will do it, yeah. But you have to see that as a very long-term project, right. These are the kind of seatings that you make for your long-term portfolio projects, you do that.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Just a question on Nigeria. You acquired the 3.7 million hectoliter breweries. Were they idle or were they producing? And could you give some clarity on how that would impact your business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you said in your press release that you bought 3.7 million hectoliters, which gives you 3.7 million hectoliters additional capacity. So my question was, is this spare capacity or is this actually additional volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is part of additional volumes and there is part of spare capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have this numbers top of mind, what's written in the &#x2013; but normally it's half-half. What I've seen in Nigeria last week, these are breweries which are turning half of their capacity, and the one more than other, but that is roughly the thing. The second opportunity it gives, the extension possibilities in those five breweries at least in three of them are really pretty good. So things like the brew house can do the double, you just have to add things and this kind of thing.</p>
          <p>So we can be pretty quick in expanding the capacity even beyond the 3.7. That is what it offers and you have to still realize, Nigeria has a proper infrastructure. I've seen much worse in Africa than in Nigeria, but it's not optimal, right? So it is not China where you have big roads and everything is very well arranged. So it's a little bit like Brazil, you need a little bit more plans and that offers us a better footprint for us to operate going forward in that country.</p>

          <p>A serious question to Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. So this is a big potential for Nigeria, this acquisition? And-</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it is. Look, for us, it was the choice of building an extra greenfield plant or even two plants or three plants and that costs you a lot of time. Of course, you start from a technologic and productivity base which will be better when you have built it, but in order to get there, you need to two to three years. Here, we have bottom in there immediately to be upgraded and yielding that additional capacity that we need.</p>
          <p>So on the one hand, they will continue to do some of their local brands, which we value and which are good, well-positioned economy local brands and a part of the capacity will be used for all the products of the brands which are by nature, positioned higher in the market of Nigerian breweries and also part of consolidated breweries.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it wasn't the government. It's a private entrepreneur in Nigeria, a man who we are in business with. He is a supplier of us also. So we know who we buy it from. We have been doing proper due diligence. And we have taken over the company, it was last week there. I think it's a pretty good company with very motivated personnel and they make good quality beers.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. One more question? I feel it's time for a beer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, just a follow-on to my previous question. If you strip out the wholesale business in Western Europe, would you say that your beer margins are close to mid-teens? And just the second one, if you could just expand a bit on the contingent liability in Brazil, which is, I think, it's EUR1.2 billion of which for EUR306 million, you have to put on some guarantees, because it's related to tax. But there is a guarantee from &#x2013; you have a clawback from FEMSA against that. But on the other EUR900 million, could you just explain a bit what is that about and if there could be any kind of <mark type="inaudible" /> coming out of there or a big surprise? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Brazil, indeed for the tax claims, we are fully indemnified by FEMSA and then there are a number of other claims. For those who know Brazil, it's a country which is very good in claiming. We have very thoroughly assessed all these claims and taken the right provisions, which is in no comparison with the nominal amount of the claim. And we feel pretty confident in the assessment we have given to it. That was Brazil.</p>
          <p>First question was on the margins in Europe and I think we discussed it at half year as well. We have EUR2.4 billion turnover in wholesale, with a typical wholesale margin, even a bit below what is normally in some of the wholesales, who have the full portfolio. So that has a very low EBIT margin and you can subtract that.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the real figure of 2010 in Western Europe, so Waverly is half of it out, so you have to subtract another EUR200 million. So that is in our figures, so if you want to do the math on 2010, and there will be another EUR200 million going out of that for the first half of next year. Time for a beer?</p>
