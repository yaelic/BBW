      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mar&#xED;a. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending Telef&#xF3;nica 2009 full-year results conference call. Today I have with me Julio Linares, Chief Operating Officer; Santiago Fern&#xE1;ndez Valbuena, Chief Financial Officer; Guillermo Ansaldo, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica de Espa&#xF1;a; Jos&#xE9; &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America; and Matthew Key, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe. During the question-and-answer session, you will have the opportunity to ask questions directly to any of them.</p>
          <p>Now, before turning to the numbers, I would like to stress that Telef&#xF3;nica fundamentals remain very solid and we continue building value for our shareholders. Today's results prove our differential profile in the industry. In a very challenging conditions in 2009, we have posted a very solid performance on the back of our strong market position across a very well-diversified business portfolio; an integrated management model with a disciplined execution; and our financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>Moreover, in 2009 we have set the basis for future growth, pushing customer growth and fostering usage, and this strategy is already bearing fruit, as reflected by the better revenue trends recorded in the last quarter of the year in organic terms. We have again met expectations, delivering on our commitments in 2009, and we face better growth prospects from a great positions, with benchmark profitability levels and a robust cash flow generation profile. In this, we are leading cash return for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number three for a quick summary of 2009 financial results, please notice the reported the figures include the impact of considering Venezuela as an hyperinflationary economy in 2009. Underlying business trend remains solid, driven mainly by the good growth in Telef&#xF3;nica Europe and Telef&#xF3;nica Latam and the growing contribution of broadband connectivity, applications, and new services. In a year where growth has been scarce across industries, we have delivered positive organic growth revenue with significant ramp up from top line to operating cash flow, which increased 8% on the year to extend &#x2013; to achieve &#x2013; a &#x20AC;15 billion mark in 2009.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, 2009 net income reached &#x20AC;7.8 billion, with a 2.4 year-on-year underlying growth, or 4.5, in terms our revenue per share, we reached &#x20AC;1.71. Reported figures show material impact from several effects. First, in 2009 we have recorded &#x20AC;630 million of higher financial expenses related with our investment in Venezuela that Santiago will explain later on. Second, we have a lower income tax expense of &#x20AC;590 million related with a tax amortization of goodwill generated from certain foreign investments made before December 2007; and third, we have recorded a capital gain from the disposal of Medi Telecom.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number five, customer growth in 2009 has been a key lever for a sound performance. Commercial activity in the last three months ramped up sharply, leading to the very strong net adds in the second half of the year, tripling the volume recorded in the first six months of the year. And this performance is not related with seasonality, but with a focused strategy to build the foundations to better capture the economic recovery.</p>
          <p>Net adds evolution was powered by higher gross adds as well as churn control, with mobile net adds underpinning the increase with a remarkable 70% year-on-year growth in mobile broadband accesses. As a result of our commercial ARPUs, we reached more than 264 million accesses at the end of 2009, 5% more than a year ago on a like-for-like basis.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number six, improving underlying revenue trends versus the first nine months of the year and our disciplined management of OpEx and CapEx drove our robust cash generation profile. In 2009, we delivered a good conversion rate of revenues into cash generation, with operating cash flow organic growth exceeding by almost eight percentage points sales growth at the Group level. And our profitability continues to extend, with a consolidated OIBDA margin at 40%, 0.3 percentage points higher than the last year's figure, clearly organic.</p>
          <p>Economies of scale, further efficiency gains and using CapEx towards growth in transformation led to an improved management efficiency ratio of 1.4 percentages points. Let's not soap on guidance, execution is presented in the slide number seven. I am proud to say that once again we have met our annual growth targets, targets that have been fulfilled for the seventh consecutive year despite a more negative economic scenario than originally anticipated. Let me now hand over the call to Santiago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, C&#xE9;sar. Let's now review our regional performance, starting with Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a on slide number eight. In a very challenging environment, we have shown our flexibility to quickly adapt our strategy to market conditions, combining a very rich cash flow generation with a sharp pickup in commercial activity during the second half of the year. The very good news are that underlying revenue trends improved for a second consecutive quarter across both businesses, confirming early evidences of a recovery.</p>
          <p>Moreover, despite top-line pressure and high-margin revenues being the most affected, we posted benchmark efficiency metrics. OIBDA margin in 2009 reached 48% with a limited drop year-on-year on a comparable basis, reflecting our focus on cost contention and in spite of the strong commercial activity recorded in the last part of the year. CapEx-to-sales in 2009 declined roughly one percentage point to 9.6% as we managed our investment as a function of demand. As a result, we sustained our efficiency ratio pretty much unchanged in 2009, leading to a strong operating cash flow, which topped &#x20AC;7.9 billion in the year.</p>
          <p>In the second half of the year, we intensified our commercial activity in the wireless arena, as slide number nine shows, with a clear focus on value customers and mobile broadband, consolidating our leadership in the market both in terms of accesses, and more importantly, in terms of revenue. Contract net adds topped 640,000 in the second half of the year, with year-on-year growth rates ramping up significantly along the year. This led to a 5.3% growth in contract customers from December '08, which already account for 65% of the total base.</p>
          <p>Our focus on capturing growth opportunities is shown on the strong performance of wireless data flat rates that reached almost 2 million in December, or twice the 2008 figure. In a more mature market and amid the mandatory process to identify prepaid customers, total net adds in Q4 were hit by the disconnection of inactive prepaid lines with no impact in our financial results.</p>
          <p>Regarding this, please take into account that in May 2010, it will be mandatory for all players to disconnect prepaid customers not identified. As a result of that, we expect to record from around 100,000 to 120,000 disconnections in the second quarter of this year with almost a nil impact in revenues. Positive trends are also coming in usage.</p>
          <p>Mobile traffic growth in the fourth quarter not only improved sequentially 1.6 percentage points, but it did post the lowest year-on-year decline in the year and pricing behavior in the market continues to be rationale. As a result, and taking into account MTR cuts, ARPU declined by 9.7% in 2009. However, excluding the impact from MTRs, ARPU has shown a recovery trend over the last two quarters.</p>
          <p>In the wireline business as detailed in slide number 10, we are sustaining our market leadership with limited impact on broadband ARPU. Lines decline roughly 7% year-on-year in line with our guidance for the year, while in recent months we are recording better results. The fourth quarter recorded the best performance in 2009, excluding the seasonality of the third quarter. Let me add, to put in place financial impact, that 66% of lines lost in 2009 were offset by wholesale line net adds, which generate revenue streams for the Company.</p>
          <p>Retail broadband figures also showed a better performance in the second half as a year-on-year decline in net adds close to halved, compared with the one recorded in the first six months of the year. In 2009, we sustained our market share at the 56% level, with retail broadband connections growing 4% up to 5.5 million, while carefully managing our connectivity ARPU. As in the mobile arena, pricing is going down, but in a rational and contained way.</p>
          <p>In the pay-TV market, we continue gaining market share with Imagenio that, despite having just a 60% household coverage, has reached a 17% market share. We are recording good customer growth with an even faster pace in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>To finish up the review of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a in slide number 11, I will rapidly explain revenue trends, which support evidences of their recovery. Wireline, IT and data services continue to deliver healthy growth rates, the first on new contracts &#x2013; the first on new contracts being awarded and the second on higher retail sales and circuit rentals due to a mobile data explosion, which is also reflected on wireless data connectivity revenues' growth trend.</p>
          <p>Voice revenues across businesses, although still down versus 2008 of lower usage patterns, are sequentially improving from the second quarter, thus trending in the right direction. Wireline broadband revenues are stabilizing in the fourth quarter, with a minor decline of 2.7% in the quarter. Finally, PSTN access revenue has declined 7% in 2009, excluding universal service obligation in both years, due to lower lines and service.</p>
          <p>In summary, in 2009 we focused on revenue share and operating cash flow, setting the base for future growth. Let me now continue with a review for our operations in Latin America, where we are successfully managing growth while enhancing profitability.</p>
          <p>I'd like to stress the healthy revenue performance, up 5% year-on-year in organic terms, on the back of double-digit growth in mobile service and Internet and pay-TV revenues, driven by the sustained customer-base growth in the region where we have reached close to 169 million accesses. OIBDA almost doubled revenue growth, ramping up by over 10% to top &#x20AC;9 billion, expanding OIBDA margins in organic terms by 1.7 percentage points to close to 40%.</p>
          <p>Management of OpEx and CapEx efficiencies jointly with scale economies are reflected in the over three percentage points improvement in the efficiency ratio. The value of our diversification best emerges when you look at other operating cash flow contributors by countries, where Mexico and Brazil drove close to 40% of the growth.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight the increase of &#x20AC;1.3 billion in operating cash flow during 2009, totaling &#x20AC;5.7 billion, while we gained 11 million customers organically. And we delivered this strong performance without jeopardizing the focused CapEx effort. Let me highlight that the year-on-year decrease is mainly driven by lower CapEx in mobile. Our ongoing focus on quality is reflected on the strong investment made across wireline operations, where CapEx-to-sales ratio have remained pretty stable over the last three years.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 outlines our Latin American wireless businesses where we continue with a strong commercial momentum. Net adds ramped up along the second half of the year significantly, reaching in this period 3.3 times the ones of the first half of 2009. The fourth quarter showed a turnaround relative to the first 10 months of the year, when net adds were down compared to 2008. <mark type="inaudible" /> remarks the quality of our growth as 19% of the net adds were contract.</p>
          <p>It is also important to notice the improved ARPU trend along the year on the back of traffic stimulation and a robust data expansion, which drove outgoing ARPU into positive territory. As a result, mobile revenues posted a very healthy evolution with a 12% year-on-year growth in service revenue, despite the drag from mobile termination rate cuts. Data revenue grew an outstanding 38% year on year organically to represent 18% of service revenues in 2009 as mobile broadband continued to gain traction in the region.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to slide number 14 to review our wireline businesses in Latin America, where the focus in 2009 has been on raising service quality to increase customer satisfaction and drive growth. Along the last quarter of the year, we have recovered broadband growth and significantly reduced line losses, stabilizing revenue drivers and setting the foundations for 2010. Fourth quarter has been the best in broadband commercial activity, driving accesses up by 6% year on year to 6 million.</p>
          <p>Traditional-line losses also showed a significant improvement in Q4. The transformation of the businesses is showed by the increased weight of bundles in our base as well as a higher contribution of Internet and TV revenues to total revenues that weighted across the region 21%, an advance of over two percentage points on, over 2008.</p>
          <p>Let me now spend some more time on Telesp. Telesp continued to focus on raising its quality metrics and our efforts are already paying off, as reflected by the better commercial performance recorded in Q4 and a significant decline in the volume of complaints submitted to the government and consumer associations, as you can see in this chart. Q4 '09 has been the quarter with the best performance in terms of fixed-line losses in the last five quarters, due to a lower churn on the back of improved quality standards.</p>
          <p>In terms of broadband, net adds recovered in the last quarter of the year to close to 60,000, 2.7 times the ones recorded in the first nine months of the year. And this has been achieved despite the fact that gross adds are still below the monthly levels recorded before Anatel's decision as advertising just started at the end of November and we are progressively resuming speedy sales across distribution channels and we are very much focused on capturing good quality adds.</p>
          <p>The increased commercial activity was compatible with an OIBDA margin stabilization on a sequential basis, despite the higher short-term spending on transformation initiatives. We need to keep working to further enhance Telesp's performance and we are working in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Finally, with Latin America, let me review quickly the performance in two key operations, Mexico, where we have posted very strong results. At the same time that we gained over one percentage points market share, service revenue grew 18% and OIBDA soared by 55%, expanding the OIBDA margin by over 10 percentage points. I already mentioned the strong increase in operating cash flow. Vivo's performance was also remarkable. And, in a very competitive environment, it was able to gain market share while increasing profitability.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to Europe in slide number 17. Telef&#xF3;nica Europe accelerated revenue growth in the fourth quarter in spite of difficult economic conditions and increased competition overall. We saw positive progress in our German and U.K. businesses, where we maintained strong market momentum. At the end of 2009, Telef&#xF3;nica Europe's mobile customer base reached 44 million, an increase of 6.5% year-on-year. Of our new mobile customers, 80% were in the contract segment, a significant improvement over 2008. The increase in the customer base and the continued adoption of mobile Internet, which is helping stabilize underlying trends in ARPUs, resulted in positive organic revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Improved efficiency and lower retention costs led to an impressive 22% organic growth in operating cash flow, of which 14 percentage points come from Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany. In the U.K., Telef&#xF3;nica defied a shrinking market to clearly outperform its competitors, gaining share in 2009 through a consistent approach to its core mobile business, with insight driven propositions, the continued migration of prepaid to contract, and its market leading contract churn at 1% in Q4 of '09.</p>
          <p>Mobile customer growth in the year was 5%, with contract customers growing by 14%. As a result of this healthy customer growth and the increasing adoption of mobile Internet, mobile service revenues in the fourth quarter ramped up from previous quarters to close to 2% year-on-year growth in local currency, which translate into a strong 8% when excluding mobile termination rate cuts from the calculation. OIBDA also accelerating in the fourth quarter to 4% year on year, clearly exceeding revenue growth in the whole year as acquisition and retention cost grew less than implied by increased commercial activity, as well as due to higher efficiency in non-commercial costs.</p>
          <p>CapEx in 2009 was reduced despite higher investment in networks to improve customer experience. In Germany, we capitalized on a best-in-class network, improved distribution franchise and a renewed portfolio to deliver market leading growth. Contract net additions in the fourth quarter were 260,000, a significant milestone in the recent performance of the business, mainly boosted by the successful introduction of the O2o tariff and My Handy hardware model, with partner channels also contributing positively.</p>
          <p>Mobile service revenues continued showing healthy performance in Q4 of '09, ramping up to 2.5% year on year if we strip out MTR cuts from the calculation. This was leveraged on 11% contract customer year-on-year growth and increased contribution from non-SMS revenues stabilizing ARPU trends.</p>
          <p>OIBDA showed a remarkable 19% year-on-year growth, with OIBDA margin increasing three percentage points on the back of new commercial approach set up one year ago, as well as the lower national roaming expense as the deployment of our own network reached an end. This has resulted in a significant improvement in the operating cash flow, which has turned positive in 2009.</p>
          <p>And turning now to slide 20, I would like to highlight that our debt size has remained broadly stable while its quality has improved. Interest expenses target has been beaten and the average maturity has been increased. Our net financial debts stood at 1.9 times OIBDA at the end of the year, or 2.1 times when adding cash commitments, in the low part of the range reiterated at our last Investor Day.</p>
          <p>This will allow us to accommodate the effect of the recent devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar that will push up the total debt-to-OIBDA ratio by circa 0.1 points on a pro forma basis. The effective interest rate has fallen by 46 basis points from 2008, benefiting from our floating exposure. The interest cost stood at 5.54% of our &#x20AC;45.2 billion average total debt, a little below our 6% medium-term target reiterated in the last investor conference.</p>
          <p>Even when adding foreign exchange losses mainly due to U.S. dollar purchases in Venezuela, the financial expenses stood below 6% at 5.9%. Additionally, total financial expenses in 2009 have been pushed up by &#x20AC;630 million due to recent events in Venezuela, but we do not expect this impact to be repeated in 2010, mainly as we will try to manage the net monetary position with the aim to nearly eliminate the accounting charge on our cash due to inflation.</p>
          <p>Finally in 2009, we have continued lengthening the average maturity of our debt that we will try to keep above six years in the future. To reach that goal in 2009, we issued &#x20AC;8 billion worth of long-term bonds and signed a &#x20AC;4 billion loan-extension option, focusing on pre-financing 2010 and 2011 maturities, respectively. So we have increased our average debt life to 6.6 years and built a cash position strong enough to exceed the 2010 debt maturities.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand back again the call to our Chairman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Santiago. Let me now share with you our positive outlook for 2010. During this year, our first priority is to boost revenues, capturing growth opportunities in our footprint. Against a backdrop of better economic accelerations, we will capitalize our strong market positioning and execution skill to foster broadband adoption both in the fixed and the mobile business and to capture additional mobile voice potential mainly in Latin America.</p>
          <p>To secure revenue growth, we will reinvest efficiency gains. We saw <mark type="inaudible" /> a benchmark OIBDA margin, as we will leverage scale economies and synergies across the whole Group. Positive customer and volume growth prospects and our financial strengths paves the way for higher investment in 2010, driven by CapEx in broadband and mobile coverage and capacity.</p>
          <p>As a result and according to <mark type="inaudible" />, Group revenue is expected to go up between 1 and 2.4% in 2010, mainly driven by strong top-line expansion at Telef&#xF3;nica Europe; a very solid, strong growth revenues in Latin America; and a lower revenue underlying decline in Telef&#xF3;nica de Espa&#xF1;a compared to 2009. We anticipate consolidated EBITDA growth between 1 to 3% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Please notice that this range incorporates the contribution from Hansenet from March, which is expected to be slightly below &#x20AC;100 million, and the negative impact of the new TV tax fee in Spain amounting to &#x20AC;150 million. Total CapEx will be between 7,450 and &#x20AC;7,650 million this year, in line with our midterm guidance and still below the peak CapEx-to-sales ratio reached in 2008.</p>
          <p>Please be aware that quarterly performance won't be linear along the year. EBITDA growth rates in Q1 are expected to be below full-year target as first year-on-year comparison will be tough in Spain, as commercial activity in the first half of 2009, and particularly in first quarter, was weak. We expect a better EBITDA performance in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The operating problems that we faced in the wireline operations in Brazil and Colombia hit 2009 performance mainly from the second quarter. And Hansenet contribution will start to be consolidated from March. In summary, we will foster top-line growth while maintaining a high cash flow generation profile.</p>
          <p>On the other side, in October 2009 we confirmed our 2010 average per-share target of &#x20AC;2.1 on the back of the operating guidance provided and up to 1 billion from further efficiencies in taxes and financial cost and potential asset sales. Despite several challenges have materialized since then, as the bolivar devaluation and hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela, we maintain this target capitalizing on the following levels:</p>
          <p>Interest expenses for 2010 are now expected to be around 5.5. to 5.75 below our previous expectations, which was 6% as we said in the Investor Conference. 2010 accrued tax rate is estimated to be around 25 to 27%, reflecting the current lower taxes on goodwill amortization and potential for other tax efficiencies as the Company continues to look for tax management opportunities. Previously, the accrued rate was expected to be at 27 to 28 in 2010. And we continue to analyze value-creation opportunities, maintaining an active management of non-core asset portfolio.</p>
          <p>Regional priorities are outlined on slide 22. All of them have the same focus, to foster top-line growth by maintaining a strong commercial momentum. If I will have to differentiate among regions, I would say that in Spain we will continue executing the strategy already seen in the second half of 2009, when we have been able to revive our commercial activity and consolidate our leadership in the market. In Latin America, our focus on the mobile arena will be on expanding the customer base while improving the ARPU. In wireline, we will enhance customer satisfaction and quality as key drivers to speed up our transformation towards a broadband company.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we need to continue outperforming in our key markets following the track record delivered in 2009. In summary, our high-quality and well-diversified asset mix will allow us to deliver a very good set of results in 2010, stressing once again our differential growth profile in the industry.</p>
          <p>Shareholder remuneration continues to be our first priority in the allocation of uses of free cash flow. In 2009, we devoted &#x20AC;5.5 billion or 61% of free cash flow to shareholders' remuneration. We offer sector-leading cash repayments and we are fully committed to deliver on our highly attractive dividend for the coming years. 2010 dividend will go up 22% on year to 1.40 euros per share and we have a 1.75 euros per-share target for the fiscal year of 2012.</p>
          <p>So, we have now launched a share buyback program. We continue buying our own shares tactically. In this regard, we made a filling to the Comisi&#xF3;n Nacional del Mercado de Valores stating that as of February 19, 2010 we hold 0.6 of the share capital. This is in addition to the derivatives on 150 million shares at the year-end. To ease some concerns, I would like to stress that our dividends are comfortably covered by our cash generation and our dividends flow is not dependent on repatriation from any country in Latin America.</p>
          <p>In summary, Telef&#xF3;nica is a very attractive investment proposition, with leading dividend per-share yield, not only in the sector, but among the top largest company by market cap worldwide. We are the highest company between the 50 markets company by market cap in the world with the highest dividend yield. At yesterday's price our dividend yield was 8.3, well above our bond yields. In my view, this is too high considering the active growth prospect we announced in our last Investor Day and we have reiterated today and that are clearly implied in the dividend growth path of our dividends.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 24, we do confirm our selective M&amp;A policy, primarily focused on investment to support our current operations, like getting additional spectrum and in market consolidation opportunities. We also aim to increase further our stake in China Unicom to 10%. Our priorities now are the spectrum auction that will take place in the coming month in Germany and in Mexico. It is also possible that additional spectrum is awarded in Spain along this year. Regarding market consolidation, I would like to remember that 10 days ago we closed the acquisition of Hansenet, a transaction that completes perfectly our strategy in the German market.</p>
          <p>To recap, despite the significant challenges and adverse conditions, we posted a robust performance in 2009 and maintaining the track record of delivering on our commitments. We charge it to the positive outlook for 2010 in midterm reinforces Telef&#xF3;nica differential profile in the industry.</p>
          <p>We have the right strategy and with a lower risk investment case. <mark type="inaudible" /> winds from Venezuela are already behind us. We continue to be a shareholders oriented company with a selective M&amp;A policy, offering industry-leading cash repayments for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Before we enter into the question-and-answer sessions and taking into account recent rumors regarding Telecom Italia, I would like to stress that we keep working with Telecom Italia to maximize synergies through the current industrial partnership because this position is clearly the best alternative for our shareholders. We are very comfortable with the current 43% stake in Telecom and we are very pleased with the cash synergies that our alliance is already delivering. We have jointly captured over &#x20AC;620 million worth of synergies since March 2009.</p>
          <p>And during 2010-2012, we expect to deliver even more value than in the previous period. I hope that with this statement we have clarified all the recent rumors of a change in our relationship with Telecom Italia. And thus we can focus the question-and-answer session on our operating and financial performance. We will make further comments on Telecom Italia.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention, and now we are ready to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's David here. A couple of questions please. First of all, your EPS target, you mentioned about potential asset sales within that. Is there anything you could give a little more granularity on any assets, such as Atento perhaps?</p>
          <p>And then a question for Matthew please. In the U.K., obviously O2 U.K., I think, continues to surprise all of us, probably not yourself, but all of us on its excellent performance, but obviously in Q1 we now have some additional iPhone competition from Vodafone and probably a little more momentum around Orange's efforts, too. So with that strong Q1-Q4 performance in mind and looking ahead to Q1 and 2010, perhaps just your feeling on how the competitive edge is continuing there, because I did also note a some fairly bearish comments from Palm on sales of the Pre?  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. David, thank you for the question, this is C&#xE9;sar Alierta. We are very comfortable level we will reach the 2.1. And as I said on the presentation, where there is going to be efficiencies in tax and financial especially, which are going to be important, but also we will dispose of some asset which are non-core to our business.</p>
          <p>As you know, we always have capital gains in our balance sheet and some of these are not core to our business and one of the things that, one of them, the most important I can be is to now, to take to the stock market Atento, as everybody know, which is, we don't think it's a core business anyway. I would like to tell you at this moment that I have been through many crisis in my life. And I can tell you that I'm very proud to say that Telef&#xF3;nica, if you look our positions, we have not gone through any crisis.</p>
          <p>Everything we have in our portfolio are capital gains, so &#x2013; possible capital gains &#x2013; so that's a position that we feel so comfortable toward the future with a strong financial position and such a sound balance sheet that it looks like we have not gone through a crisis.</p>

          <p>...cleared a number yesterday they sold in quarter four. I think they declared 222,000 and all I can say to you is, I can't give you a specific number, but during that same period we actually outsold them.</p>
          <p>So, more than comfortable on that. And even since Vodafone has started selling the iPhone in January, we see absolutely no evidence of people leaving us, churning, on the iPhone, going back to Orange or Vodafone, so, very comfortable with our iPhone volumes. We continue to out-trade the market and no sign of churn whatsoever.</p>
          <p>On the Q4 net adds, I can comment on our trading activity. We're really happy with the value that we get and our customers that we get and you will have seen how Q4 net adds held up with where we were in previous quarters. I would say that, if you look at the U.K. market, total net adds of 1.4 million in quarter four doesn't stand a logical test. So, I would suspect that some of the other networks may be getting some churn coming back into quarter one or quarter two during 2010.</p>
          <p>On Palm, yeah, I saw the comments from Jon and the guys at Palm yesterday. All I can say is that in the U.K., the volumes were broadly where we expected them and in Germany actually we're very happy. It was our biggest selling handset during quarter four.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. I was also going to ask about the iPhone, but I wondered if you could touch on the impact it's had in Spain, where I think you may be pricing it a little higher. I wondered if that, how that compares to the other markets?  And also on Brazil and Telesp in particular, and thinking also about the efforts you're making in Colombia, can you tell us if the, to what extent the one-off additional cost effort that you're having to put into these assets could come out of the numbers during 2010?</p>
          <p>And against your advice perhaps a little, but I wondered if you won't mind clarifying your situation with respect to Telco, given that is &#x2013; fine to say your 46% that you're happy with, but I'm not sure that the other parties are altogether happy with their 54% stake. Is there a scenario where you could see that holding company disappearing and your stake being held directly in TI for example?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. This is Guillermo Ansaldo. Trying to address your question about the iPhone in Spain, we are not allowed to disclose figures regarding our sales of iPhone given the agreement we have with Apple, but I can say that sales volume are going, are doing very well and that the iPhone and other 3G smartphones are contributing to the explosion of sales that we're having with mobile broadband, where roughly we end the year with almost 2 million, 1.9 million of flat tariff broadband, mobile broadband contracts. And that's almost double what we have at the end of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking the question on Telesp and Colombia. Let me start by Telesp. We are progressively going back to normal business. Significant improvement in quality levels, I mean we have increased significantly our call center capacity. We have ensured redundancy in the toll gate. We have increased the IP total capacity of the network and we have redesigned our IP network. As a result, quality levels are back to historical highs.</p>
          <p>Claims in <mark type="inaudible" /> are historically low, but that our total revenue have been decreased, lowest level of this year, churning traditional lines and maybe it still. a significant improve. So we are little by little getting back on track and that's also been noticed, or starting to flow through the customer base, gross adds in traditional line is back to the previous levels, positive sign, line losses have been significantly reduced, as Santiago has been detailing.</p>
          <p>Gross sales in terms of both ADSL and lines are also back on track, progressively back on track because we have to keep focus on the quality of the new adds. Market share has stabilized both in the traditional lines, we have increased a little bit of our market share within, that we have increased a little bit of our market share in ADSL in the region. Then an issue for us is still <mark type="inaudible" /> in Brazil has been improved.</p>
          <p>Voice traffic is dropping less in the last quarter of the year and that's something that we need to monitor because that might be a very good news. ARPU stable, 20% of revenue coming from new businesses, 23% of, almost 24% of the lines, of total lines with ADSL, a stable OIBDA margin in the last quarter of year, significant effort in CapEx for third year in a row, in the neighborhood of 14% of our sales, and also we are trying to improve our cost structure.</p>
          <p>In order to give you some guidance of January, of the first months of the year, trends keep being positive in terms of both net adds and in terms of quality.</p>
          <p>In the case of Colombia, we are a little bit below that level of turning around. What happened to us in 2009 is that we lost a significant amount of traditional lines because we were totally in position terms of the commercial offer. We have rebalanced the situation. We suppose to improve our commercial position in terms of market share, but we need to do additional efforts. I think that we launched a new commercial offer in, I think it was January 17, which is paying very good results, but it's still too soon to give such positive signs, I think, on Telesp. OIBDA margin has been stabilizing a little bit in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>So, better news, but we need to consolidate because we need them to turn around to fulfill our 2010 target, but so far we are on track.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Jesus Romero from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jesus from Merrill Lynch. Two questions please. The first one is just giving us a little more detail today on the 2010 guidance on slide 21. And if I do the math, the guidance for EBITDA, the range is 22.6 to 23 billion, but the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar is a headwind of 900 million. So you're down to, let's say, an adjusted guidance of, middle of the range, of 21.9 billion.</p>
          <p>That's 700 million below the reported EBITDA this year and you're still talking about 2.10 of EPS, which is a 1.75 billion increase in profit. So how should we think about this?  You think most of the improvements in EPS should come below EBITDA in 2010 and how much of that number?  If you could give us any more hints, would come from a capital gain?</p>
          <p>And the second question is related to some of the comments you've made recently regarding Google's potentially having to pay for some of their network usage. And if you could also say something on the wholesale applications community [WAC] you announced recently in the Barcelona DSN event?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jesus, this is Santiago. Let me answer, if I can, the first part of your question. We have consistently provided guidance on an FX-adjusted basis, so that we can compare pears-and-pears, and apples-with-apples. We think that, despite the complexities of our Group, this continues to be the right way to proceed. So we will continue providing FX neutral guidance numbers.</p>
          <p>Your numbers are undisputable and I think when the Chairman made the statements during his call, it should have been evident that we do expect a significant contribution this year from both financial and tax management activities, along with asset sales, to contribute to the 2.10. Just where on that ladder we will end to achieve the 2.10 is still unknown, but please do add the FX, your best FX assumptions to those numbers, and your best assumptions on what could happen below the operating line to arrive at a sensible estimated EPS number that, again, is non-adjusted.</p>
          <p>It is going to be spoken of as reported. So, it's still early days within the year, but we do think that it is going to be a year where most contributions &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; that contributions will come from all fronts and not only from the usual sources.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This thing about Google, let me say two things. 20 years ago, the telco industry generally was liberalized because they were phone monopolies and because of that, all of us we got an ex-ante regulation. And the ex-ante regulation, basically the goal was to increase and foster competition. We all know that this has been achieved. There is lot of competition. We are many players and the competition is there.</p>
          <p>So clearly, with regards to the operators and the telco, the communications companies, there is a clear initiative to go from the ex-ante to ex-post regulation.</p>
          <p>But clearly the new players, the emerging players in this new value chain, I mean the competition is not enough, so clearly there is a need for an ex-ante regulation to foster the competition, which is &#x2013; this is good for the consumers and for everybody.</p>
          <p>So we think it will happen to these new players like it is because of the value chain cannot be asymmetrical. So that what we are expecting, that, to give the quality of service and the network capacity, this will be in that sense.</p>
          <p>What we think is going to happen?  Well, I think, we think is going to happen that the mobile area is going to work and will make the whole model of the whole industry workable, is what is called revenue sharing. The revenue sharing that is already in application in services and which I think is very important. And basically this will be revenue sharing also on the search engines and basically that's our point of view. And now Julio, will complete on the WAC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jesus, the announcement we made in Barcelona about WAC is a joint agreement between a lot of companies in order to provide a global wholesale application services, supported already by 30 operators, including the biggest companies, and the four major mobile handsets manufacturers.</p>
          <p>This WAC solution provides to the application developers community three kind of assets. The first one is a standard APIs: testing, marketing, support, information, statistics and education, and all of that across different devices.</p>
          <p>The second, it is the biggest commercial channel distribution of compliant applications, because of the operators that we are behind this initiative. And third, we are providing to this developers community access to an unparalleled scale of 3 billion customers, which I think is the best assets in order to compete in this new digital world.</p>
          <p>So, initially this initiative is going to be focused on mobile widgets, but in the future will evolve in order to cover other platforms. So, in my view, this is the right response of our telco industry in this new digital world landscape.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Robin Bienenstock from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Two questions. I guess the first question is, you've talked a lot about your revenue growth in Latin America, and yet Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia and Uruguay are all shrinking in local currency terms. And I've noticed that your mobile prices are 25 to 95% higher than peers in most of your Latin American countries. So the question is how are you going to get back to local currency revenue growth, or are you?  And are those prices sustainable?  And that's on the mobile.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is about the Spanish fixed line, where I noticed that ICT is the largest part of your growth, so essentially enterprise services. Are these Spanish or are they international, because I know that you're booking some international things in various places?  And are you using contract accounting?  And if so, what margins are you booking yourselves and what are you assuming?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks for the question. In terms of revenue build, in fact we would like to check the numbers on your premium, because, I mean, those are not coincidental with the one that we have, because we are competing on the market and there is significant competition in every, almost every area where we are present. So, I would like to check those numbers in order to conclude.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I think that in the last quarter we have been trying to reverse the situation in our major market, namely Telesp, and we have been back, gained some market share, namely in ADSL, and to retain part of the line losses that have been suffered before. So I think that our offer is competitive. It was not. It was not competitive in Colombia and that's why we have been losing significant amounts of line, but with the new campaign that we have been launching in January 17, the numbers that we are getting from that looks appealing, though it's still too soon to say.</p>
          <p>And both in Chile and in Argentina, we are competing with very strong players in each of the countries and therefore we don't feel the full market share loss that we are becoming uncompetitive in our commercial offer. So, that's why I would like to check the number with you and see them because we're not feeling the effects of those, of that conclusion in market share.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the contract on the corporate side that you were mentioning in Telesp, of course margins are significantly lower than the traditional business in the residential market. We have significant &#x2013; we have a very large market share in the customer segment &#x2013; in the corporate segment &#x2013; on all of our wireline operation because we are the former incumbent and we have very competitive offers in terms of infrastructure, deployment and capillarity.</p>
          <p>Margins are in the close of the low double-digit numbers, but are highly contributors and significantly big in terms of providing additional revenue growth. And in order to conclude, I would like to mention that in 2009, it is true that we have been lagging growth on the wireline business, but it's also true that we have inflationary situation that was different from what we were budgeting at the beginning.</p>
          <p>Remember that almost every country in Latin America had negative GDP growth with the exception probably of Peru and we don't know yet about Brazil. And therefore, I mean, the competitive environment, in terms of consensus lower than the expected, but having said that, with the fevers that we have been foreseeing in the market in the fourth quarter and the first week of 2010, we are still, we feel comfortable that we can turn around the situation.</p>
          <p>We are pretty focused, as you might imagine, in Telesp and in Colombia because those are going to be the largest contributors to growth if we turn around the situation and that's the expectation that we have for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Robin, this is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding your question about ICT, it's a segment that it is growing very well. Basically, we are providing services that are very close to our telecom infrastructure, for example, typically house and custom services, end-to-end stock management, and so on. We are serving, and in the &#x2013; our numbers are companies or institutions that are in Spain. They could be public institutions or private institutions, national or multinationals, but the services are those that are provided in Spain.</p>
          <p>The volume size, as you can see in the numbers, is roughly &#x20AC;500 million, so that's below the 5% of our revenue mix. So, it's growing, but the impact of this growth is limited to that size. Regarding margin that you were asking, the margin varies across operation, but it's roughly between 10 and 15%.</p>

          <p>Oh hello, two questions. One is, can you sort of comment and just remind us how much cash is left in Venezuela and what the significance of &#x2013; I noticed on one of the slides it talks about a different exchange rate before January 8 &#x2013; if you could update us there?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I guess just looking at I guess the relationship with Telecom Italia, are you ruling out any relationship where you might be able to acquire perhaps their Cuban assets, perhaps TIM Brasil?  Are you sort of ruling out all permutations beyond the current shareholding within TSU &#x2013; within Telco?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, let me update you on the cash balances in Venezuela. At the end of last year, that is before the devaluation, the dollar value of our cash holdings there was roughly $3.3 billion, which of course is a much lower number after the devaluation that happened at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>A couple of other things have happened at the same time, and it is that this spy good has been opened, and we do expect to be able to claim back the dividends that have been declared and asked for at the local currency agency, CADIVI, at 2.6. This is our expectation, it has been our expectation all along, and that should assuage many investors' worries that the cash was trapped. It isn't.</p>
          <p>Not only that, we continue to expect it to come home, and not only the full amount that we were due from the 2006 dividend if I recall correctly, but also the two other years' dividends that we have claimed. We will continue to update you on those developments, but the devaluation has also opened this other more warm, more interesting line.</p>
          <p>Again, because we have claimed those dividends, we now have a local liability, which is what I was talking about when I said during the call that we would be trying to minimize or shrink the net cash position. We will both have assets and liabilities sitting in Venezuela at the same time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I had two questions. First with regards to Spain, you hinted to the fact that revenues would continue to decline. At the same, you expect to be a bit more active on the commercial front. So my question is, do you see opportunities to reduce other OpEx to mitigate the declining revenues and the increase in marketing spend?</p>
          <p>Second question has to do with Latin America. I note that in Mexico there are spectrum auctions and possibly new entrants. I also note that in Brazil there's, to me at least, a surprising announcement that Telebras could be investing up to $10 billion in broadband to provide broadband access to Brazil. And so, the question here is really, are you forecasting and are including in your guidance the entry of new players in Mexico and Brazil?  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding you question about Spain, as we mentioned, we will continue in 2010 to try to foster the growth of our customer base. We very much focus on value customers and obviously on broadband. That obviously puts some pressure on margins on the commercial expenses side.</p>
          <p>And, of course, on the other side is our strategy where we continue exploring all the savings opportunities, both on OpEx and CapEx. And, as you have seen in 2009, our efficiency ratio, with combines CapEx and OpEx, was virtually the same we had a year before. So, it's tough, but we do believe that the effort is worth it because we will have more customers, value customers, and we will be better prepared for the future when the cycle turns around.</p>

          <p>With regards to your question about the competitive landscape in both Mexico and in Brazil, you can go first to Mexico and the spectrum auction. We already knew when the auction was designed, a part of the spectrum was going to be reserved for new entrants and namely the names of Televisa was quoted and others.</p>
          <p>Since then, Televisa announced that they are under consolidation, consolidated talks with Nextel and therefore there is some more con... &#x2013; supposed to be a more consolidated market, so those are news that we know so far. And in terms of that presenting some additional case, we don't feel that because Nextel is already a player in the market. So, we don't feel that the situation is going to be deteriorated in Mexico, but rather the opposite, because we do need the spectrum in order to become much more competitive in mobile broadband and in mobile Internet. And, therefore, I think that the auction being completed and awarded, whatever the result is, if we gain more spectrum it would be good news.</p>
          <p>On top of that, remember that there is another process in Mexico that is being run. The National Electrical Company is putting for sale dark transmission fiber with national coverage and that's very good news because that's going to help to reduce down transmission prices in the country and therefore to be able to provide a more competitive offer. So, whatever we approach Mexico with in that situation is improving in terms of the competitive landscape, even though it's true that new players might arise. But, so far so good, and we think that this spectrum thing and the transmission is good news.</p>
          <p>And in terms of Brazil, the announcement of the Telebras is still pretty confusing. I mean it is true that this figure has been mentioned and covered by media, but it is also true that it is not yet clear what is the strategy that this potential investment is going to be devoted to &#x2013; if it is wholesale capacity, if it is retail capacity, what is the linkage between the legal context of the privatization process?</p>
          <p>So, it's still too soon to say. In our case, namely in S&#xE3;o Paulo, remember that just in the S&#xE3;o Paulo State, there are seven networks already operating, so the level of competitive pressure is pretty high, at least in our landscape in wireline broadband. So we are prepared for that and we &#x2013; our main focus is, again, to turn back Telesp in good shape and that's where we are focused on. And the remainder, we will see.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, I have two questions please. The first one is regarding the guidance. Given that acquisitions have been included for guidance in 2010, am I right in assuming about your full-year guidance also includes these items?   And does that seem like a change versus what was previously communicated?</p>
          <p>My second question is on cash flow, particularly around the difference between net interest payments and net interest expenses, which was around 1.3 billion in 2009. I understand that around 650 million relates to hyperinflation in Venezuela, but could you give us an idea of what makes the rest of the difference between the two numbers and is this something we should expect to see in the years to come, or was it just limited to 2009?</p>
          <p>And also whether you could talk around tax payments in the cash flow statement versus the P&amp;L?  Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I'm sure of where we left it, so why don't I start over. On guidance, the short answer is Hansenet was not included in our Investor Day and now it is. That's the only change in perimeter that you should account for.</p>
          <p>On cash flow, the difference between interest expense and interest accrual comes from mainly two sources. The first one is the concentration of coupon payments because they are annual coupons and there is a time difference because we did issue lots of bonds in 2008. That explains most of it. The rest is vastly explained by the &#x2013; part of our payments in Colombia falling due at discreet intervals in the year and, of course, being accrued on a time basis. So, that fully compounds and our Investor Relations team will be more than happy to provide better numbers.</p>
          <p>In terms of tax payments, what you may have noticed the pickup in tax cash payments in Q4, which comes mainly from the advance tax payments that we must provide the local authorities, the local tax authorities in Spain, and that then gets evened out according to the tax statement in the month of July, so we did have to make a very significant cash payment to the local tax authorities in December. That is now going to be around the summer clarified for good or for bad.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I'd like to come back on the competition in Latin America, but with a different angle. How do you perceive the merger of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil with Telmex Internacional?  I mean, do you expect also to increasingly focus on integrated offers in some of your Latam position?  Do you see it as potentially a risk to some of your commercial position where you don't have some fixed asset?</p>
          <p>And I'm notably thinking about Mexico. I mean, do you particularly, perhaps, need sooner than expect, just to control some fixed asset?  And also Brazil, I mean on a nationwide basis?</p>
          <p>My second question is regarding CapEx. Could you give some more color on where potentially there could be an increase in CapEx in 2010?  And again, I'm thinking about Latin America. I mean should we expect some increase in CapEx for 3G rollout, and also for some specific situation, coming back on the Brazilian government national broadband plan, which as far &#x2013; if I am correct &#x2013; is also involving private companies to be investing in broadband assets, not a reach for mobile broadband?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. In regarding the announcement of the integration process of the wireline and wireless business of Carso and Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil we did that years ago, I mean in terms of whatever we &#x2013; that was going to be done, we did that in terms of aligning the interests of the different shareholders in the value chain. And also in 2006, since 2006, we are running from a single point both the wireline and the wireless operators.</p>
          <p>So, on that side we have been preparing ourselves for that. We know the market with our &#x2013; our quadruple play offer is attractive for customers and on some others we're not, so on that side, we monitor the situation very closely, as you might imagine, but we think that we are prepared.</p>
          <p>The only play &#x2013; and do not underestimate the fact that this process has execution risk and requires significant focus, so put &#x2013; having the same, the same focus on the commercial side and integrating process is a complex matters and we know that.</p>
          <p>So in terms, but mainly in the case of Brazil, which is probably another of the market that you might be thinking of in terms of this integrating process. Again, our main &#x2013; the main value point that we can provide to our shareholders who were nice to turnaround the Telesp situation, we have focus on that. And at the same time remember that Vivo is highly performing, a very good year, I would say.</p>
          <p>So we need to be sure that we keep the focus of Telesp management team on redressing the situation and of Vivo management team of delivering another outstanding year before thinking about further potential joint or commercial offers or whatever. So, we do not feel that need so far.</p>
          <p>And in terms of CapEx, what it is included &#x2013; well, in most of the countries where we are operating on the mobile side, we have already been deploying during 2009 3G networks very aggressively. In the guidance, it is already included additional deployment, aggressive deployment I would say, of 3G all around the region, namely in a country we're significantly lagging behind, like Colombia in 2008. We did catch up significantly in 2009 and in, on that side we have increased by 13 times the number of places where we are present in terms of the technological deployment of 3G.</p>
          <p>So, it's already embedded in our guidance. The only thing that it is not embedded in that figure is the spectrum that we might be allocated in Mexico. All the rest, including some initial movements on the fiber deployment in S&#xE3;o Paulo and in Chile, is included in the guidance that we provided you.</p>

          <p>The increase we had on CapEx in 2010 is coming mainly from Latin America and Spain. In Europe, there is we expect a slightly decrease because we made already the effort we needed in  Germany in order to have the network. We need it and then it will come from these two regions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions please. One for O2 Europe, you are, let's say, pushing integrated products more and more, so do you feel a need in the U.K. and Germany to add a TV product to your offering to compete more efficiently?  And the second one is to fixed line in Spain. Could you give us an indication where the line losses are coming from, except the wholesale line loss, so, i.e., is it disconnections or is it business line, access line loss?  And do you have any visibility when that could turn around?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let me pickup the Europe question on TV. I think when we look at both markets, they both look pretty difficult from a TV perspective. Clearly, you've got Sky in the U.K., which are dominant operator and have most of the premium content tied up. In Germany, some pretty good cable companies, but also a lot of free-to-view channels in Germany. So, is it a major focus for us?  Probably not. May we test some things?  Maybe, but certainly not a major focus for us over the coming few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, this is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding the fixed line, in 2009 we lost roughly, have a net loss of 7% of our total fixed-line base. These are retail accesses, by retail mean whenever we have a billing relationship with the end-customer. When we look at total line loss, meaning wholesale plus retail, the decrease is only 2.4%. That means the difference is basically wholesale lines. This is the new regulatory figures, where allows more connection between third parties and a end-consumer.</p>
          <p>The whole market, we estimate that decreased a little bit to end last year and basically the disconnections, that's total disconnection, is 2.4 and retail is 7%. Looking into the future, we do believe that this trend will ease up a little bit and we will start seeing better numbers in 2010 and 2011 and 2012. You have seen in the second part of last year that the volume of disconnection is lower and that we believe will ease up in the future, taking into account the economy will start to improve and that we have more gross adds into this market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Sorry to come back to Venezuela, but I don't think that I fully understood the comment on negligible impact on net income from monetary adjustment and having now a liability which is offsetting or netting of this cash position. What's the nature of this liability, how do you created this?</p>
          <p>And also regarding margins in Venezuela and the comment made that most of the risk is behind us, something that I would like to understand is whether you have still a flexibility to increase prices aligned with inflation, and also what percentage of your costs in Venezuela are in hard currency and whether you see any kind of operating margin pressure?  And finally regarding Germany and the upcoming spectrum auction, KPN has made clear that they are open for partnering after the auction. I would like to get your view on this as well  Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Luis, let me try and explain. I was alluding to the asset and liability impact after the devaluation, so what is going to happen this year that we still &#x2013; what happens is, we still have cash in Venezuela that has suffered, is going to suffer a significant correction in dollar or euro terms, but at the same time we have claimed the dividends.</p>
          <p>So we have north of 6 billion bolivars in cash and we have north of 6 billion bolivars in claimed dividends that are now a liability of a company to the extent that they are approved. This is the liability-asset offset that I was talking about. We do not claim that the exchange rate is going to be the one we expect, but certainly we are not going to need, if my accounting is correct, an additional adjustment because of the net cash value of our investment there. So, no more idle cash means no need for further cash adjustment.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Luis, Jos&#xE9; &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete speaking. Taking the question on the margins on Venezuela and what's going to happen after the devaluation &#x2013; still unknown. The main uncertainty right now is inflation, what is going to happen with inflation, because this is really what is going to affect our business in terms of need of having some tension in prices schemes or in terms of the cost. So far, and it's too soon because it's just one month or almost two months away, it's too soon to say, but so far, we do not feel significant tension in terms of inflation. But again, it's too soon to say; we need to monitor that.</p>
          <p>In terms what is the cost structure and therefore how this inflation can affect us, remember that we were already not subsidizing handsets in Venezuela precisely because the cost of internalizing those handsets. Remember that already in year 2009, the handsets imports were carried out there parallel market and therefore was already, in terms of dollars, being adjusted and that's why we were not subsidizing handsets in Venezuela and this is mainly the main impact of the devaluation.</p>
          <p>Other part are basically denominated in local currency, labor cost, interconnection, or other commercial, like commissions and other commercial expenses. So, before concluding, we need to see what is the evolution of inflation. So far, it doesn't look concerning, but it's still too soon to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just pick up the German question. In principal, network sharing is something that we like as long it doesn't restrict our commercial flexibility, witnessed by the sharing agreements we've already got with Vodafone in the U.K., Germany and Ireland.</p>
          <p>With respect to Germany specifically post-auction, the depth of that potential agreement and who with clearly depends on the outcome of the auction and who ends up with what spectrum. So, in principal, yes, we're in favor, but who with and to what depth, that's to be determined.</p>
