        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  To those of you here in the room and everyone watching via our webcast, welcome to Imperial's 2009 Preliminary Results Presentation.</p>
          <p>I'm joined today by Alison, Gareth and Bob, and various other members of our executive team.  You'll have seen that we released two statements to the Stock Exchange today, one regarding our full year results and one in respect of our planned change for Board succession.  Gareth, Alison and Bob will take you through the results, but I would like to comment on Gareth's retirement in May next year and Alison's future appointment as our Chief Executive.</p>
          <p>Imperial has been transformed in the last 13 years from a U.K. and Irish business with 29 people in the international department, 2,800 employees and ranking as a number 14 tobacco company in the world to a truly global enterprise, selling products in over 160 countries, employing 38,000 people and now ranking number four in the world.</p>
          <p>Many people have obviously helped create the new Imperial, some of them in this room.  But for the whole period since demerger, it has been led by one larger-than-life Chief Executive, namely Gareth.  From a market cap of &#xA3;2 billion on demerger in 1996, we now have a market cap of over &#xA3;18 billion and an economic value of around &#xA3;29 billion.</p>
          <p>And along the road from October 1996 via Rizla, Van Nelle, Tobaccor, Reemtsma, Commonwealth, Altadis and some decent organic growth, the shareholders have done not too badly either.  I know how highly the investment community regards Gareth and that view is more than echoed within Imperial.</p>
          <p>Gareth, you've done a tremendous job and we are extremely grateful, but the season ticket at Bolton Wanderers will have to wait a little while.  You have more than a few months left, a few more board meetings, a bit of handing over to do and of course, quite a lot of analysts to talk to.</p>
          <p>But that brings me on to Alison.  Succession is one of, if not the biggest task facing any board in the U.K.  When succession entails following someone of Gareth's record, intellect and stature, that task becomes even more important.  The Board however is extremely pleased to confirm the appointment of Alison as Chief Executive when Gareth retires in May next year.</p>
          <p>Alison has made an outstanding contribution to the Group over the last ten years and continues to be a key driver of strategy and performance on our board.  Her experience encompassing finance, operations, mergers and acquisitions, the regulatory environment and of course since March, as our Chief Operating Officer, provides a great platform to lead the Group into the next phase of its development.</p>
          <p>Alison has been instrumental in evolving and implementing our strategy, which we outlined to the investors in Morocco earlier in the year.  And she will ensure that we continue to develop that strategy and to build on our record of growing value for shareholders.  Alison, many congratulations.</p>
          <p>We have lots of times to say thank you to Gareth over the next six months, but let me be the first on behalf of you all to say, Gareth, great job, well done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And with that I'll set you back to work on the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Okay.  Well good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  And thanks, Iain, for those kind words, particularly the bit about intellect, which I think was more than generous.  And given Bolton's recent results, I'm quite happy for the season ticket to wait.  In fact the way they're playing at the moment, I might even get a game next week.</p>
          <p>Before I start, I'd just like to say Bob just passed me a note and said 2,800 to 38,000 and you think you can control head count.  It's probably a fair assessment, yeah.  But before I start, I'd just like to say a few words about Alison.  I'm absolutely delighted that she'll be succeeding me.  I worked with her for 10 years and during that time she's made a significant contribution throughout the business and become a widely experienced and respected Executive Director.</p>
          <p>Alison produced a strategic review which is already delivering results.  And she's got all the qualities needed to take Imperial forward, to drive growth and to deliver the high level of returns that our shareholders expect.  Now to have the right skill set, the drive and the total support of an organization is an enviable combination and Alison has got all three in bucket loads.  So Alison, can I add my most hearty congratulations and best wishes to you.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the results.  By way of approach, I'll give an overview of the highlights and Alison will outline our operational performance.  Bob will review the financial results and I'll round things off with a summary at the end of the presentation.</p>
          <p>Now this has been a particularly good year for Imperial.  We've grown profits in our mature markets and made great advances in emerging markets, a terrific achievement considering the difficult economic backdrop.  In terms of headlines, we increased our global cigarette volumes by 10% to 322 billion sticks, driven by a combination of a full year of Altadis and many good brand and market performances.</p>
          <p>As we acquired Altadis in January last year, the financial results for the second half of 2009 are the first like-for-like comparatives from which you can assess our underlying performance.  In this period our cigarette volumes decline 2%, outperforming our tobacco peer group.  And we delivered organic growth in Tobacco net revenues of 5%.  After adjusting for foreign exchange, we delivered second half operating profit growth of 10%.  And after further adjusting for synergies it was 7%.</p>
          <p>I'm particularly pleased with the working capital savings of around &#xA3;1 billion, which on top of our strong underlying cash generation resulted in a conversion rate of 128% and enabled us to make a reduction of over &#xA3;2 billion in our debt position, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>For the year our adjusted earnings per share were &#xA3;1.618, an 18% increase on 2008 or 12% excluding foreign exchange benefits.  The Board is proposing a final dividend of &#xA3;0.52 per share bringing the total for the year to &#xA3;0.73 per share, which represents growth of 16%.</p>
          <p>And finally on financing, during the year we raised just under &#xA3;4 billion through bond issues, which coupled with the working capital reduction and ongoing cash generation, leaves us with no refinancing requirement until July 2012.</p>
          <p>We're a sales-led business and our revenue growth is result of our ability to successfully leverage our total Tobacco portfolio across our geographies.  And our cigarette advances were a particular highlight this year.  At the top end of the portfolio we grew volumes of our premium brand, Davidoff, by 12% with very strong gains in our Rest of the World region.</p>
          <p>In mainstream, Gauloises Blondes delivered 1% growth with progress particularly in Spain, Africa and the Ukraine.  And West, although down year-on-year, had a strong recovery in our second half, particularly in its core market of Germany and across our Central and Eastern Europe regions.</p>
          <p>At the value end we've achieved an 11% increase in John Player Special, with growth in all regions in which it was sold.</p>
          <p>We continue to grow these leading brands and they now account for over 25% of our cigarette volumes with an even balance between emerging and developed markets.  These brands are complemented by a number of strong regional cigarette brands, which make significant contributions in their own markets.</p>
          <p>Highlights this year include Maxim, our best-selling brand in Russia, where we capitalized on the growth in the low-price sector with in-market volumes up 10%.  We also delivered 21% growth in Fine volumes with good performances in a number of markets in the sub-Saharan region of Africa.</p>
          <p>Now whilst driving the operational performance of the business, we've remained focused on integration and made excellent progress in the year, both in terms of our specific European projects and the ongoing alignment of processes and systems.  Our program has delivered slightly ahead of our original plan, enabling us to report cumulative synergies of &#x20AC;190 million, 10 million ahead of our target.</p>
          <p>Our progress also allows me to reaffirm with great confidence our previously announced targets of &#x20AC;300 million of cost synergies for 2010 and &#x20AC;400 million for 2012.  And we're also firmly on track to deliver net revenue synergies of &#x20AC;60 million by 2011.</p>
          <p>Our adherence to our key growth drivers has enabled us to deliver superior returns for many years. By way of illustration, I'd like to focus briefly on our second half operating performance, which as I mentioned earlier, provides a good like-for-like comparison.</p>
          <p>Growing the top line is a key priority and in the second half we delivered organic growth in Tobacco net revenues of 5%, through a combination of leveraging our portfolio and price increases.  We also continue to optimize our cost base.  Our focus on cost and synergy delivery, balanced with targeted investments has enabled us to improve our adjusted Tobacco operating margin to 40.6%, up from 38.9% in the second half of last year.</p>
          <p>To be truly effective, cost optimization has to go hand-in-hand with working capital management. And we turned a working capital outflow of &#xA3;600 million in the first half to an inflow of nearly &#xA3;1 billion for the year as a whole, a tremendous result which helped facilitate the &#xA3;3.2 billion reduction in debt we achieved over the last six months.</p>
          <p>So that's the big picture.  It's been a great year, where we've delivered strong results.  So, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, I'll now hand you over to Alison to take you through our operational performance.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Iain.  Thank you Gareth.  And good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  As Gareth said, it's been a terrific year.  We've made particularly good progress with our leading cigarette brands, enhancing our positions in both mature and emerging markets.  And this balanced operating platform, combined with the strength of our portfolio, provides us with considerable growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>In our mature markets, we've strength across our product categories and a focus on profitability. Last year in the E.U. we sold over 134 billion cigarettes, 23,000 tons of fine-cut tobacco and nearly a billion cigars, growing net revenues by 19% to &#xA3;3.8 billion and profits by 20% to over &#xA3;1.8 billion, which resulted in an increase in the adjusted operating margin to 48.3%.</p>
          <p>In the U.S.A., we're investing to further develop our established cigarette, fine-cut tobacco and cigar positions.  And our businesses in Australasia consistently deliver high margins and profit growth.  Our emerging markets accounted for 51% of our cigarette volumes in 2009, up 1% in our second half.  And our focus is on driving further top-line growth with investment priorities in Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>In all our markets, local insight is key to maintaining our growth momentum.  And we continually seek to align our local portfolios with evolving consumer preferences in order to maximize our sales potential.</p>
          <p>Let me now go into the main markets in more detail starting with the U.K., where balancing share and sustainable profit growth is our key objective.  We estimate that the annual duty-paid cigarette market was stable last year and that the fine-cut tobacco market was up by 19%.  Both benefited from a reduction in the purchases of U.K. brands abroad as a weaker economy and currency reduced overseas travel.</p>
          <p>In January, we increased our prices and in April the Chancellor raised tobacco duties by &#xA3;0.07 per pack of 20 cigarettes.  We grew profits and our cigarette share of 45.3% reflects excellent progress with JPS Silver since its launch last November.  And Richmond and Lambert &amp; Butler, the U.K.'s two best-selling cigarette brands, performed robustly underpinning our overall market share.  Our fine-cut tobacco volumes grew significantly and Golden Virginia Yellow, launched in March, is starting to offset share pressure due to the premium segment decline.</p>
          <p>In Germany, duty-paid cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 2% during our financial year and down trading remains a key dynamic.  We increased prices across our portfolio in June and minimum pack size has increased from 17 to 19 cigarettes in July.  Our cigarette volumes grew due to the full year's contribution from Altadis and a broadly stable share, with profits up 30%.  JPS has been a real success story for us and we continue to build on its excellent growth record despite its recent short-term price disadvantage.</p>
          <p>Our premium brands, Gauloises Blondes, Davidoff and R1 were all resilient and maintained market share, while the success of both maxi packs and the recently-launched soft packs underpinned the West brand franchise.  We're the market leaders in the growing other tobacco products sector where we increased our volumes as a result of a strong performance from Route 66, growth in JPS, and additional private-label contracts which began in October last year.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Spain, where economic conditions have been particularly difficult with unemployment approaching 20%.  Market volumes of duty-paid cigarettes were down 7%, mainly due to reduced travel retail volumes and further down trading into fine-cut tobacco.  We estimate that the total white stick market declined by approximately 4%.</p>
          <p>We increased prices in January and in June taxes were raised on all tobacco products.  We passed on the increase in most cases and at the same time further increased prices of nearly all our cigarette brands.  In the blond segment, a slight decline in Fortuna was largely offset by further growth from Nobel and Ducados Rubio.</p>
          <p>We are the market leader in fine-cut tobacco and grew volumes by 52%, although our share was down due to travel retail declines and strong growth in the natural sector, reinforced by a low optical price point for some brands.  We addressed this with a launch of a new brand, Origenes, last month.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to look at our Rest of E.U. regions, where cigarette-market volumes were down 4% predominantly as a result of significant duty increases in Poland and the Czech Republic, which have led to growing cross-border flows from the East.  Excluding these two markets we estimate that total regional volumes were down 2% in line with long-term trends.</p>
          <p>We increased prices in the majority of markets during the year.  And in France, where we increased prices yesterday, the cigarette market was up 3%, reflecting a reduction in E.U. cross-border flows. Our performance in the blond sector was particularly good and we increased our share to just under 24% with gains from JPS, News and Fortuna.  Elsewhere in the region we grew cigarette shares in a number of markets including Portugal, Greece, Czech Republic and Austria.</p>
          <p>In Central Europe, as excise duties have risen and consumers continue to seek value, demand for fine-cut tobacco products has grown.  We anticipated these changing dynamics and delivered 31% growth in our volumes across the region.  Additionally, in Scandinavia our snus volumes were up 35% and as a result we're investing in further manufacturing capacity to enable us to meet demand.</p>
          <p>Our main business in the Americas is the U.S.A., where we delivered strong profit growth despite the market disruption as a result of the significant increase in federal excise taxes in April.  In January and March, we increased our cigarette prices and, despite significant competitor activity, our share remained stable with our key brands, USA Gold and Sonoma, at 2.4% and 1.6% shares respectively.</p>
          <p>We also delivered month-on-month volume growth with Fortuna as we grew its distribution.  Competitor discounting has reduced from the peak levels and our spot share in September was 4.3%.  And last month we increased cigarette prices by $0.06 per pack.</p>
          <p>Underlying cigar industry volumes have been affected by the economic climate and the very substantial tax increases.  However, against this backdrop we've performed well with our premium and natural-wrapper brands.  But the homogenized-wrapper portfolio was under pressure.  Price increases, cost and operational efficiencies, including the closure of cigar factories in Florida and Alabama, have been important in enabling us to maintain profitability.</p>
          <p>I'll round up our Tobacco operations with our Rest of the World region, where we delivered another excellent performance and cigarette volume growth of 13%.  In our Africa and Middle East region, we delivered a further set of strong results with significant progress from our main brands delivering volume, profit and share gains in many markets.</p>
          <p>In Morocco, we consolidated our market-leading position ahead of the tobacco distribution monopoly ending in 2010 and delivered growth in Gauloises Blondes.  And in Saudi Arabia, our main market in the Middle East, our share was up to 9.8%.  We grew profits and volumes in Eastern Europe, achieving particular success with Davidoff, which was up 16% across the region.</p>
          <p>In Russia, our cigarette market share was stable at 8.6% with a good performance from Maxim.  And in the Ukraine we grew our share of Classic in the value sector and Davidoff in the premium sector.  Our Australian cigarette share continues to recover and we've made progress with Horizon and launched JPS in May, which reached a spot share of 1% in September.</p>
          <p>We delivered a strong performance in Asia following the opening of our Taiwanese factory in January, increasing our average cigarette share to just under 10%, rising to a spot share of over 11% in September, with positive progress across the bulk of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>And in common with most luxury goods, our overall Habanos cigar volumes were impacted by the economic climate, resulting in both destocking and lower consumption.  However we've partly mitigated this through price increases across the portfolio and volume gains in Asia, most of Eastern Europe and in some markets in Western Europe.  And pleasingly, we've seen sales recovering in recent months.</p>
          <p>Overall it's been a great year for our Tobacco operations.  We made advances in our mature and emerging markets, generated tremendous working capital improvements and made significant progress on integration.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to Logistics.  Our tobacco logistics operations have been resilient.  And whilst we saw some economic impact in our other logistics operations, we were largely able to offset these through cost-saving initiatives and share gains in some divisions.</p>
          <p>Within tobacco logistics, our performance in France was ahead of expectations and we've recently renewed contracts with BAT and JTI.  And in Spain, despite the volume weakness our results benefited from price increases and we also renewed our distribution contract with Philip Morris.</p>
          <p>In other logistics we were able to increase market shares including in our French wholesale operations and within our pharma division.  We're rationalizing our other logistics operations whilst looking for further opportunities to leverage our expertise profitably.</p>
          <p>In Spain, Logista recently formed a joint venture with a gaming company to provide a range of services to support one of the Spanish lotteries, including distribution and marketing.  The contract runs till 2020 and will significantly extend the lottery's point-of-sale network and improve our profitability.</p>
          <p>Let me close by looking at our expectations for 2010.  We will further enhance our focus on driving sales, ensuring that our versatile brand and product portfolio continues to be aligned with changing consumer preferences, impacted by regulation and the economic environment.</p>
          <p>During 2010 we have a number of global brand initiatives, including Davidoff rejuvenation, Gauloises centenary packs, West Super Slims and further pack innovations.  But our local and regional value-for-money portfolios are also critical to manage in an environment where we're likely to see more down trading with consumers looking for value choices.</p>
          <p>Within our European markets we currently expect normal market volume trends and our results will benefit from the full year impact of the 2009 price increases.  But we expect a continuing negative economic impact in Spain.  We've not seen a significant impact elsewhere but it's clearly something we will continue to monitor.</p>
          <p>In the U.S.A., we will be investing to further enhance our operational performance as the market continues to work through the impact of the federal excise tax increases.</p>
          <p>We believe our emerging markets within our Rest of World region present us with considerable growth opportunities.  As part of the ongoing development of our Africa-Middle East business we've been restructuring certain distribution arrangements in the region, which we anticipate will result in a short-term volume reduction but with minimal impact on Group profit.</p>
          <p>Strategic investments in key markets and our focus on sustainable sales growth is enabling us to further develop our business.  And our enhanced sales focus is already delivering results, with September cigarette spot shares in a number of markets ahead of our 2009 averages, adding to my confidence that as we go into 2010 there's real momentum in the business.</p>
          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  I'd now like to hand you over to Bob to take you through the financial highlights.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alison.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  The reading today, I'd like to start with an overview of the results.  Tobacco net revenues were up 30% to &#xA3;6.8 billion, reflecting the full year contribution from Altadis, operational progress and foreign exchange benefits.  The increase in logistics distribution fees reflects the full 12 months' results as opposed to eight months in 2008.</p>
          <p>Both Tobacco and Logistics adjusted profit from operations grew strongly, up 31% and 46% respectively.  The combined result is an increase in adjusted profit from operations of 32% to &#xA3;2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>The Altadis acquisition, combined with the impact of foreign exchange movements and additional costs of refinancing, has resulted in an increase in the net interest charge to &#xA3;700 million.  And after tax charged at an effective rate of 26%, adjusted earnings per share grew by 18% to &#xA3;1.618 or 12% excluding foreign exchange benefits.</p>
          <p>Results have been adjusted and presented on our usual basis with the main differences to reported numbers being amortization of acquired intangibles of &#xA3;451 million and fair value losses on derivative financial instruments of &#xA3;660 million.  There are further details in the appendices.</p>
          <p>Before I go into more detail, note that when we're discussing the impact of foreign exchange movements, we adjust for the translational impact and also the transactional impact on our leaf costs.</p>
          <p>Starting with net revenue analysis.  Our Tobacco net revenue grew by 30%, or 16% at constant currency, and we benefited from a full year's contribution from Altadis in all regions apart from the U.K. In the U.K., revenues were up reflecting pricing improvements, a stable duty-paid cigarette market and growth in fine-cut tobacco volumes.  And our German results mainly benefited from the June price increase.</p>
          <p>In Spain, our results reflect increased prices and growth in fine-cut tobacco volumes, whilst our Rest of the E.U. region delivered a good performance in France and many other markets, which was offset mainly by volume declines in travel retail as well as market declines in Poland, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>Despite the cigarette market decline in the U.S.A., we delivered a good result in the region due to pricing improvements and a good operational performance.  And within our Rest of the World division, we delivered a strong underlying performance in the majority of our markets.</p>
          <p>Moving on to profit.  Our Tobacco adjusted profits from operations grew by 31%, or 17% at constant currency.  In addition to the points I highlighted in respect of net revenue growth, profits also benefited from incremental synergies of &#x20AC;147 million or &#xA3;128 million, which we delivered in the year.  But this was partially offset by the &#xA3;17 million-bad debt write-off in the Netherlands, which we took in the first half.</p>
          <p>Our Logistics operations contributed a little under &#xA3;1 billion of distribution fees and &#xA3;177 million to our adjusted profit from operations, with the impact of economic conditions being mainly offset by cost initiatives.</p>
          <p>Given that our second half shows a clearer picture of our organic performance, I though it'd be useful to give you some further analysis, starting with net revenues.  We outperformed the industry with cigarette volumes down only 2% with good underlying growth offsetting economic conditions in Spain, the FET increases in the U.S.A. and Central European market falls.  And we were able to deliver 5% organic growth in Tobacco net revenues in the second half of the year.  Spain is perhaps the most difficult of all macro environments, but our price increases in January and June will support revenues in the current year.</p>
          <p>In the U.S.A. our second half was affected by significant competitor discounting.  However, our share is now on a positive trend and we would expect revenues to continue to be strong.  The U.S. cigar market remains in a state of flux but a combination of price increases and strict cost management means the business continues to perform in line with expectations.</p>
          <p>And now moving on to adjusted profit from operations.  Adjusting for foreign exchange and incremental synergies, both Tobacco operating profits and Group profits grew by 7% on an organic basis.  As you can see, all of our operations grew organic profits, aside from the Rest of the E.U. and Logistics.  The U.K. is still up 5%, even if we adjust for the budget timing differences.</p>
          <p>Despite declining market volumes, Spanish profits were higher.  The U.S.A. showed the benefit of pricing despite lower industry volumes.  And the Rest of the World continues to produce excellent results.  The Rest of the E.U. region suffered from volume declines in a number of markets.  And within Logistics, despite the economic impact, we were able to report organic profits down only 4% in the second half as a result of cost-saving initiatives.</p>
          <p>Now turning to cash flow and restructuring.  Our headline conversion rate was 128%, reflecting strong operational cash flows and as you've heard, working capital savings, and I'll go into these in more detail shortly.  We paid tax of &#xA3;363 million and our interest payments benefited from changes in timing following the recent bond issues.  And as a result, we paid &#xA3;505 million of net interest in the year.</p>
          <p>Net capital expenditure was &#xA3;184 million.  And there was a total profit and loss restructuring charge of &#xA3;145 million, including approximately &#xA3;100 million for the closure of the Berlin factory announced last year and 10 million for the closure of our Tampa cigar factory.</p>
          <p>Cash outflows in the year in respect of European integration activities were around &#x20AC;110 million, or approximately &#xA3;96 million.  This chart shows the movement in adjusted net debt, which decreased to &#xA3;10.8 billion in our financial year, an excellent result considering the negative foreign exchange impact of 1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>We delivered operating cash flow after net CapEx of &#xA3;3.7 billion, reflecting a significant working capital inflow of nearly &#xA3;1 billion relating to various Group-wide initiatives, including optimizing our finished goods stocks and tax stamp inventories, as well as reducing our trade receivables.</p>
          <p>The denomination of our closing adjusted net debt was 56% euro, 31% dollar and 13% sterling.  Our average net debt level for the year rose to &#xA3;12.8 billion.</p>
          <p>During the year, we successfully raised just under &#xA3;4 billion through the debt capital markets, which leaves us with no refinancing requirements until July 2012 and committed facilities in place at the year end of around &#xA3;15 billion.  Our average all-in cost of debt was stable at 5.5%, which resulted in net interest charge of &#xA3;700 million and interest cover on an adjusted basis of 4.2 times.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to end with some guidance for our financial year to September 2010.  Albeit very early days, we've made a promising start to the year and will be increasing investment in top-line growth whilst keeping a tight control on costs, enabling us to stay on track and deliver results in line with our expectations for the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of synergies, we'll deliver an incremental &#x20AC;110 million in 2010, giving a total of &#x20AC;300 million for the year.  We're seeking to manage the impact of increasing leaf costs, which are being driven by underlying pricing pressure and the currency translation impact of a commodity price primarily in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>We expect our all-in cost of debt in 2010 to be around 6%, 50 basis points ahead of this year, due to full year impact of last year's refinancing, slightly offset by decreases in average underlying interest rates.  Additionally, we anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of around 26%, consistent with 2009 and slightly lower than our historic rate.</p>
          <p>We expect depreciation, capital expenditure and amortization to be similar to this year in underlying currency.  And we're currently basing our forecast on the two main currencies which affect our results as shown on the slide.</p>
          <p>In terms of working capital, we'll consolidate our tremendous improvements and continue to emphasize cash conversion throughout our operations.  We anticipate a similar cash flow profile between the first and second halves of the year as we saw in 2009.</p>
          <p>And I'd now like to hand back to Gareth to conclude the presentation.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Bob.  So all in all, ladies and gentlemen, it's been another year of considerable progress and achievement for Imperial.  It's a challenging environment but we see many opportunities for us to build on our growth momentum.  Our enhanced focus on sales has enabled us to increase organic Tobacco net revenues by 5% and profits by 7% in our second half.</p>
          <p>Aligning our local portfolios to specific market and consumer dynamics is helping to develop sales of our international and regional cigarette brands and we'll be supporting this growth momentum with increased investment in priority markets and brands.  Fine-cut tobacco market volumes are rising and we'll be working hard to capture our share of that growth with further innovative developments.</p>
          <p>Active cost management across the business remains an inherent part of our day job, not only managing the impact of increased leaf costs but also consolidating our cigar and Logistics divisions, which have been particularly affected by economic conditions.</p>
          <p>We've made excellent progress on integration.  We remain focused on delivering the balance of synergies and see further opportunities beyond the Altadis integration for cost initiatives across the business.</p>
          <p>We've a strong track record on cash generation, a combination of driving high margins and working capital discipline.  This is an ongoing priority and has enabled us to make significant headway in reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Driving sales, optimizing costs and effectively utilizing the cash we generate are hallmarks of Imperial and continue to underpin our strategy.  These growth drivers and the strength and capabilities of our management team leave us very well placed to create sustainable value for our shareholders for many years to come.</p>
          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  We'll now take any questions you may have and as the presentation's being recorded, could I ask if you would wait for a microphone before speaking and then give your name and organization?  Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, all right, I'll go then.  Sorry.  5% organic revenue growth in the second half when you were still very focused obviously on synergies when the consumer's under pressure looks like fairly decent results.  Are you surprised at how well that came through?  Or were there one-off factors which push that up, which might not recur in future years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one of the points to make, Jonathan, on this one is that overall in most of our markets we took price increases during the course of the year.  And some were in the second half, which was obviously helpful, so that was one of the drivers.  Alison, if you want to expand on that as well with the organic developments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the key take-out for me on this is, if you look at the agenda of the organization for last year, the integration activity you highlight, the working capital focus as well and also driving the top line.  I think it really is a question of the fact that people at Imperial have delivered in the last year.  And I think it gives me tremendous encouragement around the capabilities we have in the business to continue to drive the growth going forward.  And I don't think there's anything specific really apart from you're well aware of the pricing we had in a number of markets that has really pushed that as a one-off impact.  I think it really just has been a good result from the people at Imperial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I look at your operating margin for the year in Tobacco, I think it was only up about 0.1 of a percentage point which might be a little bit surprising given the amount of synergies that you realized.  So I was just wondering to what extent you're taking the opportunity of the pricing and the savings that have come through to reinvest in the future?  Has there been much of that going on in terms of strengthening marketing et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, do you want to take that one on margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well margins were impacted by a number of things. Firstly, yes, there has been some investment in terms of that. Secondly, we're also looking at the mix of the &#x2013; if you were looking at a revenue number, the Rest of the World region, for example, was significant growth but it's a lower margin than our other markets and therefore in terms of that.  I think the pleasing point and what we said, the Group margin is merely an arithmetic average of the various regions and so it's more focus on improving margins in the regions, which actually have come through despite the investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're also, fair to say, well on track to rebuild margins back to where we were.  We had the sort of backward step on margins when we bought Reemtsma back in 2002 and built it very quickly, both in the core market of Germany, but then in wider Europe and then the Rest of the World.  And I think we're well on track to do the same thing post the Altadis acquisition, so pretty pleased the way that things are shaping out there. Okay, Jon?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask Bob a question on &#x2013; serious questions on the cash flow, please?  First of all, obviously there's a huge working capital inflow.  But that sometimes is affected by timing and I was wondering were there any particular issues at year end?  I guess I'm asking, if you drew up a balance sheet a month later or a month earlier would it have been so good?  And related to that, I noticed that both the tax paid and the interest paid were substantially less than the P&amp;L items.  So if I've got my maths right, you paid &#xA3;200 million less tax than the income statement said and your net interest was almost &#xA3;200 million lower.  And so I was just wondering if you could explain those items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those three simple items.  Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Adam said they were serious questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>You always ask serious questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I did &#x2013; I thought it was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Adam, they're fine.  Can I take them actually in reverse order, because some of the answers are very easy.  For example in terms of interest, one of the things we benefited from which is, okay, it's a one-time, but it will now &#x2013; we will hold the position, is in fact that we refinanced a substantial portion of our debt into the bond capital markets, about &#xA3;4 billion.</p>
          <p>In terms of the revolving credit facility that we were replacing, interest on that is payable in general, shall we say, quarterly, effectively on bonds you're paying annual interest.  So all of the issuance effectively we haven't in cash terms paid any interest on that in the year to September.  What will happen obviously is that will normalize next year and the interest charge will then come back in line &#x2013; sorry, interest paid will come back in line with interest charged.  So it's a &#x2013; if you like it's a one-time benefit of capital market take-out.  So that's interest.</p>
          <p>Tax, there are always timing differences in tax in that generally tax payments lag, in that you pay tax after the event and during the quarter of any year you also get &#x2013; tax tends to go over a period of time and over the course of the year you get payments to and from revenues as you close down historical tax.  So there's a always a bit of a lag on the tax paid.</p>
          <p>And the final one in terms of the working capital inflow, I think when I was here at the half year, basically we were looking at a 600 million working capital outflow.  I was rather helpfully asked when I mentioned that we would have an inflow for the year, what would it be.  And I replied if it was nothing, I'd be unhappy, if it was half a billion, I'd be happy.  So I think I'm very happy.  The reality of the situation is, there is nothing &#x2013; I mean these are a series of initiatives.  I'll run through some of the major ones.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we've dropped some lease durations and so in terms of that, that is a benefit that is sustainable.  We've looked at our processes and part of this is actually getting visibility of what's happening throughout the Group as we've rolled our systems out.  We actually see what is happening.  So we've rolled out processes out, basically the way that the sales and marketing and manufacturing operations work together on just changing little things about how they were doing things.  An example, manufacturing love running flat production, they'd love the tax stamps for the next month's production on the last day of the previous month.  Well if you bring them in on the first day of the next month in certain markets and sometimes it's &#x2013; you're looking at things on fortnightly basis, you get an extra month's credit.  It's those sorts of thing.  So it's management.  Again looking at once we rolled our systems out, debtor management through the entire Group meant that we were able to reduce or get more &#x2013; some of the &#x2013; there were some overdues that we managed to pull into line.  So it is all effectively sustainable as far as I'm concerned.  I would expect going forward that we would look at our normal cash conversion, I've always said, of sort of 90 to 100%. And I see no reason to change that.</p>
          <p>We always thought that there was probably more to go at in terms of the Altadis and the 0.5 billion. I'd say it's a great effort and people have actually just pulled out the stops.  We've had a focus on this and they've delivered well, far more than I thought they'd deliver in the time that they had available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we very much aim to consolidate all those improvements as well.  So thanks, Bob.  David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>David Hayes from Nomura.  Just to follow up on that, you mentioned the profile being similar for this year so I assume you mean outflow first half, inflow second half.  I guess to be a bit more absolute about it, and based on what you just answered, would you expect an overall inflow from working capital next year as those efforts continue to be consolidated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say I would expect &#x2013; I would be pleased if we hold the position and do 100% cash conversion.  I'd say &#x2013; as I say, going forward 90 to 100.  I might tell the guys to do a bit more, you never know, I'm such a kind person.  I wouldn't expect by the way at the half year, this year we saw about a &#xA3;600 million outflow.  Now of that, about &#xA3;450 million was due to effectively stock that we were holding, particularly in Poland and Czech.  Now regulations, I think, in both countries have changed whereas in 2009 pre-excise increase volumes had to sold out by June.  By next year they'll have to be sold out by February or March I think.  So I wouldn't expect, if you like, that 450 million element in the 2010 number.  But there will be a bit of a swing there, there always has been, one of the major impacts being in fact the Chancellor's budget in the U.K.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a second one, the dividend question if I can, and 45% payout ratio, you flagged that back in May.  I guess a lot of the factors that came through in the second half, particularly the cash conversion, might have tempted you to be a little bit more aggressive on that. Can you just talk about what the logic was around that 45% level?  And I guess what the trend might be going back to the 50?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The dividend policy is very much unchanged to progressive dividend to grow progressively in line with underlying earnings growth with a payout ratio of around 50%.  So that is completely unchanged as a policy.  Looking at the year just ended, the Board took a number of factors into account but of course what we posted is a 16% improvement in dividend.  And when one looks at our EPS growth, round about 30% of that EPS growth was from translational FX benefits.  So on balance we felt that a 16% dividend was appropriate.  It is certainly though our intention to move up to the 50% payout ratio over the next couple of years.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Roger from Credit Suisse.  In the second half, you delivered 2% organic volume decline and 5% organic sales growth, so a 7% price mix.  Just in light of the price increases announced last year and with unemployment rates still increasing, do you see these kind of levels sustainable in fiscal '10?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think fair to say in most of our markets last year there were price increases, all the big markets, in the U.K., in Germany, in Spain.  There were a couple of price increases in America, several price increases obviously on the back of the FET increase.  And in many others there were tax increases.  I think it's fair to say we see more tax increases I think probably coming through, given a lot of countries are obviously in an indebted status, which tax raising is probably necessary in those economies.  But I don't think we've seen anything that sees a change on the pricing horizon.  In fact we increased prices in France yesterday by 6%.  So I think it's probably more of the same as we would see it going forward, Roger.  I don't know if anyone would like to add to that, but I don't see anything on the horizon which is...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just tie into our long-term guidance really in that clearly minus 2% isn't what our guidance is in terms of volume.  We are looking for a little bit of volume growth.  But clearly there are things that happen in markets in certain years that do impact that and some significant impacts in the second half.  So 2% we were quite pleased with in terms of the decline in the second half.  NSV-wise we've targeted four to 5% in terms of what we're looking at.  So I think the guidance we've given is probably the overarching comment to put over that, in line with that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're showing there the net debt of 12 billion rather than the 10.8 you talked about in the slides.  And obviously the difference is interest accretion and derivatives.  I wonder if you could talk &#x2013; I mean, presumably the derivatives when that cash might out flow, if it ever does, is an open question.  But the interest accretion, perhaps you could talk about how much is interest accretion, when that actually flows out in cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Effectively it's &#x2013; that's the other side of the fixings that we've got in the P&amp;L.  And so that's in the all-in cost of debt if you like.  We have interest rate fixes at various levels.  Of course today in terms of mark-to-market, if we fixed at 5%, market rates are nothing, that's a 5% negative mark-to-market over the life of the swap.  But it actually comes through on &#x2013; and it actually just nets out year-by-year.  It will net out to nothing because it's taken up in the interest line and in the interest charge in the P&amp;L account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So following on from Adam's question, the interest paid in future years will be just running at or slightly above the interest charge in the P&amp;L, will it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I would say at the charge, because this year we got the benefit of basically the timing on the fact we issued bonds this year, the annual payment comes in next year. So next year we'll have an annual payment and an annual charge next year.</p>

          <p>Your closing remark there is the one I'd pick up, which is we're not saying, shift your numbers by a chunky amount of money because of the investment we're putting in.  But in terms of looking at the costs in the business and where we want to put the money in terms of next year, we are upping our focus behind a number of the brands and particularly behind the geographic investment focus we took you through in Morocco.  So clearly focus on those mature markets, balancing share and profitability, but we want to make sure we put the right investment there in FY10.  But also continuing investment in the U.S., Eastern Europe and Africa-Middle East, as we highlighted in Morocco, but stepping up a bit next year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John Leinster, UBS.  Just following on from that, I mean, traditionally you've often been seen as very strong in the low-price segment.  And yet a lot of the key markets, the U.K., Germany, Holland, Spain, your market share's probably trending downwards.  Is that &#x2013; and if you're investing principally, it sounds like the step obviously is going to be emerging markets and USA, is there no need to step up the A&amp;P perhaps in some of the more mature markets?  Or do you think that those trends will just start to reverse because there's particular factors there?</p>
          <p>And secondly, the renewal of the contracts on the Logistics side, will that have any appreciable impact on the Logistics businesses, particularly I suppose the PMI one, which is the big one in Spain?  I mean, have the terms changed significantly or not significantly?  And thirdly, can you just remind us, the Taiwanese factory that went off.  What were the saving figures in 2009 and '10 that you attached to that?  I think you've given us them in the past.  Thanks.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  That's what I was trying to allude to, John, when I was talking just then about investment.  I mean, we keep talking for the mature markets about balancing share and profit and there's a number of markets there that -- there is a little bit more investment going into next year in terms of the portfolios.  We don't mind the share being there or thereabouts in terms of down a little bit in some markets, but clearly that's not a trend we'd want to see continuing.  And therefore it is a question of making sure we get that balance right year-on-year.  So there is a bit more investment going into the mature markets as well as next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think fair to say as well, if you take somewhere like Germany where I think our share was down 0.1.  And certainly from the time the &#x2013; we were at quite a disadvantage because a couple of our competitors, when the market moved from 17s to 19s in July had <mark type="audio gap" /> the 17 stock piled away and some of them are still selling it out.  Now they have to be off the market by the end of December, the law says that, but they obviously had more stocks to enable them to sell.  So we were quite price disadvantaged throughout, particularly our last quarter, so that wasn't a bad performance.</p>
          <p>I think in the blonde shares in Spain and France we were pretty pleased with.  The U.K. share, again it's a question of balancing share and profit.  And as we pointed out, I think in most of our markets, or the majority of our markets let me say, our September spot shares are ahead of our MAT.  So I think we're pretty happy with the way things are developing on that.  I think the second question was on Logistics and the renewals.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

            <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  Broadly the same terms and all renewals when due to-date have been signed up.  We continue to run Logistics very much on an arms-length basis with an enduring spirit of neutrality there and I think that is the right way to carry on.  In terms of our Taiwan factory, I think when we said we were going to build it, we were talking about a benefit by the time the project matured of about 20 million. I think it was pounds a year, not dollars, pounds, yeah.  And I think certainly what we've seen in Taiwan is greatly encouraging.  We've seen a very strong recovery there financially but also in terms of market share.</p>
          <p>Our spot share in the last three months has been over 11% and I think we're up about 11.5 at the moment and still growing.  I think the factory has made quite a difference.  One of the main aspects we've seen so far is a shortening of our supply chain.  So we don't need this sort of a month on the water, a month in the docks and a month at this end.  So we really compressed that supply chain.  To be frank, Jonathan, I don't think I can give you a figure of what the contribution has been so far this year.  Certainly it is part of that 20 million has obviously been realized.  The factory officially opened in March '09 and is now pretty much fully in production.  And obviously we'll see that 20, I think, during the course of the coming year and probably a little bit into '11 as well before it's all totally mature.  Okay?  There's a question at the back here.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning.  Fulvio Cazzol from Goldman Sachs.  I was wondering if you can give us a bit more color on the moving parts for the pension deficit?  I know that you discussed actuarial assumptions but what &#x2013; how did the discount rate change?  And also, do you know or have any visibility as to what your cash contributions are going to be in 2010 on this?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's definitely one for Bob, our pensions expert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I shall be in receipt of one I'll take more than a passing interest in this answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine.  I've got one or two of my colleagues down below, so they'll correct me if I'm wrong.  I mean effectively, in terms of firstly the IAS 19 &#x2013; let's talk about the U.K. fund, which is one of the largest funds.  I think in terms of IAS 19, which is past service only, that fund was actually in surplus.  More importantly in terms of that fund, we do a tri-annual valuation on that fund in March 2010.  At the moment we're not paying contributions into that fund, so we may end up paying contributions.</p>
          <p>But in terms of where it is, size of fund, assets of around about 2.5 billion, continuing funding, I would say well it's difficult to be precise, because &#x2013; but I would say round about 80%.  So not a significant amount and so we may be talking about in cash terms the odd somewhere between, I don't know, 10 and &#xA3;30 million a year on the U.K. fund, which would not become payable &#x2013; the first payment will be made in 2011 in fact, so financial year 2010-2011.  So a year after the actuarial evaluation, we'll settle the valuation and obviously agree contributions.</p>
          <p>At the two other large funds which contribute to the deficit that you see in the accounts are actually the German fund and there's a Spanish fund, which are effectively both pay as you go.  And from memory I think the contribution is about 30 million a year on that.  But that's been that level, which is pensions in payment effectively, so that's already in today's cash flows, sees no significant change.  And in terms of the discount rate, I think it moved, again from memory, from seven to a little over five...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Nick.  7.3 to 5.5.  Effectively that's merely the market rates of the instruments that we were using to monitor them.  And in fact quite interestingly, I suppose at 7.3 we were at possibly the top end of the range last year and 5.5 I'd say we're slap bag in the middle of the range of other companies this year.  And so it's been the change in discount rate that's changed the liability number on the pensions.  Hopefully that explains it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Any more questions?  Chas, down here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Could you give us an update on performance in Russia and the Ukraine?  That's the first one.  And you've given us a lot of information by brand.  If you were to put all your brands together into the value segment, mid-price segment and premium segment, could you give us an overview of how those three key prices are performing in volume terms?  And I may have missed it, but in the Rest of the World division, your constant currency revenues are up 15% on volumes up one &#x2013; cigarette volumes up one.  Could you take us through that dynamic, which seems quite strong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Alison, you want to take the Russia and Ukraine question first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Russia, I mean, our share's really not shifted significantly over the last year, although I'd have to say in Russia measurement of market share has always got its complications, because quite a lot of our brands are well represented in some of the more rural areas and they're not particularly well covered by some of the data capture.  So our Russian portfolio, I think, yeah, we're reasonably pleased with the performance there.  But we're putting more investment in there currently to get better distribution of our brands in Russia so I see that improving over the next year.  And I think there are some portfolio opportunities there currently, particularly with some of the initiatives we've got on Davidoff and other brands, there's Gauloises and Maxim in the portfolio also performing well.</p>
          <p>So I think it's a question of just tailoring the portfolio there to suit both the up trading and the aspirational dynamics in that market, but also clearly some significant value opportunities there currently as well.  Ukraine I'm particularly pleased with, because we kind of have got it at both ends in Ukraine.  We've done well with our value portfolio this year, but also done well at the top end and we're seeing spot share picking up in September as well.  So I think the performance in Ukraine is good and we're going to continue hopefully that momentum into FY '10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The second question, Chas, was on segments.  I think, as we've said earlier on, we've seen a particularly strong year from Davidoff and that I think is about four strong years on the trot now where it's been growing probably as fast as &#x2013; almost as fast as some of the fast-growing value brands in the world.  And for a premium brand to do that is quite something.  I think it's a question of its geographic spread and it becoming embedded in markets and really gaining some market share traction.  So I think historically it was known in many countries as the 1% brand.  We've got a lot of countries now where it's butting up towards double-digit shares, and long may that be the case.  But we've a lot of investment and a lot of innovation planned for Davidoff and we expect that to continue growing.</p>
          <p>I think in mainstream we posted a slight gain in Gauloises.  It was a 1% gain, with some pretty strong growth in some specific markets.  And certainly it's been part of the net revenue synergies we talked about, to take Gauloises into more markets.  I think we've gone into now 10 markets that Altadis weren't in before we took them over and we plan to do more.</p>
          <p>In the value segment, obviously JPS, particularly in Europe, but also we launched it in Australia.  It's already got 1% and is driving our Australian share back upwards and I think that's particularly outstanding performance.  Value in total we would say is around 50% of our cigarette portfolio, I think, as a rough estimate if my memory serves me correct.  So does that give you enough granularity on that, Chas or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Broadly how much has that value segment grown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll have to get back to you on that one.  We'll take that one offline.  I'm sorry your third question, I wasn't quick enough to right it down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Rest of the World constant currency revenue growth of 15%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And volume growth of 1%.  I'm just taking a look.  What I believe it is, and I'll come back to it, but I believe it's the actual market mix because we've said even within the Rest of the World region, if you look at revenue by market there are significant differences.  I mean, we've already told you a number of times that for example our Africa and Middle-East areas are significantly more profitable than Eastern Europe.  And so I think it's merely that, because it is a significant difference in revenue per unit between those two.  And I believe it is &#x2013; I'm almost sure it is, it's a mix of market mix and the fact that we have taken pricing as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Adam Spielman again from Citigroup.  There's a story or there's an argument that goes around that consumers are down trading, you make by and large cheaper brands, therefore you should gain market share.  And you've said that German share is effectively flat so I don't want to argue about whether it's down or flat, but there doesn't seem to be much evidence of gaining market share so something is missing in that story.  I was wondering what is it?  Is it that other company &#x2013; actually the whole world is becoming more competitive in Tobacco?  Is it that other companies are investing more in new packaging et cetera and you can do the same and are doing the same and that's beginning to work?  Or is there something else that I've missed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say there are some structural dynamics in play in terms of segmentation amongst all the players, the four major players.  And certainly a number of them have been emphasizing investment into value-for-money products this year.  Certainly we saw some pretty aggressive levels of discounting post the FET increase for a number of months.  And it was aggressive with a capital A.  So I think there is more investment going into value-for-money segments, obviously to respond to the down trading dynamic, which is obviously a result of economic circumstances.</p>
          <p>I think also fair to say as well in roll-your-own, we're seeing a structural dynamic with more players coming into the market, companies which would have been traditionally just a cigarette franchise, as it were, a cigarette portfolio, actually launching derivatives of those cigarette names in the roll-your-own or make-your-own format.  And we've seen that pretty much across all regions where there is an OTP dynamic.  So I think it's fair to say it is very competitive out there at the moment, yeah.  Okay, Erik?  Sorry, I'll come to...</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Erik Bloomquist, JPMorgan.  You mentioned that the cigar business was improving in the last few months.  Would you just comment on how &#x2013; where that improvement's coming from?  And how you see that evolving into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think it was Alison pointed out in the presentation that certainly we've seen improvements in Asia.  In fact Asia wasn't bad throughout the year but certainly in the second half we started to see improvements in some of the Western European markets. Germany, France and the U.K. surprisingly also improved.  I think the only one that didn't really improve that much was Spain, which is an important market for Habanos particularly.  But even in the last couple of months we've started to see some European improvements now in our European brands and more improvements in the United States.  So again in the States they were subject to a pretty dramatic tax increase.</p>
          <p>So I think it's starting to come back and it's always difficult to predict.  It's almost as difficult to predict the cigar return graph as it is to predict a U, a V, a W, a love, or whatever the curve's going to be in terms of economic recovery.  But I think the situation, as we've seen about four month-on-month's improvements, I would hope that that's an embedded sign that things are getting better on the cigar <mark type="audio gap" />.</p>
          <p>We've taken a lot of action last year, a tremendous amount of cost restructuring in the business. We obviously closed Selma and Tampa.  We'll be very soon in a situation where Cantabria is our only cigar factory in Europe, having closed three.  And a lot of brand rationalization, SKU rationalization, so all those things really put cigar, I think, on a much stronger platform going forward.  It's a much more efficient base of manufacture and supply, with which to attack the markets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just one point to add on that as well that clearly at the premium end there was a significant amount of destocking in FY '09 in terms of particularly the Habanos brand.  And I think we've clearly got through that now and therefore we're seeing some pick up again but the destocking was quite a significant impact in FY '09.</p>

          <p>Hi.  Thanks Matt Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Just two quick questions.  First, just curious as to your views on potential changes in the minimum price regulations that exist in several E.U. markets.  If that's ultimately overturned, do you anticipate that governments may simply seek to achieve the same sort of levels of price gaps through minimum duty levels?  And secondly, in the U.S. where you've held share a bit above 4% for the past year or more, with the incremental investment that you're planning, can you comment at all on maybe specific growth objectives, whether flat volumes or specific level of market share improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Do you want to take the regulatory one or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, all I'd say on minimum price is that your &#x2013; what you suggested in your question is absolutely right.  My anticipation would be the governments would look to see what they could do from a duty-structure perspective.  I think that's what we'd be quite likely to see in a number of markets but we're still guessing at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And MIOD isn't a hell of a lot different in practical terms quite frankly.  In terms of the U.S., I mean it's been a very profitable year for us in the U.S. but it's also been extremely eventful with this SCHIP shaker, as it were quite frankly, in April.  I think we've adjusted quite well to it.  Obviously our aim is to grow our share but our primary aim and the first mechanism by which we grow share is to increase distribution. It is a vast country with a vast number of points of sale.  And we're still in the business of investing basically in shoe leather, taking on more reps, more sales management, in order to widen the distribution, particularly in the national accounts but also in the independents.  And one can see two to three years of work ahead in terms of that and that growth in distribution should be incremental.  So we see the States, funny enough it's almost an emerging market for us because we're at the level that we're at.  But it's very profitable.  Probably wish we'd gone there a bit before we did but we have great faith in it and that's why we will be continuing to invest quite heavily in the States.  John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Just &#x2013; actually the question was going to be actually quite similar on the States.  I mean, if you strip out the brands you've acquired, because obviously you launched a while ago and talk about your 50 million of profit organic growth, what would the share &#x2013; what would your share of Davidoff and indeed other brands, Imperial brands, be that you've launched into that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I think in terms of &#x2013; Alison, do you want to take it or I'll answer it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We refocused our approach with the federal excise tax increases. So yes, we have launched Davidoff into the market, but at the moment for that to be a prime focus for us considering where the market is reacting wouldn't be right at all and you've got to respond in terms of the portfolio when these sort of shocks happen.  So the push has been very much behind USA Gold and Sonoma, and also to some degree behind Fortuna, which is making some progress but on the radar of an American market share isn't worth quoting significantly.  But it's still a focus but USA Gold and Sonoma, with the shocks we've had in the market, the federal excise tax increases have got to be the prime focus for the portfolio currently.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just remind us from a regulatory point of view about the timing of any sort of E.U. minimum on the fine-cut tobacco, any minimum tax on that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>It's still being debated.  I think there's supposed to be some views at the back end of this year but we just can't &#x2013; there isn't a consensus at all.  And it's &#x2013; yeah, so the time scales just still keep stretching out on this currently.  So it's not clear.  What we have said before though in terms of the proposals on fine cut, I mean most markets meet those currently.  There isn't any other I think significant concerns for us around the proposals to shift the fine-cut percentage, where it's sitting in debate currently.</p>

          <p>With an open end to it.  Okay.  Can we &#x2013; one down here.  Nico?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for the chance.  It's Nico Lambrechts from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  If I may ask Alison a question, you referred to your medium-term guidance earlier.  Could you remind us what the medium-term guidance is in terms of price revenue? And then indicate where do you think 2010 might deviate from the medium-term expectations &#x2013; growth expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Medium-term guidance naught to 1% volume growth, four to 5% NSV growth, mid-to-high-single digit EPS growth is where we're sitting in terms of the overall guidance.  In terms of next year though, clearly you've got further synergies coming through.  And currently in terms of the market, our expectations, we're very happy with where the expectations are sitting in terms of how we're viewing next year currently.  So there's bound to be deviations on next year particularly because we've got the synergies coming through.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>May I, Gareth?  Thank you.  So your mid-term &#x2013; your EPS guidance does not include any synergy or cost savings going forward?  And would you care to comment, maybe to any deviation on the price and volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Currently I think where we're sitting from an expectation perspective, I don't think there's a significant deviation from that currently.  I mean clearly what you have got is the cost aspects, so with the synergies coming through.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  David, I think if we can start to move towards this --making this the last one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we can pick up on the last one and the point you made about value for money and the investment we're seeing from competitors and the kind of the shift from up trading in some markets that we're used to, to down trading at the moment.  When you look at what consumers are doing, when you speak to the consumers, is there a danger that the value-for-money proposition is becoming so good now, quality wise, that you don't see those people shift back into premium?  Is that what you're budgeting for?  Or do you think that the market, once the economy improves, you will see that up trading come back in those obvious markets?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question.  And there's no, I don't think, generalized answer you can give to it.  I think the main thing is to say is, the heart of your question is the fact is consumers are still consuming.  We've not really seen &#x2013; a couple of exceptions, but we've not really seen any great evidence or trends to say that we're seeing falling consumption. We are seeing dynamism, movements more into roll-your-own for the ultimate down traders.  We are seeing people smoke the value-for-money brands growing.  We're also seeing more duallists that smoke one brand during the week and another brand at the weekend.</p>
          <p>They might even smoke roll-your-own in the week and tailor-made cigarettes at the weekend.  So we're seeing all sorts of developments.  I think the only I suppose unsavory developments or unwelcome development is we are also seeing growth in a number of markets in the illicit trade.  And I think Ireland probably would be the example of the ultimate basket case where a government really does get it wrong and boy, have they got it wrong.  And the market is being penetrated at a very high level of illicit trade now and that is something that I think as an industry and as governments we've got to work together to try and stop.</p>
