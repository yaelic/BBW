          <p>Good morning, everyone. My name is Ben Spincer. I'd like to welcome you to Telstra's Half Year Results for Fiscal 2011. We've got the people here in the room in Sydney. I welcome those people on the phone lines and also watching us via the Web. I'll hand over immediately to the CEO, David Thodey, who'll introduce the results to you. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ben. Good morning everybody and welcome to our half year results, and especially welcome to those people on the webcast and I do need to give a quick plug for all those on Channel 409 on the IPTV T-Box which we're actually streaming live today.</p>
          <p>Now we're going to follow a similar format to what we did last time. I think it worked quite well. I'm just going to give a few introductory words and there are a few things I want to cover off on our NBN and the floods. Then I'm going to ask John to take us through the detailed financials and I'll come back and talk about how we're going against our strategy because that's critically important for us.</p>
          <p>But before I get in to talk about the floods and the NBN I do just want to stress the three key messages that really we have from today. And the first one is we're seeing very strong sales results in the first half. We now have almost 1 million additional Australians choosing Telstra in the last six months. And we went back over the records and we cannot &#x2013; we went back 10 years, we had never had stronger six month period. So we're feeling good about that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, our strategy is on track and we are now tracking that very clearly and we are delivering results and I want to take through that because that's very important for us. And very importantly and importantly for me, we have delivered on the half and we're confirming guidance for the full year, and let me stress that is very important to me.</p>
          <p>So let me now just touch on a couple of things. So they are the three key messages for me about the day and I'll come back and talk about it. But I do want to talk a little bit about the floods and I want to talk about NBN because they are two big issues for us.</p>
          <p>Now, look, I know many of you've read a lot about the floods, but for those who don't know, we obviously track weather conditions pretty carefully and we can't really remember a period we've had such an extensive period of increment weather and/or both the intensity, but the also the scale. Now remember, we had a very wet period before Christmas Eve in the Victoria, so even though we've had a lot of issues in Queensland and then we went out into Western New South Wales down to Victoria, now up in North Queensland. It has put extreme pressure on our staff and on our customers and also on the network. But I do want to take a moment. I don't often get an opportunity to just recognize the incredible people inside Telstra and how proud I am of their efforts.</p>
          <p>You see, we really are often the people who go in, these are our field staff, as emergency services that people go in, and one of the first things people want is connectivity. So, we really play a critical role and our people have just done a tremendous amount of work, and of course the work goes on in terms of, once you get in, you try and restore services, but then it goes on for a number of months as you work through that. And our people really have gone to extraordinary lengths and often it's at their own personal cost, both their homes their families, just to make sure our customers are kept going.</p>
          <p>And there have been some tremendous personal stories and I do want to personalize a little bit today, because sometimes in big companies you sort of lose the personal aspect of that because you've got to get power up, you had people who have been incredibly innovative in terms of getting in to restore services and we've had police escorts, we had defense force, Black Hawk helicopters getting generators into area, it really is an incredible story. So we've been just very grateful for what our people have done, and I mean that really sincerely.</p>
          <p>One specific story, I'm going to tell you. I know this is a financial briefing, but I think it's important to get the personal story. A guy called Clint Dixon who is one of our field technicians here in Sydney, he had an 18-hour day. First of all, we got these sales on wheels and we had to move from Sydney up to Cairns, so he personally took it up to Cairns. Then he got to Cairns, he flew out to Palm Island on a light aircraft, then he worked all night getting the mobile base station up and running and he did it by with a flash light, because there's no power. And then he spent the rest of the night in the hut sleeping out there and that's just a sort of story you get, and I could tell many, many stories like that and that really is Telstra. That really is the essence of this company and as you look at investing in Telstra that's the sort of I think passion and commitment that really makes this company different.</p>
          <p>At the moment we've got about 700 people working up in North Queensland and they don't do it as part of their job description, they do it because they're passionate about this company. And remember as that cyclone went through, which is only, what, nearly a week ago, we had all of the services, at least the majority of services up and going within five days. That's an incredible feat. Now there is still a lot of work to do, because a lot of folks out there, but we are just doing a tremendous job. So, obviously, for you what's the cost to this in terms of Telstra? Well, it's just very, very hard to put a financial cost on it just at the moment. You see, we've got to go through, we've already spent money getting technicians up there, but most of it is going to OpEx.</p>
          <p>So the network itself has stood up incredibly well, and Mich Rocca, who is here today, has been out looking at how things have gone. So it's going to be mostly OpEx in terms of the cost, but what really is our most important priority is getting customer services up and running and we will, as soon as we know, we'll let you know what the financial impact is. But we need to just get a bit more certainty on that. So that's the disaster, as you can see from some of the pictures up here, we had some help from Black Snake and various people, but it has been an incredible period, but our people have done clearly well. So that was the first thing.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the NBN negotiation update, because I'm sure you're very interested in how we're going on that. Well, look, we are making good progress and we're working towards the finalization of these negotiations. We are pleased today to announce, I think, a very, very important milestone, which is the finalization of the key commercial terms with NBN, Co. Now the reason why this is so important is that this sets a framework, so we can document the definitive agreement. Now that has taken a lot of hard work to get there and of course this is all about delivering that approximate $9 billion in post tax net present value to Telstra and our shareholders. And, of course, the other key part of that is working with the government and we're pleased to announce today also we have reached in-principle agreement with the federal government over the specific measures that we expect will deliver that further approximately $2 billion of post tax NPV.</p>
          <p>Now that adds to obviously the $11 billion and we're being very focused on preserving that value for our shareholders, because this is an enormous, an enormous amount of negotiation and there is a lot of moving parts that could move during the discussions. So, very, very important and so it is an important milestone. We're going to keep you informed as we go forward, and one of the things that you often ask us is, can you give us more detail about what's actually in the contracts? Now there is a certain amount of confidentiality, but I wanted to show you that as soon as we've just got those agreements tied down, we will be sharing that information and so that you can start to look at the substance of those proposals. Okay? So very important milestone.</p>
          <p>So, it's still a lot of work to be done and we have set ourselves a target of July the 1st to put the proposal to the shareholders. Now, this is a very ambitious target. However, we thought it was important to put that out there and I want to be very clear that that still depends on a number of factors. Remember, there's three legs to the stove. There is work with the government, with NBN Co and now we've got to work with the ACCC around interim separation and there is still legislation to go through the House. But, while some of those are out of our control, we are going to do everything we can because we think it's now time to be clear about our timeframe and then we can move on. So, we believe this target is achievable, but very aggressive and &#x2013; but that's what we are going to be working through. So, I'm sure you have some questions about that later on and John and I'll be happy to take those.</p>
          <p>But let me now throw to John, he is going to take us through financials and then I'll come back and give you an update on strategy. Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks David, and good morning everybody here and wherever you may be this morning. I don't want to either complicate things this morning, so put simply we're executing on our strategy as we outlined to you last year. And we are delivering the results that we expected. Most importantly, we are confirming guidance today.</p>
          <p>As we discussed back in August, this is a transitional year where we invest to prepare the company for the future. Therefore, as expected, our results have been impacted by the spending necessary to implement on this new strategy. And as you know, this year we are investing to retain and grow our customer base, to improve customer service and satisfaction, to simplify our business and core processes and to make investments in new products in order to grow our revenue streams. And as you will see, we have seen great momentum in the growth of our customer base in the half. And this augurs well for revenue growth in the future.</p>
          <p>So, firstly, let me take you through the key numbers for the half on a reported basis. Sales revenue declined marginally by 0.5% to $12.3 billion. There were some one-off factors that impacted the sales revenue line this half, which I will discuss in a moment. The impact of the significant increase in the customer base is also not yet fully evident in the revenue line, but that is really just a matter of timing. At the OpEx line, this half, we have undertaken the strategic investments detailed to you last year. Therefore, operating expenses grew by 10.7% or $757 million to $7.8 billion. As a result of our strategic OpEx investments, EBITDA fell by 13.9% or $737 million to $4.6 billion.</p>
          <p>On a guidance basis, which excludes the Octave impairment that we did announce late last year and the net accounting guidance on the sales of businesses, including SouFun, the decline in EBITDA is 12.5%. This is in line with our comments at Investor Day that we expected the EBITDA decline this half to be low-double digits. And remember, the bulk of the expense growth has been to support the growth in customer numbers.</p>
          <p>EBIT declined by 24.1% or $756 million to $2.4 billion and net profit after sales declined by 35.6% to $1.2 billion, in line with expectations and as the arithmetic sort of flows through the P&amp;L. Higher net finance costs after recent rate rises were more than offset by lower income tax expense. Free cash flow was down 22.9% to $2.02 billion, but is on track for our full year guidance. We had maintained our fully franked interim dividend at $0.14 per share.</p>
          <p>I also just wanted to briefly mention the underlying performance of the business after removing some one-off factors and other adjustments. These factors, which, when you look through the slide pack detailed in an appendix, includes the removal of the Octave impairment adjustments to exclude accounting guidance and losses on the sale of businesses, including SouFun, and the movement of the recognition of the Sydney Yellow Pages Book for the second half and a few FX fluctuations and so on, which don't amount to large numbers. But after you do that and so trying to get back to underlying business, sales revenue actually grew 0.7%, and the EBITDA fell 11.1% and the attributable profit after-tax declined 24.9%.</p>
          <p>So let's have a look at this continuing strong growth in the customer base, which is at the heart of our strategy, and a part of the strategy is to do this without sacrificing ARPU, or average revenue per user, so that we can grow revenue and profit over the medium term. The results were very positive this half and as you can see from the chart, first quarter trends were maintained or improved in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>During the half, we added 420,000 bundled customers and this is very encouraging given some customers not only spend more by taking new products, but these bundled customers have a much lower propensity to switch or churn. We have also added 919,000 mobile customers during the half. This included nearly 300,000 postpaid mobile handheld customers and more than 0.5 million mobile broadband customers. Customers clearly value services on how fast and reliable is Next G network.</p>
          <p>That is the largest, as you heard David say, growth in over a decade. And we added 139,000 retail fixed broadband services during this half. And this reversed the trend of recent halves where we were in decline. So our strategy is working. And we are taking profitable market share back. And we have achieved a significant increase in customers while maintaining ARPU in mobile handheld postpaid and retail fixed broadband. The chart highlights how well ARPUs have generally held up. We continue to manage ARPUs in light of our improving churn data, focus on our customer service, growing customer numbers and our go-to-market strategies for each of our segments.</p>
          <p>There is considerable detail on the chart on the ARPU drivers by product. While there is probably no time today for me to go through all of them, I would like to highlight that bundles are revenue accretive due to new customer acquisition, improved retention rates and additional product take-up from our existing customers. And in the second half we would expect modest declines in ARPU as customers will move and are moving to competitive price offerings, but this is within our expectations for the year.</p>
          <p>From a product perspective, I wanted to give you an overview of the puts and takes in the topline performance. We continue to be buffeted by the strong PSTN headwind with a $253 million decline as usage levels continued to fall across all categories. However, the decline in PSTN revenue was more than offset by the continued strong growth in mobiles. Mobile services revenue grew 6.5% or $210 million to $3.4 billion and mobile hardware revenue grew 37% to $566 million.</p>
          <p>Revenue for advertising and directories fell 18.7% or $182 million to $793 million. Now, remember there is the change in recognition of the Sydney Yellow Pages print revenue to the second half which has an impact on that, which is about $83 million. If the Sydney Yellow Book revenue is added into the first half, then Yellow revenue declined by a further 8.7% and Sensis sales revenue overall would have declined by 7.9%. Later, David will discuss the actions we've already taken to transform Sensis into a digital business.</p>
          <p>IP and data access were relatively flat as we see continued strength in the IP access product from customers migrating to these services, but it's all being offset by a decline in all our legacy data products such as digital data service and ATM and Frame Relay and so on. IP access revenue alone had another strong half growing at 20.1%. All three major retail segments, and this is very pleasing, returned to revenue growth in the first half of the year after challenges faced last year.</p>
          <p>Telstra Consumer and Country Wide sales revenue grew 1.9% as the segment focused on retaining and growing the customer base. Mobile revenue grew in this segment by 12% with the growth driven by mobile data revenue and higher handset sales. In the consumer prepaid handheld segment, revenue growth of 9% was achieved and in the second half double-digit revenue growth is expected.</p>
          <p>In terms of the bottom line, EBIT contribution declined by 14%, because of the investment we're making to grow the customer base. However, we expect an improvement in EBIT contribution in the second half as higher mobile and fixed broadband customer levels translate into revenue.</p>
          <p>Telstra Business, our business segment, the sales revenue increased by 2.2% with revenue growth across all of the products with the exception of PSTN. Mobile services revenue was up 10%, which included mobile broadband growth of more than 20%, and on the fixed side PSTN revenue fell 8% while fixed Internet or fixed broadband revenue rose nearly 4%. And finally, the Telstra and Enterprise &#x2013; Enterprise and Government segment increased sales revenue by 1.3%. The growth was driven by IP access revenue growth of 19% and mobile services revenue growth of 11%. And expenses declined slightly and we have a very strong sales pipeline for the second half with an increased focus on network applications and services.</p>
          <p>So now let me turn to costs. And as expected, OpEx increased by 10.7% or $757 million to $7.8 billion. Excluding the Octave impairment of $133 million and a few other smaller adjustments set out in the slide in the appendix, the increase was $694 million or 9.8% growth. And as you can see, much of the OpEx increase was due to sharp increases in both cost of goods sold and subsidies, as we invested to retain and grow our customer base. As a result, goods and services purchased as a proportion of sales revenue increased from 21.6% in fiscal 2010 to 25.7% for the half. We expect this rate to fall as revenue from customers retained and acquired increases and the level of cost of goods sold and subsidies stabilizes.</p>
          <p>Next, I wanted to update you, because there was much discussion about this as we talked about our full year back in August, just to update you on the incremental OpEx investments we are making or have made already in this financial year. The categories that specifically relate to the investment in the customer base rather than the business as usual are on this slide. So I want to remind you that as we told you last year, some of the expense categories are front-end loaded to the first half as we hit the ground running on our strategic initiatives.</p>
          <p>During the first half, we spent around an additional $500 million on directly variable costs, which includes subsidies, cost of goods sold and net repayments to maintain and grow market share. We have spent a little more this half than originally planned as we made conscious decisions to respond to the demand that rose in the market and you saw the services and operations chart earlier that shows how that demand and how strong that demand has been. So as a result, we've acquired more customers than we expected in the half and we achieved strong growth in the customer base.</p>
          <p>In the second half, we anticipate that we will continue to invest in subsidies and cost of goods sold to acquire customers and keep the momentum going in our business. However, we are going to find savings in other areas such as labor and so on to support that investment in the growing customer base. So it's important to remember that some of this incremental directly variable cost is offset by the higher mobile hardware revenues that you get as we acquire the customers and also we will reduce other OpEx spending, as I said. The point being that we will be continuing to support our customer growth and spending on directly variable costs, but importantly this is about our success in the market and we do intend to still deliver on our financial guidance.</p>
          <p>This half we also incurred around $100 million on initiatives related to new product growth, such as the T-Box and T-Hub and network applications and services. In relation to our Project New, which is to simplify the business during the first half, we incurred around $180 million of costs and realized about $90 million of incremental benefits from these early investments. But we remain on track to spend about $290 million, but achieved about $250 million of benefits this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>You will recall, we talked about this project in terms of the main benefits coming from next year, but the increase in &#x2013; there will be an increase in occurrence of benefits in this second half. So there are clearly timing issues here and we weighted redundancy, for example, to half one, so that more benefits are realized in half two, and of course, and I said, in the next fiscal year. Overall, I am confident that we're on track with our plan and the strategy we'll deliver on our guidance.</p>
          <p>Now let me talk about some of the key expenses, so the categories &#x2013; I know I've talked about the directly variable cost, but let me talk about labor for a minute. Labor costs marginally increased by 1%. We had a 3.5% fall in salary and associated costs, which was offset by 56% or $58 million increase in redundancy costs as we implemented the simplification of our business. As indicated on the previous slide, the directly variable costs increased by 20% or $533 million, primarily due to the subsidies and the cost of goods sold that I explained and part of the cost increase was offset by $153 million increase in the mobile hardware, which is the revenue received through the first half of the year. And we'll see the benefits in customer usage revenues going forward. Most of the half on half increase in handset cost of goods sold and subsidies was due to a rate increase as the penetration of smartphones continues to climb.</p>
          <p>In the other expense category, service contracts and other agreements costs increased by 6.7% with us engaging more contract people in the call centers and in sales support as we focus on customer service. Costs associated with the commencement of Project New also did contribute to the increase on a year-on-year basis. We continued to tightly manage our discretionary costs and as a result general and administrative expenses declined for the fourth consecutive half and they remained below first half of '07 levels. This half general and admin costs were reduced by 4.5% with further reductions across a range of categories including travel and IT leases and so on.</p>
          <p>As we invest through time and grow our customer base, EBITDA margins in mobiles and fixed broadband have declined this half. The dilution resulted from several factors including the higher upfront acquisition costs, including subsidies and cost of goods sold and higher sales and marketing expenses. During the second half of the year we expect mobile margins and for that matter the total Telstra Group margins to improve. Despite the reduction in PSTN revenue and ARPU, PSTN EBITDA margins remained relatively stable due to cost control and reduced usage. IP access EBITDA margins were also stable.</p>
          <p>Now let me just turn to free cash flow and CapEx, capital expenditure. Free cash flow was just over $2 billion this half, including the $320 million cash proceeds from asset sales. I'm aware that the market consensus expects a smooth half-on-half free cash profile. However, that has never been the case at Telstra due to the timing of our CapEx cycle and for that matter our STI or incentive payments. For example, only 42% of our full year free cash flow occurred in the first half last financial year. This year I would expect the same pattern of free cash flow and so therefore it will be weighted towards the second half of the fiscal year for similar reasons.</p>
          <p>While on cash flow, it's appropriate to point out that our working capital increased as we funded the retention and growth of the customer base. This included a $137 million increase in customer deferred debt due to the increased popularity of our mobile repayment option, where a customer gets to pay off their mobile over the period of the contract. And these are prevalent options on smartphone offers, T-Box offers and T-Hub products.</p>
          <p>Accrued operating CapEx fell 9.4% to $1.45 billion, or at a level of 11.8% of sales revenue, 11.8% of sales revenue in the half, as CapEx fell, as we had completed the major IT transformation projects. Our 14% CapEx to sale guidance is confirmed today, as part of the overall confirmation of the guidance, and cash CapEx in the half was $1.831 million, as accrued CapEx unwinds in the half one as usual and that causes the first half second half variation in profile.</p>
          <p>As I said at the start, I confirm the full year guidance, since the business is performing in line with our expectations. There are a number of other factors that mean that the second half will be better than the first half. These include both underlying improvements to the business and the impact of one-off factors.</p>
          <p>In terms of the underlying improvements, we expect growth in the customer base achieved in the first half will translate into a better top and bottom-line performance in the second half and we expect to realize more benefits from Project New in the second half, as I mentioned. And the results on a guidance basis will also be positively impacted by some other items and that is of course a recognition of the Sydney Yellow Pages Book revenues in this second half, a sequential fall-off in the amount of redundancy expense, some of it is front-end loading into half one, and the fiscal 2011 results will be impacted by cycling the year-on-year impact of the CSL New World goodwill impairment charge that happened in the last fiscal year, second half of the last fiscal year.</p>
          <p>So due to these factors we still expect flattish sales revenue, a high single-digit percentage decline in EBITDA, CapEx to sales of around 14% and $4.5 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow. And I want you to note, the assumptions that the guidance is based upon that are set out on the slide and that is we're assuming price stability, no further impairments and so on. Our guidance is really based on combining normal business performance.</p>
          <p>Finally, we believe that the $0.28 fully franked dividend can be paid across the next two years with the current balance in the franking account combined with the franking credits that will arise on tax installments expected to be high.</p>
          <p>So I'll now hand back to David to elaborate on our strategy.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. What I'm going to do now is I'm going to come back and look at our strategy that we laid out really at the AGM last year and at the Strategy Day. But let me just stress again the three key messages. So, very strong sales results, which we think augur very well for the future. Now as John went through, there has been investments to get that customer growth, but that was what we plan to do and that's what we executed on and so it's inline. It was a little bit more than we had expected, because we had such a strong response from the market. It was both the investment, but also our products and plans were more competitive in the market too.</p>
          <p>And I'll talk a little bit about customer service, because one of the great things here is churn levels are very low and that's probably some of the lowest churn levels we've seen, which means that customers are staying. So strong first half results, we're delivering on our strategy, and also we're confirming our guidance.</p>
          <p>Now, as you know, there's a lot of changes going on in this industry, fixed to mobile migration, we've got the incredible growth in data as customers want to use our services more and more. And of course there is growing competition, which is just a way of life for us now. So last year, we outlined these four main initiatives and at the cornerstone of that was around customer service, because that &#x2013; without having good customer service you could spend a lot of money and not retain customers, and while we made good progress, I'll take you through some of that, there's still a long way to go.</p>
          <p>Secondly, retaining and growing our customer base and the signs are good, the signs are good. More work to be done, but we are feeling comfortable with where we are at the moment. Thirdly, about the significant work that Robert Nason and the team have been doing right across the business to simplify the business so that we can really start to get better end-to-end processes, really addressing some of the fundamentals in the business to reduce our cost base, and then, of course, at the same time looking for new ways to create shareholder value.</p>
          <p>So let me just take through just a brief update, so I don't want to belabor it, there's a brief update on where we're at with each of those ones. So let's look at customer service, and as you would have seen, we've implemented a large number of improvement initiatives, so, I think, are making progress and we're seeing good response from the market around them. But, there's still lots of things we still need to do. They are proving popular, many of the things we've implemented, like the weekend appointments, we're now getting &#x2013; had over 30,000 weekend appointments. So that's been a big change for us in terms of allowing people to say, when they want a technician to come to do a service. And that's being a really good initiative. Maybe we went to 24-hour-seven day-a-week call centers, which was a big change in our strategy, already taken over 2 million calls. So that's again being available when customers want to deal with us is being very important.</p>
          <p>Now what has been the result of this? Well, this is all around reducing costumer churn. And you see, churn and ARPU really are about equal importance, so if you can get your churn levels down and hold ARPU you're going to drive a good business. And look at the churn results. The annualized deactivation rates have fallen from 25% to 16.4% for broadband, fixed broadband. And in mobile it has moved from 15.8% to 9.7%. Now these are annualized numbers. These are very good results and probably the best we've had for about five years. So that's a very good indicator of how the business is going.</p>
          <p>Now the other important thing, because while we can say we do many good things, it's really what your customers are saying about you. Remember we run this customer satisfaction survey and we measure this Net Satisfaction Index. And we've seen a good improvement of 1.3% in the first half that's continuing to generate. We set ourselves a target of 6% improvement for the year, still work to be done, but it is trending the right way. So, all in all, pretty good results. Now, this is a very important incentive for all of the management at Telstra. Remember, 40% of at-risk compensation is dependent on us meeting our customer satisfaction target, so this has got a lot of focus within the business and I think it's the right thing because it makes this company's focus on external factors like customers.</p>
          <p>So we are very serious about this and we are making good gains and we've taken decisions that we think will result in a long-term improvement in the underlying factors of this business. So that's customer service.</p>
          <p>Second one was around winning new customers, and I think John has taken you through that. Good strong sales momentum, and of course this is dying to bear fruit. But of course winning customers needs to translate into revenue and profit and so we are very conscious about the quality of the customers we are getting and how that will flow through.</p>
          <p>Now the chart you will see behind us is this relationship between mobile services growth and about winning customers. And you usually see about a 12 to 18 month lag from hardware revenue growth flowing through into services revenue growth and that's been the case historically and we believe that that will be the case going forward. And as I said, the quality of our customers is very important. The new customers you are bringing on. Let me just remind you of some statistics that John took you through. We now have 800,000 customers on a bundled plan. Now, remember that's a two-year contract and they are taking more services, it's a critical part of our strategy. More than one quarter of our handheld base are now on smartphones and you know with smartphones they have higher ARPU, spending more over those.</p>
          <p>And, of course, in the fixed broadband customer set, there has been a significant shift from low to high data plans, which has been very much driven by competition in the market and from low to high speed plans. Now 74% of our ADSL customers are on high speed plans and that's up from 13% just a year ago. That's been an incredible shift and of course 32% of ADSL customers have moved on to the higher data plans and that was just from 1% a year ago.</p>
          <p>So, big changes and we're very pleased with our success in the fixed broadband market and important, we're attracting the right types of customers, because spending a lot of money to attract customers that may have low ARPU isn't necessarily a really good strategy. So that's about winning in the market.</p>
          <p>Gordon Ballantyne, the last time we were together, shared a little bit about the key battlegrounds in the consumer market and remember we talked about prepaid mobile, postpaid mobile and also fixed broadband. Now we see these as key areas that we've got to be more competitive in.</p>
          <p>So let me just give you a quick update on how we're going there. Our prepaid handheld services revenue in the consumer market was up 9%. Our Cap Plans that we introduced last July have proven very popular and have driven an increase in ARPU in this category, which is very encouraging. Postpaid mobile, we've generated tremendous momentum there, 221,000 consumer customers, additional consumer mobile customers, and many of them using smartphones as I said. And then a very important factor as you know is this PSTN and fixed broadband mix.</p>
          <p>We look at this category a lot because that's obviously in the PSTN results, 8.4% decline, but for the first time for a long time, we've had a positive movement in terms of the net customer improvement and you can see there from the graph that's been a big turnaround from where we were just a year ago. And, again, lot of them on bundled plans which means that it's a two-year contract. So, good progress and we're seeing fixed and mobile is complementary, not substitutional and that also is a good sign for the future.</p>
          <p>Now the third part of the strategy was how we can simplify this business. And as I said, Robert Nason has been working on this right across the business but it's every part of the business. So, this is about simplifying the business so we can really take cost down in a sustainable way but also improving customer service, because any large telecommunication company has a lot of complexity and it can get the simplicity, you have a better customer service, you have happier employees and in the end then you deliver better results for your customers.</p>
          <p>We've had 27 projects running across the business, that's a large number of projects and we're now into execution phase. So, this is really moving into good old business as usual. Let me just talk a bit about some of them because I want to give you a bit of a flavor. We talked about a leaner operating model. I mean 300 executives have left the business, so what does that mean? Well, it's all about speed of decision making. It's about reducing layers of management so we can be quicker in responding to the market. Also, it's about getting more efficient organizational structures and that's what we've been doing. So, that's been a big change. But it can't just stop there, you've got to simplify your process, you got to change the way you serve your customers and change the channels that you use.</p>
          <p>Well, just an example, if a customer now wants to get global roaming, they don't have to ring the front of house. They can go online, use a simple Web form and get that activated. Now that sounds simple but when you're taking literally millions of calls each year, this has a big impact on the business. So, our target of getting 35% of all of the transactions, that's service transactions, sales transactions online is a critical part of the strategy and you'll be hearing some more about that in the following weeks. So, we continue to review all our call center channels.</p>
          <p>We're looking at training and a big change that I hope you picked up was when we bought Country Wide and Consumer together. We have a very strong geographical coverage model; we now have 33 area general managers right across the country responsible for serving the customers in that area and that has worked very, very well and we've both got efficiencies, but we've got actually a better outcome; our people are really focused on local customers. So, this has been a tremendous initiative, we worked through all that hold the people in place and we're making good progress.</p>
          <p>And then of course simplifying pricing, because simplifying pricing makes it easier for customers to make a decision, makes it easier for us to provision, easy to build. Now, it is certainly &#x2013; an example is in the broadband area from 12 to four plans, that's been a big movement; and so we're simplifying it. It means we've got to be very specific about what our customers want; but that's been a big change and that's why going I'm through all our product set.</p>
          <p>And of course, cultural change is very important and we've started that about, one, Telstra and a business that is really focused on the customer and that's a holistic change. So, we're working through a program, every manager in the company to roll out to every employee and that takes time, but it's really getting embedded in who we are as a company. And so, I'm very pleased about the progress there. But of course a long way to go to really deliver the sorts of results that we need.</p>
          <p>And of course, delivering greater shareholder value, it's critically important to have good contracts with our partners and we continue to do that. That's both about the value we're getting, but it's the nature of the partnership you have, because we do outsource a lot of work to various partners and Rob and the team have been working through that, and I think we're making very good progress. So, remember, last year, I said how you're going to know, what are these lead indicators that are going to give you some sense about how we're traveling? Well, I put the chart back up about how we're going and, of course, it's not an exhaustive list, because we have a larger number of key indicators, lead indicators. But it is representative of the sorts of things we are doing now. As you see, five out of the eight indicators traveling well, they're green. But, we've still got some work to do in a few of them.</p>
          <p>Now, what I want to point out is around TIO complaints. We have seen an increase in TIO complaints just over the last month. Some was driven by the floods, but that's an area that we are really focused on and of course really more importantly I like hearing about issues it's about how quickly you respond to them. And that's what we're doing. We're getting far more responsive and saying, hey, let's solve problems and let's get it done so that you can get on and live your life. More needs to be done but I think that's a good progress.</p>
          <p>So, now let me just turn to the last area about now what are the three areas we're really focused on in terms of driving shareholder value and I'll just give you a bit of an update across the three. The first area, of course, is around what John mentioned which is a network-based applications and services. It's called NAS for short but I'll call it network-based application services. Now remember, this is all about as customers migrate to IP networks, there's a lot more work that needs to be done to manage them, to integrate them and put applications over the top of them. So, the lead indicator in terms of the opportunity is about IP access growth. As John mentioned, we have seen very strong growth in IP access over the last six months, in fact, over the last three years. So, this augurs well for the opportunity in network application services.</p>
          <p>But also there's some key categories that you look at. One of the key categories is unified communication. This is the ability to really provide Voice over IP or voice services, messaging services over the core telephony, IP telephony service and that's been a very strong growth. And we're seeing tremendous demand. In fact, over the last half the actual sales volumes have been very encouraging. So, as you look at the revenue, it's actually slightly down but that's because we exited some products that weren't profitable and a couple of contracts with customers as well. Very strong results there and I still think this has tremendous opportunity as we go forward and over the next three years we do think we can double the size of this business. So that was NAS.</p>
          <p>What about our Asian assets and driving shareholder value? Well, as you know, Tarek Robbiati has been running that business. I'm very pleased with the focus we have on the Asian assets because we now have one division looking at our Asian assets and can be across everything that's happening both in Hong Kong, China, right across Asia and we've made some really good progress. I want to take you through just what we're doing there. So, it is all about driving shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Firstly, CSL, we've had very strong momentum in CSL in Hong Kong. Remember, it does remain the most profitable operator in Hong Kong and I've the pleasure of being up in Hong Kong as we launch one of first LTE networks in Asia and that has gone incredibly well and has actually been the catalyst for some tremendous growth. We saw in local currency revenue growth of 24.3%. Now, a lot of that was in the smartphone growth, so we had 110% growth in the handset revenue but good solid 7% growth around our mobile services revenue. Also profitability is going well. So, we're expecting a very strong year from CSL and we expect EBITDA to continue to grow. That was the first one. And then just a few weeks ago we announced the change in the structure of our Reach joint venture.</p>
          <p>Now I do want to just mention here, Reach has the best IP network in Asia Pacific and it's very important in terms of what we want to do as a business going forward. So the de-merger gives us greater control over this platform and it's going to allow us to deliver what we need to do, which is end-to-end services to our Australian customers going into Asia, but very importantly it's about European and U.S. companies coming into Asia and giving them a really strong service throughout the region.</p>
          <p>So we're very pleased about this. We still got some more work to do just to conclude it, but it's a tremendous result and has been the result of a tremendous amount of work over the last two months. Thirdly, the China portfolio. As you are aware, we had the SouFun IPO last year, which was good to get away, but then we did review the Octave Investment and there has been quite a bit regulatory change there, which we wrote down that business because of those regulatory changes, one of the things of doing business in China, but we remain very focused on China because Sequel and L Mobile continue to perform very well. So our strategy across all these Asian assets are continuing to drive, we believe, shareholder value over that period.</p>
          <p>So let me just finish on the last one and that's around the media portfolio. Now, when I talk about media I include Sensis, I include FOXTEL and I include the BigPond content assets. So let me just touch on a few of these. Firstly, FOXTEL has had a very strong first half, 9% revenue growth, 17% EBIDTA growth, nearly a quarter of its subscribers are now using high definition services, 17% have got IQ and I think it's 25% have got IQ2. That's been great, and I think we're coming through a tremendous period with FOXTEL. We're very pleased with the performance of that team.</p>
          <p>Then as said, we've got our own IPTV product, T-Box and that continues to exceed our expectations. We have over 100,000 T-Boxes sold but more than one-third of our T-Box households are active BigPond movie download users. So they're ranging now on average more than one movie every week. So remember that's a big source of revenue, downloading movies. So also we've been working very closely with FOXTEL, and you would have seen we announced that from May our T-Box will carry 30 channels of FOXTEL content and that's I think a great demonstration of this very close weekend relationship we have with FOXTEL, which will be very important for us as we move forward.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to Sensis. Now just as we'd forecast, Yellow Print did decline. And that decline did accelerate. The good news is that we are well into executing our strategy that will support our customers growing for around digital solutions. Now this has been something we've talked about for a long time and I've been very pleased with the work we've done. In the last year, remember, we rebuilt the Sensis IT platform, so we'll be ready for this change, because in an online world, it's very different to a print world and we have recently announced some very strategic partnerships with key industry players, being Google and Bing. And they are very important announcements.</p>
          <p>Also we've put out new applications on mobiles and tablets and this is driving very strong usage of our online Yellow Pages digital product. You see it's important to understand the underlying trends and opportunities facing Telstra. Now, so what we wanted to do is get Bruce to give you all a briefing over the next couple of weeks about some of the underlying changes that we have put into the business, because I'm sure that you're looking at that in Shanghai, what's happening to the print business, but we really do believe that print and online together we have a very strong proposition.</p>
          <p>So what he will talk about is three key things. Firstly, about the expanding of the digital business to drive growth and how we're going to simplify the customer experience in terms of opening up this addressable market. Remember, Sensis has a very strong relationship with a large number of small businesses across Australia. Secondly, to support print is a variable provider of advertiser leads. So you see, if you can have print and online working together we think that creates a good partnership and we've been looking at different operators around the world for over two to three years, as we've seen them go through their own transition.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, how do we maximize value from the other parts of the Sensis Group. Now remember, there's still White Pages, there's Whereis, there's Sensis Digital Media and Adstream, and last year these businesses generated around a third of the sales revenue from Sensis and I do want to just stress, we did see cash flow improvement in the first half from Sensis. So a lot of work to do, but we'd like to take you through our strategy. So to sum up, FOXTEL is performing well, we're pleased with T-Box and the Sensis strategy is about creating this long-term value for our shareholders by really taking advantage of this move to digital marketing. And that's why we still expect good strong growth from this portfolio.</p>
          <p>So, just before I conclude, I started off with taking about the floods, and a key person who was part of this has been Michael Rocca, and as you'd have seen in the press, Michael is leaving the business after 43 years service in the business. He has been a tremendous contributor and I just want to publicly recognize Michael today for his great contribution and he has really been a stalwart of this company for many years. So, Michael, on behalf of all thanks very much.</p>
          <p>Okay, just to conclude, strong sales momentum in the first half, 1 million mobile and fixed broadband additional customers through the half and that's taking us good momentum into the second half. Delivering on our strategy, everything we said we've done and we are confirming full year guidance, and I think we've made another critical milestone in our NBN negotiations. Also, we've taken a number of concrete steps to improve customer service, so I'm going to see results there, retaining our customer base, simplifying the business and of course we believe we'll drive shareholder value. So with that, let me ask John to come up and join me, and happy to take some Q&amp;As. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. As always, we will start the Q&amp;A here in George Street. I will take four questions here from George Street before I go to the people who are on the phone line. We might have 14 or 15 of you who are trying to ask questions today, so please can you try and just ask a couple of questions and then we can come back to you later, we've got plenty of time. If we are ready, I'll hand over to Laurent.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And good morning, John and David. First question on the NBN, so how long do you expect the documentation to take now, and once the documentation is finalized and therefore signed, will that put you in a position to come public ally and give us the key term of NBN agreements? And on the back of that just wanted to see if you had some thoughts to share in terms of &#x2013; now you've got some of the key inputs in terms of OpEx, CapEx et cetera, and how do you think your model <mark type="inaudible" /> is going to evolve over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So, in terms of documentation to get to the final agreements we think a couple of months. We think that we've got lot of focus. Now remember it's about documenting what we've agreed, it's number one. So Will and the team are actively working on that now. As soon as we've got them, we will share with you some more information. Remember, once we get everything together, we've got to get an independent assessment before we bring everything back to you for a vote, but we'll try and share with you at that point some more information.</p>
          <p>In terms of the long term modeling of the business, obviously, we have done lot of work on that area, and I think probably as we move through into that period we'll share with you some of that information, because there's a lot of moving parts in that, Laurent, as you understand. There's some decline in the PSTN, high margin, but we've got new NBN revenues coming in that depends on the rollout of the NBN Co. But, John, you might want to comment, because you and the team are doing a lot of work in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have done a lot of work, Laurent, and we're also doing a lot of work on the product set that we will take to market and estimating the revenue and the margins that may occur from that. But it's a little premature to start talking about what that looks like. But when we get to sign up deal and so on we will and we look forward to the next few years, we'll give some guidance on where that's going, but it's just a little early.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm interested on the CapEx modeling, how do you think &#x2013; because you'd have to think that the capital intensity in the business should have to come down over time given you're moving to a sort of lower margin, potentially lower market share sort of business model. So I was just interested, you're spending 14% of sales now, where do you say would be a reasonable assumption, I don't know, five years from now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we've said that we're looking at a continuation from here on 14%. You are right that there is a change of where you spend your CapEx, but you shouldn't underestimate that there is some capital expenditure required to have a new product set and the interaction between Telstra Retail and the Wholesale called NBN Co. So there will be some spend necessary for that. But I don't see &#x2013; certainly not exceeding 14% CapEx this half and yeah, there will be opportunities in CapEx reduction in other areas of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on the first half '11 performance, so in the presentation you're showing an EBITDA decline of 12.5%. Then in the financial highlights you're showing 11%. Just want to clarify the main difference being the Sydney Yellow Pages in terms of adjustment? Okay, so, would it be fair to say the more like-for-like type number would be 11%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just want to clarify that. And just in terms of adjustments, the $75 million in your finance cost of sort of non-IFRS type adjustments, can I just clarify they're non-cash costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tom and I did the valuation, re-val, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So that things do inflate, your finance cost for this half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the borrowing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Putting all that in the mix, if I get a normalized NPAT number of say 1.4, that seem reasonable to you putting all these adjustments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's reasonable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had three listed, but maybe I can't. Let's look just quickly. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just give a sense for trading into Jan and Feb? That's the first question. Perhaps we'll start here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, momentum continues. I mean, obviously, it was an exceptional first six months. So, I don't expect it to be as big as the first half, but we're still expecting strong performance through the half, but January and Feb, really Feb looking good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of ARPU, it's obviously one of the key drivers, can you give a sense for ARPUs for new contracted customers versus the existing base across, I guess, mobile, PSTN and fixed mobile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll get John to get you the exact details. Obviously, we're managing the re-contracting, because we put new Cap Plans in the market. So you're seeing some decline there. But the new customers coming on are coming on at a great ARPU, because a lot of the smartphones. So, we're getting a good mix there, but we're managing the re-contracting very carefully. And if you look at the way we go out, especially in the consumer market, is just managing those levers. I think we're doing it very well at the moment and attracting the right sorts of customer. John, do you got any...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll repeat what I did say about ARPUs. You saw the ARPUs were holding up pretty well, but I do anticipate ARPUs will come down in the second half because people are signing up, mainly these new acquisitions and re-contracting. Part of the success, part of the 919 million mobile success is not just are subsidizing customers, it's also we have adjusted their price points and have included more data, et cetera. So, by definition, ARPUs will come down a little in the second half.</p>

          <p>And then finally, guys, I think previously you'd said of the sort of $1 billion increment in OpEx expected looking forward into FY '12, perhaps two-thirds of that would be the cost of ongoing business.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ben. I have two questions. First is in the prepaid market, just wondering if you can give us some feedback on what's going on there? I mean it seems as if you're reporting much higher ARPUs, but in a subsense the market seems flat or down. I mean your competitors are reporting quite sharply, Optus 66,000 down. Vodafone, I think, were just slightly down in prepaid subs. Is that the impact of smartphones, firstly, and I'm just wondering what's driving that? I'm also noticing by the way, in that context that your SMS numbers are now pretty flat. I mean this is not really a growth anymore. I'm just wondering, is this a smartphone impact on prepaid market? Is that having a follow-on impact on your SMS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think to a certain extent. I mean we're pleased with the prepaid result because remember that's been a market we haven't been as strong as we once were. So it's great to see growth, but remember our ARPU was up, which is very good. We did just prior to Christmas put some smartphones on the prepaid offer and I think that while it was on Cap Plan it's having some impact. Now were you referring to SMS on prepaid or SMS total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we talked about SMS on prepaid, so just SMS total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>I'm just wondering if that's &#x2013; obviously on a smartphone with a data plan, you can send an email.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that overall that is probably a trend we're seeing that especially in corporate and business an email is just as good. But the SMS volumes are still very high and growing very well. Have you got those numbers?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And second question on Sensis, the digital revenue growth there. I seem to recall that in the past that you had experienced digital revenue growth of 10 plus percent. Obviously, I'm counteracting the decline in the print book, but this time you're showing digital revenue growth of only 0.2%. Obviously, we're going to hear more about this in a couple of weeks time, but is that worrying or do you think that your customers need a different offer from Telstra or from Sensis on the digital product, why has the digital growth really slowed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's been a combination of things. We're in this transition period now, because when we bring a whole lot of new digital products to market, which we'll take this through. The actual growth in sales was about 20% through the period, but the revenue did not flow, partly through competition, but I think there is some execution things there, but I think that Bruce will take you through some quite exciting plans going forward. So a bit of work to do, but I think the guys are on to the right things now, so we'll take you through and give you more detail, because you've got to go through the build-up of what those digital revenues are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Mark McDonnell from BBY. Two questions from me. Firstly, on the NBN, secondly on your results. The NBN is now a sharply politicized development. We've had recent statements from the Shadow Minister, Mr. Turnbull that the Liberal Party supports structural separation but remains implacably opposed to the NBN.</p>
          <p>So my question is, given those circumstances is Telstra prepared to provide a choice to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM around the form of structural separation, one option being the Labor Party preference for a deal with the NBN and the other option being a Liberal Party preference for structural separation that does not involve the NBN?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, what we will take to shareholders is what we have certainty about, that's all I can deal with and that will be the current proposal that we have worked with the government and NBN Co and the ACCC at that time. That's all I can take to shareholders because while I may understand the policies of the opposition party they are not in place. And so, it would be very hard to give anything of certainty. However, we're taking to our shareholders what we know and that will be up to shareholders to vote on. That's all I can deal with I can only deal with reality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question relates to your project simplification. The emphasis in the way that you talk about this is largely on process and internal organization, some reference to pricing. But one of the great sources of complexity in Telstra's business is the sheer diversity of your activities. And in that regard it's quite apparent that a number of your businesses are struggling and have struggled for quite some time and yet we never hear anything about simplification involving the turnaround measures or plans to divest underperforming assets, and I'd refer in particular in this case to TelstraClear. Now, David, you know that I questioned your predecessor about this business on several occasions over a number of years. This has been a long running sore. And as we see from these results it not only continues to lose money but those losses are getting worse. What are you going to do about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>TelestraClear which as you know, John has been Chairman there for a while, continues to get a lot of focus. We have looked at a number of options here, Mark, and we continue to look at what the best thing is for shareholders. We have an investment there. If we could find a better return from what we're doing we would do that. But the first half was not quite where we wanted to be. The guys have put a little bit of money into acquiring some market share didn't come off right, but I &#x2013; at the moment we're steady as we go. I think too, if you know something that we don't know, let us know, butt at the moment we're going work through that business and try to make it as profitable and as well performing as we possibly can. That's really the option we have in front of us alone.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Thanks Mark. If you don't mind waiting there, we'll go to the phone lines. All right, can we take the first question from the phones please?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Hi, David and John. The first question, just on the NBN and I know you don't want to give details, but just to clarify, I think what you've made a caveat to the NBN agreement being completed. Price stability, conformation of the tax treatment and then also the legislation on the NBN, can I just clarify exactly what you mean by those three caveats?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Let me ask John to do that. I mean our pricing stability and regulatory stability is probably the right term for the first one. But, John, do you want to take through this, because you've done...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The price stability is about copper pricing fundamentally that we've been arguing that it's best for the industry to have some stability around copper prices as it enters into an NBN world and pricing, of course, copper pricing is very dependent on ACCC consideration. So, pricing stability therefore is of concern to us. Sorry, the second and the third?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the tax, the tax is just simply that &#x2013; the deductibility for all our payments, for NBN accessing our network and our interactions with NBN are appropriately deductible. I don't really have any strong concerns about it, but nevertheless it's going to be fast and so that there are no adverse implications, because, of course, the financials depend on certain tax outcomes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which has got to go through and we've got to make sure the NBN is all clear and good. So that we've got to work through those, and of course having regulatory stability in terms of separation is really important, because that can have a big impact on valuation. So, we need to find some way that we can work that and that's why we've got to work through with the ACCC over then next extra couple of months. So thanks, Digby.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Dave and John. Thanks for your time. Just two questions if I may as well. Firstly, just on the operating cost outlook, I think you said at the Investor Day that &#x2013; David, you said cost will be up $450 million this year and labor is up $230 million, which I think you also put in the presentation. But it looks to me like you spend basically 500 on the DVCs. So you spend the annual allocation in the first half and the labor costs have only increased by about $20 million versus the $230 million that you guided to. So, just wondering what the outlook is for the second half on both of those measures, because if you continue spending on the DVCs and that labor increase does come through, I just like to better understand where the savings are going to come from?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on Sensis, where I think your adjusted sales fell about 14% with print down 18% once you adjust the Sydney. I do understand that you are looking at some digital initiatives, but currently you're still around 50% of total sales. So I am just wondering how confident you are you can arrest that decline given that sort of print &#x2013; that print decline is now pretty much in line with what we're seeing globally with directories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the reason for the question is because as Sensis, as I am sure you know is over 10% of your group EBITDA? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. Thanks, Christian. I am going to get John to answer the first one because he did go through I think some of that in his presentation, but we'll just take you through because that's a very key point. We did spend that $0.5 billion on DVCs, and as John said he did confirm guidance, we'll show how we do that. And on the Sensis one, John might want to make a few comments then I'll make some comments on Sensis too, because we clearly understand how important Sensis is in our business. So, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Christian, the $450 million that we talked about was mobile DVCs. DVCs in total we said would be about $650 million or so and you're right, roughly speaking, labor increase was going to be about 200 and other expenses was going to about 200, and you're right labor is, the increase is only 20 for the first half and what I did say was that we will continue to support the momentum in growing the customer base and so the DVCs might well be higher than what we did say. But, as you can see, already the labor expenses is running at a rate that's lower than we anticipated and that's because we've done some things earlier, emanating from the simplification of the business, and so we do expect the labor additional cost to be lower than we said back on Investor Day.</p>
          <p>And in the other expense category, roughly that was to grow a couple of hundred as well, and right now that's grown about 200, but 133 of that is the impairment, the Octave impairment. So you can see the run rate in other expenses is also not as high as we expected. So, to answer your question, we will spend a little more on DVCs, as I said, but our intention is to offset it in other expense areas and deliver on our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. I just like to add on top of that Christian, we are making good progress around the reengineering works. I think that we're seeing good engagement across the business that's driving some really good improvements. So that's been a little bit of the upside we've got in terms of costout, and so good news is, so lot to do, but that as John said, we can &#x2013; I don't think the DVCs rate is quite at the same level as they were in the first half, but we will still keep the momentum going as we go through into the second half.</p>
          <p>Let me answer the Sensis question, because it is very important that we really move this business forward, and of course you all know the stories around Yellow Pages Directories around the world, and yes, we're seeing some of that change in customer behavior from print product to online products. So we are well positioned now for that change, but as that revenue mix changes there's a number of different element to that when you recognize revenue, how you do it, how you continue to make a very compelling offer to the customer around print and online, and I think that's what we really do have a differentiation in. But revenues will continue to decline.</p>
          <p>So therefore, you've got to do quite a bit of work to take your cost base out and because we did the big iGen project nearly, what, 18 months ago, John, we're now seeing cost trying to come out of the business, and remember that the online digital sale is a very different sale to what you've traditionally had within the print business. So that's the change we're going through and so that we can &#x2013; those cash and that EBITDA is very important to us as we go forward. And while it may be a different mix on revenue and expense, we have a very clear target about how we're going to maintain the free cash flow and the EBITDA for this business, but there will be a transition period and that's what we're going to take you through over &#x2013; sometimes in the next couple of weeks, right, and so we're trying to give a bit more color because this is not sort of suddenly a surprise when we work on this for a long time, and &#x2013; now, but we're very aware what's &#x2013; what the trend has been around the world. Okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David and John. John, you put up a slide showing product profitability and on that slide we saw a substantial decline in mobiles and fixed Internet margins. I gather the reason or a large part of the reason for that is the new deals you're doing, the bundled deals and just low pricing plans. The implications at the margin on those new customers, and old customers that are converting to those new plans is a lot low than the average figure you've shown for the half. Can you give me an indication of just where those margins are on the new deals that you're doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't tell you the deal-by-deal margins, but I can tell you that your assumptions are right that there are two things that are driving the margin reduction. One is there are different price offerings in the marketplace and so that we will have some &#x2013; and it's having some impact on ARPUs, and particularly wireless broadband ARPUs. If you look into the detail of our results, wireless broadband ARPUs have dropped quite considerably. And of course, the half-year result has lot of the upfront acquisition costs.</p>
          <p>And so on a half basis you are seeing a lot of the upfront costs in that result which will &#x2013; those margins will improve over the second half. But will mobile margins get back to where they were before? No, they won't, but they won't be where they are now, because we have got the upfront cost in the first half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but remember, we are more competitive in the market around mobile fixed broadband, but we still selling the value that we believe that we deserve, because of the strength of the network, the fixed broadband network and the service we give. So, it is about being competitive, but as John said, there is a lot of upfront loading in terms of the variable cost, and because we expense it upfront therefore it flows through. So I wouldn't get too caught in that, because I think as John said it improves the <mark type="inaudible" /> a ton.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

Let's be clear here, we're aiming at growing earnings and EBITDA not so necessarily focused on growing margins.</p>

On your wireless broadband net adds of 500 million &#x2013; closer to 500,000 customers, just wondering is that new customers or are you activating customers back from your competitors? Because the reason I ask is because if I look at your fixed line trends, they look relatively resilient. You only lost about 130,000 fixed lines this last half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the question with the net additional adds. But your questions are the new customers, the category versus win back from customers. It is too early to tell that. We do look &#x2013; remember, it isn't quite a churn. We can tell with mobile when you churn the number, but on a mobile broadband people tend to buy new dongle. So it's a bit harder, but I would &#x2013; well I mean &#x2013; we can come back to you with what our estimates are, I'd be guessing. I've got an idea what it is. But I think there's quite a few new people into that category. Sachin, so that's &#x2013; you're just getting one question only.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just one &#x2013; You spend $0.5 billion on PVC, but if we look at the sequential mobile trend, you've only had 5% revenue growth, which is only marginally better than what you have done historically. Just wondering is that reasonable or you're expecting a much stronger pickup in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that's reasonable, but there will be, we think, a bit of pickup as we go forward into the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't done that. Still &#x2013; still 12%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>12, yeah. I'd say 12 percentage, that sort of range. So not up to the 20, 25s of the U.S. 12, 13.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in relation to this regulatory certainty question around the price of copper and so on, ACCC has got a different interpretation of that where they've got this new regulated asset base and they have also proposed quite a massive reduction in the value of the asset. Now, if they confirm that presumably you would have to fight that in the court. I would expect you have to fight that in the courts. Would that then mean that you couldn't say we got regulatory certainty, we don't know what the value of the network is, that we're negotiating and therefore you won't meet that 1 July deadline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there is a risk, Ian. No question, because we've got to work through to get to a position that we have certainty over the period. So what we bring to shareholders, I can stand there and the Chairman of the Board can stand and say, yeah, this is what we expected to get from it.</p>
          <p>So, yes, there's a lot of moving parts in there but we've done the discussions, we've disclosed that. We've said that both to the government and NBN Co and to the regulator. And we're going to have to work through that, going to have find our way through it, because we can't live in a open ended world if we're going to do something as big as this. So, yes, there is lot of work to do.</p>
          <p>John, do you want to...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just going to add that there is a consultation process that's been running with regards to that ROA, return on asset base methodology and we've put our views and others have put views and we don't yet have an outcome of that consultation. So &#x2013; but that's all part of the pricing stability discussions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I confirm another thing. I think John said that the dividend, for next year the Board wants to pay $0.28 as well. And I think you said, John, the tax position is such that you can fully frank that as well?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Sameer Chopra [Merrill Lynch]. I had two questions. First one is on gearing. You talk about the comfort level of gearing is around 1.5 to 1.9 times net debt to EBITDA. You are at 1.6 right now. How does that change as you enter &#x2013; as you become a retail-centric business or as you divest your network and does your comfort levels change? That's kind of the first question. The second one was mobile SARC is running at about $162 in this half, it was $149 last year. I would have expected a bigger SARC number actually coming into this result. I am wondering, what are you expecting in terms of trends on SARCs? Are smartphones &#x2013; is there a bigger smartphone in the base you're expecting SARCs will lift from here, stabilize, come off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask John to talk to the gearing one, and if he wants to make comments on the SARCs and then I'll wrap up, but in terms of our modeling we're doing a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sameer, the gearing or debt servicing target is &#x2013; the conditions leading into that. We regularly have a look at our target signs, if you like. But I am not expecting much shift in the free cash flow capability of this company. So, not expecting too much changing in our target zones whatsoever. We have, you might have noticed, reduced that target a little bit. It was a little higher than that and that was simply a change in the world financial environment. So that's why we're saying that. It's just some evidence. From time to time we need to review these parameters, but &#x2013; and we will when we &#x2013; in a couple of years time when we follow on into a &#x2013; an NBN world. But we have expectations of what that will deliver and look like and but we might be absolutely wrong. But right now I wouldn't see any need to radically change those targets.</p>
          <p>And SARCs, look, I mean the $162 from $149 was driven by the combination of the cost of smartphones, and I said in my presentation it was fairly much driven by rate, and in fact I can &#x2013; if you bear with me a little second here I'll give you little more detail &#x2013; bit of a split &#x2013; it's probably in the documentation that we've given you, but of the &#x2013; it's &#x2013; of the 162, 41 million, so in absolute is driven by rate and 100 million is driven by volumes. That's the &#x2013; so the increase in SARCs was $141 million. This includes CSL by the way, because that's in your expense line, 41 by rate, 100 by volume. So, rate hasn't been the primary driver. We've actually &#x2013; the number of &#x2013; the volume of handsets we're subsidizing is quite high, as you can tell by our additions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> SARCs are not really picking up, is that one of the Project New benefits, because I think you were taking the contract of Brightstar and looking to do it in-house?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, be careful there. We've only taken the management of outsourcing, thus so doing all of the supply chain warehousing for us, and they're doing a good job for us actually. So &#x2013; but yeah there has been a lot of good results. We do that I think pretty efficiently. But also I'd like to say that the whole distribution strategy, we continue look at that driving the cost to most efficient channel while meeting customer demand, and Gordon and the team have done some very good work, but it's also in the enterprise market and the business market. So, your question is what do we expect? I think it will probably flatten a bit. There may be a little bit up in the second half, but generally I don't see it going much higher. Now are we doing a good job in trying to buy correctly and looking at the handset mix, et cetera? That all the things you've got to do as you would understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would add that in the second half of the year, we expect far more on mobile repayment option than on the subsidy side. That also helps with the full year SARCs rate zone.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys. Two questions. First, one around interest and tax and secondly around head count and labor costs. Effective tax rate was quoted as 33% in there, John. Could you just give some clarity on that? And on interest, I noted that the average interest cost was increasing as well on high liquidity and just financing costs, so if you could give us an idea as to where that's expected to go? Secondly, head count down around to 1,000 in this first half. Will you be doing a similar reduction in second half, and if not, would that be pushed out to FY '12, just to get an idea around redundancy costs? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let John handle that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the effective tax rate, it's 33%. So it's gone up a little bit, because we haven't had so much R&amp;D claims and investment allowances given that the transformation expenditures have come off. So that's fundamentally why the effective &#x2013; what's affected the tax of your graph.</p>
          <p>In terms of the borrowings, the actual interest expense has gone up, mostly because of rate, because you will see in our figures our net borrowing has gone up about $450 million. That's timing, right? So net debt went up about that amount in the first half, it's just timing of cash flows. So the interest expense increase is just right and that will continue, because rates have gone up and we've had to refinance, but it's not huge. I mean it's sort of tens of millions of dollars. Now, the FTE &#x2013; let me talk about redundancy.</p>
          <p>Redundancy, we spent $160 million in the first half. We don't expect to spend that much. Remember in the second half &#x2013; remember I said the total redundancy expenditure is likely to be 220 also in the full year, we'll be around about that mark, maybe a little bit more. We will time our redundancies perfectly, but it's not going to be anywhere near the first half redundancies, and I said, we're front-end loaded in our exits of &#x2013; you're right, the exits where 700 or so in net terms and there will still be some exits in the second half, but not at the same rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That tax rate, John, will that be 33% for the full year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It might come down a little.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe now towards the 30%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Let me just &#x2013; I want to come back to just labor and labor sub, because it's not just the head count, it's about labor and labor sub and we have a lot of focus on that. So I am expecting it to continue to decline and that's what we've got to do as a business. Been years we've got some redundancy costs, but the only result here is to drive a more efficient business. So every business unit has targets to continue drive efficiency. So it must come down. Now, there's mixtures in the FTE numbers, there's some contractors and agency staff, it's everything that's out for grabs, so a lot of work going on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer that. They're classified as prepaid mobile broadband.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And the number of iPads is &#x2013; it's on the top of my tongue &#x2013; Gordon, can you remember? It's about 70,000, yeah. I think it was &#x2013; and Galaxy is not as many, but going okay. But the ARPUs are, yeah, not anyway near what we get, means sort of in the low, low numbers. So we can get to the data on it, but if we watch that &#x2013; it's a emerging category that because people go into WiFi a lot, what you get on the 3G networks don't quite want to go. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given that it's kind of mobile broadband ARPU is around $40 now. As these other segments grow, we could probably see ARPUs trending even lower given those lower price points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what we're doing now is &#x2013; and the ARPU story is getting more and more complicated, because we're also getting a lot of machine-to-machine and that can be based low as $5 ARPU. Then you're getting the tablet category, then you've got just the straight mobile phone, then you've got a smartphone and different types of smartphones. So, while we may be seeing overall ARPU declines the actual cost to sell &#x2013; fairly every category has got a different equation. So what we'll do is we can get you that data, because that's a lot of the work we're doing now as we start to move into these new areas, which is going to continue to grow the number of so called subscribers on the wireless network.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a related question around mobile CapEx, in particular. Obviously you've got 0.5 million new wireless broadband customers. Obviously data utilization is increasing. I mean can you give us a feel for how that's tracking and how the network is going? Obviously, your competitors have been spending a lot outside of the floods, having to spend a lot for various reasons, but how is Telstra's network?</p>

          <p>The network is going &#x2013; holding up incredibly well, both in terms of its performance, in terms of the headroom, still got a lot of headroom, in terms of the amount of data we can carry. Remember it's what I think, roughly, 90% data packets and 10% voice or around about there, but we are very pleased with the network and we have some good plans coming up too.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Andrew Levy, Macquarie. Your latest cap plans, well the cap plans when I looked appear to have an embedded MRO or Mobile Repayment Option charge in them, and John, you referred before when Sameer asked a question to greater Mobile Repayment Option takeup in the second half. That kind of sales technique, I guess, pools forward some of your revenues. So, I was just wondering if you could talk to when that was introduced, what the impact on the FY '11 accounts will be versus selling how you used to sell, and also what the ARPU impact will be in the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we introduced zero MRO option in December and that has an impact on the revenue line. In that the phone is not subsidized and the cost of the handset is spread over revenues, or they're amortized over the contract period. So, as a result of that &#x2013; and it's spread over hardware and usage, all right? So, it's one of the reasons that I mentioned that ARPUs will decline in the second half, because rather than subsidy it has a net revenue or an impact on your credit. So, that's how that works. So you come in and buy a handset on a zero MRO plan, meaning your handset doesn't cost you anything, but it's in an accounting sense the sales are amortized over the revenue contract period offsetting its usage and hardware sales.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we make the sale on a day, but the accounting is that the revenue declines over 24 months, it's amortized 24 months.</p>

          <p>Just wanted to go back to the comment you made on the documentation. You think I am going to &#x2013; I think &#x2013; I'm upset with the timing, but it is, we've been in a sort of information void in terms of real NBN disclosure from that eight months, so it's kind of getting a little long. And two months documentation process. Not sure what law firm you use, but that seems to be an awful long time to put these documents together. I'm sure they can do much better than that. And so, is the idea that you actually &#x2013; you are waiting to have the legislation through, because you don't want to add to the current controversy by releasing more detail on your definitive agreements? I'm struggling with the timing of the increased disclosure?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we shouldn't &#x2013; we shouldn't underestimate the complexity of this agreement. I've been up to my armpits in the whole thing and we shouldn't underestimate the importance of what we've said today. I know it's easy to say, well you haven't told us much new about NBN today? But to actually agree the deal terms is really the blue print for the lawyers to go document. Why we haven't gone any further than we have is that we haven't been in that position.</p>
          <p>We've been still talking about the deal terms Telstra to NBN, and for that matter the elements of the government contract that will emerge between Telstra and the government. So, that really sets the blue print for the lowers to go away and do the documentation. Now, having said that, that doesn't mean that that doesn't have its own complexity, because &#x2013; but I just want to make sure people understand here that where we have got to and what we've been asked today is an important milestone, because the blue print is there for the documentation.</p>

          <p>We have agreed the deal terms on an exchange of letters.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exchange of letters, okay. And second question, thanks for that clarification, it's very useful. Second question is around the interaction between your volume re-acceleration and the impact that it's had on ARPU. Particularly if you had to kind of go back and look at the last six months in terms of how you've driven the volume re-acceleration in mobile and fixed broadband, what would you say has been the most important sort of driver in terms of how you've driven that subscriber growth? And what &#x2013; back off of my mind it's from my point of view I think you've driven that a lot more through the cost. So your cost to re-investment rather than an actual price gap, but I'm interested to have your view on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's really a mixture of all the above. I mean, remember, what, nine months ago some of our plants had 35% premiums on them. So, I think that we were not as competitive as we need to be. We weren't as strong in some of the smartphones as we needed to be, and then I think also our promotion wasn't quite where it needed to be. So, as you'd understand, it's the balance between all the above and getting the channel working correctly.</p>
          <p>And I think we've just had a really good mix of that and we have been very conscious not to start a price war, because we don't believe that's in anyone interest but we did want to make sure that we were having attractive plans with the right handsets at the right level. So that's been a lot of the work we've done and I think we've got a bit of management of it on a weekly, monthly basis roller on. So, I put that down to that. John, do you want to add any more to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's exactly right.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that the sort of PCP run rate you're thinking of taking into second half or there will be a bit of an acceleration on the PCP rate, in terms of ARPU compression?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have already mentioned the MRO impact on the mobile ARPU, and so it will be a little more than 1.7%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a little bit more. But with the strong volume and the right customer mix coming through, I think that that's where we feel confident.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll take one more &#x2013; we haven't got time, so we will take one more question here, and I know that Digby and Christian have been on the line waiting for a while. So we'll come back to the phone lines. Andrew?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yeah. Andrew Anagnostellis, Deutsche. Just on the PSTN business, it's a reality that it is declining, but are you disappointed with the rate of decline in the last half given all the new products you've introduced? And just philosophically, going forward, in an NBN world does this business just continue to run off or is there some sort of strategy to either accelerate or slow the decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not disappointed, it's pretty much where we expect it to be. You can see from the bundling strategy in some of the PSTN access pricing whereas we're rebalancing. And what I'll do is I'll get John to take you through just a little bit of the mix in the PSTN, because you got to look at access and calling rates. And John, did you bring those numbers over here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I have got the numbers. It's already in my head anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean it's driven by usage, as I think I said and people are just using other mobile and Facebook to communicate and as I told you, SMS is all <mark type="inaudible" /> and so on. So of the &#x2013; access is sort of a highest element of the PSTN revenues and that declined about 4%, right. So the line reduction is not too bad. So people actually having an access line. But it's &#x2013; the 8.4% is driven by like 20% reduction in local calls and another 13% in national long distance, they are the sort of numbers that are driving the 8.4%, so it's usage again, right.</p>
          <p>But access lines, access revenues, access revenue reduction of 4.4, I think it's &#x2013; so that's sort of the mix that's going on. I guess that will continue as people continue to use other forms of communication and access lines will gradually will come off, but in the brave new NBN world it will be quite a different &#x2013; voice will probably be an application of that &#x2013; who knows how much it will be charged for &#x2013; or we'll charge them different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of &#x2013; the whole reason you're doing this strategy is of course to restore earnings growth. Clearly, this year it's not happening. I mean what confidence should investors have that the measures we're seeing this year are going to translate into earnings growth next year? I mean obviously we don't expect a formal guidance, but just perhaps in terms of some of the revenue and cost drivers that could flow through to next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think 1 million users is a pretty good proof point, but as I showed in my chart, about revenues returning and growth and also in terms of profitability. But you also need to look at the fundamentals. Yes, we have invested around customer growth, which we told you we're going to do, we told you what was going to happen this year and it's all about returning to topline growth and profit growth.</p>
          <p>Now with the cost out you see the labor improving. Yes, there is some variable cost increase, but that's good investment, good investment. You're getting returns in 10, 11 months, it's &#x2013; that's very good. So, I think that's the proof point and so the momentum in the business is very strong and we're going to keep it going, because it's a good thing for our shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the simplification of the business, I and Robert told you all of it. There's time that had to be spent and has been spent on identifying all the opportunities and that's been done and now we're into execution on those, doing certain projects that Dave mentioned, to have a totally different cost base in our organization &#x2013; lower.</p>

          <p>We'll just go the phone lines for two last questions. I think we've got Digby.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have Digby wishing to ask another question. Please go ahead, Digby.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for coming back to me. Just quickly, two questions actually. NBN cash flows, John, within your assumptions what proportion of the 11 billion NPV will be realized before the next election, so I call it about a year-end FY '13, so in other words what extent do you think long guided supply contracts or contract to service arrangements will provide certainty over the remaining cash flows, if there is a change in government? And then very quickly, another question, Yellow Pages, the 18% decline in adjusted print revenues, can you please give us some indication there? You've indicated higher cancellations and a declining yield, so what was the volume and yield mix within that 18% print decline? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You take NBN?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can. The first challenge is picking when the next election will be. Look, if we talk about election being three years out, remember, in the first three years, the cash flows from the NBN arrangements aren't going to be great, right. So &#x2013; but in term &#x2013; and the cash flows come from the infrastructure leasing and so they're not going to be doing a hell of a lot of work in the first three years. And therefore the other element of cash flows that come to the company, which is payment for de-commissioning customers also won't be very much in the next three years. So, cash flows in the next &#x2013; if we assume elections in three years time, might be very high over the next three-year period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of Sensis &#x2013; now Bruce Akhurst is in Melbourne? Bruce, you there? What's up?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So what I think will be based on the &#x2013; because the Yellow is &#x2013; there's a number of different numbers you got to look at it across print and digital. What I think we'll do is come back and we can give you some more color on that, because I think that's a longer story. But I understand what you're driving to, and something we're looking. So, we'll come back on that one, Digby.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I also have a couple of follow-up questions. The first one is on your labor cost growth expectations for FY '12. My second question, John, is just touch on something that you mentioned earlier about, sorry, it was you David on your plans for the mobiles network. I was just wondering what that means to you CapEx expectations for the company for FY '12? And then thirdly just touching on something that Digby mentioned. You obviously sort of talked that went over the last six or seven months around the $11 billion number and that's something that obviously shareholders are very focused on. What sort of strategies do you have in place to mitigate the risk of NBN not getting to sort of 90%, 93% coverage in terms of what that means to your total compensation package?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, let me answer the second one on any plans we have within the wireless network is just within the normal CapEx unplugged. So, no additional CapEx you should be planning for at all. In terms of the NBN Co, that you are on exactly right sorts of questions, Christians, so it doesn't get too nice &#x2013; what does that mean, that's why there is a lot of discussion that you need to have about what that means. And of course, the implications of when exchanges are turned off, not turned off, all those sort of things are critically important, in fact, probably more important than is apparent from just what people think you're doing in that topline deal. In terms of labor cost for the second half of the year, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Christian asked about fiscal year '12. And we're not really guiding on fiscal year '12, Christian. To your CapEx question and that was a fiscal year '12 question as well, and I'm not saying this is fiscal year '12 but in over next three or four years, we will have a spectrum renewal requirement and so that will add to our CapEx requirement, but that's sort of fiscal year '13 and beyond.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's right. So I think that's been pretty much rated, but in terms of my comment about what we're doing, there's no additional CapEx, which was why the question was asked. Okay. So, does that answer your question, Christian?</p>
