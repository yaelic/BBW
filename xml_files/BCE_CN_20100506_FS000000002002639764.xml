          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to BCE's First Quarter Results Conference Call.  I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Thane Fotopoulos.  Please go ahead, Mr. Fotopoulos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carolyn. Good morning everybody.  Joining me today as always is George Cope, President and CEO, and Siim Vanaselja, CFO.  Earlier this morning the news release was issued announcing our Q1 results.  George and Siim will take you through a slide presentation that's available on the investor section of our website at bce.ca and after that we'll move into a Q&amp;A session where we'll answer as many of your questions as time permits.  Because of our Annual General Meeting this morning at 9:30 A.M. we will need to end this call at around 8:50 at the latest.</p>
          <p>However, before I had the call over to George, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements with respect to items such as revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS, free cash flow, and capital intensity.  Several assumptions were made by us in preparing these forward-looking statements and there are risks that our actual results will differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements.  For additional information on such assumptions and risks, please consult BCE's 2009 Annual MD&amp;A as updated in BCE's Q1 2010 MD&amp;A and BCE's press release dated May 6, 2010, announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2010, all of which are filed with the Canadian Securities Commission and with the SEC and which are also available on the Investor Relations website at bce.ca.  Any forward-looking statements made today represent BCE's expectations as of May 6, 2010, and accordingly are subject to change after such date.  Except as may be required by Canadian Securities Laws we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, and I'm making this statement on behalf of both George and Siim, whose remarks today may contain certain forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will hand it over to George.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you, Thane. Good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining us.  I'm happy to report that Bell is off to a great start in 2010 and over the next few minutes I want to take you through a quick overview of our first quarter with Siim.</p>
          <p>If we turn to Slide 4, as you know we have five strategic imperatives we're focused on and we made measurable progress on all five of those imperatives.  In terms of wireless, we increased our share of incremental postpaid adds to 42% in the quarter up from 19% last year and exceeding our target. As you know, we had set to make sure we achieve 33% of the net adds of postpaid.  So off to a strong start on wireless. Of particular importance is the acceleration we've also seen our data revenue growth which came in at 40% in the quarter and driven by new applications such as the Olympics TV application on mobile phones and our NHL playoffs on Bell Mobility phones.</p>
          <p>In terms of our investment, our FTTN coverage in Toronto, Montreal is now completed.  1.8 million homes have been passed with 25 Mbps service using VDSL2 and by the end of this year all of our FTTN footprint that we will have completed will have VDSL2 capability. Put us in the position such that in early February we launched the Bell Fibe network providing 25 Mbps services in Toronto, Montreal and increasing our competitive offering relative to our cable operators.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide5, we saw a strong quarter in terms of revenue growth per household with 12% year-over-year revenue growth driven by an increase in ARPU in both our Internet business and our TV business.  Through the continued focus on cost reductions year-over-year we were able to generate best-in-class wireline EBITDA performance with over 5% EBITDA growth in our wireline business and that includes the Olympic expense.</p>
          <p>Our focus on service continues to benefit the company.  We continue to see a reduction in our churn in the Internet business and our TV churn has always been maintained well at 1.1%.  Same Day, Next Day service now completion rate at over 95% and it's really starting to show up in our call volumes as the reduction at the call center in the first quarter was 12% year-over-year because of the improved service and customer &#x2013; to the customer.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost, continued focus there where we saw wireline operation expense reduction of $90 million year-over-year excluding our cost to operate the Olympics and, of course, excluding the acquisition of The Source in order for you to get a normalized sense of our cost reduction in the wireline side.  And great work on working capital as accounts receivable balances through DSO improvement of four days improved, generated $141 million in working capital for the company.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 6, our improvement in distribution, branding, products and service across both the wireline and wireless business allowed us to report one of our stronger first quarters in RGUs in years with net additions excluding our NAS losses up 78% to 86,000 in the quarter, while at the same time we did see a small reduction in NAS losses again and on the residential side for the tenth consecutive quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 7 on the wireless side a little deeper look at the quarter, obviously very pleased to see our gross adds on postpaid up 25% year-over-year. With the 81,000 net adds in postpaid, that's the strongest first quarter we have had in our 25-year history.  I think just as important was the stabilization we have now seen on ARPU, where we saw a slight uptick in our blended ARPU, more importantly, it didn't decline in the quarter where we had been in the previous quarters.  And if we take the months of February, March and now also now in April at Bell, we've had three months now that we've seen ARPU improve year-over-year.  And that's the trend that obviously is important versus the decline we'd seen in the past, and that's been driven principally by our wireless data revenue growth. And, as I mentioned, that's 40% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And also pleased to see that we kept our COA in check in the quarter at $362 and, obviously, that's driven through much higher volumes than we anticipated so amortizing advertising costs over a much higher volume and the new distribution agreements we entered into last year that we talked about in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 8, as I had mentioned, our residential NAS losses did improve year-over-year.  It's the tenth consecutive quarter that we've seen that, and I think important for investors is we are not seeing acceleration in local access line substitution and that is seen here in our numbers from the consumer side.  On the business side, we saw a small improvement year-over-year.  We believe that is again continued to be driven more by economy than competitive issues. There are not a lot &#x2013; lot of expansion going on in the BDM business or addition of lines. And as a result, although we've seen a small improvement, we'll look hopefully in the second half of the year through economic growth to help slow that decline.</p>
          <p>Local revenue trajectory was improved, but when combined with our long distance revenue decline you can see a 7.7% decline. And that was particularly driven in the long distance area where we saw competition on the business side and in the consumer side with fixed-price residential long distance packages driving LD revenue down more significantly than we had seen in the past, and I think consistent with what you've seen from other companies reporting this quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 9, our Bell TV continues to achieve excellent results for us.  ARPU up $3.76 for the year on a year-over-year basis, net adds climbing to 20,000 in the quarter and revenue growth of 10.6%, well maintaining excellent churn at 1.1% per month.  And we are focused now on ramping up for our launch of IPTV later this year.  We will launch in some geographies in Toronto and Montreal in the second half of the year and are encouraged by the results we're seeing from other telephone companies across North America in terms of the rollout of IPTV.</p>
          <p>On Slide 10, our wireline data, as I mentioned earlier household ARPU was up, part of that was driven by residential Internet ARPU with a 5.2% year-over-year increase. That's really driven as people migrate to our new Fibe network and to higher bandwidth rate plans.  Also happy to see that our Internet net adds were up slightly over last year and 39% of our subscribers moved to FTTNs -- or subscriber growth to FTTN in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So people are moving, if you will, to where we put our money in terms on investment and that drives incremental ARPU for us.  On the business side, again, continues to be soft. As a result overall data revenues were flat as legacy declines of up to 12% were almost offset by growth in our IP connectivity of 9%, and as a result data for the quarter was flat year-over-year.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we made, we believe, significant progress on all five of our imperatives in the quarter.  On the wireline -- wireless side remaining part of the year we will continue to focus on maintaining and growing our market share, making sure we achieve our target of at least 33% of the postpaid net adds, continue to focus on the data opportunity that we now have in front of us with the HSPA network and a focus on the data products to drive ARPU.</p>
          <p>On the wireline side, our investment in broadband will continue with the launch of IPTV later this year.  We've got to continue to drive costs out of the organization such that we can reinvest those cost reductions in increased growth in our wireless portfolio and for our launch of IPTV. And we expect to continue to see the service improvements that we've had in the marketplace and that is truly helping our brand -- driving costs out and you can see that, as I mentioned, in our churn numbers on the Internet side for the company.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Siim.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks George. Good morning, everyone.  We appreciate you joining us on the call this morning.  After closing 2009 with a good fourth quarter I'm pleased to say that we also enjoyed a good start to 2010.  As you will have seen from our Q1 earnings release, revenue, EBITDA, earnings and free cash flow were all up considerably.  Both our wireless and wireline operations performed at a high level very much consistent with the guidance we outlined for you in February, if not somewhat better.  Total revenue growth was 3.8% this quarter.  This was driven by the inclusion of The Source in our results which is reflected in product revenues and by slightly higher wireless service revenues.  TV and broadband results also contributed to the improved trend in overall service revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Bell's EBITDA grew 2% this quarter, a great result when you consider that this reflects $63 million of incremental year-over-year Olympic-related expenditures and $17 million unforeseen charge from an arbitration decision that was rendered on a wireless contract dispute relating to prior years.  Now partly offsetting those two items was a favorable pension valuation adjustment in the amount of $51 million.  So before these three one-time items, EBITDA growth was 4.1% with a stable margin year-over-year on much higher activations.</p>
          <p>We continue to achieve meaningful cost reductions in labor and G&amp;A spending.  We also began benefiting from more favorable currency rates on the hedging of our U.S. dollar purchases this quarter.  Our CapEx spending was lower year-over-year with our new HSPA wireless network build behind us.  We do expect, though, to accelerate capital spending through the course of the year on our broadband fibre initiatives including IPTV.  Therefore our outlook is still on pace to achieve a capital intensity level of close to 16% for the full year.</p>
          <p>BCE statutory EPS for the quarter increased to $0.72 per share from $0.48 per share last year.  That increase was driven by EBITDA growth, lower restructuring charges and gains on a sale of our remaining non-core investment in shares of SkyTerra and TerraStar.  Adjusted EPS, which is before those net gains in restructuring costs, was up 14% year-over-year to $0.65 per share.</p>
          <p>In addition to the higher EBITDA, adjusted EPS benefited from lower depreciation and the accretion from fewer outstanding BCE common shares as a result of our ongoing share buybacks.  I'm particularly pleased to report our free cash flow generation which doubled year-over-year to $545 million.  That's a very strong result driven by lower cash taxes from the voluntary pension plan contribution that we made at the end of 2009 as well as decreased capital spending and the improved working capital that George referenced.</p>
          <p>With that high level perspective on the results, let me then turn to the details for each of our segments.  So on Page 14, wireless financials, the performance trends here were particularly good.  We saw much improved revenue growth of 7%, strong growth in our postpaid subscriber base and significantly higher data usage.  We're also encouraged by Bell Mobility's ARPU performance in the quarter which stabilized after five consecutive quarters of decline.  Voice ARPU declines were offset by continued strong data ARPU growth.</p>
          <p>Our wireless EBITDA performance this quarter reflected spending to gain 63,000 more activations year-over-year. As well we've been upgrading existing customers to more high-end data capable devices which, of course, will help drive improved ARPU and churn performance for the future.  Together, subscriber acquisitions and retention spending was $41 million higher this quarter compared with the first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Our wireless EBITDA this quarter also was impacted by the contract arbitration decision that I mentioned.  Excluding that item, wireless EBITDA was down about 1% year-over-year and margin stayed about 40% even with the significantly higher activations and upgrades.  So, I'd say a good financial quarter in wireless with an improved market share and revenue trajectory.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to our wireline segment.  Wireline revenues were up 2.5% year-over-year from the addition of The Source, increased data equipment sales to large business customers and continued growth in TV and Internet.  Our residential unit improved average revenue per household this quarter by 12%.  We saw an improvement in local revenue erosion with fewer NAS line losses year-over-year in both residential and business.</p>
          <p>Trends in our business market continue to stabilize, although clearly spending and new business formation has not rebounded to pre-recession levels.  Once again the clear highlight of the quarter for our wireline segment was our industry-leading EBITDA growth of 5.1%.  Cost pressures from higher Olympic-related expenditures this quarter were essentially offset by lower year-over-year pension expense.  Wireline margin improvement of almost 1% was from lower voice erosion and cost savings from the flow-through of labor reductions in 2009 as well as procurement savings and efficiencies in field services.</p>
          <p>Turning to earnings on Slide 16, BCE's adjusted EPS grew 14% year-over-year to $0.65 per share.  I mentioned the one-time pension valuation credit this quarter which recognizes a surplus in one of the BCE pension plans. You may recall on our guidance call in February I estimated this amount would be in the range of 25 to $50 million.  The final valuation adjustment was calculated to be $51 million and, as a result, we now expect full year 2010 pension expense at Bell to be about $130 million, down from my previous estimate of 155 million. And this additional upside is largely offset by the one-time impact of the wireless contract arbitration decision I mentioned, so there's no need to change our earnings guidance for the year at this point.</p>
          <p>Lower depreciation expense also contributed to adjusted EPS growth this quarter. That mainly reflects a lower fixed asset base and an asset mix at slightly lower rates.  So we're definitely starting to see the benefits in our results of maintaining our capital intensity at or below 16%.  And with that, we now expect full year depreciation and amortization to be slightly lower on a year-over-year basis with our adjusted EPS guidance range again sufficiently broad to take that into consideration.</p>
          <p>Net interest expense was lower year-over-year in line with our expectation due to the repayment of $2.1 billion of debt in 2009 and a more favorable cost of debt after having accessed the capital markets on good terms last June when we early redeemed our debt.  Our effective tax rate came in at 22% for the quarter; that's consistent with our guidance.  Given the uneven timing of tax recoveries, however, you should expect that this rate will vary from quarter-to-quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, the accretion from our share buyback program also provided upside to adjusted EPS this quarter.  As of today, the current NCIB program, which targets the repurchase of 500 million in BCE common shares, is approximately 50% completed.</p>
          <p>On Slide 17, you have the details of our free cash flow.  As I said at the outset a great start to the year with free cash flow essentially doubling year-over-year to 545 million.  This increase reflects the lower cash taxes paid due to tax savings on our $500 million special pension contribution and I'd say about half of that total cash tax savings of 135 million that we'll get in 2009 from this contribution was realized in the first quarter, and the balance will be recognized pretty much evenly over the remaining three quarters of the year in the form of lower tax installments.</p>
          <p>Our total CapEx was $51 million lower year-over-year and I discussed that. Working capital improvement has been a priority focus and we saw the benefits of that effort also contributing to higher cash flow this quarter.  The higher cash funding of the pension plan in the quarter reflects the final 2009 deficit funding installment.  Our defined benefit pension solvency deficit at the end of 2009 is estimated at approximately $1.3 billion on a market related value basis, a much improved position.  And with this smaller deficit we expect lower full year cash funding in 2010 in line with the guidance that we outlined in February.  And with interest rate likely heading upward, we would expect to see continued improvements in the solvency position of our pension plan.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $748 million and that balance increased by about another 115 million on April 1, with the cash receipts from the divestiture proceeds on SkyTerra.  So clearly a strong balance sheet positioned to support the continued execution of our strategies.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, good performance this quarter with all of our key financial indicators comfortably on track if not ahead of our targets.  We enjoyed a strong start to the year with improving wireline and wireless revenue trajectories, strong earnings and free cash flow performance, better wireless market share and tight cost control. By all measures I'd say our competitiveness has improved.  With that, we're reconfirming all of our full year financial guidance for 2010.  Looking ahead, we'll see how the next quarter unfolds, both from an economic and operational perspective, before we revisit our guidance targets.</p>
          <p>And with those observations I'll now turn it back to Thane and the operator to move to your questions.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Thanks, Siim.  So before we start, I just want to remind you again given our time constraints, please keep your questions short, to the point and limited to one, so we can get to as many people on the queue as possible.  So with that, Carolyn, can you give the call-in instructions?</p>

          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  The first question is from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, good morning. Good results.  On the wireless side, 42% here in the prepaid, that's pretty impressive.  Can you just talk through what you see in terms of the drivers of that around distribution, around advertising and to what extent was the Olympics just sort of a temporary benefit or is this something that you think you may be able to sustained going forward?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, yes on the postpaid side, we over the last few years, as people know, have been working in four areas: improving our distribution, which we did through The Source and through some disciplined execution there; rebranding; improving our products, products being the handsets; and the network with the new network and the improvements in service. We think those have driven us to be in a position to achieve our postpaid market share of not less than a third and that's what our target remains.  There's no doubt, there has to be some benefit to what we did during the Olympics, given we think the presence we had, the excellent execution on the technology side and the unique branding opportunity, given just how successful the games were in Canada, across the country.  So hard to measure that impact, so our strategy that we think we put -- that we know we put in place over the last few years we think puts us in a position to make sure that we achieve our goal this year of not less than a third market share.  And so, it's just going to have to now execute in the market to see how we do in the coming quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  The next question is from Peter MacDonald from GMP Securities.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Just a number of small questions on the cost side.  I think you said 51 million pension costs, does that equal the Olympic cost pretty much the same, and how does that break down between wireline and wireless?  The second one is, I think you'd seen &#x2013; I didn't really understand your connection between the pension cost savings or the benefit of $51 million in the quarter offsetting the litigation cost of 17 so maybe you can highlight that?  And then last you highlighted the pension trends, the positive pension trends on the deficit, is there a chance that you can see any of those benefits this year in your funding requirements or is that a next year?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  So let me start with clarifying the impact of the pension valuation adjustment. That was $51 million in the quarter, that's a one-time adjustment and what it does is reflects the surplus that wasn't previously recognized in our financials relating to one of our subsidiary companies.  What I referenced is that on &#x2013; there's three one-time items in the quarter.  There's that pension adjustments, there's year-over-year higher Olympic spending, which are more in the range of about 60, $63 million.  And then in addition, we were impacted by that one-time arbitration outcome, which was in the amount of $17 million.  So it's those three items that have impacted our EBITDA.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, with regard to the improving interest rate environment, we will not see a benefit from that either in our pension expense or our pension funding for 2010 because those assumptions are determined at the end of 2009.  But we would expect, as the interest rates improve and discount rates increase, to see the benefits of that in 2011 and beyond hopefully with a reduced --an increased valuation position in our pension plan and reduced funding going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  And is there ability to break down the Olympic spend between wireline and wireless?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's mostly in wireline, but we don't have &#x2013; we're not disclosing a breakdown of those costs between segments.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you.  The next question is from Philip Huang from UBS.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Thanks very much.  My question is on the wireline business, Western Canada is seeing sort of intensified competition.  My sense is that the environment in Central Canada currently is a bit more benign.  So my question is first, do you see the current competitive environment changing as you launch IPTV?  And secondly, I just wanted to get a sense of how comfortable you are with the pace of your current FTTN, FTTH upgrade plans and if competition were to intensify, would you consider accelerating your upgrade program?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Well competitive intensity, we would say, hasn't been any less than we've seen quarter-over-quarter.  Videotron is a very tough competitor in the local phone business, as people know, and so I think we've had to deal with that. I think what's making the difference for us in our territory is the dramatic improvement in our service to our customers and the Full Install, the Same Day Next Day repair, is helping to drive churn down. And the work that we've done on the branding side we think is really having an impact and helping the company.  So we haven't seen a reduction in intensity there at all.</p>
          <p>In terms of the acceleration of our broadband strategy, I mean we've talked about the decision to build Qu&#xE9;bec City out with full fibre now and that's ongoing because of our ability there with our aerial territory that we have.  We've completed now Toronto and Montreal with FTTN and we're in a position there with most of those two cities already in a position to have VDSL2, and at the end of the year, all of our FTTN footprint that we'll have built at that point will have VDSL2. And we had accelerated that build-out, as everyone knows, after the go private to get back on track.  So at the moment there isn't any announcement to speed things up other than to say that every new neighborhood, as we talked about on the call at the end of the year, every greenfield neighborhood is now being built with full fibre in both provinces and that starts in the second half of this year.  Hopefully, that's helpful.</p>

          <p>And just as a follow-on, do you expect, when you come out with IPTV do you expect the competitive landscape to become a little bit more competitive or at least internally are you guys planning for that to happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know we've been in the TV business, as you know, for years and competing in, I would say, the urban, suburban and rural markets, but certainly suburban markets more than urban, because where IPTV, we think, will add to our footprint for TV is in the core downtown.  And so, we would expect that, I think -- when you launch a new product competitive intensity always picks up.  So, we may see some of that.  Having said that, given how well we've done on TV the last two years we have seen competitive intensity the last six months from both Rogers and Videotron because of our success with TV.  So we'll just have to see.  We will enter the market with the strategy we followed, which is profitable subscriber growth and not with a strategy to create a price war, that's not the business we're in.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning guys.  The question is on the buyback, so you're roughly halfway through it as Siim indicated, strong liquidity position at the company, still some room on free cash flow not considerable. Is it at all a consideration at the company to expand the buyback, especially considering how much last year's buyback differentiated stock?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Greg.  I think it's still a little early in the year to assess renewing the buyback.  We're are going to continue to complete the balance of the existing $500 million program, see how the year unfolds.  Part of the cash that we have on the balance sheet, I think about 400 million, is to meet debt maturities -- one in April and one in June.  But we do acknowledge that &#x2013; October -- but we do acknowledge that cash flow is very strong.  The balance sheet is healthy.  So we'll continue to assess renewals of share buyback programs once the current one is completed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just as a quick follow-on, is it a function of the debt maturities, is that sort of the major issue that you're focusing on right now, and once that's done then buybacks become a consideration again? Is that how you think about it or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, here's how we think about it.  We raised $1 billion in the market last year and we did that principally with the view to refinancing some existing debts at favorable rates and that saved us about $25 million of interest expense on an annual basis.  So we're committed to using cash proceeds to pay off this remaining portion of that in the amount of $400 million.  Beyond that, when we look at our credit metrics and our balance sheet ratios we're comfortable with the credit profile of the organization and therefore, consistent with our capital market strategy, as we grow surplus cash flow we're going to principally look to return that to shareholders through increased share buybacks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  I wanted to ask a question actually on the dividend.  I know it's a board decision, can you talk to us about how often do you review your dividend distributions given that you're sitting at the low end of your distribution ratios right now and would there be any chance in reviewing those payout ratios given that your capital intensity is &#x2013; it's not increasing anymore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, thank you for the question.  We're not at this point reviewing the payout ratio that will stay where it is.  Where you are correct is, we're at the low end of that payout. And as the year unfolds, as a function of where we are in results, we every quarter at the board look at our payout ratio we've committed to the investment community and what our profitability is. And if we were to go below that payout ratio, that's a discussion we would have with the board.  And consistent with our behavior over the last year and a half has been when we do get below that payout ratio, we are determined to stay within it, given our commitment to our shareholders, through increases in the dividend and that will continue to be our strategy going forward.  And so we will look at it every quarter throughout this year relative to our performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-up on that, between the share buyback and the dividend, what is your inclination as to increasing -- just returning cash to shareholders, what is your preference at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The company strategy is a dividend growth strategy and through executing through growth and profitability and EBITDA and returning that within that payout ratio. And then excess cash over that that's available over that, once we've satisfied our credit metrics, we will then look at returning shareholder capital through buybacks.  But first and foremost is the dividend growth model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  The next question is from Glen Campbell from Bank of America.  Please go ahead.</p>
          <p>The next question is from Dvai Ghose from Genuity Capital Markets.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much, if I can follow-on on the free cash flow and dividend theme, Siim, your free cash flow guidance for this year is 2.1 billion but it's predicated on cash taxes of 200 million, which are unusually low.  I calculate that if you were paying full cash taxes of about 30% of pre-tax income, your fully tax free cash flow would be about 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion.  So my questions are, number one, are my calculations correct?  Number two, when if ever do you expect to pay full cap cash taxes?  And number three, what does it mean for the dividend, because the current dividend is about 1.3 billion, so if you're fully tax free, cash flow is 1.4 billion, 1.5 billion and you eventually have to pay full cash taxes, that may have implications?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I'll let Siim answer the cash tax question for sure, but remember one of the other things really impacting our cash flow as well, Dvai, is the significant pension payments in our free cash flow that we're currently making.  And as we mentioned, as there's a full expectation I think by the entire investment community at some point we'll see an increase in interest rates and that will have, obviously, a potentially significant impact on our cash function for the pension.  So there are some other sides to that, but on the cash taxes, out of my expertise and over to Siim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as I said, our effective tax rate is 22% and that reflects the fact that the minority pickup that is included in our results from Bell Aliant is not taxable.  As we've said on past calls, we're in a position where we continue to have both significant investment tax credits which are available for carry forward and to be utilized against our federal tax liabilities, and each year with the significant $2.5 billion of capital spending and a portion of our operating expenditures also qualifying for investment tax credits, we continue to build up new investment tax credits.</p>
          <p>And, therefore, as we look at the picture unfolding over the next couple of years, for 2010 our guidance is to have cash taxes in the range of what we paid last year, which is about $200 million.  And then there's potential for some escalation over the next few years.  But I think it's rather modest and something that we've always been able to implement some tax planning to try to minimize. And it will be our continued objective to try to keep cash taxes at a very manageable level, and we believe we can do that over the next two, three years.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations to your tax people, because most of your peers seem to be paying a lot more cash taxes even though you've been much more profitable historically, so you're obviously doing something right there.  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing too, Dvai, and the investors remember the payment we made on the pension -- that's the cash payments on the pension are part of the tax deductibility, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, our guys can help you with that, Dvai, so that difference is obviously a little different than the P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true.  And we are paying higher cash taxes -- higher pension contributions than our competitors, many of whom don't even have defined benefit plans.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Thanks very much.  Hopefully I can sneak in a clarification and a question.  Siim, you mentioned FX hedging benefits, can you clarify what amount that would have been in the first quarter?  And question probably more for George, on the video side in the competitive environment, you said there's big strength you're having in video adds, certainly the overall numbers we see are up, but we don't get a breakdown between retail and what's just your wholesale subs from TELUS, but your commentary suggests that even if we back out the TELUS subs, your retail video adds would be well up year-over-year, is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to disclose between the two.  We're happy with TELUS and what they're doing on the execution and we're happy with our retail results.  We look forward to adding the IPTV capability so we can increase our growth of TV over time.  So all pieces of the puzzle are working.  It is intensely competitive out there because of some of our TV results over the last year.  And I think what we're really pleased with obviously is the ability to see increased usage of our services driving increased revenue, but I'm not going to get into the split. It's not fair to TELUS and it's just something we're not going to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>On the hedging, from the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2010 our hedge rate on the U.S. dollar improved by about $0.08 on the dollar.  In the first quarter that equated to approximately a $10 million benefit to our EBITDA and on a full year basis, given that we've completed the balance of our hedging program, we would expect the benefit to be somewhere in the 40 to $50 million range.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Two part question on the wireless side, George, you mentioned you want -- you're targeting capturing your 33% share in the wireless business, but I would highlight is last quarter Q4 it was balanced between the four competitors and postpaid which is a primary focus for your company.  This quarter you outperformed your peers on that particular metric.  How do you view your growth strategy going forward, balancing growth versus profitability, given that you don't want to capture too much share, because you could incent a competitive response?  And as well, I'm very curious about the prepaid market, what exactly is happening there?  All three companies, the large national players, are losing prepaid customers. Certainly it's not the type of customer you want, but they are customers nonetheless.  I'm wondering what's driving that?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On the market share issue, we've had two quarters after many quarters of not achieving our one-third target.  So, it would be, I don't even think we deserve the right to think about what we would do to have -- one quarter at 42% doesn't set in place a permanent market share swing in the market.  So, we're just focused very aggressively to make sure we maintain that third. And quarters like this are great and, obviously, every quarter like this we can have, we want to have going forward.  But we recognize competitive dynamics make it tough to maintain that type of market share. And for those that have followed me in the wireless industry for 15 years know my view on profitable growth always trumps subscriber growth if you're getting your fair share. And our challenge before was we weren't getting our fair share, and we need to do that for our shareholders and we're now doing that.</p>
          <p>On the prepaid side, it's a good question.  I think a lot of, as we see it, we do see migration from prepaid to postpaid because of the smartphone capabilities, et cetera.  That sector just has a high churn rate for I think all three and we do look pretty carefully at the profitability of it. And we're convinced we make money in that segment, and it's a segment we need to be in.  But clearly we focus our marketing distribution dollars, our compensation dollars to channels to refocus more and more towards postpaid. And we've particularly done that with Virgin since we acquired it, where they have really revectored their entire business almost to a postpaid model with some prepaid as opposed to before it was a prepaid model with some postpaid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will it be fair to say that most of those losses are migrating up to postpaid or are they going elsewhere to new competitors perhaps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it's not upgrading into postpaid.  I think it's fair to say they're switching back and forth or they're short programs. People come in and out of that sector and it looks -- it's been consistent like that for a couple of years.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Question on IPTV and the rollout in the second half of this year.  I think one of the issues in launching IPTV is the potential for DTH subscribers migrating to IPTV and therefore BCE incurring an extra installation cost without an incremental revenue stream. Do you think that's a significant issue in the rollout of IPTV and how do you approach that -- that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good question and we don't think it's a significant issue, we think it's something we have to be conscious of.  When we look at our market share of Bell TV today in the suburbs versus urban or downtown cores, it's 4 to 5 times more in the suburbs than it is in the urban market.  And so although there is some overlap, we think it's pretty close to a hand-in-glove fit in terms of launching IPTV.  And so we're -- we'll have a little bit of  as, you're right some cannibalization back and forth, but quite frankly where we're investing IPTV is where quite -- our market share of Bell TV is the lowest.  And so we're pretty comfortable with that.  And secondly, we'll obviously incent our distribution channels in a way that their focus will be on converting cable TV subscribers, not Bell TV subscribers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much for fitting me in.  My question is on the new consumer legislation in Qu&#xE9;bec in July, the Bill C-60 which limits early termination fees.  Can you talk in a general way about how you see that changing the dynamics of the market, whether there's likely to be margin impact, a churn impact, and whether we might see a move towards regional pricing as a result?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Glen, it's a good question.  We think &#x2013; well, first of all in the wireless industry we do from time to time have regional pricing.  So all carriers have that capability. So that's one area where I think to your question, the answer would be I think you could see some regional pricing.  You could see some increased pricing for handsets in the Qu&#xE9;bec marketplace because as is contemplated in Bill 60, the amount of subsidy in the contracts or the amount of penalties in the contract if someone disconnects is linked very much to the amount of subsidy.  And sometimes, there's more than just subsidy in those handset reductions.  There can be compensation to distribution channels in that reduction in the handset price.  There can be install services depending on the technology, and there can be advertising dollars, co-op dollars in that handset price.  So, those things combined may have an impact in that market to see some price changing on the handset side. And we're obviously disappointed in the legislation, and we also view that this is a jurisdiction of the CRTC.  And so we'll be asking them some questions at CRTC on that as well.  Of course, the effect of this is on the industry as a whole in Qu&#xE9;bec -- to the wireless industry, not specifically just to Bell.  So, we'll all have to deal with this as it rolls out.</p>
