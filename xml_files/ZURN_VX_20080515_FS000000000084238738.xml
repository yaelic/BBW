          <p>Good morning. This is the chorus call conference operator. Welcome to the Zurich Financial Services results reporting for the three months to March 31st, 2008 analyst and media conference call.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. This call must not be recorded for publication or broadcast. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>At this time I'll turn the conference over to Mr. James Schiro. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us on Zurich's first quarter analyst presentation. As Dieter will shortly discuss in more detail, this has been yet another strong quarter for Zurich.</p>
          <p>Our net income is up 3%, our business operating profit is up 1% and our BOP ROE stands at 18.6%, well above our 16% target.</p>
          <p>In line with the current market conditions and the higher level of large losses in Q1, these results reflect the value of successfully executing on our strategy. And for that, I have to say I'm extremely pleased with our performance. But what really excites me is the confidence that this success is instilling in our people.</p>
          <p>When you travel around our businesses, you can see the confidence building, whether it's with long-time Zurich executives or with new members of the team from Russia, Turkey or China. Our people are seeing how the underwriting processes we have put in place are providing the right rigor to be selective in a more rate-driven market.</p>
          <p>They are internalizing how the cash we are generating through improved operating platforms, is fueling a focused growth strategy both organically and through acquisitions. And they are appreciating the differentiating benefits that are intense, risk and investment management processes generate.</p>
          <p>Apply these strengths across a portfolio of risks that grows larger and more diverse every quarter and our strategic vision becomes clear. It is a vision designed to position us for success in any market condition and is based on inherent strengths, not external factors. And we are executing.</p>
          <p>That is what I see in our business today, and that I believe what you're seeing reflected in the strong first quarter results.</p>
          <p>With that, I hand it off to Dieter, who'll provide a deeper review of the figures.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. I am pleased to say we have delivered a strong set of results, which are a demonstration of the resilience of our business. The diversified nature of the business and our strong risk management have allowed us to absorb the strength of the market and deliver consistent performance. The business operating profit was strong and contributed to by all operating segments.</p>
          <p>At a total level, we have a headline increase of 1%. The ongoing businesses were up 7%. Within other businesses are the operations in run-off, some of which are more prone to volatility due to financial markets as this has affected the other business lines. The 7% increase in ongoing business was due to the strength of the European currencies against the dollar. In local currency, operating profit from ongoing business was flat year-on-year, a very satisfying performance in current market conditions.</p>
          <p>Let me now take you through the detail by segment of our results, starting with the top line on page eight. Again, we are very pleased with the levels of growth achieved in the prevailing market conditions.</p>
          <p>Looking at general insurance. During the first quarter, Zurich has continued to execute the market strategy that was so successful for us in 2007. Despite a tough rating environment, particularly in the United States, we have grown our gross written premium by 2% in local currency. We have achieved this top line success through a dual focus on organic and inorganic growth, withstanding overall rate reductions of about 2%. While rates remain under pressure from our U.S. business, the signals from Europe are somewhat positive, showing either reduced rates of decline or even increasing rates.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we have increased our net earned premiums by over 4% in local currency as we continue to cede less business to reinsurers. Seizing opportunities to go organically means no less focus on our Zurich Way of doing things. We maintain our focus on underwriting discipline, our core profitable customer segments and overall customer retention strategy.</p>
          <p>We are willing to make difficult choices to maintain our bottom line. Benefits of organic growth in the quarter can be seen in Italy where we are now benefiting from a 10% growth in gross written premium through our expansion in the agency base during 2007 as well as repositioning of automotive book.</p>
          <p>This growth comes despite strong market competition and premium rate reductions. We continue to integrate the numerous acquisitions that we made during 2007 with particular benefits in Europe general insurance. Russia, Germany, Ireland, Spain and the U.K. all see the benefits of acquisitions made in 2007, which in total, contribute 1.5 percentage points of our overall premium growth. With these acquisitions, Europe general insurance gross working premium is ahead of 2007 year-on-year in local currency terms by 7%. Most countries are ahead of prior year despite flat premium rates on average across each line.</p>
          <p>Notably, the rate picture in the U.K. appears to have improved with flat rates on average during the first quarter largely supported by personal lines increases. Rate reductions remain in Italy and Ireland, but this is offset by increases in most of mainland Europe. More details of this can be seen on slide 23 in the appendix.</p>
          <p>In North America, commercial gross written premiums is flat despite rate reductions of 4%. With rate reductions still occurring across all lines of business, there appears to be a slowing in the rate of decline if you look at the market and our own experience.</p>
          <p>We are confident that whether rating conditions improve or not, the strategy of risk segmentation, account optimization and underwriting discipline will continue to protect the bottom line. Rate pressure on global corporate, particularly in the U.S. where rate reductions are approaching 10% is the main reason for gross written premium being 6% behind prior year. The premium rate picture is more positive in Europe where rate reductions were small at 3% overall with similar average reductions in both U.K.  and Continental Europe. Despite the high level of competition in the U.K., the rate of decline has slowed significantly. In property, for example, rates are down 4% year-to-date compared to 12% during 2007.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding this pressure, retention levels remain at 90% and new business is now up 25%, back to levels seen in 2006. This is mainly as we execute on our growth initiative in Europe.</p>
          <p>In international business, premium rates have risen by 1% with gross written premium growth of 3% in local currency. This result is driven by strong double-digit increases in South Africa and rate increases in Latin America. In contrast, rates have fallen in Australia to unsustainable levels at the same time as the worsening attritional claims experience. As we adjust for these changes in the market and maintain our technical standards, we are seeing quite large reductions in volume.</p>
          <p>In summary, we continue to remain disciplined in our approach to a market that is competitive and showing some signs of leveling up.</p>
          <p>Within global life, new business grew by 8% in local currency. This was largely from growth in emerging markets which continue to grow strongly and in Germany, which benefited from the recent pension increases. The growth of the emerging markets increased the share of global life APE from 22% in the first quarter last year to 23% in the first quarter this year. There are challenges to grow annual premium equivalent across the globe with the current interest rate environment, investment market volatility and the real estate slowdown. Additionally, this has a further impact on fee income generated from unit-linked products.</p>
          <p>Financial market conditions had the most effect in the U.K. and U.S. In the U.K., annual premium equivalent was down 7% in local currency. In a depressed market, this reductions in volume of single premium bonds sold only partly mitigated by increased sales of pension and protection products.</p>
          <p>A further factor affecting single premium bonds was uncertainty around the change in capital gains tax legislation. In the U.S., where weak economic conditions were challenging, APE was down 19%. However, gross written premium, policy fees and insurance deposits increased 5%. In Italy, Spain and our local Hong Kong operations, growth was affected by the timing of campaigns compared to prior year.</p>
          <p>Farmers Management Services remains on track with high growth in fees of 9%. This is in line with the continued good levels of underlying premium growth at the exchanges of 6% as a result of organic and inorganic growth initiatives such as integrating Bristol West.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to look at the general insurance segment in more detail on page 9. Within general insurance, business operating profit has increased by 5% to $1.2 billion. Overall, investment income for general insurance was up by over 4% in local currency, which, in the business operating profit result, more than offset the reduction in underwriting profit.</p>
          <p>The ongoing benefit of increased investment income is as a result of higher levels of invested assets generated from our strong operational cash flows. The 1.3 percentage point increase in the combined ratio was driven in part by the net expense ratio, which increased by 0.8 percentage points above prior year. This was largely the result of higher commissions occurring in both North America commercial and Europe general insurance.</p>
          <p>In North America commercial, the account makes a strategic shift to segments like the program business, which attract higher levels of commissions for lower combined ratio. In each line, there is a continued shift towards higher commission in most countries, particularly the U.K. due to the changes of business mix and higher broker commission. The benefit of the strategic movement to higher commission lines of business is the deliberate targeting of higher margin business, the benefits of which can be seen in the strong underlying loss ratio performance.</p>
          <p>A number of opportunities to improve our operational efficiency have been implemented over the last few months. In North America commercial, we have been able to reduce our headcounts by over 5% without impacting our market facing areas. In Ireland, we have implemented a three year plan to transform the operating model. This will enhance our customer facing operations and leads to a healthy reduction in our expense base. In Germany, the transformation of the business model is well on track to seeing a reduction in the expense ratio of 2 percentage points by 2010 from today's 22%. These new initiatives all demonstrate Zurich's determination to take all opportunities to improve efficiency and react to market conditions.</p>
          <p>Overall, non-commission related expenses are broadly flat. Increased expense efficiencies and a small reduction in premium taxes offsets the higher level of investments being made in growth and operational transformation initiatives which amounts to about $60 million, ahead of the level in the first quarter 2007.</p>
          <p>On a risk based return basis, which is a better profitability guide than combined ratio, general insurance continued to show good underlying strength. At the end of quarter one, the general insurance adjusted BOP return on equity before tax was 29.3%, well ahead of our 25% target.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a more detailed look at the loss ratio on the next slide -- page. Consistent with the last few quarters, we retain this analysis of the underlying loss ratio. This quarter we have improved the disclosure to give an underlying attritional loss ratio by removing large losses. This is in addition to major CATs and prior year developments that we normally would have adjusted for.</p>
          <p>On this basis, we are pleased to see no movement in the underlying loss ratio, but let me explain in more detail. The definition of catastrophe claims only includes very large market level events. By looking at large claims as well as the cost of catastrophe claims, we have seen an increase in cost of over $160 million compared to 2007. Quoting London market industry reports, the high incidents of single risk loss for a quarter are approaching record levels. Although our experience in the quarter indicates a similar profile, it is more modest than indicated across the industry. By business division, this increase in loss cost was largely driven by a high number of large claims in global Corporate. Europe general insurance, despite not suffering from a similar CAT event to Kyrill in 2008, experienced a more normal level of large claims compared to last year.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, CAT and large losses contributed 1.5 percentage points to the loss ratio compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the life business on slide 11. The 8% growth in new business in local currency was achieved while maintaining strong new business margins and maintaining growth in new business value and business operating profit. The life business is showing steady progress towards achieving its longer term new business value targets. New business value increased to $160 million, up from 146 million in the same period last year, an increase of 10% or 2% in local currency. Our new business margin benchmark of 20% has been exceeded once again at 22.2%. First quarter BOP is reported at $337 million, up from 317 million in Q1 '07, an increase of 6%, but a 2% decrease in local currency.</p>
          <p>Germany benefited from further efficiency gains. U.K. and Ireland earnings have been impacted by market volatility, leading to a reduced asset base, fees and accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs. Overall, the one-off items in the quarter largely balance off. The effect of reduced fees in the quarter was about $12 million. The ongoing effect will depend how markets develop.</p>
          <p>Global life remains committed to double-digit growth and has been developing an evolved strategy to grow our explorations to the next level following the well-executed business turnaround.</p>
          <p>On page 12, we can look at emerging market performance. The strong growth <mark type="inaudible" /> in emerging markets, which include Zurich International Solutions, the local business in Hong Kong and Latin America with sales growing by 19% overall while maintaining strong new business margins.</p>
          <p>The key contributors to growth: our focused development of distribution through bank partners and international broker networks operating in multiple jurisdictions. The business space in Hong Kong shows a decrease due to different timing of sales campaigns in 2007 and eight.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Farmers results on the next page. Looking first at the business operating profit at the bottom of the slide. It decreased by 9% to $300 million, driven by two factors. Firstly, investment income decreased by $19 million, largely as a result of higher dividends and cash transferred to the Group, reflecting our centralized approach to capital management.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the last year included a gain of $28 million on the sale of operating property, which was not repeated in 2008. Let me also explain how we have developed the reporting. The changes to the Farmers book due to the acquisition of Bristol West, but also the impending transfer of the small business book from North America commercial means that the old 12% gross, 6% net margin relationship is no longer a useful metric. We introduced a margin on gross earned premiums last quarter which demonstrate the profitability of the underlying insurance business to Farmers Management Services.</p>
          <p>You can see as overall fees and related expenses have both grown at 9%, the gross management result, which applies to margin, improved by 8%. The margin increased by 10 basis points to 7% and provides a direct view of the profitability to Farmers Management Services of the underlying insurance businesses in the exchanges. Much of this growth is -- in these three lines was driven by Bristol West.</p>
          <p>To sum up, this is a strong performance in all metrics. With that, let's move to the performance of the Farmers Exchanges on slide 14, the Farmers Exchanges, which we manage, but do now own, have continued their strong track record from 2006 and 7 and delivered 6% of premium growth in the first quarter 2008, 5 percentage points of which came from Bristol West.</p>
          <p>The Exchanges delivered the remaining 1% growth despite challenging and flat market conditions and therefore outperformed the industry once more. This growth was aided by a multitude of initiatives such as growing the tight agent sales force and making it more effective as well as renewed growth in the independent agency channel. The integration of Bristol West continues to run smoothly and according to plan. Bristol West premiums grew about 14% year-over-year, strongly ahead of non-standard competitors and it is this which resulted in 5% of the growth for the exchanges overall as I have already mentioned.</p>
          <p>After the first quarter 2008, 24 of the 29 tight agent states have been rolled out including large states such as California and Texas. And we expect to complete the roll out in the second quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to add that the Exchanges overall top line growth is profitable as the adjusted combined ratio at 92.5% shows. This is a higher ratio than in 2007 and was driven by more normal CAT losses and weather-related claims this year as well as increasing homeowners loss trends. More importantly, the Exchanges have continued to file rate increases since the beginning of 2007 in response to higher loss trends.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter 2008, the Exchanges took rate increases of 3.4% in the auto book and 5.4% in the homeowners book. Farmers plans to continue to file additional rate increases in 2008 as loss trends warrant.</p>
          <p>Going forward, the total market for U.S. personal lines is expected to take rate increases and the Exchanges target is to continue to outgrow the industry. Net surplus still grew by $30 million, despite lower equity market and the surplus ratio remains at a strong and solid level of above 40%. At this level, capital management at the Exchanges allows for the levels of targeted growth we described at the strategy day last year as well as the pending transfer of the small business portfolio from Zurich North America commercial which we announced in March.</p>
          <p>Turning now to look at the performance of our other businesses and corporate function segments on the next slide, number 15. As I mentioned earlier, some of the businesses here are affected by the impact of financial markets. This is particularly true for Zurich Capital Markets. Their trading investment result is part of the BOP and reduced by roughly $50 million in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In center in some of the businesses in one-off in the other line, profit are also reduced as a result of a lower level of one-off contracts. Farmers re-profit was down due to a reduction in the quota share as well as the effect of higher loss ratio in the exchanges. Corporate functions improvements are due to foreign currency gains, more headquarter expenses being allocated to the businesses. The foreign currency gains are partly matched by currency losses in other segments.</p>
          <p>Looking now briefly at the performance of our Group investments. Slide number 16. Net investment income increased by 5% in dollar terms, but is down 2% in local currency. This was largely driven by lower average invested assets, largely as a result of the transfer of the U.K. annuities of about $7 billion for Swiss Re last summer. Net capital gains through profit and loss were a positive $10 million, down 295 million, largely affected by challenging financial markets in the first quarter 2008. Within this number were impairments of 235 million and profits on equity hedges, but both of these were before policyholder allocation.</p>
          <p>Net capital gains to shareholders after policyholder allocation were 14 million, a respectable number in these markets. As a result, investment returns for P&amp;L are slightly down to 1.1% on a not annualized basis. Unrealized losses included in equity increased by $1.6 billion as available for sales equities fell. Interestingly, unrealized losses on debt securities were broadly flat as decreases in interest rates offsets the widening of credit spreads. This is a demonstration of the quality of our bond portfolio.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you of some key points of Zurich's disciplined investment approach and you find further details in the appendix.</p>
          <p>As emphasized, we continue to be very comfortable with the quality of our investments and our asset allocation. Our equity exposure is well controlled and amounts to 4.8%, taking into account our hedging programs, which protect about a third of our equity exposures.</p>
          <p>We continue to have confidence in the credit quality and future performance of our high quality debt portfolio, including our very small CDO and subprime exposures. Our bond portfolios continue to be of high quality, incurring only limited impairments of 11 base points or $144 million in the first quarter 2008, underlying both the quality of our portfolio and its diversification. Of these $144 million debt impairment, only 7 million were on U.S. mortgage-backed securities including a 1 million write-down on U.S. subprime.</p>
          <p>Our exposure to assets wrapped by monolines is about $1.3 billion, which increased by about 300 million since year end as we took advantage of attractive prices of U.S. municipal bonds. We consider the potential impact of losing wraps to be insignificant as the underlying credit quality of these debt securities is between A and AA on average. Our investment approach remains disciplined. We carefully exploit opportunities arising from current market conditions. For instance, we have increased our exposure to subordinated debt bonds and, as just mentioned, municipal bonds.</p>
          <p>With that, let me comment on the movement on shareholder equity on slide 17. Shareholders equity at $29.4 billion is up 1% on the restated 2007 year-end closing number. You can see the strong net income after-tax performance, which is driven not only by the operating earnings I have already described, but also by improving the shareholders' effective tax rate down 2.2 percentage points.</p>
          <p>This increase of $400 million is net of the first part of the 2008 share buyback program costing $319 million. The $769 million of adverse movement in unrealized investment losses represents 1.6 billion that I mentioned in the investment slide net off tax, policy holder and other allocations. As I said before, this is mostly on equity mark-to-market adjustments.</p>
          <p>In summary, looking at the main drivers of our results. Growth continues to be in line with our longer term strategic targets, although in some places impacted by the shorter term effects of economic conditions. Acquisitions in 2008 in Spain and Turkey will contribute to growth later in the year.</p>
          <p>The underwriting result in general insurance was strong in spite of the relatively high level of large claims losses in the quarter. Underlying loss experience excluding large losses and prior year development was stable with a more optimistic outlook on premium rates in a number of our markets.</p>
          <p>We will continue to take actions to manage our expense base as evidenced in the U.S. and in Ireland while maintaining necessary levels of investment in transforming the business.</p>
          <p>Investment and investment income remains strong in a difficult first quarter for the financial markets, demonstrating the discipline we have applied to investment management. The balance sheet strength continues to underpin our ability to take advantage of opportunities in the market. Our continuous work on business improvement through The Zurich Way gives us a developing benefit across all these drivers.</p>
          <p>Finally, we believe that this set of results reinforces not only the resilience of our balance sheet, but also that our determination to position the Group to find quality profitable growth in a challenging market is paying off.</p>
          <p>And we would now be happy to take any questions.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, this is the chorus call conference call operator. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Spencer Horgan of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you very much. Can I just ask three things? First is thank you very much for the disclosure you have given on slide ten and also slide 23. They are very useful. I just wonder if you could maybe give us some guidance about what you would expect normally as the large loss component to be within the loss ratio across the sort of average year?  Second question is I hear you talk about the commitment to growing the APE, the double-digit rate in local currencies. I am assuming that's probably not achievable this year given the current market conditions, or maybe you can help me if I'm wrong there.</p>
          <p>And then just thirdly, more generally, I guess we see quite a lot of banks looking to sell insurance operations at the moment. I wonder if you could give us your general thoughts on that? And then I guess more specifically, the highest profile examples probably in the U.K. where I think you have not mentioned the U.K. as being a particularly interesting strategic market historically for acquisitions. I wonder if you could just confirm that's still the case? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the large loss over the year just for comparison, I think what we have seen in large losses in the first quarter in global corporate is probably more what we have seen over almost the whole year in 2006 and seven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the life APE growth at the end of May, Mario Greco will take you through the life strategy. At this point in time, we are not making any adjustments to the guidance that we've given on life. As it relates to acquisitions, I think part of the discipline that we've instilled in our organization is to focus on metrics that drive the business. I think it's a plus that we're rumored in every single acquisition that comes along, whether it's Friends Provident to whatever other one you're talking about at that point in time. We don't comment on those rumors. We will look at opportunities that fit into our strategy and we will look and ensure that they achieve the hurdle rates that we've set out that allows us to deliver the kind of results that we've been delivering to date.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Three questions as well please. The first one is I just wonder if you could give us a sense of what you're seeing on the claims inflation. Dieter, I think you mentioned that you're seeing a very modest price increases going through. But how are you seeing claims inflation, at least how is that compared to what you were seeing a year ago? And sort of following on from that, how do you monitor inflation? Is there any sense you are seeing that claims inflation might be picking up?</p>
          <p>Second question is just on the Farmers margin, the 7%. I just wondered if you could give us a sense of how the change in the mix of business are having an impact on margins. Is it positive or negative? And the third question is just on the currency gearing. I was a bit surprised you didn't have a bigger currency gain in the quarter in dollars. Perhaps you can just give us a sense of what you see as the split of your capital by the three core currencies. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so, James, claims inflation is, what we see so far across our global portfolio, flat. We monitor it as part of our monthly KPI we have in all our claims organization; that is a standard process. So the margins at Farmers, yeah, we see a slight uplift in the margin going forward. But as you can see, we are shifting the business to higher fee percentages. And that will have a mid-term positive impact on the margin developments. And the currency impact, I think is on our near number roughly 60 million compared, I think it's more 90 million on a year-to-year comparison, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was thinking more on the balance sheet actually. I mean in terms of the amount of your capital which is invested in U.S. dollars effectively, just as a percentage of the total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the movement in the balance sheet, that's a movement into CTA, that is roughly 180, if I am not just fully mistaken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean it just looked like quite a small number given the sharp move in the dollar against the euro and against the Swiss franc.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but it's only the net surplus invested and there are also other movement in the currencies. It is not only the dollar. That is the net result of all currency movements.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. Okay. Let's take this off line. But then just on the claims inflation, you are essentially saying that there is no claims inflation, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, well, I am saying that there is no new development. It's the same claims inflation as last year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Just one quick question. Sorry, just following up on the inflationary impact. From what you, just to James's question, it seems a little backwards looking, I was interested in where you see that correlation with the macro environment and as we move into some pretty high inflationary numbers or increasing numbers on a lot of commodities et cetera, how that then reads across into your numbers and what you do as a sort of preemptive strike, if you like, on the pricing side of things. It would be just interesting to understand that sort of forward-looking process as well as the backwards.</p>
          <p>And sorry, I will add another one. I was just looking at the U.S. reserve developments over the last few quarters, the last couple of years. We've seen what seems to be a general -- this is broader market rather than new -- sort of turnaround where the reserve releases are shrinking again now. You guys don't seem to have started that process. I was just wondering whether there is any way you can or would be prepared to reconcile that difference between you and the broader market out there? Whether you are just sort of taking a more European approach to it or whether there is something else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That is absolutely correct. Well, first, we will take The Zurich Way approach, but that might be described as closer to the European approach. I think on the inflationary impact, if I just take the example Germany, you will see that that actually productivity and rises of salaries are below the consumer inflation. Because the consumer inflation is very much driven by oil price and fuel price developments, and that is not impacting our claims handling. That is much more driven by salary increases and things like that. So I think inflationary impact is as I have described before. On the U.S. reserves, we have not, on average, we had some movements between the accident years in the U.S., but we have not released reserves from the U.S. So the releases we are showing are mainly coming from our European businesses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had two questions please, both of them relating to slide ten. Like Spencer had asked in the opening question, I would like to get a better sense of what we should assume large claims should be normally. Dieter, you gave a response, but if you just put some numbers on that. What was the large claim load in Q1 for global corporate? And I guess the sense was we should have take that number and divide by four and that would give us what you might think would be the sort of underlying run rate for large losses. That will be the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we have really tried to increase the transparency and show the movements. I think we cannot go too far to explain to all our competitors what is our large loss loads in our pricing assumptions. That might be too much appreciated by other insurers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I can understand that. I am sure you must understand it's a necessary part of our forecast, how much to take the 7.3 out and replace it with what? I guess we'll be left on our own. But if there is any way you can think of helping us out on that, that will be appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you, Brian, what we could do is once you get the numbers from everybody else in the industry, we can comment on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is full between 2007 and 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thank you. And the second one is that it's really great that you haven't had a flat underlying loss ratio year-on-year. And I guess I don't understand the mechanics of how you can do that. You have prices falling by I think you said, Deiter, an average of 2%. I really appreciate the detail you provided on the back, and if you are roughly weighted together about a 2% price drop on average, The Zurich Way is designed to give a 2% benefit per year. But then you must have some claim inflation. Because I don't add it up to how a flat performance could be achieved, and I guess The Zurich Way is coming in better than expected or maybe I've got the mechanics wrong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there is certainly claims inflation, and the number we gave last year was depending on the market between 2.5 and 3.5%. What you have also to see is we are paying a little bit more of commission to get the business. That means we move the business to higher loss ratios, but paying a bit more commission for it. So if you take this into account, I think the whole picture works very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Hi. I would like to ask two things. Firstly, in terms of the increase in the expense ratio where you've seen it, I think it was still down slightly on a couple of quarters last year. Are you at the level where you're comfortable with these expense ratios? Where they've been going up because of commissions, or do you see sort of more of a shift there going forward? Will you make further investments basically in distribution that way?</p>
          <p>And my second question was with regards to some reserve strengthening that we saw last week in the AIG results. I think they imply specifically in their commercial lines setting aside I think about $400 million and they said most of that was relating to this dilution issue, this MTBE petrol exposure. Do you have reserves for those losses and how have you seen that progress over the first quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the quarter after my retirement, I'll be satisfied with the expense level. So that means we are continue to work on the expenses. And what we have announced in the U.S. and already to a large extent implemented is outside of our Zurich Way initiatives and is an additional measurement to move the expense ratio in the right directions. On the MTBE, we have reserves for it. We have not seen anything in our portfolio why we would move the reserves. So that is the only comment I can make on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And sorry, just to follow up on the expenses. I guess I was asking more as much about the U.K. and the commission structure there in commercial lines in Europe. Do you still see pressure on increasing commission as kind of distribution patterns change there or do you think these run rates are now systemic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is continued pressure from the brokers who of course also want to move the revenues up. But I think that the biggest movement in this ratio actually comes from a change in business mix and less from dynamic movement of the individual commission.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. I have two questions. One is on slide nine, why is the strong BOP improvement of group reinsurance? Why did that happen? And second question on slide number 17. Could you explain to me the accounting change you have made with regard to the shareholders equity? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The group reinsurance, that are the risks we retain internally. So it is a integral part of our four business divisions. And that is I think some reserve movements because we have also held reserves here for all the claims which we have the lead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question, we are moving in the other business, a process which started already some years ago more and more to fair value accounting on this run-off box. And we have unlocked financial and non-financial assumptions of run-off disability books at center and that created the positive restatement of our equity in 2007.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I just had a couple of questions. One is relating to the prior year development positive, that was mainly in Europe. Would it be fair to assume that it was also to a significant extent in Switzerland and possibly in head office because your Swiss combined ratio looks extremely low at 82%. And I wondered, therefore, if that was an issue like a sort of head office adjustment that you have taken in Switzerland or which is operationally elsewhere. And the second question was just on the buyback. The pace of it accelerated markedly in that you did as much in April as you did in March. So the question is does that indicate growing confidence of your ability comfortably to do the full year planned, I think 2 billion? Or is it simply the result of opportunities in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, thank you for the questions. The answer to your first question is no, the Swiss combined ratio, which we show, is purely is the Swiss business. That has nothing to do with the corporate center. Related to the question of the previous, the general group reinsurance, that contains reserves we held at the corporate center so to speak. Our Swiss business had an excellent quarter and also we have some additional net earned premium. So therefore, the combined ratio was fairly lower than the year before. On the share buyback, we are just aiming to spread it more or less equally over the year. So it is a very constant speed at which we are exercising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, if I could comment on this, when I first came here -- you and I had a discussion about this if I recall correctly. We no longer normalize reserves at the corporate center. So the reserves are booked at the business units only, not at the corporate center.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. William Hawkins, KBW. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. One quick one. I am sorry, I know you've had a couple of questions already, but the large claims, can you just tell us what the large claims were in the full year 2007 relative to the 263 that you took in the first quarter? And then secondly, Dieter, when you were talking about the Farmers Management Services, you said that the 12% gross, 6% net margin sort of fee charge no longer works because of Bristol West and the other small portfolio. And I wasn't quite sure what you meant by it longer works. Could you just clarify that comment please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because -- well, I think on this large loss number for the full year, we probably have to come back to you. I don't have it at hand at the moment. The Farmers question is easy to explain. The old line of business mix at Farmers generated a 12% service fee from the exchanges to the management company. And with the change in product mix to 12%, it's moving to a higher number and that is what I meant with that the old formula, that 12 to 6 is not working. So it is more moving now to a net 7% margin as I have explained, which is then the difference between the fee and the expenses, but it is not the old 12, 6 formula.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the economics haven't changed at all; it's just you are saying the 12 and 6 rule of thumb are no longer the right numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good morning. I have got two questions, if I may. Firstly, on the international business, looking at your numbers, we can see that the BOP return that you are generating has actually been gone down, is well below your hurdle rate. But at the same time, you have actually increased your exposures. Could you maybe explain in terms of the strategy behind these movements? And my second question relates to the life business, in particular the accelerated amortization of DAX. Could you provide us with some numbers in terms of how large that was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the international business was also hit by some larger losses, large also in relation to the size of portfolio. We had the interesting situation that too large to wineries in Australia burned down. Also, you would not say that wine is particularly fire exposed. That would be more for Scottish whiskey, I guess. On the deferred acquisitions costs, and -- that is mainly the U.K. and that is around $40 million of additional accelerated amortization. So that is a one-off and will not repeat in the next quarters, assuming that equity market is not falling further from March 31st level.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have three question actually. First of all, could you update us on the financial flexibility you have today, especially for doing some acquisitions and where you are in terms of solvency ratio? My second question is with regard to the life activity, which is very impressive in Germany on Q1. Could we have some explanation here in order for us to understand what is recurrent and what can be considered as exceptional? And my third question is with regard to the combined ratio of Farmers, which is now close to 100%. Even if you are not impacted at all by this combined ratio, technically speaking, what is -- where would you be ready to put it -- having in mind that you have a strategy of growth, which is successful but nevertheless is structured your growth in this company? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the Farmers combined ratio. Our strategic target is around 98% combined ratio for Farmers. That is what we said last year at the strategy day and we are not deviating from this strategy. There is a fairly active last quarter. It's not huge hurricanes, but quite a lot of mid-sized hails, snow storms, tornadoes, wildfire and also floods which is affecting in the first couple of months the U.S. personal lines business. I think we are actually doing quite well if I compare our CAT impact with announcement of some of our competitors for the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe you could give us the CAT impact in this combined ratio in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the line is very bad. Could you repeat your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe as a result of your comments, could you give us the net CAT impact on the first quarter of Farmers in terms of combined ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That I think we can certainly send it to you. I can't say this by heart because as we are not follow the details of the loss ratio at the same level as we do for the other businesses. I don't have this number at hand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I had three questions please. First one, on page 15 of our financial review, you show the operating cash flow, which improved from 2 billion in Q1 '07 to 3 billion. And I wondered why was that, because the operating -- the business operating profit and net profit are relatively flat. And second question is how much capital would you upstream from this ceding business or selling business in North America commercial to Farmers, and I wondered maybe you could give an indication whether this is going to be a continuing trend, whether there is going to more businesses brought by farmers and so you are going to get more capital out. And maybe you could give some indications on that.</p>
          <p>And then last one, which is a bit -- a small point is in that slide where you showed the underlying loss ratio, you showed a figure of 198 million for prior year development and elsewhere, I see a figure of 160 million. This is for 2007; that's what I am saying this is sort of a bit of a silly question, but maybe there is an easy answer to that. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Well I think the capital, the lease at Zurich North America will occur over time. That is not happening in one day because all the capital requirement formulas are averaging and therefore work only over time all through the reserve, which is always consuming quite a bit of the capital will also go down over the years. I have not understood your question on the prior year loss development, but maybe I'm first answering your question on the cash flows.</p>
          <p>We have a billion more positive cash flow on GI and then the other impact is coming from the investment activity in the life portfolio. So I think as always, I have to make the warning that this cash flow statement is an IFRS requirement, but I think it is still very difficult to read it in the insurance company context.</p>

          <p>Good morning. First of all, thank you for publishing the figure as early in the morning. It supports a lot the analyst, so thank you first of all. Second, two questions. First of all, in terms of general insurance, the gross return premium in Switzerland went up pretty substantially some 22% but also for the rest of the operation. My question is how relevant was in this development the Zurich Connect initiative and how much is direct in terms of growth? And the second one, is I know that you don't comment rumor and sorry for bothering or insisting on this, but what exactly are your hurdle rates for deals as I am a little bit puzzled for the multiple that I'm seeing for the two RBS operations.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, first, let me comment on Zurich Switzerland. We have actually transferred some portfolios to the responsibility of the Swiss management. And as our country numbers are always reflecting the management view, therefore, I think there is a one-time increase of 22% which is then for Europe general insurance in total not this significant.</p>
          <p>Zurich Connect is growing nicely. I think we can certainly match what other direct start ups are announcing about early successes. But in premium volume for this large European book, it is still not making a huge difference.</p>
          <p>And on the hurdle rates for any acquisitions, we use for all acquisitions pretty much the same hurdle rates, of course adjusting to specific country risk if you go to Latin American countries or Asian markets, so. And that has to reflect that we still make our overall Group hurdle of 16%, which is a unchanged target for the Zurich Group for the next years.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Since there does not appear to be any more questions, I think we can perhaps bring this to a close. And as Dieter made clear in his presentation and through the questions, I think you can see that our strategy and the execution of our strategy is holding up well in the face of these challenging times.</p>
          <p>But the strategy also positions us well when the markets and pricing turns. By continuously improving our operating platforms, we are poised to capture the maximum advantage of the inevitable upturn in rates. And by focusing on customer, product and distribution strategies, we are honing our ability to grow and expanding our presence in tomorrow's most promising markets. And by maintaining a deep commitment to risk management, we are nurturing a strong and healthy balance sheet that will allow us to take advantage of any value adding opportunities that might arise.</p>
          <p>Already that approach has allowed us to acquire new operations in Russia, Turkey and Spain where integrating plans are on pace. We also continue to expand our operations in Greater China, extending our distribution platform to Shanghai and announcing a new branch in Singapore.</p>
          <p>And we are finalizing plans to deepen our focus in the Middle East and other emerging markets and we will be making announcements in this area soon. Together, these efforts underpin the value of a diverse mix of businesses that increasingly leverages emerging market and capital light activities, mitigating against volatility and maximizing shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Further, in that regard, Mario Greco and his life team will be hosting an Investor Day on the expanded global life strategy on May 23rd and I hope you will participate. I am confident you will see why we are so excited about the next phase in our life business and how its value to the Group will only continue to grow.</p>
          <p>I also want to thank our people for making these results possible. We asked a lot of them and they have met every challenge. That is why we continue to invest in them and why in the end this really is a people business. And finally, I would like to extend our thoughts to the victims of the disasters in China and Burma as well as the tornadoes in the U.S. Whether insured or not, these events remind us of the power of nature and the need for any society to be prepared to manage risk. Thank you again for participating.</p>
