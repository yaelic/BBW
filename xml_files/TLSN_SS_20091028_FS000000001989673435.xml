          <p>Okay, welcome everyone to our presentation for the third quarter of 2009. My name is Andreas Ekstr&#xF6;m, Head of Investor Relations. With me today I have our President and CEO, Mr. Lars Nyberg and our CFO, Mr. Per-Arne Blomquist. We will follow the format that you are used to. We will start with Lars that will give us a brief introduction to the quarter. Then Per-Arne will go through the financials. We will then open up for a Q&amp;A session both from the floor and also from the telephone conference. With that I think without further delay leave it a word to Lars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andreas. And good morning and very welcome. TeliaSonera's performance is strong. This quarter, the third in a row of strong quarters, we delivered the highest EBITDA in the company's history and that is despite a very tough economic environment, of course. Due to a healthy mix of mature and emerging markets, we've been able to keep revenues in local currencies intact and at the same time improve profitability. I see this as quite an achievement given the fact that telecom sector is not immune to lower revenues in an economic activity, it's pressured by regulatory intervention as well as lower roaming revenues related to less business travel.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA grew by 9% and the EBITDA margin improved to 36.1 in the quarter. Operating income improved by 3%, despite notably lower income from associated companies. The drop in income from associated companies is the result of currency fluctuation and a lower contribution from Turkcell due to one-off items.</p>
          <p>Cash flow improved by as much as 62%. The improvement in profitability and cash flow is driven by actions that we sort of control ourselves, namely successful efficiency improvements, cost reductions, and careful capital spending. And we continue to scrutinize ways to preserve strong cash flow generations.</p>
          <p>Sweden continues to be a strong performer within Mobility Service and the strong trend for mobile data and mobile broadband continued. It's also encouraging to see that our customers rate our performance in both mobile and fixed telephony and broadband as best-in-class in the Swedish market according to the recent published EPSI survey. The situation in the Baltic countries remained challenging and the economic recession continued to cause substantial sales declines in local currency. It's still too early to talk about any green shoots in the economy.</p>
          <p>The economic downturn has so far had limited impact on our Mobility Services and just as in Mobility &#x2013; had limited impact on our Broadband Services and just as in Mobility, we are doing very well in Sweden, as you could see, actually also in Finland.</p>
          <p>There is a strong demand for bundled services including IPTV, voice over IP. Sales of IP-based services increased by 18% in reported currency and now represent about 35% of our total revenues in Broadband Services. The price increase on fixed telephony that we introduced in the Swedish market in the first quarter to offset volume declines had a positive effect on revenues in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We direct more and more of our investments to fiber, as we are confident that the demand for bandwidth is unlimited and we also believe that fixed access is superior in delivering high quality services to fixed locations with many people like homes and offices.</p>
          <p>Business area, Eurasia showed good growth in terms of volumes and traffic minutes grew by more than 50% compared to last year. The economic downturn has not had any major effect on usage, although customers are I think a little bit more price-sensitive today than before.</p>
          <p>Profitability in Eurasia improved from already high levels, despite decreasing average price per minute in all markets. I believe Eurasia will continue to be our growth engine with high margins for many years to come.</p>
          <p>For two years, we have worked hard to improve our efficiency and reduce cost in order to safeguard our long-term profitability. This is now the third consecutive quarter. We have proven that we are capable of delivering real cost reductions, instead of continuous annual cost increases that we have experienced in the past.</p>
          <p>For the group as a whole, we reduced operating expense by more than 4% from the first nine months and close to 5% in the third quarter. Broadband has done a great job in reducing cost and delivering restored margins that I think we all can be pleased with, well above 35%. It is also encouraging that we are beginning to see effects of efficiency improvements in the Mobility Services in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Eurasia continues to grow, costs are under control, and the margin improved in the quarter. We have a strategy to increase TeliaSonera's effective ownership in our core holdings. In October, we launched two public cash offers for the outstanding shares in Eesti Telekom and in TEO, Eesti Telekom in Estonia, of course and TEO in Lithuania.</p>
          <p>The offer for Eesti Telekom was met with very high level of acceptance. The Government of Estonia agreed to sell their stake and so did most of the other shareholders. Thus, our effective ownership is now above 98%. Therefore, we have decided to initiate a squeeze-out process to take full control of the company.</p>
          <p>The offer for TEO was not as successful, but still we managed to increase our ownership to above two-thirds, which gives us more control. We will continue to look for other opportunities to</p>
          <p>increase our ownership to above two-thirds which gives us more control. We will continue to look for other opportunities to increase our ownership in core holdings in addition to making complementary acquisitions within our current footprint and selectively looking at new markets to enter in Eurasia.</p>
          <p>To summarize, this is the best quarter in TeliaSonera's history despite the very challenging economic environment. Top-line is flat in local currencies, costs are down and our EBITDA margin and EPS are both up.</p>
          <p>Now, I leave it to Per-Arne to go through some more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Lars. Lars has already mentioned some of the effects that we have seen on the result this quarter and I'd just like to highlight some of these. First of all, we talk about our top-line growth of 5% which actually is the underlying zero <mark type="inaudible" /> if you look at also other operators when you compare for their performance.</p>
          <p>I strongly believe that zero growth in our markets today is a very strong performance compared to what others are doing. And I also believe that our EBITDA also taking into account that we have the currency effects with a plus to 4% it's a very strong performance also in the environment &#x2013; in this environment. We've mentioned EPS, we've not yet mentioned the net debt, the EBITDA multiple, I will come back to that later on, but we have a solid base right now when it comes to our balance sheet. And I think that we have good market also too, if we like to refund ourselves going forward.</p>
          <p>And there is a lot of questions about our cost side. And I think that it's worth mentioning here that when we look at our cost today, we are not just trying to make some kind of a quick fix. We try to attack the structural costs in our company. And as you could see here when I showed this picture the first time on our Capital Markets Day.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we are down close to 5% quarter-on-quarter, 3% is personnel cost; we have the 7% on marketing, 3% on IT. Yes we're still marketing ourselves. Yes, we still continue to work with different IT projects, but we are much more strict on the prioritization today. So for us this is a question of actually attacking the structural cost but not just to make some kind of quick fix.</p>
          <p>If you take Finland, where we have in this quarter decreased with close to 8%, you could see the same pattern. Here we have 5% down on the personnel cost, we are 14% down on marketing, and 18% down on IT. We have discussed this very much was to do with how we start to market ourselves in the Swedish area. If you look at the press, if you look on tele you will see us pretty frequently on the way with the budget that we have today so, I'm not so worried about that, but I think once again the focus is here in a different way than we have done this before. And I mentioned this also before that myself and also our CIO, &#xC5;ke S&#xF6;dermark spend quite a lot of time right now to scrutinize different IT projects. Yes, we still invest, we still do things, but we do it in a more cautious way.</p>
          <p>If we then move into the different business areas, and we start with Mobility, I would say that we have three different areas we have Sweden, we have other Nordics, and we have the Baltics. And here we could see, say three different patterns. If we start with Sweden, I think they have done a very good job when it comes to growth. They are up with 5% &#x2013; close to 5% year-on-year. They have a gross margin of more than 40%, 41.5. We have added on more than 90,000 customers in the quarter and half of this is the postpaid subscribers and half of this is mobile broadband subscribers.</p>
          <p>If we then look at other KPIs and also like our per minute of use, you can say we are very much unchanged compared to last year. Very strong in Sweden which helps them, Mobility, as such to come back to a margin of more than 31% which is the same as it was last year. So they have sort of regained now their margin.</p>
          <p>If we then take the other Nordic countries, you could say that we still see the same pattern as before. We have a downturn of roughly 5 to 10% when it comes to revenue. This is, however, mainly driven by regulatory effects and also loss of the service provider contract in Norway. We have been able to increase and defend margins given that we have spent quite a lot of time now on the cost saving side. So from a margin perspective we are doing pretty well even though these markets are tough. We have also been, I would say, rather cautious also in these countries with the CapEx very much selective, we still invest, but we are doing that much more selective today.</p>
          <p>The third block that I talk about is the Baltic countries which, of course, has the tough time right now. It's still somewhat more than 20% down compared to last year, and I think we have difficulties in seeing that something will change that pattern dramatic right now. As to all figures coming out in Lithuania, the other day where we have a GDP decline of 14, 15%. And this means that we haven't not yet seen some kind of turnaround in the economy, so we should be very cautious here in our way to mitigate this risk or actually to work with the costs and also with different price levels. But still the Baltic countries as you could see here has been good in protecting the margins and they are more or less on the same level now as they were a year ago.</p>
          <p>Broadband Services, very strong volume, 35.3% compared to 32 last year. It should be a strong margin in the third quarter. I don't think you could trend the 35.3 out for the rest of the year, remember that the third quarter should be strong, but behind this we have a couple of factors. Despite the fact that they are losing 2.5% on top-line, they are saving more than close to 15% on OpEx, but we have also seen some positive effects from the price increases that we announced in the first quarter this year. We talked about this on the Capital Markets Day that on an annual basis this will have an impact to roughly 250 to 300 million and you could start to see that now happening in these figures.</p>
          <p>We are also working very hard on the CapEx side here, which also gives us a very good cash flow compared to last year and also compared to overall level. I got a question before we entered this meeting and I hear this also pretty frequently and that's the reason why I come back to this topic what are we actually doing and on the cost side, is it sustainable, is it just the one-off? No, once again it's not. We are sort of attacking the cost structure and we try to work at all different parts that you can work with within a company. Everything from renegotiating subcontractors' agreement to taking down the number employees to look at IT costs included consultants.</p>
          <p>If you look at some of the consultants company, they will actually confirm that we are using less consultants today than we did yesterday &#x2013; one year ago. More focus marketing, less traveling and we are actually using our own products given that we are communication companies. And one product which is very good is the TelePresence that yourself should use from time to time and we are using that very frequently and you could communicate with the colleagues even though you are not there physically. So I think these are the factors behind that we are saving money right now. There are no quick fixes, but it's a very thorough work throughout the organization.</p>
          <p>Eurasia, Lars mentioned that before, strong traffic growth, strong margins. Behind the curtains you could say we have sort of different structure today than we had a year ago. Uzbekistan, Tajikistan growing dramatically; 140% in Uzbekistan, 45% in Tajikistan. Kazakhstan is still growing, but to a very more limited extent. However, they protect the margin and they are also improved the margin in this quarter even though they had lower growth for the time being. Azerbaijan is down and this is affected by lower interconnection prices and also price reductions in yield. But overall, this is our growth and in and, as you can see here, we're also producing quite good cash flows.</p>
          <p>CapEx-to-sales, 11.4%. We still reiterate our outlook for this year 13 to 14%. This is very much depending on the tender process that we have in Finland and Demark when it comes to 4G licenses and that will sort of decide upon how high or low we will come. Cash flow, we have mentioned before as you can see on a group level coming up on a steady basis and we are well above 20 billion. Right now, we are talking about the EBITDA and CapEx.</p>
          <p>Some words about our income tax. I got this question after the Capital Markets Day, and the question was why we have so big difference between paid taxes and also reported taxes. The major reason for this is that we have had tax depreciations after a deal we made with Skanova Access. We took it out from our parent company. And this has affected our taxes during 2008 and 2009. They will disappear. So from 2010 and onwards, we will have &#x2013; be much tighter on paid taxes as reported. So this difference will disappear the coming years.</p>
          <p>Finally then on my refinancible position. I mentioned that we have a solid financial position today, debt multiple is 1.3 compared to EBITDA. Also interesting to look at the interest rate cost and average interest rate that we have today, starting this year we had roughly 4.9% in average interest rate, today we are down to 3%. The markets are very favorable for those who would like to raise money in the market and that has especially happened after April, May this year. And we are looking of course to fund ourselves going forward.</p>
          <p>If you look at the buckets here, we now start to look at 2016, '18 and '19. And if you would like to go out in the market, you could really find cheap money for long-term periods and we might do so going forward. We will see what is happening right now, but it is an opportunity for those who had possibility to go out in the market right now who found themselves very cheaply for a long-term basis.</p>
          <p>We have our key ratios. Return on equity 17%, and the net debt equity ratio over 35.9, which is lower than the start of this year, keeping up the return on the equity more or less at the same level as we had at the beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>Finally, outlook. Net sales in line or slightly below the level of 2008, not changed. We haven't changed at all in this outlook for this quarter. Addressable cost below last year; EBITDA margin above the margin level of last year; CapEx-to-sales ratio, 13 to 14%; and the number of employees, somewhat below 30,000. We are today at 30,131. So we would be below that figure.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Per-Arne. I will also ask Lars to come back and we will open up for some Q&amp;A session. We will start with a few questions on the floor and then we will leave it to the conference call, but we start with Sven Sk&#xF6;ld.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. Sven Sk&#xF6;ld from Swedbank. First on the Swedish fixed line business, can you sort out the improvements in Q3 compared to Q2 and also compared to last year, how much is cost, how much is the rates, fixed line rental fee, et cetera, just some extra info there, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To give you a color on it, I think the cost reduction compared to last year is the main driver of the improved profitability. Clearly, the raised price has helped us somewhat, but the main driver is the cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are selling close to 150 to 300 million on an annual basis, so that's the minor cost; the major driver is the cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And second question about MegaFon in Russia, I mean we have all seen Telenor solution here with Alfa, what's your comment regarding your holding in MegaFon? Is that the solution that you would like to see for TeliaSonera as well or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't want to speculate in public what I want to see as a solution. I said many times I spend quite some time talking to our partners or co-owners and this Telenor Alfa was an interesting solution although we need to understand that they were &#x2013; they are two partners we have. In MegaFon, we have three partners. So it's a little bit more complicated.</p>
          <p>I think we have a constructive dialogue and intensive dialogue and it's a good thing. And hopefully we will see things in the same way, I've said all along that if you can't get consolidation of MegaFon, at least we want liquidity and control. I think we have a degree of control. We have a number of seats on the board. We have the chairman, but also like to see some liquidity. And we've also said we don't want to see a one time dividend; we want to see a dividend policy. And yes, I think maybe this economic environment will make it more interesting for everybody to agree to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We take another question from the floor, Stefan Pettersson [Nordea] in the front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello; Stefan Pettersson, Nordea. Two questions, if we start with the EBITDA margin development in Broadband Sweden, fantastic margin, 41%, never seen it before; I don't remember when Lars, when you said that long-term that you were aiming close to 30% for the broadband margin in Sweden and now we are pointing somewhere towards 35% for the full year 2009. Can you comment anything on how you see the margin development long-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's an interesting question. It has to do with what kind of service are we going to provide through the fixed net. And those of you who joined us on the Capital Markets Day heard us say that we strongly believe in the fixed net as the carrier of telecom services to fixed points, being homes and offices.</p>
          <p>The question then is what sort of services, because on some services we make much higher margin than on other services. So I wouldn't like to make a prediction. Clearly, 30% is an interesting margin, 35 is better, 41 is sort of I think this is the third quarter, let's be honest. But I have some real trust in that this fixed business will be a very interesting business for our company, for many years to come because of this appetite for bandwidth being unlimited and the fixed technology is the best way to provide that to the fixed locations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I interpret that that you're not satisfying with 30% long-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean when you deliver when <mark type="inaudible" /> delivers 41 in the quarter and sort of you talk about 35, yeah, the appetite from my side increases, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question is more of a clarification, last quarter you delivered 8.6% organic growth in Eurasia now down to, I believe, it was 3.8%, but the main deviation at least to my numbers is Azerbaijan and here you talk about the interconnect, how much did the interconnect affect the absolute numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know what we have revealed, but I will say that this is a big, really big part of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have two countries that grew less this quarter than historically have done, it's Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. I don't think this is a trend. I think it's sort of a quarter. I think they'll come back. That's why I made a point in my short introduction that I am convinced that Eurasia will continue to be the growth engine of TeliaSonera maintaining high margins for many, many years to come. And of course, I wouldn't say that if I believe that the growth in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan will be over. It's not over at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We take one more question from the floor before leaving to the conference call and we take Michael at the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael Andersson, Evli Bank. Regarding the Q4 versus Q3 seasonality which you have mentioned now, could we perhaps expect that the margin drop or the margin difference to be a little bit less in looking on the back of your cost-cutting, but also maybe lower roaming revenues this year? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>Also another Q4 question, CapEx, since you still keep your guidance for CapEx for the full year, looks like there will be quite a substantial increase, I guess, in whole numbers for Q4. That's the second part, and also since you have such a good growth in mobile broadband. And the last question, it's more a question I would put to a cyclical engineering company, let's say, we have 10% growth next year, how much will you have to add to your cost base then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's start with the margin, of course, I mean you can't repeat the same margin in Q4 as in Q3. I mean we have the seasonal effects as we have always have had. So I think you should not expect that. But still I mean our aim is to have a more sort of even distribution of all the margin, all the time and to take down the volatility. And if we do something now in Q3 it's more sort of for obvious reasons that we have take decision to do some activity. But do not expect to have the same margin development in Q4 as we had in Q3.</p>
          <p>The next question was about...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx, yes. As I said here, it's very much depending on, first of all, if we have the auctions coming up in...</p>

          <p>Finland and Denmark, of course. And then also we have said that we will back end load the investments and we will go continue to invest in certain countries.

          <p>I'll take the third one. Assume you mean if the revenue would grow 10%, right. I think that the impressive thing is that we are able to have an historically highest EBITDA this quarter without growth. And our industry, our business benefits from growth, because I think we can grow this &#x2013; if we can grow the top line 10%, we so not need to grow the OpEx 10%. There are some acquisition costs around and inevitable. But we don't need to add a lot of cost in many other areas. So I'm really looking forward to the day when this market starts really growing and we can deliver 5, 6, 7% growth, because that will have an enormous impact on our EBITDA, I believe.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen. First question, you've emphasized the fixed business as regards how important broadband connections are, long-term. As I look at your trends, it still seems that access line loss is getting worse, it seems that DSL has stagnated. I just wonder if you could elaborate on how you see it developing going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well &#x2013; this is Lars Nyberg. I talk of course longer term of the fixed network using fiber technology and not copper technology. And this is a very interesting discussion that we have, like many other operators have.</p>
          <p>If you want to have 100 megabit per second or a gigabit per second of kind of bandwidth, you don't have much of an alternative if you come to my opinion, you have to go with fiber. You can go theoretically with mobile, but economically I think it's not acceptable.</p>
          <p>So I think over the coming years, we will some increased investments from our side in fiber. We're not really ready exactly to describe how, but it will be very selective, and we'll deal with that step-by-step. And that's &#x2013; this is based on our conviction that this technology is the most efficient way to provide telecommunication services to these fixed locations.</p>
          <p>And as that starts, I think we will see reduced losses of customers in fixed, because historically the fixed customers are basically voice customers. But as you transform into broadband customers, IPTV customers, I think we'll see a slowdown on the decline &#x2013; of the losses of the subscribers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Mr. Andrew Lee from Citi. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Lars, you're very clear on your appetite for Swedish broadband margins on a longer term basis. I wondered if I could just ask the same question on Finnish fixed. A very strong performance there this quarter. And could we get to a 35% margin in Finnish broadband on a two, three year time horizon? And secondly, on Swedish mobile composition, how significant a risk do you see from a more aggressive Tele2 in the consumer segment, and Telenor in the smaller business segment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last one, the second question. We have been gaining market share in the Swedish mobile I think for at least the three quarters of this year, which I'm very proud of and the people who accomplished that should be also very proud. Yes, of course, this is a very competitive industry. And I also saw the statement of one of our competitors saying they would focus more on the Swedish market, okay. As Life just continued to get the best score in the EPSI survey, being the world class customer services company, have good quality in your networks, those are the determining factors, who is going to win that battle. And we have that battle everyday, so I am not particularly nervous or surprised. It's just part of our daily business. The first question was...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Finnish fixed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We haven't &#x2013; on all the Capital Markets Day we said that when it comes to broadband, we will invest differently in different markets. And since the Capital Markets Day we have spent more time talking about this in view of the kind of investments that we are talking about. And clearly Sweden and Finland I think are the two countries where it's most obvious that we have a great opportunity and some other markets, I think we have lesser opportunity and we'll therefore prioritize probably Sweden and Finland. But I want to underline we are not ready totally with a plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think it's also too early to state whether it should be 30, 32, or 35.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have delivered now three quarters and I think important for us is to stabilize this, make sure that we have control over the cost and then it will depend on our product mix, what we sell and also what kind of activities we will go for going forward. So I think it's too early to try to fix a certain EBITDA margin right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andrew. We take one more question from the conference call before going back to the floor. Operator, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Mr. Damien Maltarp from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. Just a couple of questions, just on Kazakhstan, can you maybe just go into bit more detail in terms of the revenue trends, in Q2 we saw quite a strong acceleration in revenue growth than in Q3, that's obviously decelerated quite rapidly. Could you maybe just give us a bit more insight to what's happening in terms of tariff changes, consumer usage and behavior? And secondly on Kazakhstan, there have been some press reports suggesting that you might be interested in taking a stake in Kazakhtelecom. Can you just comment on whether you would see that as a sensible move or what the rationale behind that? That would be, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the last question. We have stated and I actually stated here 30 minutes ago, we have as a policy that we would like to increase our ownership in companies where we are active. The company in Kazakhstan is called Kcell and we own 51% of Kcell. And if possible, for the right price, I would be interesting to own more. So I don't know where the rumors are coming from, but that's the background, I suppose, to the rumors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It was...what I read was more taking a stake in Kazakhtelecom, I believe as you are partnering Kcell, I think you prefer direct stake rather than indirect stake in Kcell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I prefer to increase my ownership in Kcell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the question about Kazakhstan and perhaps you could elaborate more about it, Andreas. But at the end we have had less of a marketing activities in the Q3 and then I think that's the basic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're right about that, Per-Arne. Some quarters you need to consolidate your position and as you can see, Damien, we have slightly less customer intake this quarter. Now we don't disclose the EBITDA margin by country, but I can tell you that the EBITDA margin in Kazakhstan improved compared to last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can I just have a quick follow-on just on MegaFon, can you remind us whether you have a right of first refusal, if one of your partners decides to sell out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's a very complicated answer, because the ownership structure is very complicated. And I can't from the top of my head explain why we have the first right of refusal and why we don't have, but we can find out and you can &#x2013; if it's public we'll tell you later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's go back to the floor. We have a question from Jan Dworsky [Handelsbanken Capital Markets] here on the front room.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jan Dworsky from Handelsbanken. On the Swedish mobile business, you more or less maintained the same growth in Q3 despite the NTR cut, how much &#x2013; what was the impact of the NTR cut on the Swedish mobile business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I cannot say that our Capital Markets Day if the effect from that during the second half is kr 200 million. So in this quarter it should be 100 million then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And detail on the cost split in Sweden and Finland, the NPA costs are down about 10% year-on-year in Q1 and 5% in Q2 despite people leaving the business. What explains that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you also have an impact of the holiday season. You will have an effect on the personnel cost front for holiday payments. I think that's the difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was there more of a holiday this year than last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously. But also that we have fewer employees this year than we had last year. So the holiday payment goes down, which impacts the year-over-year comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just to clarify on CapEx, in the CapEx forecast you include the potential payments for licenses in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if there are no license payments in Denmark and Finland, will you still be within the range then or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll be then in the lower part of the range rather than the upper part.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Andreas at Enskilda.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Andreas Joelsson, SEB Enskilda. IP service is obviously growing quite well in the quarter. Can you elaborate a little bit about the penetration on your existing client base on IP services and what we could expect going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think as I said, of the total Broadband Service revenues now, 35% is coming from IP services. And this whole cost savings program that we talked about that we try to explain is sustainable, the driver actually is to move Broadband Services over to IP technology as fast as possible. Now it will take a long time before the last circuit-switch is closed. But I think we have increased the speed in the transformation in the last 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have quite a few number of questions left at the conference call. Let's go over to them again, operator, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Mr. Peter Nielsen from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Couple of questions, please; firstly, if I may return to some of Per-Arne's comments about the impact of price reductions in this Swedish fixed line business, what has been the initial customer reactions to this? It doesn't seem as if line losses has increased nor they moved towards IP, Voice-over-IP has increased dramatically.</p>
          <p>Interested in how customer, initial customer reactions are and do you feel that this estimate you've given, Per-Arne, again today might be a slight &#x2013; a bit cautious in terms of the net effect from these price increases?</p>
          <p>And my second question would relate to the impact of the low CapEx on the OpEx at TeliaSonera. How much of the flow through is there on the OpEx side from the decline in CapEx? Or if &#x2013; when CapEx come up, how much OpEx will be sort of, just an indication if you can give us anything on the sensitivity to the CapEx levels?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, I know it's a small absolute number, but the slight upgrade of your estimate for restructuring charges, even though as I said it's a small number in absolute term, I'd be interested in why that is that you are now at this stage of your program expect restructuring charges to come up a bit more than expected? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start with the last one, I think we have said that we should have roughly three billion in restructuring costs if <mark type="inaudible" />, I think it's obviously a small amount. And I mean we continue to work with this kind of restructuring. And then sometimes it's sort of difficult to estimate exact, but I think we are pretty on <mark type="inaudible" /> anyway. So for me, if it's three or 3.1, it's &#x2013; for me, more or less the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if we go back to the impact from the customer <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; I think we saw sort of at the beginning sort of a higher outflow, but then it sort of went back to the same levels again. So I mean it was sort of the first impact. But then we haven't seen some of the change. And I don't think that whether we are too pessimistic or optimistic about the income impact, I think we remain with the 250 to 300 on an annual level that we have said.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You had a second question that I didn't fully understand, Peter Kurt, about OpEx and CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I assume there was some OpEx related to CapEx, yeah, so when CapEx is coming down, the way it is at the moment, how much of a positive impact does it have on OpEx level, i.e., when CapEx &#x2013; if CapEx starts to come up again, how much of an impact will there be on OpEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see very little connection between CapEx and OpEx. I think they are two separate issues. Longer term I could agree with you. For instance, the issue on ongoing IP, if we can invest CapEx to go IP faster and therefore reduce the old technology and get OpEx out, yeah, then there is a theoretical connection. But in the shorter term, there is no connection between CapEx and OpEx.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Mr. Ulrich Rathe from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;neral. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have three short questions. The first one is on the competitive environment in Swedish mobile following on Andy's question there. You said you are doing really well in Swedish mobile which is true. I was just wondering do you actually see increased competitive intensity in the consumer space, in particular, given what Tele2 is doing there and talking about do you actually see increased competitive pressures?</p>
          <p>Second question is you sort of reiterated your potential appetite for M&amp;A, particular sorts of M&amp;A. Now if you compare this sort of things across your table today to say 12 months ago, do you think the M&amp;A opportunities that you are seeing today are better or worse than 12 months ago?</p>
          <p>And my last question is just coming back to this question of the cost cuts in Swedish fixed, to what degree, if any, is the cost reduction Swedish fixed also driven by maybe competitors pushing their products a bit less aggressively? In other words, to what degree is the ability to control costs driven by the general pressures from the macroenvironment on all players in the market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The third one, I see no help from their side. I think the cost reduction in Swedish fixed broadband is fundamentally re-look at what activities do we need and how much resources do we need for those activities. And we have structurally changed our resources over the last two years. And that's nothing to do with the competition in my opinion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I take the M&amp;A side, no I don't see a difference what comes sort of on the table right now. I think it's still so that it's very difficult to sort of create deals right now because the expectation on appraisal from the seller side and the expectation on what to buy on the buyer side is still a very discrepancy. You see very few deals done actually out in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree with that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could start perhaps and then I'll ask Lars could add it on, but I mean we should remember also that the price levels in Sweden are perhaps one of the lowest in Europe as well. So I think that we have tried to protect the price level and price models here. And of course that could be tough, but there it has always been a very tough competition in the Swedish market, but I can't say this has changed dramatically right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll agree with that. I think there has been always, I mean we are four operators in a 9 million people market. Of course, you get high competition, I mean, but we always had that. And I think it will continue to be higher competition. I think that also gives a lot of credit to our people in Mobility Sweden being able to grow &#x2013; outgrow competition and have very nice EBITDA margins.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Two questions, could you identify the effect of &#x2013; in revenue in Sweden of the increase in prices for the quarter, please? Second question, I would like to clarify that the guidance of CapEx, if there is some auction you will be at the higher hand of the guidance, and if there is no auctions from spectrum, it will lower. Is that correct?</p>

          <p>That is what Per-Arne said, that we stick to the annual effect of that is 250 to 300 million on an annual level. So if you divide that by 4, you have the quarter impact.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of James Britton from Nomura. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I've got two questions, one quite general and one much more specific. Just firstly, generally, you've obviously made great strides on reducing addressable costs this year and you are also emphasizing that it is a structural move and unsustainable. So is it reasonable for us to assume that directionally addressable costs will continue to move downwards over the medium term on the risk strategy at least? And then secondly my specific question is on the Q3 margin performance in Broadband Services in Sweden. I guess, two of the three factors you cite for the very strong result are improved gross margin and lower interconnect costs, can you just explain why the gross margin is increasing because I would have thought that with the LOE prices going up, maybe that might be moving margins the other way, can you specifically sort of tell us why that's the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, this is Lars. Let me take the first question, we have reduced our cost structurally. We have taken two years to do it and we are nearly done. I mean we are done in Finland and we have little bit work to do in Sweden then we are done.</p>
          <p>If we assume that now we have the right structure, then of course, you cannot assume that OpEx is going to go down in the coming years, because if you assume that we can grow the business when the market turns, then the trick is to make sure that the OpEx grows less and hopefully much less than the growth of the revenue. We don't know and we are still talking about what we expect in 2010. We'll come back to that when we have our next quarterly report, but I do not think that you &#x2013; as you ask me can assume that OpEx will come down in the medium term year-on-year. We do have salary increases. We have inflation etcetera. But the trick is we have the right structure now we believe and we must make sure that our revenues grows much more than we grow the OpEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question I assume was about the COGS and all this -the gross margin development, and of course, if you improve your EBITDA margin, I mean there's two things that you are working with, the addressable costs and also the cost for &#x2013; on COGS and I think we have been working with subcontractors. We have re-negotiated agreements and so on. And that's also an ongoing work. It's not just addressable cost where we are looking at right now. I don't know whether that was the question or....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly right. So in fact is that the main reason why gross margin has increased to offset the higher wholesale prices from your wholesale division, than that's the detail I was looking for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. We have couple of final questions from the floor. We have Johanna here from Enskilda.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Johanna Ahlqvist, SEB Enskilda. I was wondering if you can tell us more, how the operations in Nepal is progressing. I saw that you lost customers in the Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lost customers, okay. We have built a network for the last 8 or 10 months. We decided to push on the button for marketing. We haven't done anything, because we didn't think we had the net quality we require. We think we had that in the beginning of October, beginning of this month, we pushed the button, and had a very favorable reaction in the marketplace, it's sort of an anecdote. But I think, we in six days, had 200,000 subscribers. Now you have to be very careful when I say this, because the marketing offer was please signup and you get 50 local money to call for free. That's a no-brainer of course I'll do that. This is a prepaid, right. The question is how many of these 200 will come back when they have called for 50 and say, oh, I want to refill the card with more money, that's the real number and I don't have that number. But I have high hopes about Nepal, we are two operators, incumbent old monopoly and us. And our people in Eurasia are very experienced in entering and becoming number one in the emerging markets. I have personally been to Nepal twice, I think in the last six months talking to these people. I believe Nepal has the possibility of becoming the Uzbekistan of today, at least that's our ambition, but we are just starting. So, maybe we'll have some more to say in the fourth quarter report.</p>

          <p>We have a final question from the floor from &#x2013; follow-up from M. Antoine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've discovered actually that the best pricing churn in this industry has been fixed line telephony because you raised the fixed line rental fee. Yesterday I received a letter from one of your competitors to my household saying that we are going to raise your price. So my question is, are there further room for raising the prices in fixed telephony? I mean the churn doesn't seem to change, so you can do whatever you want actually.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I say <mark type="inaudible" />, this was the first price increase in eight years, to start with. So it's a...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we raised by what kr20 or something, is that right. I actually don't think that that is the interesting question. The interesting question is if we would be able to provide this fiber access with 100 megabit or 1 gigabit, what are we together going to fill that with? And how do we going to make money out of it? And those of you who are in the capital markets there, you know that we have decided that we don't think that we going to make a lot of money in content, but we also understand or believe that the pricing structure, the pricing model will probably have to change because we have basically for 100 years charged all of us consumers for voice per minute and distance. I'm old enough to remember when you had to call long distance and it was more expensive.</p>
          <p>And voice is going to be so small in the bandwidth. So I think you are going to see another pricing model evolve. And so it's not raising the interior bars in Sweden, that's not the most interesting question, the question is how do we charge for the telecom services when you provide 100 megabit per second and maybe 50 services.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks; Michael here from Evli Bank again. Regarding this offering in Sweden fixed line or IP offering going forward, is there any regulatory or any other things that could stop you and there is several houses now that have <mark type="inaudible" /> belonging to Telenor fiber in it, is that something that could stop you from going even further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, absolutely. There is a potentially very big issue here. If for instance the biggest player, that's being us, today having about 25% of the fiber in this country, if you are the only one who gets regulated and the regulator decides the price, the future price. I think our board will be very hesitant to invest the billions that we talk about. And this is a big issue for our company, but it's a much bigger issue for this country because somebody will have to invest in the fiber network, in fiber infrastructure in Sweden now. And the state has said very clearly they have no interest and no money, so then it leaves to the market. We are the natural player, we have the balance sheet to do it, but we have many opportunities to invest our money. We have more opportunities than we have money. So, yes, that's going to be a real issue.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a follow-up on the, I am afraid again in the Swedish fixed. The question is this clearly has been involved in cost cutting particularly in the fixed business for years and years and years, now, we are now seeing a significant benefit on the natural cost side which is a great success. I'm just wondering where you attribute the success now given that the effort was there all along. Is it the incentivization or the way you implemented or what about the way you implemented leads to the net cost now that was never there before and certainly not to this extent? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This actually addresses the heart of the culture and the transition that we are talking about. I joined this company two years ago and I talked about performance and consequence management. I talked about not allowing people to move their goal post during the match. And I think that is the issue that we agree on something and then people are expected to deliver what we have agreed upon. And everybody can make a mistake, I have no problem with that, but to agree on something and then constantly not deliver it or ignoring it is unacceptable. And that has changed in the last 24 months. That's simple.</p>
