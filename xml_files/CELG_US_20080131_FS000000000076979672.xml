          <p>Good morning. My name is Tom, and I will be your conference operator today. I'd like to welcome everyone to the Celgene Quarterly Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gryska, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I am Dave Gryska, Celgene's Chief Financial Officer, and welcome to Celgene's fourth quarter and full year 2007 conference call, and thank you for joining us today. I am in Boston, and with me in New Jersey are Celgene's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sol Barer; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hugin.</p>
          <p>The press release reporting our financial and operating results was issued earlier this morning and is also available on our corporate website. I will begin the conference call by reviewing the fourth quarter and year-end results and then &#x2013; and by sharing our financial objectives for 2008. Then Bob will review our operational and commercial results from 2007 and outlook for 2008. Sol will then conclude our session with a strategic perspective on 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Before we start, we want to remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be forward-looking or made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain forward-looking statements which involve known and unknown risks, delays, uncertainties, and other factors not under our control may cause actual results, performance and achievements to be materially different from the results, performance or other expectations implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors include the results of current or pending clinical trials, our products failure to demonstrate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, actions by the FDA, the financial conditions of suppliers including their solvency and ability to supply product, and other factors detailed in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or referred to in the press release issued this morning.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll take you through the financial results. Total net revenue for 2007 increased to a record to $1.406 billion, an increase of 56% year-over-year. The increase was driven by multiple growing revenue streams, including record product sales of REVLIMID.  Sales of REVLIMID increased in both the U.S. and European markets in the fourth quarter and across all lines of therapy. The exceptional commercial performance of our global team translated into record bottom line growth for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter of 2007, we reported adjusted net income of $132.8 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.31. This is an increase of 72% over the same quarter last year, when adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.18. For the full year of 2007, adjusted net income was $452.9 million or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.06, doubling the adjusted diluted earnings per share performance in 2006 of $0.53.</p>
          <p>We ended the year with a very strong product sales. Total net product sales of REVLIMID in the fourth quarter were $247.4 million, that's nearly double the year ago quarter results of $123.6 million and a 24% increase sequentially quarter-over-quarter. For the full year of 2007, REVLIMID product sales were 773.9 million, an increase of 141% over full year sales of 2006.</p>
          <p>Turning to THALOMID, net product sales for the fourth quarter increased to $112.6 million. Net products sales of THALOMID for the full year 2007 were $447.1 million. Despite the extraordinary progress of REVLIMID and multiple myeloma across all stages, THALOMID sales remained strong.</p>
          <p>Turning to ALKERAN, net product sales for the fourth quarter were $20 million compared to $15.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Sequentially, quarter-over-quarter ALKERAN sales were up 5.7% from third quarter sales of 18.9 million.</p>
          <p>Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs in the fourth quarter was 28.4 million, up from 19.6 million in the year ago quarter. Sequentially, they increased 79% from $15.8 million in the third quarter of 2007. The increase was due to seasonal sales fluctuations as children often go off medication in the summer and start back up in the fall.</p>
          <p>Our product gross margin for 2007 was 90.81%. The gross margin in 2006 was 86.1%, which means year-over-year there was an increase of 4.7 percentage points. We expect gross margins in 2008 to improve further to approximately 91%.</p>
          <p>Now turning to expenses, in the fourth quarter of 2007 R&amp;D was $93 million compared to 77.6 million in the year ago quarter. For full year of 2007, adjusted R&amp;D was 340.9 million, that's an increase of 38.6% over 2006 when adjusted R&amp;D was 245.9 million. We have been investing more in R&amp;D as we are fully committed to expand the clinical and commercial potential of our pipeline in compounds and to exciting new treatment areas, in hematology and oncology, as well as information. Our Chief Operating Officer Bob Hugin will expand on those initiatives in just a few minutes.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, SG&amp;A was 119.8 million, an increase of 44.5% over the fourth quarter of 2006 which was 83 million. Quarter-over-quarter SG&amp;A increased 39.8% in the third quarter of 85.7 million. This increase is due in large part to expanding international commercialization activities and programs in the U.S. to support patient access to REVLIMID, including patient co-pay programs.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year SG&amp;A increased to 406.8 million from 268.5 million in 2006. The increased costs are in investment in a long-term growth to Celgene as we are expanding into more countries and continents. Celgene now has a presence in over 50 countries, with a total target of nearly 100 countries. Additionally, one of Celgene's core values is to support patient assistance and patient access programs around the world.</p>
          <p>As I just mentioned in 2007, we substantially increased contributions to foundations that help underinsured cancer patients with prescription co-payments and other critical expenses, and we will continue to do so in 2008.</p>
          <p>We expect SG&amp;A to increase approximately 10% in 2008.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted tax rate in 2007 was 28%. Since we've utilized our NOLs in 2007, we will be moving to a GAAP tax rate in 2008 of approximately 25%, and we are reviewing our international structure to further approve upon that rate.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to look at cash flows and our balance sheet to highlight our extremely strong cash position. We ended 2007 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.7 billion. This gives us the financial flexibility to maximize our potential, consider other opportunities and pursue our goal of becoming a leading hematology/oncology company in the world.  We expect cash generated from operations and investing activities to be approximately 900 million for 2008.</p>
          <p>2007 marked the fifth straight year of continually increasing profitability, and we look forward to greater success in 2008. We expect exceptional revenue and earnings growth in 2008, driven by multiple products, countries and indications. We previously announced on January 7th <mark type="audio gap" /></p>
          <p>Here is our guidance for 2008 that does not include the Pharmion acquisition. We expect total revenue to increase nearly 30% to approximately $1.8 billion. We anticipate REVLIMID global revenue to increase more than 60% to approximately $1,250 million, and we have had a strong start to 2008. We are targeting adjusted diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 45% to a range of $1.50 to $1.55.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hugin, who will explain the commercial successes of past year that we have established the momentum for a very promising and robust 2008.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave. Please don't confuse the effects of my cold with my enthusiasm for the tremendous results of 2007 and for the exciting prospects for 2008. 2007 was an exceptional year for Celgene with all functions and geographic units contributing to the superlative results.</p>
          <p>Importantly, these accomplishments reflect our success in both producing strong near-term results and accelerating the achievement of our long-term goal of becoming the pre-eminent global biopharmaceutical company, focused on hematology/oncology and immune inflammatory diseases.</p>
          <p>I will now review the outstanding 2007 performance, starting with our commercial operations. As Dave outlined, the numbers are impressive. REVLIMID's growth of 140% to nearly $775 million was the key driver in the 56% increase in total revenue to over $1.4 billion in 2007.</p>
          <p>During the year, we also significantly increased our investments in the future by building our international infrastructure and expanding our clinical and pre-clinical research programs. R&amp;D investments, in fact, grew by 39% to almost $350 million. At the same time, our adjusted earnings per share doubled to $1.06 per share.</p>
          <p>REVLIMID's growth was driven by significant increases in both the United States and Europe. In the United States, prescriptions grew by over 60% year-over-year, and by approximately 9% quarter-over-quarter. REVLIMID's usage in multiple myeloma accounted for most of the growth and for about three quarters of all prescriptions. A little under 20% of prescriptions were for MDS, and the remaining 5 to 6% were from other indications, including CLL, NHL and myelofibrosis.</p>
          <p>REVLIMID's market share in the United States grew across all lines of myeloma therapy, with short increases in the earlier stages of the disease. The most recent third-party data reflects continued strong market share gains for REVLIMID with approximately 25% of all treated myeloma patients currently receiving REVLIMID.</p>
          <p>The successful launch of REVLIMID in several European countries, including France, Germany, Ireland and Austria, significantly contributed to REV's success in 2007. The remarkable efforts of our international team positions us well to reach our corporate objective of commercializing REVLIMID in all of Western Europe, Canada, Australia and Latin America by this time next year.</p>
          <p>We are optimistic that we will see continued strong growth in Europe in 2008, as pricing and reimbursement is achieved in the remaining countries in Western Europe, and market share gains are achieved.</p>
          <p>In many markets, significant advances have already been made in establishing REVLIMID as the market leader in the treatment of second-line multiple myeloma. Market share gains in Europe have generally been consistent with those achieved in United States at similar stages of the REVLIMID launch.</p>
          <p>The presentation and publication of important clinical data has contributed to these market share gains. There were several data presentations that were most significant. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and Southwestern Oncology Group's newly diagnosed multiple myeloma studies of REVLIMID and dexamethasone illustrated the significant potential of REVLIMID in this stage of the disease.</p>
          <p>In the ECOG trial, REVLIMID and low-dose dexamethasone achieved unprecedented one and two year survival rates of 96 and 87%. The SWOG study found that REVLIMID and dexamethasone produced a superior overall response rate of 85%, compared to 55% for dexamethasone alone. Importantly, the study supported the continuing evidence that outstanding REVLIMID survival rates showing a 77% one-year progression-free survival compared to 51% for dexamethasone alone.</p>
          <p>These two trials combined with other studies, including the recently published Biaxin, REVLIMID and dexamethasone trial, showing a 39% complete response rate, demonstrate the potential that REVLIMID has as a combinable oral therapy that produces deep and durable response rates that improve over time leading to increased overall survival for newly diagnosed myeloma patients.</p>
          <p>Updated data from the two pivotal Phase III trials that have supported REVLIMID's approval in previously treated myeloma patients was published in the New England Journal of Medicine this past November and presented at ASH in December. The updated data reported immediate overall survival of 35 months, the longest reported median survival in previously treated myeloma patients in Phase III trials. These trials also highlighted that REVLIMID produced the highest reported overall response rates, the highest combined CR and near-CR rates and the longest duration of response in Phase III relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma trials.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, these trials supported regulatory approvals for REVLIMID. Last June, we received our first approval for REVLIMID outside of the United States with European Union approval. We subsequently received marketing approval for previously treated myeloma in Switzerland, and just announced Australian myeloma approval last week. We've advanced our regulatory program in Japan and expect to file both multiple myeloma and MDS 5q applications late this year or early in 2009. Additional approvals are expected throughout 2008.</p>
          <p>We are committed to expanding REVLIMID's role in multiple myeloma through additional clinical trials and regulatory approvals. It is a key corporate objective for 2008 to obtain the ECOG and SWOG data, prepare it for regulatory submission and review its acceptability with regulators this year.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2008, we will also complete accrual of MM-015, our newly diagnosed multiple myeloma trial, comparing melphalan, prednisone, and REVLIMID versus melphalan and prednisone. Data from this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 450-patient trial is expected in 2009, and if positive would be used to support regulatory filings.</p>
          <p>We are optimistic of the results of MM-015, based on the preliminary results from a Phase II trial, evaluating the same regimen published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology this past September which showed one year event-free and overall survival rates of 92 and 100% respectively, a complete response rate of 24% and a combined CR and very good partial response rate of 48%.</p>
          <p>Further demonstrating our commitment to REVLIMID in the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma market we are initiating MM-020, the largest newly diagnosed multiple myeloma trail ever conducted, comparing REVLIMID and low-dose dexamethasone to melphalan and prednisone and thalidomide. This global 1,590-patient trial will begin enrolling patients in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>To fully capitalize on REVLIMID's unique efficacy and side-effect profile, we have initiated or will initiate later this year more than a dozen trials with almost 4,000 patients exploring REVLIMID's usefulness in upfront multiple myeloma with multiple combinations and in the high-potential maintenance setting. We have the potential to produce data that demonstrates overall survival advantage increasing and durable response rates and high quality of life for extended periods of time. The promise of REVLIMID extends well beyond multiple myeloma. We are committed to fully exploring its potential in multiple indications.</p>
          <p>REVLIMID is being studied in more than 100 clinical trials worldwide with the great majority outside of myeloma. Expansion of the REVLIMID franchise in MDS remains a high priority for us. We were pleased to announce last weak that our REVLIMID 5q deletion MDS application had been approved in Canada, a very positive step in the initiation of our commercial operations in Canada. At the same time, we announced a negative CHMP opinion regarding the same application in Europe. We intend to appeal this decision and will supplement our application with additional analysis in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p>We are hopeful that our MDS 5q franchise will be further strengthened later this year when the data from our randomized controlled trial MDS-004 is released. This trial was fully accrued last June. As such, we'd expect the data to be available late in the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>New and updated data presented in 2007 reaffirmed the potential of REVLIMID in both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Let me spend a minute updating you on our plans to accelerate these programs in 2008.</p>
          <p>In CLL, we have initiated our dose finding and titration study CLL-001 in relapsed/refractory patients, which is expected to conclude by mid-2008. These results will establish the dosing schedule for our Phase III SPA regulatory track trial, which we plan to initiate later in 2008.</p>
          <p>In addition to CLL-001, there are six other studies currently enrolling patients in either single-agent or combination studies. Over the next 12 months, we expect to initiate four registration track studies in addition to CLL-002, our planned SPA study, and another eight to ten Phase II or independent investigator studies.</p>
          <p>In NHL, we are nearing complete enrollment of NHL-003, our 200-patient single-agent open-label study in relapsed/refractory aggressive NHL. Its regulatory utility in combination with the previously completed trial NHL-002 will be reviewed once the data is available late this year or early next year. It is our intention to initiate five registration track trials, including studies in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. Additional Phase II trials evaluating various combination therapies are initiating now.</p>
          <p>By the end of 2008, we expect to have no less than 40 trials studying REVLIMID in CLL and NHL. These trials are designed to support regulatory applications, explore potential combination therapies and provide direction for further clinical study, and to support commercial strategies.</p>
          <p>In addition to REVLIMID, we are also continuing to advance our deep pipeline of IMiD compounds, including our CC-4047 program in myelofibrosis, multiple myeloma, solid tumors cancers and sickle cell anemia.</p>
          <p>2008 will also be the year of building a robust foundation for our anti-inflammatory franchise. Last year, we announced the positive results of our randomized placebo-controlled Phase II proof-of-mechanism trial for our lead TNF&#x3B1; inhibitor CC-10004 in psoriasis. The full data set from this study will be presented this weekend at the American Association of Dermatology meeting in San Antonio.</p>
          <p>Following recent regulatory discussions, we are embarking on an aggressive clinical program to explore the full potential of both CC-10004 and 11050 in a range of dermatological, rheumatological and inflammatory conditions. Later this year, we will initiate a Phase IIb study in psoriasis, examining the potential benefit of extended duration and higher dosing of 10004 in advance of commencing Phase III studies. In addition to the ongoing psoriatic arthritis and recalcitrant psoriasis trials, it is our intention to launch five Celgene sponsored trial this year, in addition to the 20 investigator initiated trials planned.</p>
          <p>Other Celgene programs also continue to make excellent progress. We recently filed an IND for our first oral JNK inhibitor CC-930 that we look forward to moving into Phase I in the first half of the year. We are also on target to file our first IND for PDA-001, our proprietary placental stem cell product this summer. We will update you further as these programs progress.</p>
          <p>And I hope you can tell, we are very pleased with the progress that was achieved in 2007 and I have high expectations for the prospects for 2008. In addition to the progress of our commercial, clinical and research programs, we strengthened our long-term growth prospects through a number of strategic collaborations, highlighted by the Pharmion merger, and also with a number of equity investments and high-potential research-focused biotech companies, and research collaborations with Array BioPharma and PTC Therapeutics.</p>
          <p>Let me now take a moment to update you on the Pharmion transaction. We believe that the combination of Pharmion and Celgene makes exceptional strategic sense, and enhances the value of both companies. We look forward to working together with the outstanding team of Pharmion to advance our combined products and pipelines globally. We've made excellent progress in advancing the transaction on several fronts.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month, we announced the 30-day waiting period under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act had expired, and we also recently announced the transaction had cleared German anti-trust regulatory review. The S-4 proxy statement has been filed with the SEC, and we anticipate an expeditious filing of the final proxy, and mailing of the proxy to Pharmion shareholders. It is expected that a shareholder vote will be scheduled approximately 30 days after mailing. Following a positive shareholder vote, the transaction is expected to close in March.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the call over to Sol.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. As you've heard 2007 was a landmark year for Celgene. We achieved record financial results, reporting adjusted diluting &#x2013; diluted earnings per share of $1.06; established REVLIMID as one of the most successful hematology/oncology products with revenues of over three quarters of $1 billion with $247 million in the fourth quarter; began our international commercialization effort with operations in 50 countries notably France and Germany; set the stage for a major international commercial expansion to almost 100 countries within five years; continue to advance our research and development pipeline with our IMiD, TNF&#x3B1; inhibitors, numerous kinase inhibitors and proprietary new classes of compounds; and importantly, began to grow Celgene with external partnerships and acquisitions in addition to our successful internal growth.</p>
          <p>All of these contributed towards the advancement of our strategic mission to become a pre-eminent global biopharmaceutical company, meeting the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer and serious and debilitating inflammatory immunological diseases. But this is just the beginning. We expect 2008 will be a year of truly dynamic growth, driven by REVLIMID, our international expansion and our pipeline.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we will continue to work toward regulatory approval for REVLIMID in two major indications, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, where we plan to initiate two new Phase III special protocol assessment trials. We will advance our REVLIMID pivotal Phase III international trial in newly diagnosed myeloma which, as Bob indicated, is expected to be fully enrolled in the first half of 2008, while analyzing the REVLIMID newly diagnosed myeloma cooperative group trials for potential submission to the FDA.</p>
          <p>We are also significantly expanding the global reach of REVLIMID. We've recently secured approvals in Australia and Canada, and anticipate REVLIMID being commercially available in more than 30 countries by this time next year. Beyond that, we look-forward to expanding commercially into the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, Latin America and the Middle East by late 2009 and early 2010. REVLIMID can be considered a pipeline in itself.</p>
          <p>In addition, our research and development team is advancing several promising candidates forward in hematology and solid tumors including pomalidomide, CC-11006, a pleiotropic pathway modifiers, kinase inhibitors such as CC-930 which is now entering the clinical, and a new subclass of IMiD, having potent solid tumor activity in preclinical models.</p>
          <p>As Bob indicated, the next IMiD compound pomalidomide is currently being studied in myelofibrosis and sickle cell anemia with a trial of multiple myeloma to be initiated. Moreover, we are beginning two studies in 2008 in solid tumors. We are advancing our lead anti-inflammatory compound of apremilast or CC-10004, a proprietary oral agent that inhibit TNF-alpha among other cytokines and is currently under evaluation in clinical trials in moderate to severe psoriasis and recalcitrant psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with plans to initiate trials in 2008 in a number of other dermatological and rheumatological diseases. Actually, data is going to be presented this weekend at the American Academy of Dermatology Meeting on this compound's activity in moderate to the severe psoriasis.</p>
          <p>As David mentioned, our financial picture is excellent, with strong cash generation targeted towards fulfilling our global mission and is appropriate to grow Celgene through select global partnering opportunities and strategic investments. Notable in this regard is our agreement to acquire Pharmion which from a strategic, financial, clinical, product and importantly human resource prospective represents an important step forward in our growth to a pre-eminent global hematology/oncology company.</p>
          <p>As always, our focus is on patients. Our therapies help physicians to deliver higher quality healthcare, resulting in improved patient outcomes worldwide. To this end, we continue to provide patient support that is both generous and caring.  Our RevAssist, a new Patient Support Coordinator Program remained unique to the industry. In addition, our donations to independent non-profit 501(c)(3) co-pay foundations and our free drug programs for qualified patients have been and will continue to be some of the most generous in the industry.</p>
          <p>This is the extremely exciting time in the company's history. This is only the beginning of our mission to maximize Celgene's potential worldwide. In the coming years, we will benefit from multiple high-potential global revenue streams, label expansions for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Expansion into additional blood cancers increasing our global opportunities and expanding our product lines with new, innovative therapies to hematological malignancies, solid tumors, and serious inflammatory diseases. I have never been more optimistic regarding Celgene's future. We truly have the potential to become an exceptionally successful pharmaceutical company.</p>
          <p>I would like to thank the entire global Celgene team for all of the extraordinary accomplishments reached in 2007 and a many milestones that we plan to achieve in 2008.</p>

          <p>Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. A couple of questions for you on financials. One, gross margins seem to be a little bit flattish in the quarter despite a pretty good REVLIMID number, can you give us a sense whether there are any one timers there. And then also for SG&amp;A &#x2013; seem to ramp up a little bit in the fourth quarter. Is that mostly co-pay assist or does that reflect, I guess, more of the global rollout you guys have done over the second-half of '07?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure Geoff, on the gross margin line our contract with ALKERAN has adjustments that are built in to increase the cost of goods sold for us. So, even though revenues are increasing, it's just &#x2013; contractually its something that is in the contract where our revenue &#x2013; our gross margins do look a little bit off a little bit in the fourth quarter because of the Alkeran contract. So, if we didn't have that in there, the margins would have been better by couple of points, number one. The number two, the SG&amp;A did increase Q3 and Q4, a majority of that was just getting ready for expansion in other parts of the world into Asia and other parts of Europe. So, we had to hire some more key individuals along that line and we did make some contributions to some of the non-profit organizations on co-pay because there was simply a need for that and it was appropriate to do in the fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the outlook for the year is still, I think if you look at the SG&amp;A, the guidance for '08 is consistent with what Dave outlined on the call of a 10% or so increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, just a quick follow-up on that Bob. With respect to the guidance for the year, it looks like with the SG&amp;A and margin in your tax rate should we &#x2013; I guess we should expect pretty dramatic increases in R&amp;D? And then what's &#x2013; the sort of the flexibility with some of those costs or, is that just you guys sort of baking in, maybe, some contemplation on the Pharmion cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, really the information that we provide in terms of guidance is really just for Celgene excluding Pharmion. But as I hope you can tell that we really do expect CLL and NHL now that we get the dosing and titration underway. The result from CLL have just been in every place we test is REVLIMID CLL, the results have been striking and compelling.</p>
          <p>So, the fact that we've had to take some time here to get to dosing and titration schedule resolved is a necessary and important function. But as we're resolving that in the coming months, we are going to aggressively move forward and we are looking forward to getting SPA pivotal trials up in CLL and NHL and the MMO20 to show the commitment to newly diagnosed myeloma.</p>
          <p>So, I think there is, I think we are optimistic that we are going to have positive results &#x2013; one which will support the increased expansion in R&amp;D. If things don't move as positive the way as we hope, we might see some positive impact on that in the bottom line, but we hope that's not the case; our intention is to move everything forward including from stem cells to oral J&amp;K inhibitors to 4047 to new compounds coming into the clinic even more quickly than we thought and accelerating pre-clinical compound. So, we are building for the future and that's why I think when you look at the whole picture of R&amp;D internal-external collaborations, we want 2015 to 2020 to be the most exciting time in Celgene's history as we are looking to build that global company.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. First for Bob, can you give us a sense on the break between U.S. and actual sales of REVLIMID, or how much of the growth quarter-over-quarter was outside at U.S.? What was the stock &#x2013; was there any stock piling in the quarter? Then I had a quick question on Pharmion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we haven't broken out U.S. and non-U.S. I mean, over time, you know, we've made it very clear that we think the opportunity in international is actually as equal, or actually larger than the U.S. potential. But I think in terms of the fourth quarter, I'll try to give you some sense of it, that we saw 9% prescription growth in the U.S. and strong growth internationally. So, that's as specific as we're going to be.</p>
          <p>We anticipate in the guidance numbers that we've given for '08 good growth in both markets, both growth in the European markets where we've already launched, as we gain increasing market share going from later stage patients up to second line patients, and in markets that we haven't yet penetrated, like Italy and Spain, that we &#x2013; hopefully here in the first six months of the year will bring onboard and other countries as we bring them on step-by-step. And in the U.S., we're seeing positive signs on duration which is a &#x2013; clearly is a benefit to us as we get patients who stay on the drug longer.</p>
          <p>We've &#x2013; in the relatively short period in time since we've launched in myeloma the U.S. REVLIMID duration has expanded past the duration that we've been able to produce with THALOMID. Obviously, because the side effect profile of REVLIMID doesn't have the neuropathy that other compounds like THALOMID and others have, and it has good side effect profile with significant efficacy. So, we're pushing hard for growth in the U.S. It's going to be in the myeloma. We are not anticipating in our guidance much growth, very little growth in MDS, slight growth, and international combinations. So over time, Europe is going to be a bigger part &#x2013; international is going to be a bigger part of the pie. It's going to be very important to the growth, but it's not the only part of the growth.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And was there any stock filing in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that there might have been some minor benefit of a few million &#x2013; as we've said each quarter, the quarter end can vary. There might have been a little benefit &#x2013; sort of run rate might be a little bit less than 247, but it was still a very strong accelerating growth the last few weeks of the quarter in December. And third quarter, we had a little de-stocking of inventory. In the whole scheme of things on an annual basis, we're talking about 1 or 2% numbers here that I don't think really impact the long-term direction of the results of '07 and looking forward. But again, a minor benefit in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-on on Pharmion, can you give us a sense of when was the proxy actually filed, because there's no actual date on the material. And is the vote 30 day after the proxy was filed, to give us a little bit better clarity on when the vote might have happened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe the date of the actual filing was the 22nd or 23rd of January, that timeframe. And then you have lots of things, the SEC can review it, they can review it minor, they can move quickly. We're comfortable that there will be an expeditious filing of the final proxy and when the final proxy is filed, hopefully here in the near term you would then have a mailing to the Pharmion shareholders, and you would expect under normal circumstances in a deal like this, the Pharmion shareholder vote would be scheduled about 30 days following the mailing of the proxy and everything is on track for an expeditious timing as we move forward here.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Jim Burchnall, Lehman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, couple of questions just on front line myeloma. Just trying to get a sense with the ECOG study we didn't have CR rates really at ASH because of a lack of bone marrow assessment. Is there an ability to collect both bone marrow samples going forward in that study and could we see updated CR data? Also wondering what the gating factors are to getting that data in house and what do you think the time lines are for discussion with FDA? And then just finally on the 015 study final data in '09 but if you look at the early stoppage of VEESTA, is there some interim analysis that could provide data earlier in that study?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so there were several studies and there were several questions in that. In terms of the CR rate in the ECOG study, as you know bone marrow data was not collected. You really can't go back and do that but they are collecting CR data based on blood and urine. We understand the ECOG is doing that and from what I understand there is an abstract that's going to be presented at ASCO. But again we don't know to what extent they are going to make progress and how much they are going to collect in &#x2013; within the period of time between now and then but we are pretty optimistic in terms of at the end of the day in terms of CR rates based on previous REVLIMID trials and certainly the CR and very good partial response rate is in the 40% plus range already.</p>
          <p>And one of the unique aspects of it which I should mention and which is important is that REVLIMID has a bit of a unique characteristic as a biological sort of modifying agent in the fact that CR rates will improve over a period of time. So patients can be on there for a while and CR rates can get even better. And of course on top of all that CR data that will be coming in both from the ECOG trials, the BIRD trial in combination with Biaxin which had very, very high CR rates or the overall survival numbers which will continue to be reported on and updated which are obviously end of the day probably the most important thing for a patient, you have to be alive in order to respond.</p>
          <p>In terms of, I think another question that you asked, Jim, was regarding the timing for the ECOG data and we are obviously working with ECOG to collect the data as quickly as they can. That's what &#x2013; something that they are doing, this is not something that we do. We have obviously been through this before, our approval for THALOMID in first line myeloma was based on an ECOG trial which they went through the same process. Our plan is going to &#x2013; and it's tough to put timing on it but certainly 2008 we will be going through the data, we'll be making the appropriate analysis, we'll talk to the FDA regarding it. And then based on the conversations with the FDA we will be making a decision regarding submission what specific indication or sub-indication to go for in terms of newly diagnosed myeloma.</p>
          <p>And it should be clear that this is a less certain path than the more belt and suspenders MMO15, which is double-blind placebo control trial with all the dose and which was associated with it. So this is something we are pursuing obviously aggressively and look forward to talking to the FDA and also the EU authorities based on the kind of data we get.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jim, your question about MMO15, there are obviously opportunities for potentially earlier release of data but from our perspective we would like to keep the expectations as conservative as appropriate and so that is why we outlined the timing that we outlined in the conference call. And if the results are better then we will take advantage of that upside. I do just want to mention one thing that someone did raise a question about earlier about &#x2013; before the call about the press release, about Compendia listing in the newly diagnosed sector. I do want to make it clear that at the end of September of '07, we'd received Compendia listing from multiple Compendia agencies for newly diagnosed myeloma and it's very clear that we have Compendia listing for all stages of myeloma but specifically for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure hi, thanks. Just a question on Bob's comment about market share dynamics in Europe paralleling the U.S. at similar stage of launch for REVLIMID. Does that also apply for first line multiple myeloma, can you just elaborate on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Maged. The market share is an important dynamic when you think about what the ultimate overall prospects for the drug are in terms of the penetration rates and the number of patients etcetera to what the trajectory is going to be. So we've been very encouraged in Europe it's not uncommon to start with the salvage later stage patients and move up and we have been very pleased in the countries where we have launched to move quite quickly up in various stages of the disease. Europe is a different market than United States. There are some countries that are very much focused on the clinical benefit and physicians are able and patients are able to get reimbursed then for therapies for newly diagnosed myeloma or other indications that are not covered in the label and there are some countries that are very resistant to that and prohibit and prevent that from happening.</p>
          <p>So in the countries that we don't have a label, it's really up to physicians and the system to work that out. And we have been successful already or patients have been successful and physicians have been successful in some of the larger countries to already be able to prescribe REVLIMID and get the patient reimbursed for it in newly diagnosed in some of the larger markets. And our own estimates, something we obviously would not and do not promote outside the label that we would not be surprised to see something in the order of 10% market share in those markets, in terms of in European markets for front line but our projections and our outlook are based on really having a major, major impact on second line myeloma.</p>

          <p>I think that we have looked at different third parties but &#x2013; and I read different third party &#x2013; again we don't get it under the RevAssist, the different lines of, we just get who is a myeloma patient etcetera. But I have seen a number of third party studies that show us around the 20% newly diagnosed number and that's third party estimates.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question. A couple, first, you mentioned that Compendia and given UnitedHealthcare's finally going to use the NCCN Compendia, I checked that this morning and it look as though your listing there is only front line transplant candidates, not non-transplant candidates in front line setting and it's only rated 2B rather than 2A. Wondering if you think that that can change and certainly also whether you think that Medicare might switch to the NCCN Compendia. And, secondly just, Sol, on R&amp;D, you came in at about 22% of revenue in the fourth quarter, 24% for the year and really a remarkably small number for a company of your size 340 million or so. Obviously that's going to ramp next year but I think we all have a sense that you are playing a little bit of catch-up on a couple of things like maintenance, like NHL and even front line. Are you going to be more aggressive about really investing in all of your potential opportunities and where might that R&amp;D ratio go as you do that in the future? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me &#x2013; it's Bob, let just answer the first one which I think is an important one because reimbursement in all the markets and especially in the United States is one that you need to be focused on. We certainly need to be focused on and are focused on and have a, I think a great track record our team of ensuring that our products are well reimbursed for patients in the United States and around and the world. I think under Medicare there's lots of things going on there and there is issues between comparability and equality between Medicare Part D and Part B. People who have drugs that are only Part B think Medicare Part D is to favorable and people who have Medicare Part D drugs, think Medicare Part B in terms of Compendia etcetera is more generous.</p>
          <p>We so far have been very happy with what's happened with any physician or patient that's wanted to prescribe or take REVLIMID for newly diagnosed of getting complete reimbursement. And I think in terms of the NCCN guidelines, you are absolutely right and so we have it for that segment of the population, we are, I think we are pretty confident about how that will be expanded in the relatively near term but in terms of the Medicare, the Compendia listings that we have do fully give us coverage for every patient under Medicare Part D today. So again this is always something we are focused on. We need to be focused on, it's something that will only have increasing importance and so far we believe we are in very good shape, but we will continue to push hard to make sure we are always in a better shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the R&amp;D, I agree with you Geoff, our perspective is that &#x2013; I have said this many times that research and development is the lifeblood of any pharmaceutical company and no less Celgene where many, many &#x2013; all the development so far, virtually our entire pipeline, has come from internal developments. And we intend to be aggressive in terms of investing where we think some of the major opportunities are, not only in REVLIMID as Bob indicated there are a lots of trials that are ongoing, we are expanding that significantly in everything from newly diagnosed to chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and others, but also our pipeline of products. CC-4047, 10004 and there are some very, very exciting early stage compounds that we are currently investing in, which I think is going to be very, very important.</p>
          <p>I really would love to have the time to go through some of those and because there is so much in the pipeline and it really doesn't get the kind of visibility that we really think it deserves and to match the excitement within the corporation, we will have an 'Analysts Day' later in the year. We haven't formulated the exact date. We are going to do that and probably towards the end of the year, because I think there is so much going on. We do need to prepare for that, but nevertheless, you will see from research and development in expenditures it will be done in a prudent fashion but there are a number of areas that we think we can benefit from in the future and some very exciting stuff that we haven't talked about yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's also &#x2013; just to make it clear to everyone that if you look historically, there have been years when we have had very high percentages which obviously early in our development, but we want to make it very clear that we don't have guidelines that hamstring or restrict us. We very much look at what the potential is and what we can afford and want to spend everything we possibly can to accelerate and grow the company for the long term.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a couple of questions. One is on REVLIMID, what is your share now in second and third line multiple myeloma? And, the second is on development on 4047. What are some of the lessons learned that you have based on previous molecules that you are going to change for the development of this compound and what exactly is the plan for solid tumors, I know that you mentioned earlier that you will be starting some studies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first deal with the REVLIMID market share in the later stages, or in the different lines of therapy in the U.S. where we've now been on the market for about a year and a half or so. In the later stages, it's a very high percentage. So any patient that had prior therapies before REVLIMID being approved, see REVLIMID later in the treatment of the disease, so we are in the 40 plus percent in the third and fourth lines and in second lines we are likely to be in the &#x2013; from the different external third party providers that we have looked at, the estimates are in the 30% market share in second line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the second part of the question was in terms of 4047. Let me just step back, not everybody may know this compound. This is an IMID, it is an IMID that has second priority obviously to REVLIMID where we put most of our focus in. It is the most potent IMID that we have found so far, its potency is about in order of magnitude greater than that of REVLIMID, it is currently being &#x2013; we have investigated in some solid similar trials. Our plan here is to look at it in specific hematological malignancies such as myelofibrosis and in multiple myeloma. I think a key thing that we do being very aggressive in terms of getting into the clinic is we need to understand the dosing regimens for 4047 very well. The myelofibrosis trial is a trial that looks at dosing carefully, we have a small cell lung cancer trial that is ongoing now, and that's going to be initiated in by the end of this first quarter. And we have another trial that would be initiated at the middle of the year in 4047 in soft tissue sarcoma, which again is a Phase II open label trial we did, that's going to open in the U.S., EU and Australia with about 170 subjects. That has a couple of stages and we're building in what we have learned in the first stage to the second stage. We understand the maximum tolerated dose for this compound is about 7 mgs which is again very, very potent compound. So we are looking at it from a variety of indications, but with a specific rationale to each of those indications.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys, congratulations on a good quarter and thank you for taking my question. I had a question on REVLIMID with regard to its duration of use as well as its dosing. You mentioned duration was beyond that of THALOMID. Can you give us some specific information on that and then in terms of what you are seeing in the market with regard to dose; maintenance of dosing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Charles, something happened on our line here. When you &#x2013; would you repeat the second part of your question because it didn't come through quite as clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what I was &#x2013; I was interested in if you had data on the duration of REVLIMID dosing that you are seeing in the market as well as the dose kind of the magnitude of dosing, if you are seeing any reductions or what are the dynamics with regard to REVLIMID dosing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, thank you. In the U.S., it's &#x2013; we are able to more closely look at these issues, than we are outside the United States because of RevAssist and we have seen over time very positive shifts in duration. As you would expect early in the launch of REVLIMID a lot of late stage patients, we now have gone on a total basis, including the late stage patients, the median above eight months. So that's encouraging of this stage to us as it's about half a month longer than we had targeted for, for this time in the drug's launch. So we are encouraged by that and we are working very hard to do additional clinical trials and publications that will even help our people be able to educate and promote how to use the drug even longer because when you think about REVLIMID and its advantages, it is the ideal drug for extended therapy, efficacy that improves over time, very tolerable by patients, don't feel or see the side effects of the drug generally, and can keep and maintain a response for a long period of time. So that's critical to us and we are starting to see the benefit of that in the U.S. as we have gone now past the thou.</p>
          <p>On the dosing side, we have also seen good stability, where there are some patients that started 25 and will come down to 10 or 15. But the average dose in the 19, 20% milligrams has been pretty consistent for a period of time now. So both the trends on dosing and duration are encouraging for us, and you know that our philosophy from a pricing point of view is that the cost of therapy should truly &#x2013; should not be impacted by what therapy or what dosage forms are needed, and that's our intent with the pricing over time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And just to summarize and to build on what Bob has said, from a time perspective REVLIMID is a compound that is really interesting from a longer duration perspective, because number one, there does not appear to be an accumulative toxicity such as peripheral neuropathy associated with it. It has a very, very different mechanism which involves an immunological component, which also we then think leads to improved responses over periods of time. So we're very encouraged. Particularly given that the duration is increasing, there is still a number of patients, a significant percentage are still on a latter lines of therapy.</p>
          <p>Okay, so we are going to take just &#x2013; and I'm being told it's 10 o'clock. We are going to take two more questions now, and the first &#x2013; operator?</p>

          <p>Yes. Our next question comes from Sapna Srivastava with Morgan Stanley.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions, one is just on seasonality. I remember last year people had mentioned in fourth quarter to expect some negative trends because of the donut hole effect from Medicare, and I wonder if you saw any of that in this quarter this year. And secondly just in seasonality again, do we expect the patient co-pay, the duration for patent co-pays to be more concentrated in the latter half of the year, every year, or is this something which is a 2007 phenomenon? And just a last question on front line filing in the U.S. what updates can we get from you to see where you are in the process of filing in the U.S.? And lastly just in Europe, with the THALOMID slightly more limited label and you going with REVLIMID MPR potentially there, how do you see that playing out in front line there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me go through a bunch of these one at a time. First, in terms of seasonality, we were concerned, two years ago or a little over a year ago when the first time that Medicare Part D went through in December as most people familiar with Medicare Part D, patients have good coverage and then they hit into a donut hole which exposes the patient to significant co-pays, and after they go through the donut hole then get extensive coverage after that. And so you are worried if new patients come on and enter the donut hole for the first time very late in the year and then have to have a very large co-pay early in the next year. And I have to tell you frankly that it's not clear that any year will predict next year, but the first two Decembers the impact of the double donut hole has been less than I personally would have anticipated, and that any effects that we see in August or December are more related to seasonal factors in patients and physicians, personal lifestyle, choices in the holidays and vacations etcetera have more impact on prescribing trends than has the double donut hole had an impact. So that really hasn't been as significant as possible.</p>
          <p>In terms of the seasonality of co-pays, I think it's a combination of things frankly. One, we want to ensure that whenever possible we are &#x2013; we fully support the independent third-party non-profit foundations. And if the quarters allow us to be a little bit more generous in terms of funding them in advance of what potentially might be needed, we will do that. But generally the largest donation period for co-payment foundations is going to be in the first period &#x2013; the first quarter of the year, and likely that's when we'll have our most significant contributions in donations, but it's not always as directly linked. But certainly, their donations are heaviest in the first quarter and usually will be ours also.</p>
          <p>And in terms of front line in Europe &#x2013; in terms of the United States, well obviously, as we outlined, we are going to get the ECOG data as quickly as we can, and we are to analyze it and put it together in a way that would be most acceptable to the FDA. And if it's acceptable to the FDA, we would look at it ECOG and SWOG data, combined with the FDA. If it's accepted by the FDA, we would also then have discussions with regulators outside the United States about it also.</p>
          <p>In terms of its impact of having, whether it's RevDex or MPR, so far we haven't seen that that's going to have an impact on a label having a specific usage in terms of its combination. As long as it's approved in the front line we would expect reimbursement to be well taken care of.</p>

          <p>Thanks a lot. One more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our final question comes from Katherine Kim with Banc of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I am glad that I was able to squeeze in at the end. So I have two questions. The first is could you give us an idea of the market potential in Japan for REVLIMID?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Japan is basically &#x2013; especially for cancer, the second largest individual market in the world. And for some indications, it is really not an attractive market and some of the indications that we may eventually pursue will not be an attractive market. But for our most advanced marketplace multiple myeloma, it is &#x2013; it has prevalence at or higher than the level seen in the United States and Europe. So it's a highly attractive market with good reimbursement. It's obviously a developed country and one where pricing is very much dependent on the pricing parameters in other countries. They use different mechanisms to look at the different marketplaces, and see what is the appropriate pricing.</p>
          <p>In the case of REVLIMID the fact that we have a relatively uniform global band of pricing makes Japan a very attractive market for us in multiple myeloma, especially since the myeloma market is an international market and the Japanese KOLs are very well known in the myeloma market. We have developed a very direct presence in Japan and developed strong relationships with KOLs. So that as we look to file our applications in both, MDS &#x2013; MDS 5q and in myeloma late this year, early next year, we are optimistic that once we get approval, we would expect a very, very rapid uptick in Japan.</p>
          <p>And I think just as a side note to mention that when we went to the Japanese Ministry of Health early on to talk about REVLIMID's potential in both MDS and myeloma, the committee for unapproved drugs designated REVLIMID as a high priority for approval. So again we have to be cautious, we've got a lot of work left to do, but the trials have accrued rapidly in Japan, the regulators are very positive, and it's going to take time. But so far we are very encouraged about what the timing will be and what the prospects longer term in Japan will be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one thing, actually just to add on to Bob is in terms of the relationship. It is a very important market for us, number one. And we thought that it would be critical for us to take advantage of this on our own, and we have built up an important, still small, organization in Japan that is entirely staffed by Celgene people to look through the registration process, the clinical trial process, and ultimately the commercial process as opposed to a partnering strategy. So, as Bob indicated, this is something that's a very attractive market, second largest country for oncology after the United States in the world, and this is something that we look to take advantage of for ourselves, for our shareholders completely.</p>
          <p>The other point is, in terms of relationships we did host a mission from the regulatory authorities in Japan, in the United States for about a week to get to know Celgene, to get to know the distribution system regarding REVLIMID etcetera. So it is an important country for us, and we look to having submissions there, perhaps a submission by the end of this year, and the myeloma submission some time in 2009 and, okay.</p>
